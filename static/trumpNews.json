A military official told The NYT that the troops heading to the state are not expected to take direct law enforcement roles themselves.\n\nNews cameras spotted Texas Guard troops on Tuesday at an Army Reserve center in Elwood, Illinois, 55 miles southwest of Chicago. \n\nIllinois and the city of Chicago sued the Trump administration on Monday to stop the National Guard deployments, alleging that the White House was putting the “bedrock principles” separating the military from domestic law enforcement “in peril.”\n\nA federal court last week temporarily paused a similar attempted deployment of in-and out-of-state Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, but the judge in the Illinois case declined to take such a step, scheduling a hearing in the suit for Thursday. For the time being, that means the troops in Illinois may begin their operations before the court weighs in. \n\nIllinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, has accused the president of using authoritarian tactics to wield control over states and cities governed by his political rivals.\n\n“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said Monday.\n\nSpeaking in Minneapolis Tuesday, Pritzker said the Trump administration has not spoken with him directly or given him information about its plans in Illinois. \n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said during a press conference Tuesday he also had not been notified about details of the operation, which he called “unconstitutional,” “illegal,” and “wrong.”\n\nPritzker, in an interview Tuesday with MSNBC, called on his fellow governors to rally to his support and threatened to withdraw from the National Governors Association if the organization did not speak out in Illinois’s defense.\n\n“We should stand as one against the idea that Donald Trump has the ability to call up our National Guard against our will,” the governor said, accusing Abbott of being a “tool” and “lackey” of the White House. \n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, whose National Guard troops the Trump administration attempted to send to Portland, after they were used in a similar military deployment to Los Angeles earlier this year, hammered Texas leaders for supporting the White House campaign to send troops into Illinois.\n\n“Crime is out of control in Texas,” Newsom wrote on X. “Texas’ homicide rate is 39% higher than California. But Greg Abbott is busy sending his National Guard to Illinois for stunts. Stop invading other states and clean up your own damn mess, Greg.”\n\nThe assembling Guard presence in Illinois will join the scores of federal agents who have already been sent to the Chicago area for a multi-agency immigration crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, which local officials and protesters have also opposed. \n\nThroughout the back-and-forth with Illinois leaders, Trump administration officials have framed their unprecedented, heavily militarized presence in the state as a response to an alleged law-and-order crisis and out-of-control crime, pointing to regular protests around an ICE facility outside of Chicago and alleged violent threats against federal agents.\n\n\"Seeing what's happening in Chicago, they need the National Guard,” Attorney General Pam Bondi testified in the Senate on Tuesday. “Our ICE members need the National Guard to protect the national buildings.”\n\n“When violent gangs can plot to kidnap and kill law enforcement officers in a U.S. city like Chicago, that means they are feeling way too comfortable,” Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol leader spearheading the operation, wrote on X on Tuesday. “Time to make them feel uncomfortable.”\n\nThe ACLU of Illinois, which is also suing the Trump administration, has accused those same federal agents of unleashing a campaign of violence and intimidation against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside an ICE building in Broadview, near Chicago.\n\nMajor crime is down across multiple categories in Chicago, according to police statistics, including a 28 percent decline in murder in 2025 compared to this period last year, and a 34 percent decline in robbery. \n\nChicago Mayor Johnson signed an executive order Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations. \n\nThe Illinois operation is part of a larger Trump administration tactic of sending or threatening to send troops into largely Democrat-run cities.\n\nSince starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nA federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.","summary":"The fierce opposition to troops being sent to Chicago comes as the federal court recently blocked the Trump administration from using National Guard troops for a similar mission in Portland","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/texas-national-guard-illinois-chicago-lawsuit-b2841308.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/07/22/National_Guard_Cities_Chicago_15461.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/up6cF69U-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-08 01:00:50","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.307},{"id":367165172,"title":"Gold glitters as worries mount about government debts and uncertainty","text":"At the core of the uncertainties that have drawn investors and central banks to a traditional safe haven lies America.\n\nDonald Trump’s presidency has so far been turbulent, to say the least, characterised by erratic decision-making, bizarre appointments to his cabinet and major government agencies, massive shifts in America’s role in global affairs and in its relationships with traditional allies, actions that challenge its constitution and laws, political dysfunction, fiscal expansion and, of course, the weaponisation of tariffs and the US dollar.\n\nHis trade wars have upended global trade and affected economies across the globe.

His office would not confirm the details of most of those meetings, but did later confirm Carney met with Sen. Mike Crapo, the chair of the Senate finance committee.\n\nA source with knowledge of the plan, but who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the prime minister was also scheduled to attend a dinner hosted by Vice-President JD Vance on Tuesday night.\n\nDuring question period in the House of Commons in Ottawa on Tuesday afternoon, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre attacked the government for how long the negotiations are taking, pointing out Carney promised to quickly resolve the trade war yet there is “still no victory.”\n\nPoilievre also took issue with Carney's comments on investment, specifically when the prime minister said in front of Trump that Canada will probably invest about $1 trillion in the U.S. over the next five years \"if we get the agreement that we expect to get.\"\n\nPoilievre charged that would likely mean \"closing mines and factories in Canada\" to move them south of the border.\n\n\"Why is it when the prime minister goes for lunch at the White House, it is Canadian workers on the menu?\"\n\nGovernment House leader Steven MacKinnon called the statement \"absurd,\" saying Carney was in the room to advance Canadian interests.\n\nDuring the public portion of events, Carney sat next to Trump in the Oval Office during a rambling news conference where Trump mused about everything from his dislike of former U.S. President Joe Biden to his hatred of windmills — but only offered hints on trade.\n\nCarney largely ceded his ground to the ever-unpredictable Trump, who appeared to be in good spirits as he joked around.\n\nWhen Carney called Trump a \"transformative\" president and listed his accomplishments, including extracting unprecedented commitments from NATO members on defence spending, Trump interrupted to add \"the merger of Canada and the United States” to the list.\n\n\"That wasn't where I was going,\" Carney replied with a smile.\n\nThe president showed no signs of relenting on tariffs. He said the U.S. wants to make its own steel and autos and warned that Canada and the U.S. have \"natural\" business conflicts.\n\n\"Americans don't want to buy cars that are made in Canada,\" Trump said. \"It's a tough situation because we want to make our cars here. At the same time, we want Canada to do well making cars. So, we're working on formulas and I think we'll get there.\"\n\nThe president said the U.S. could renew the trilateral North American free trade agreement, while suggesting in the same breath the two countries could instead work out separate deals. Trump did not indicate a preference either way.\n\nHe also heaped praise on Carney, calling him a great leader and tough negotiator. When a reporter asked why the two countries have been unable to reach a trade deal to date, Trump replied, \"Because I want to be a great man, too.\"\n\nPremiers wished Carney luck ahead of the meeting, but also expressed frustrations about the persistent U.S. tariffs.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said earlier Tuesday if Carney can’t reach a deal to end the U.S. tariffs, Ottawa should start hitting back hard with retaliatory measures.\n\n\"You sure don't sit back and get beat up by a bully every single day,\" Ford told reporters in Toronto. \"It's time to hit back if he can't get a deal.\"\n\nFord said if Carney knows something he doesn't about how talks are progressing, the prime minister should sit down with the premiers to explain.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith told reporters in Ottawa she thinks it's a good idea for Carney to visit Washington \"on a relationship-building expedition\" since trade deals can advance simply due to a \"good personal relationship between the leaders.\"\n\nBut Smith said she wants to see \"at a minimum\" Carney try to find a \"compromise around autos and steel and aluminum, and perhaps even softwood lumber.\"","summary":"A high-profile meeting between Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday resulted in Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc vowing both sides are focused on quickly reaching deals on steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nTrump lavished praise on Carney publicly and promised the...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/576702/As-Trump-digs-in-on-tariff-rhetoric-LeBlanc-suggests-quick-deals-in-the-works","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/10/8c70a418859a5517ca69b721d48df87766d8cb80b48b9cc962f04810d5a1cfee.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:36:00","author":"Kelly Geraldine Malone","authors":["Kelly Geraldine Malone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.021},{"id":367165062,"title":"Donald Trump reacts to Bad Bunny as Super Bowl halftime performer","text":"President Donald Trump is putting in his two cents on Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl. On September 28, the NFL announced that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny will be the 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer.\nFollowing the announcement, a wave of backlash has been directed at the “Monaco” artist, with the common complaint being that his songs are in Spanish, his native language. To add more fuel to the fire, Trump also shared his opinion on the NFL’s decision during his appearance on Greg Kelly Reports on Tuesday (Oct. 7).\n“This guy does not seem like a unifying entertainer, and a lot of folks don’t even know who he is,” Kelly said.\n“I never heard of him. I don’t know who he is,” Trump responded. “I don’t know why they’re doing it, it’s crazy, and then they blame it on some promoter that they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.”\nElsewhere in the interview Trump suggested that people should be “blowing off the NFL” as a response to the league’s decision.\nBad Bunny faces backlash for Super Bowl halftime show announcement\nTrump’s opinion follows social media users and athletes who have an issue with Bad Bunny’s upcoming Super Bowl performance. Former race car driver, Danica Patrick, shared her thoughts on Bad Bunny being selected.\n“I don’t have any problem with someone performing at halftime that is not from the United States, although Bad Bunny is technically a citizen because he was born in Puerto Rico,” she told Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast on Friday, Oct. 3. “He wasn’t necessarily born in America. I don’t care where you’re actually born. What I care about is that I can sing along to the music. His music is almost nothing in English.”\nShe added, “I don’t think it will be as much fun. I don’t think it will be as uniting. What I would hate to see is that it would divide us again, in yet another way.”\nShe suggested that there should be an alternate Super Bowl halftime show made so that others can sing a long.\nPatrick’s opinion follows the Trump administration threatening to have ICE outside of the Super Bowl — something that Bad Bunny took into consideration while planning his Debí Tirar Más Fotos World Tour and decided against performing in the States and only in Puerto Rico.\n“There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I’ve performed there many times. All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent,” the rapper told i-D in September.\n“But there was the issue of — like, f—ing ICE could be outside [my concert],” he added. “And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”\nWhile he’s been in the debate across several mediums over the past two weeks, the artist has been keeping an optimistic spirit and even joked about it during his Saturday Night Live hosting gig over the weekend.\nDuring his monologue, he addressed “all the Latinos and Latinas in the entire world and here in the United States” in Spanish by saying, “More than being an accomplishment of mine, it’s an accomplishment for everybody, demonstrating that our mark and our contribution to this country will never be able to be removed or erased by anybody,” he said in Spanish.\n\nHe added, in English, poking fun at those criticizing the fact that his songs are in Spanish, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”\nBad Bunny will make history as the first Latino male to perform solo at the Super Bowl.\nThe 2026 Super Bowl will be on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California.","summary":"President Donald Trump is putting in his two cents on Bad Bunny performing at the Super Bowl.

The visit comes months after India and the U.K. signed a trade deal during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s July visit to the European country. It also comes as both countries are navigating major geopolitical shifts, including their respective trading relationships with the U.S., under the administration of Donald Trump.\n\nThe visit is focused on trade and business, with No.10 Downing Street calling it a “two-day trade mission to Mumbai”. The U.K. delegation will include the Minister for trade and business, Peter Kyle, as well as investment minister Jason Stockwood.\n\n“It’s not just a piece of paper, it’s a launchpad for growth,” Mr. Starmer said about the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). \n\nThe visit will also involve bilateral discussions on regional and global issues, the Indian government had said on Saturday. These talks– scheduled for Thursday (October 9, 2025), would be aimed at further strengthening the bilateral relationship, including via a tech partnership, the Technology Security Initiative launched in July 2024, according to a statement from the U.K. government.\n\nThe leaders will also take stock of the India-U.K. relationship, reframed during Mr. Modi’s visit to the U.K. in the summer, as being guided by ‘Vision 2035’, a ten-year roadmap spanning a range of dimensions — from trade and climate to education, technology and people-to-people ties.\n\nSince Mr. Starmer took over the leadership of the Labour Party in 2020, Labour has sought to redefine its relationship with India, after ties frayed over positions the party had taken on India and Pakistan and the Kashmir issue. For the Modi government, another challenge with the U.K.— across governments in Downing Street— has been reaching a common understanding on the risks to Indian personnel and assets in the U.K. from Khalistani separatists operating in Britain. The signing of the trade deal and articulation of Vision 2035 in July were outcomes of both sides choosing to reset ties. \n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Modi and Mr. Starmer will deliver keynote addresses at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai and engage with business leaders, according to a government press release.\n\nUnder the trade deal, the U.K. has removed tariffs on 99% of products. However, this will impact a smaller proportion, 45% (or $6.5 billion), of Indian exports to the U.K., according to the Global Trade Initiative. The items impacted include textiles, footwear, seafood, automobiles etc.\n\nFor the U.K. one of the big wins from CETA has been in the alcoholic beverages sector.\n\n“The historic trade deal the U.K. Government struck with India this year is great news for Scotland and especially our whisky industry. But having secured the deal our challenge and responsibility now is to put this deal into action,” Secretary of State for Scotland, Douglas Alexander said.\n\n“That requires implementation of the deal by the governments of India and the U.K., and the utilisation of the deal by British and Indian businesses,” Mr. Alexander added. Under the deal, tariffs on Scoth Whiskey will fall from 150% to 75% immediately and further drop to 40% over ten years.\n\nThe trade deal has not yet been operationalized and is making its way through the British legislative system — a process that may take months. The deal is unlikely to be implemented anytime before early 2026, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\n“Britain means business. We want to increase bilateral trade, business and investment between our two countries,” Karan Billimoria, a member of the House of Lords and founder of Cobra Beer, told The Hindu on Tuesday (October 7). \n\nMr. Billimoria, who used to head the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), believes the visit is more than just symbolic and thinks India and the U.K. will double their bilateral trade in the next five years. The total bilateral trade in goods and services for the year ending March 31 was valued at £44.1 billion ($59.14 billion), according to official data from the U.K. \n\nWhile India is the U.K.’s 11th largest trade partner and the trade deal is expected to contribute an increase of just 0.13% to the U.K.’s GDP over the long-term (the equivalent of £4.8 billion annually), the agreement with India has been repeatedly cited by Mr. Starmer and his colleagues as an example of job-creation. The trade deal is expected to increase U.K. exports to India by 60%, Downing Street said.\n\nPosting a picture of himself on social media with tens of others from his delegation, pouring out of the aircraft that brought them to Mumbai, Mr. Starmer said he was on a mission “to deliver for people back at home”.\n\nThe Labour government faces significant economic challenges in the U.K. , including low productivity, high national debt, and weak economic growth. It has also tightened the screws on migration – including the movement of skilled and documented workers into the U.K., pressured in part by anti-migrant policy promises from the Conservatives and nativist Reform U.K. Party. In recent years, India has topped the list of countries whose citizens get the most skilled worker visas.\n\n“Other countries are actively competing for the same pool of skilled talent, and perceptions of openness can significantly shape investment decisions,” a spokesperson for the U.K. India Business Council (UKIBC), an industry body, said when asked how about the steps the government has taken to cut skilled legal migration.\n\nThe body, which is represented in Mr Starmer’s delegation, said it recognized the British government’s intent to manage migration in a way that supported national priorities. A spokesperson for the UKIBC said that a “balanced and predictable” migration framework that welcomes talent in sectors with high demand would ensure the U.K. remained a top destination for investment.\n\nThe delegation also includes the CBI, Rolls-Royce, British Airways, banks such as Standard Chartered, Barclays, NatWest and HSBC; alcoholic beverage company Diageo; engineering firm Arup and telecom company BT.","summary":"Ministers, CEOs and representatives from British universities and industry groups seek to bolster ties; bilateral trade in goods and services for the year ending March 31 was valued at £44.1 billion","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/starmer-visits-india-with-eye-on-trade-and-business/article70136390.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/1jlybb/article70136897.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-10-07T152503Z_96035606_RC227HAM0NNK_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-BRITAIN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:30:00","author":"Sriram Lakshman","authors":["Sriram Lakshman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.309},{"id":367165788,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel reacts to having a lead over Trump in poll: ‘I don’t like to upset him’","text":"A new YouGov poll indicated Jimmy Kimmel holds a 16-point lead in favorability over President Donald Trump. \n\nKimmel's net favorability was +3, with 44 percent expressing a favorable opinion, whereas the president's stood at -13, with 41 percent favorable. \n\nKimmel reacted to the poll results with humor, quipping that the president has a lower approval rating than 'Diddy and diarrhea'. \n\nThe survey also revealed that 55 percent of respondents believed Kimmel's recent suspension from his show was unwarranted. \n\nKimmel's return to television after a brief suspension attracted a large audience, with his comeback monologue achieving millions of views online.","summary":"","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/culture/jimmy-kimmel-trump-approval-rating-poll-b2841363.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/02/3/20/Jimmy-Kimmel.jpeg?crop=3273,2182,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Qmur3Ol0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:27:29","author":"Tom Murray","authors":["Tom Murray"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.077},{"id":367161036,"title":"‘My sh*t, my food’: Chinese CEO’s Aus rant","text":"But that’s exactly what happened at the recent GWM Tech Day.\n\nThe invite-only event in Melbourne saw hundreds of dealers from Australia and New Zealand brought in alongside media from around the world to experience a showcase of the brand’s most up-to-the-minute models.\n\nMORE: GWM H7 reviewed\n\nBut while there was plenty of fanfare around electrified SUVs and four-wheel drives, the head of GWM International, Parker Shi, gave an impassioned and at-times rambling monologue around the brand — its future, and perhaps most poignantly, its past.\n\n“The trust is not Parker’s mission and my team’s mission, it’s everybody’s,” he said.\n\n“It’s our food.

Trump -- who suggested last week that American cities be used as \"training grounds\" for US military forces -- exaggerated the scale of unrest in Los Angeles and crime in Washington to justify those deployments, and a judge suggested he did the same when it comes to Portland.The troops from Texas were sent to Illinois as part of a mission to protect \"federal functions, personnel, and property,\" the Pentagon official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the Guardsmen have been mobilized for an initial period of 60 days.The troops were seen on Tuesday at a military facility in Elwood, southwest of Chicago.The planned deployment of these forces has infuriated Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, who said they \"should stay the hell out of Illinois,\" and that any deployment against his state government's wishes would amount to an \"invasion.\"Trump over the weekend authorized the deployment of 700 National Guard troops to Chicago, sparking a lawsuit by Illinois state officials who accused him of using US troops \"to punish his political enemies.\"\"The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor,\" the Illinois Attorney General and counsel for Chicago said.But Judge April Perry, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, declined to issue an immediate temporary restraining order, instead scheduling a full hearing for Thursday.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the plan to send troops to Chicago, claiming that the third-largest US city is \"a war zone.\"Trump has similarly taken aim at Portland, which like Chicago has seen surges of federal agents as part of the president's mass deportation drive, prompting protests outside immigration processing facilities. Trump asserted that it is \"war-ravaged\" and riddled with violent crime.But in a Saturday court order temporarily blocking the deployment of troops to Oregon, US District Judge Karin Immergut wrote that \"the President's determination was simply untethered to the facts.\"Protests in Portland did not pose a \"danger of rebellion\" and \"regular law enforcement forces\" could handle such incidents, the judge wrote.Trump responded to that setback by openly mulling the use of the Insurrection Act -- which allows the president to deploy the military within the United States to suppress rebellion -- in order to send more troops into Democratic-led US cities.\"We have an Insurrection Act for a reason,\" Trump said, adding that he would use it if \"people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up.\"","summary":"Two hundred Texas National Guard troops have arrived in Illinois, a Pentagon official said Tuesday, ahead of a planned deployment in Chicago that is strongly opposed by local Democratic officials.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trumps-orders-200-troops-texas-arrive-illinois-3786097","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4626796/texas-army-national-guard-troops-are-seen-military-facility-elwood-illinois-october-7-2025.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=403a728e38f2e576f01619f2aa305ac9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:21:14","author":"W.g.

Migrants are now even turning back before they reach our borders,' she told The New York Post.\n\nThe final year of Biden's presidency saw just 271,000 removed, which was an increase from 142,000 in 2023. \n\nOn the other side of the border, federal agents have only apprehended 238,000 migrants trying to illegally get into America during the 2025 fiscal year, a 55-year low. \n\nThat's a shocking drop from the height of the border crisis under President Joe Biden, when in 2022, a record 2.2 million were taken in at the border, CBS News reports. \n\nOver 60 percent of the apprehensions at the Mexican border happened during Biden's final three months in office. \n\n'President Trump has overwhelmingly delivered on his promise to secure our Southern Border,' said white house spokesperson Abigail Jackson. \n\n'As a result, Americans are safer — unvetted criminal illegal aliens and dangerous drugs are no longer pouring over our border unchecked,' Jackson added. \n\n'And for all the Democrats who claimed it was impossible to secure the border or that they needed new policy, turns out all we needed was a new President.'\n\nOfficials surrounding the president have noted that the Trump administration has achieved its goals despite the courts getting in the way and the numbers come as the White House faces another legal battle over his efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. \n\nJudge April Perry set a midnight Wednesday deadline for a response from the federal government and scheduled a Thursday hearing in the lawsuit filed Monday.\n\nIn the meantime, Perry has opted not to temporarily block the deployment, paving the way for Trump to send in as many as 200 Texas National Guard troops overnight.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the troops will be flown in via military aircraft and will begin operations on the ground no sooner than Wednesday. \n\nThe lawsuit railing against the move alleges that 'these advances in President Trump's long-declared ''War'' on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.'\n\n'The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president's favor,' the lawsuit says.\n\nTrump has argued that the troops are needed to help fight crime in Chicago and to ensure that federal agents can enforce immigration laws in the city, which limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.\n\nThe president threatened Monday to use emergency powers against rebellion to deploy more troops into Democratic-led US cities, intensifying his rhetoric as his attempts to mobilize the military face legal challenges.\n\nThe Republican leader openly mulled use of the Insurrection Act after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily halted a National Guard deployment in Portland, while another judge in Illinois allowed a similar move to proceed for now in Chicago. \n\nBoth cities have seen surges of federal agents as part of Trump's mass deportation drive, prompting protests outside immigration processing facilities.\n\n'We have an Insurrection Act for a reason.

Union leaders for air traffic controllers and airport security screeners cautioned that the situation could deteriorate further.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration noted staffing challenges at airports in Nashville, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia, as well as its air traffic control centers in Atlanta and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Consequently, the agency temporarily slowed the takeoffs for planes heading to the first three cities.\n\nMajor flight delays reported the previous day were also linked to staffing shortages due to the shutdown that began on October 1. The FAA mentioned delays on Monday at Burbank, California, Newark, New Jersey, and Denver airports.\n\nTravel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt highlighted that the risk of major disruptions to the U.S. aviation system “is growing by the day” as essential federal workers continue to operate without pay. If the shutdown persists, it threatens to impact holiday travel plans in November, he explained.\n\n“I’m gravely concerned that if the government remains shut down then, it could disrupt, and potentially ruin, millions of Americans’ Thanksgiving holidays,” Harteveldt stated.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted on Monday that there has been a rise in air traffic controllers calling in sick at several locations. When controller numbers fall short, the FAA must limit the number of takeoffs and landings for safety reasons, which can lead to further flight delays and possible cancellations.\n\nThat’s what happened Monday afternoon, when the control tower at Southern California’s Hollywood Burbank Airport shut down for several hours, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours. \n\nWhen a pilot preparing for takeoff radioed the tower, according to communications recorded by LiveATC.net, he was told: “The tower is closed due to staffing.”\n\nNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the shutdown highlighted some of his union’s members already face on a regular basis due to a national airspace system that is critically understaffed and relies on outdated equipment that tends to fail. \n\nA couple of controllers missing work can have a big impact at a small airport already operating with limited tower staffing, he said. \n\n“It’s not like we have other controllers that can suddenly come to that facility and staff them. There’s not enough people there,” Daniels said Tuesday. “There’s no overtime, and you have to be certified in that facility.”\n\nAir travel complications are likely to expand once a regularly scheduled payday arrives next week and air traffic controllers and TSA officers don’t receive any money, the union leader said. If the impasse between Republican and Democratic lawmakers on reopening the government persists, the workers will come under more pressure as their personal bills come due, Daniels said.\n\n“It’s going to eventually be that when people don’t have money, they have time to start making life choices and life decisions,” he said. \n\nDaniels said it’s not realistic to expect controllers to stay focused only on their difficult jobs of keeping flights safe while they aren’t getting paid even if they eventually should be entitled to back pay. \n\n“That’s not reality and it shouldn’t be put on our backs,” he said. “It’s completely unfair that an air traffic controller is the one that holds the burden of ‘see how long you can hang in there in order to allow this political process to play out?’” \n\nJohnny Jones, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter that represents TSA workers, said he was hearing questions like “How are we going to handle paying our bills?” and “How are we going to pay our child support? How are you going to pay for childcare? How are you going to pay your mortgage payments? If I have to miss work, am I going to get terminated?”\n\n“The employees are struggling. They’re assessing what they need to do and they’re assessing how this is all going to work out,” said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the TSA was established.\n\nSome TSA officers already have called in sick, but Jones said he ddid not think the numbers were big enough to cause significant problems and delays at airports.\n\nAviation unions and U.S. airlines have called for the shutdown to end as soon as possible. \n\nThe unions are also making appeals to food banks, grocery chains and airports to secure support for workers during the shutdown. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was offering federal workers $15 food vouchers and allowing them to park in the terminal, according to Jones. \n\nJohn Tiliacos, the chief operating officer of Florida’s Tampa International Airport, said the facility started preparing for the shutdown well before it began.\n\nNicknamed “Operation Bald Eagle 2” among airport staff, the efforts center around pulling together resources for the roughly 11,000 federal employees who are working at the airport without pay, including security screeners and air traffic controllers.\n\nTiliacos said the help would include a food pantry, free bus rides to work and a program with the local utility provider to keep the lights on at the homes of the workers. \n\n“Whatever we can do to make life a little easier for these federal employees that allows them to continue coming to work and focus on keeping our airport operational, that’s what we’re prepared to do,” he said.\n\nTampa’s airport provided similar resources for impacted workers when the government closed for 35 days in 2018 and 2019 during President Donald Trump’s first term. Tiliacos said he thinks the assistance helped prevent the widespread staffing shortages that other airports experienced during that shutdown.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nStaffing shortages led to increased flight delays at various U.S. airports on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Staffing Shortages Lead to Increased US Flight Delays Amid 7th Day of Government Shutdown first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/staffing-shortages-lead-to-increased-us-flight-delays-amid-7th-day-of-government-shutdown/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Staffing-shortages-cause-more-US-flight-delays-as-government-shutdown.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:03:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":367165798,"title":"The Latest: Trump administration threatens no back pay for federal workers in shutdown","text":"President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.\n\nThe move was widely seen as a strongarm tactic to pressure lawmakers to reopen government, as party leaders remain seemingly at an impasse on day 7 of the shutdown. Democrats are conditioning their support for a short-term funding patch on extending the health subsidies that lessen the cost of plans offered under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAfter the longest government shutdown in 2019, Trump signed legislation into law that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund government.\n\nThe president during an Oval Office meeting Tuesday suggested he’ll “ follow the law ” on back pay for federal workers, minutes after saying the compensation “ depends on who we’re talking about ” and that some workers would be taken care of “in a different way.”\n\nThe Latest:\n\n Seeking more immigration barriers, Noem waives environmental protections in New Mexico \n\nThe Trump administration is waiving a long list of environmental protections and regulations as it seeks to expand barriers to immigration along the southwest U.S. border in New Mexico.\n\nIn a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security is invoking an “acute and immediate need to construct additional physical barriers and roads” in a remote area of the state near the border with Mexico.\n\nThe directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem describes the area west of El Paso, Texas, as a traditional place of high illegal entry to the U.S. Noem is suspending federal regulations there aimed at protecting endangered species, clean water, migratory birds, sacred Native American sites and more.\n\nLaiken Jordahl of the Center for Biological Diversity said there are fears any new construction would take a toll on wildlife populations near the remote bootheel of southwest New Mexico.\n\n House Democrats press Trump on drug cartels he designated as terrorist groups \n\nSeveral House Democrats say they want President Donald Trump to name the drug cartels he claims are in an “ armed conflict” with the U.S. government.\n\nFive U.S. representatives released a letter Tuesday that also asks the president to explain just how he determined the cartels were designated as terrorist organizations. \n\nThe lawmakers also asked for the intelligence and the legal justifications behind the U.S. military’s four fatal strikes recently against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.\n\nTrump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants in an administration memo, which was obtained by The Associated Press last week. The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers, with Trump effectively declaring that trafficking of drugs into the U.S. amounts to armed conflict requiring use of military force.\n\n Justice Department names new head of immigration courts \n\nA former immigration court judge and longtime Marine is going to be the next director of the federal office overseeing the nation’s immigration courts.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Tuesday that Daren K. Margolin will head the Executive Office of Immigration Review.\n\nMargolin has served as an assistant chief immigration judge and as a lawyer at the legal office prosecuting immigration cases. He also served in various legal positions during a nearly 30-year career in the Marine Corps.\n\nMargolin takes over an immigration court system struggling with a ballooning case backlog. Immigration courts have also increasingly become hubs for immigration enforcement with ICE agents arresting people in hallways after their court proceedings.\n\n Past surgeons general argue HHS secretary is ‘endangering' nation's health \n\nSix former surgeons general said in a Washington Post op-ed on Tuesday that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. poses a “profound, immediate and unprecedented threat” to the nation’s health.\n\nThe former public officials — appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush — warned that Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, autism and other issues have undermined the public health system and amplified health misinformation instead of combating it.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, accused the past surgeons general of criticizing the first HHS secretary who is taking on the “decline in America’s public health” after they presided over it.\n\n“We remain committed to restoring trust, reforming broken health systems, and ensuring that every American has access to real choice in their health care,” Nixon said.\n\n Oregon Gov. Kotek meets with DHS Sec. Noem in Portland \n\nDemocratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said she met with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for about 20 minutes upon Noem’s arrival at the Portland airport on Tuesday. Kotek reached out to Noem after hearing through “unofficial channels” that Noem might be visiting.\n\n“Today, in my meeting with Secretary Noem, I reiterated again that there is no insurrection in Oregon. Twice now, a federal judge has affirmed that there is no legal basis for military deployment in Portland,” Kotek said in a statement.\n\nNoem then went to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. News crews and some protesters lined up behind yellow police tape that cordoned off the blocks in front of the building.\n\n White House says it will use tariff revenue to bolster food aid program facing funding shortages \n\nPress secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X that Trump has “identified a creative solution to transfer resources” from tariffs the administration has imposed on U.S. trading partners to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.\n\nAlso known as WIC, the program provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples but was threatened by the government shutdown.\n\nLeavitt did not provide details of how such funding transfers might work. But she wrote that the Trump White House “will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry.”\n\n Trump meets with American hostage freed from Gaza and with relatives of American killed there \n\nTrump has met with an American hostage freed from Gaza, and with the family of an American-Israeli soldier who was killed there but whose remains have yet to be recovered.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a photo online of Trump meeting in the Oval Office with Edan Alexander. He was taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that led to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe meeting wasn’t public. But the picture also showed Trump with the family of Omer Neutra, whose body is still in Gaza. Peace talks are being held in Egypt over Trump’s plan to end fighting between Hamas and Israel.\n\nTrump also met this summer with Alexander, who was the last living American hostage in Gaza and released from captivity in May.\n\n House Speaker Mike Johnson says he’ll schedule the swearing in of new Arizona Democrat ‘as soon as she wants’ \n\nAdelita Grijalva won a special election for a House seat on Sept. 24, but has been unable to actually represent her district in Congress until the speaker officially swears her into office. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has so far refused to accommodate her request to officially take office while the House is not conducting legislative business during the government shutdown.\n\nJohnson did not elaborate on what he meant Tuesday by saying he would swear her into office as soon as she wants. However, Grijalva could be sworn in during one of the House’s pro-forma sessions. The next one is Wednesday.\n\nOnce she officially takes office, Grijalva has said she will join a legislative maneuver to force a vote in the House on a bill that would require the Department of Justice to release the case files on the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n Judge blocks changed guidance for teen pregnancy prevention grants \n\nA judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump’s administration from requiring recipients of federal teen pregnancy prevention grants to comply with Trump’s orders aimed at curtailing “radical indoctrination” and “gender ideology.”\n\nThe ruling is a victory for three Planned Parenthood affiliates that sued to try to block enforcement of a Department of Human Services policy document issued in July that they contend contradict the requirements of the grants as established by Congress.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, blasted the administration’s policy change in her written ruling, saying it was “motivated solely by political concerns, devoid of any considered process or analysis, and ignorant of the statutory emphasis on evidence-based programming.”\n\n Federal grand jury in Atlanta charges 2 men with making threats against ICE officer and his wife \n\nA federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted two men after authorities said they made online threats against an ICE officer and his wife.\n\nFrank Andrew Waszut and Anthony Patrick Noto are charged with knowingly making interstate threats of violence. Both men were indicted last month, and the indictments were unsealed Monday. They were both in custody and online court records did not show either man having a lawyer who could comment on the charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a news release Tuesday that Waszut posted a video on Instagram that identified and showed photos of the officer, who lives and works in Georgia. Waszut is accused of encouraging people to “make him famous” and urging anyone who sees the officer to “give him the cell block one treatment,” which prosecutors said means subjecting him to violence.\n\nNoto posted a comment on Instagram under a photo of the officer’s wife that called her a “pretty good target” for anyone wanting to test out a semiautomatic rifle.\n\nWaszut, who lives in Knoxville, Tennessee, was in jail in Texas, where he’s accused of making separate threats against Republican lawmakers. Noto, who lives in Ronkonkoma, New York, was in federal custody.\n\n National Guard members from Texas are in Illinois in Trump’s latest move to send troops to cities \n\nNational Guard members from Texas are at an Army training center in Illinois. It’s the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration’s plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.\n\nThe Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn’t specify where they were going.\n\n-By Erin Hooley and Christine Fernando \n\n US authorities report 2025 border arrests at 55-year low \n\nCustoms and Border Protection said Tuesday that authorities made 237,565 arrests at the border with Mexico during the government’s fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That’s down 84% from more than 1.5 million during the previous 12-month period and the lowest tally since 1970.\n\nThere were more than 2 million arrests in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe latest number includes nearly four months of the Biden administration. Arrests fell sharply after the Biden administration imposed severe asylum restrictions in June 2024. They plummeted more after the Trump administration virtually eliminated asylum access and dispatched thousands of miliary troops to the border.\n\nDuring September, authorities averaged 279 arrests a day. That’s up from 204 arrests a day in August but down from nearly 1,800 a day in September 2024.\n\n Democrats ask Bondi about Tom Homan: Where’s the money? \n\nAs Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a Senate panel, Democrats time and again asked her what happened to $50,000 that White House “border czar” Tom Homan accepted last year from undercover agents posting as businesspeople.\n\nThe investigation into Homan was shut down by the Trump administration, but Democrats repeatedly questioned whether the money was recovered or whether Homan kept the money and reported it as income on his taxes.\n\n“Do you know sitting here whether he took the money?” Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked Bondi during one particularly combative exchange with the attorney general.\n\nBondi said the decision to clear Homan of wrongdoing was made before she was sworn in as attorney general and defended Homan. She repeatedly refused to say what actually happened to the $50,000, though.\n\n“You think you got a gotcha with Tom Homan our border czar who has been out there fighting for our country since Donald Trump took office,” Bondi replied to Schiff.\n\n GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’ \n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.\n\n“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.\n\nIt was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.\n\n Supreme Court seems skeptical about state bans on ‘conversion therapy’ \n\nThe Supreme Court ’s conservative majority seems likely to side with a Christian counselor challenging bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nMost justices on the high court didn’t seem convinced that states can restrict voluntary talk therapy aimed at potentially changing feelings or behavior for kids who identify as gay or transgender.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito said the Colorado law being challenged “looks like blatant viewpoint discrimination.”\n\n GOP senator questions whether National Guard deployment to cities is ‘best practice’ \n\nSen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is suggesting that National Guard troops are not the best equipped to address crime in cities and that instead accountability for policing should remain with local officials.\n\n“Is this deployment of the National Guard a part of an emerging best practice that I just don’t get yet?” Tillis asked Attorney General Pam Bondi during a Senate oversight hearing.\n\nIt was a bit of indirect criticism from Tillis, who is not seeking reelection next year, on how President Donald Trump is deploying National Guard troops to major cities as part of his crime and immigration agenda.\n\n DHS Sec. Kristi Noem to visit Portland \n\nThe city and police department confirmed her visit in a joint statement after conservative podcaster and influencer Benny Johnson said on social media that Noem was going to Portland on Tuesday.\n\nThe city said it received notice of her visit to the Portland area but did not have full details about her agenda. Portland police “will provide the same routine support they would for any visiting dignitary.”\n\nHer trip comes as local and state officials continue to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to the city.\n\nA federal judge issued two restraining orders over the weekend blocking the deployment, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments in the case for Thursday morning. The court indicated the arguments could be canceled if judges determine they aren’t needed.\n\n Trump praises Carney as a ‘world-class leader’ and ‘good man’ \n\nThe president said of his Canadian counterpart that he is “a great prime minister,” and added: “He could represent me anytime.”\n\nBut, Trump said: “He’s a nice man but he can be nasty.”\n\nWhen asked by a reporter what is holding up trade talks with Carney if he’s such a great man, Trump said: “Because I want to be a great man too.”\n\n Trump says he’ll meet with Xi in a few weeks \n\n“I’ll be meeting him in South Korea,” Trump said, referencing a summit that he’s expected to attend there at the end of the month.\n\nA meeting between the two leaders has not been formally announced.\n\n Trump says his first-term trade deal with Mexico and Canada could be negotiated – or even replaced \n\nThe president appeared to dismiss a key achievement of his first term, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.\n\nTrump says he’ll negotiate trade deals on Tuesday with the visiting Canadian prime minister.\n\nBut asked about USMCA -- which took effect in 2020, replacing NAFTA -- he offered a surprise. “We could renegotiate it or we could create a different deal,” Trump said.\n\nHe offered no further details.\n\n Trump likens Dem tactics on shutdown to a ‘kamikaze attack’ \n\nThe president said the Democrats “started” the shutdown fight and that the minority party was taking such aggressive tactics because “they have nothing to lose.”\n\n“Well, they’re the ones that started it,” Trump said in response to a question about his message to Democrats. “They’re the ones that have it, and it’s almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack. They, they almost, you know, they have nothing to lose.”\n\n Trump suggests he’ll ‘follow the law’ on federal worker backpay \n\nAsked a second time about backpay for furloughed federal workers given that the requirement is spelled out in law, Trump said: “I follow the law, and what the law says is correct.”\n\nBut asked about what he meant previously about dealing with workers in “a different way” than backpay, the president ducked the question, suggesting reporters would have to find that out for themselves.\n\n Carney says the U.S. and Canada are competing, not in conflict \n\nThe Canadian prime minister pushed back at Trump’s characterization of the two nations being in “natural conflict.”\n\nCarney pointed out that Canada is the United States’ second-largest trading partner and is also a major foreign investor. He said the relationship between the U.S. and Canada are “maybe not so much conflict” but that they “compete.”\n\n“There are areas where we compete, and it’s in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” Carney said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together, and that’s what we’re focused on”\n\n GOP senator suggests FBI interview Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after his comments about Epstein \n\nSen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is suggesting that the FBI look into comments that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made during a recent interview in which he called the late financier Jeffrey Epstein the “greatest blackmailer ever.”\n\nDuring a Senate hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi reiterated her previous stance that the Department of Justice has not uncovered evidence that could be used in relation to Epstein’s sex trafficking of teenage girls. But Kennedy said that the comments from Lutnick, who was formerly a neighbor with Epstein, suggested others were involved.\n\n“Don’t you think that you ought to talk to him after this interview?” Kennedy asked Bondi.\n\nThe attorney general responded that Lutnick had not been interviewed and she was noncommittal about any future interviews.\n\n Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada \n\nThe president said there’s a “natural business conflict” between the U.S. and its northern neighbor but said there’s also “mutual love.”\n\n“There’s still great love between the two countries,” Trump said.\n\n Trump says back pay for furloughed federal workers ‘depends on who we’re talking about’ \n\nThe president didn’t dismiss back pay for all workers, but added, “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of, and we’ll take care of them in a different way” without elaborating.\n\nHe also blamed Democrats for putting “a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy.”\n\nTrump’s comments came as his administration threatened no back pay for federal workers in a memo Tuesday. That’s despite a 2019 bill Trump signed into law guaranteeing back pay.\n\n Chicago mayor says he doesn’t know where National Guard troops are in his city \n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Trump administration has not told him where the National Guard is, when it may arrive in Chicago or what its task will be.\n\n“None of that has been made clear,” Johnson said at a Tuesday news conference. “That is what is so difficult about this moment, you have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority.”\n\nThe City of Chicago and state of Illinois sued Trump on Monday, seeking to stop the sending of National Guard troops to Chicago. The legal challenge came hours after a judge blocked the Guard’s deployment in Portland, Oregon.\n\nJohnson said Trump’s federalizing of the national guard is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous.”\n\n“The federal government is out of control,” Johnson said. “This is one of the most dangerous times in our nation’s history.” Johnson said Trump is “unchecked” and “If Congress is not going to hold the president of the United States of America accountable, then I will.”\n\n ‘Law is clear’ on federal worker back pay, House Democratic leader says \n\n“Every single furloughed federal employee is entitled to back pay. Period. Full stop,” Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday, responding to a White House memo outlining a rationale it’s considering for denying back pay to federal workers during the shutdown.\n\n“The law is clear,” Jeffries added. “And we will make sure that law is followed.”\n\n Illinois braces for National Guard deployments amid legal challenge \n\nGov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said that some 300 of Illinois’ guard troops were to be federalized over his objections and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.\n\n“He wants to justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command,” Pritzker said, accusing the president of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.”\n\nA federal judge in Chicago scheduled a hearing for Thursday on a legal challenge that describes Trump’s military mobilization plan for Illinois as unlawful and dangerous. A federal judge in Oregon blocked the Guard’s deployment to Portland.\n\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media Monday showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, without saying their destination.\n\n▶ Read more about National Guard deployments in American cities","summary":"President Donald Trump’s administration is warning Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been longstanding policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-kristi-noem-white-house-greg-abbott-office-of-management-and-budget-b2841362.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/08/01/APTOPIX_Justice_Department_Congress_36054.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:03:16","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":367165164,"title":"Attorney-general dodges questions about alleged incriminating Trump-Epstein photos","text":"Donald Trump's attorney-general has dodged questions about whether the FBI found photos of the US president with half-naked young women while searching Jeffrey Epstein's home.\n\nAttorney-General Pam Bondi was testifying before the Senate when she was asked about the pictures by Democratic politician Sheldon Whitehouse.\n\n\"There's been public reporting that Jeffrey Epstein showed people photos of President Trump with half-naked young women,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nREAD MORE: Supreme Court rejects appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell﻿\n\n\"Do you know if the FBI found those photographs in their search of Jeffrey Epstein's safe or premises or otherwise?\n\n\"Have you ever seen such a thing?\"\n\nBondi replied by tying Whitehouse to Reid Hoffman, a wealthy Democratic donor who had connections to Epstein.\n\n\"You know, Senator Whitehouse, you sit here and make salacious remarks once again trying to slander President Trump left and right when you are the one who was taking money from one of Epstein's closest confidants, I believe. \n\n\"I could be wrong, correct me, Reid Hoffman, who was with Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions, and the senator sitting right next to you tried to block the flight logs from being released, yet you're grilling me on President Trump and some photograph with Epstein? \n\nHoffman has admitted travelling to Epstein's notorious island but has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nREAD MORE: New Epstein files mention Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, top Trump aide\n\nIn a lengthy interview with reporter Michael Wolff before his death, Epstein reportedly showed photos of Trump with topless young women sitting in his lap.\n\nWolff claims to have more than 100 hours of recordings of interviews with Epstein.\n\n\"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years,\" Epstein reportedly told Wolff.\n\nWhile Trump has faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct, including a jury ruling he raped a woman, he has not been tied to wrongdoing in connection to Epstein.\n\nBondi has been heavily criticised for changing her tune on the Epstein investigation since she took over the Department of Justice.\n\nIn an interview in February, Bondi said Epstein's purported client list was \"sitting on my desk right now\".\n\nThen, in July, the Department of Justice announced the client list did not exist.\n\nREAD MORE: Purported letter from Trump to Epstein released by US Democrats﻿\n\nEpstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 after he was arrested and charged with child sex trafficking.\n\nThe wealthy financier and high-flyer faced myriad accusations of sex abuse against underage girls.\n\nYesterday, Trump said he would consider granting a pardon or clemency to Epstein's partner and accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\n\"You know, I haven't heard the name in so long.

The stock was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 last year, rising by an incredible 340%. But now there are serious concerns about its lofty valuation, and the federal government shutdown -- which as of this writing shows no sign of ending -- could also cause issues for the company.\n\nPalantir stock is still beating the market, up 33% in the last three months and up about 136% year to date. With its third-quarter earnings report about a month away, is Palantir stock still a buy right now? \n\nWhat Palantir does\n\nThere's no other company quite like Palantir. It was created two decades ago, as management puts it, as an answer to technology platforms that weren't adaptive enough to handle complex issues and took too long to deploy as custom systems. \n\nPalantir is a data-mining company that uses artificial intelligence to gather and analyze information from thousands of sources. For instance, military and intelligence agencies can get insights about adversaries by tapping into satellites around the world, giving them insights and the ability to make decisions using real-time data in battlefield situations.\n\nPalantir has been working with the U.S. government for a long time, and is famously credited for providing the intelligence that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden.\n\nIn 2022, it rolled out its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows both military and commercial clients to utilize large language models to interact with data and operations. The platform uses AI and the company's data to suggest process improvements, offers guidance on how to accomplish tasks, and interacts with AI systems to perform tasks. \n\nPalantir uses what it calls boot camps to give prospective customers a chance to see how the platform works on their real-world problems and how it could change their operations. That strategy has been incredibly successful: Palantir closed 157 deals in the second quarter that were valued at more than $1 million each; 66 valued at more than $5 million; and 42 deals valued at more than $10 million each. The company generated $306 million in the second quarter from its fast-growing U.S. commercial segment (up 93% from a year ago). And its U.S. government revenue continued to grow as well, up 53% from a year earlier to $426 million. \n\nLooking ahead to Q3 earnings\n\nThe question that Palantir's next earnings report will answer is whether or not it duplicated or exceeded the growth it achieved in Q2 in Q3 -- because the expectations for the company are sky-high.\n\nPalantir currently trades at eye-watering valuations: Its price-to-earnings ratio is 623, its forward P/E is 217, and its price-to-sales ratio is 137. There are no numbers that it can post in the third quarter to make those ratios reasonable because the stock trades on momentum and expectations, not on the company's current fundamentals. To invest in Palantir requires that you believe in the potential and the growth story, and that you not worry as much about the math. \n\nHowever, people will be much more nervous about Palantir if it doesn't post blowout quarterly results. According to Yahoo! Finance, the consensus among analysts following the stock is that Q3 revenue will come in at $1.08 billion. That would be up 50% on a year-over-year basis, but only an 8% increase on a sequential basis. I don't think that would be enough to sustain Palantir's stock run. \n\nManagement's guidance matches the Street's expectations. For the full year, the company is looking for revenue between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, which would be about 44% better than 2024. Again, those are great numbers, but would they be enough to satisfy the sky-high expectations of institutional investors? I am skeptical. \n\nThe bottom line\n\nPalantir is a good company. It has a product that other companies can't match, its commercial segment is growing rapidly, and its mission to create AI agents that can perform basic job functions dovetails well with the desire of President Donald Trump to shrink the federal government's workforce.\n\nBut the stock is still reeling from an August report from short-seller Citron Research that called Palantir's valuation \"detached from fundamentals\" and assigned it a price target of $40 per share, which is roughly 73% lower than today's price. While I think that's overstating the issue, I agree that any argument about Palantir that rests on valuation is a losing argument for the stock. \n\nIn my opinion, Palantir must exceed expectations in its third-quarter report to keep its run going. The stock's rise is already slowing, and any sign of weakness could feed into Citron's warnings. I think Palantir's still a buy, but investors should approach the next earnings report with caution.","summary":"When the company delivers its Q3 report, it could be a make-or-break moment.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/07/up-29-in-3-months-should-you-buy-palantir-right-no/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F836349%2Fpltr-1.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 00:01:00","author":"Patrick Sanders","authors":["Patrick Sanders"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":367165142,"title":"HarperCollins UK apologizes to Melania Trump, removes claims about her from book following legal threat","text":"HarperCollins UK issued an apology to First Lady Melania Trump after it published \"unverified claims\" about her in a book. \"HarperCollins UK recently published a book by Andrew Lownie titled ‘Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.’ We have, in consultation with the author, removed passages of the book that referenced unverified claims about the First Lady of the United States Melania Trump,\" HarperCollins UK wrote in a statement Tuesday. \"Copies of the book that include those references are being permanently removed from distribution. HarperCollins UK apologizes to the First Lady,\" the statement added. Melania Trump shared the statement, which was first posted on HarperCollins UK's X account, to her nearly 4 million X followers. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP PUTS HUNTER BIDEN ON $1B NOTICE OVER 'FALSE, DEFAMATORY' EPSTEIN COMMENTS The book, which focuses on Prince Andrew, examines the disgraced royal's ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Lownie alleged that Epstein introduced Donald Trump to Melania. Representatives for the first lady rejected the claim, pointing to her own book which states she met her husband at New York City's Kit Kat Club in 1998 and was not introduced to him by Epstein. Melania Trump's team has taken swift action towards those who've promoted the false claim. Back in July, The Daily Beast retracted an article it had published based on comments made by Michael Wolff, who echoed the fabricated Epstein connection. The outlet later issued an apology. DAILY BEAST APOLOGIZES TO MELANIA TRUMP OVER RETRACTED EPSTEIN ALLEGATIONS ARTICLE \"The Daily Beast recently published a story headlined ‘Melania Trump ‘Very Involved’ in Epstein Scandal: Author’ based on an interview with Michael Wolff. Upon reflection, we have determined that the article did not meet our standards and has therefore been removed from our platforms,\" The Daily Beast said in a statement last month. \"In response to a letter from the first lady’s attorneys, The Daily Beast has also removed a portion of an episode of The Daily Beast Podcast titled ‘Trump’s Epstein Scandal Can’t Stop Won’t Stop’ referencing the first lady,\" the statement continued. \"The first lady points to her bestselling book ‘Melania’ as the definitive account of her life story. We apologize to the first lady and our readers.\" Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville repeated the claim on his own podcast and similarly issued a retraction and an apology. \"In last week's podcast episode, we spoke with Judd Legum,\" Carville said. \"After the episode, we received a letter from Melania Trump's lawyer. He took issue with our title of one of those YouTube videos from that episode and a couple of comments I made about the first lady. We took a look at what they complained about, and we took down the video and edited out those comments from the episode. I also take back these statements and apologize.\" Attorneys for Melania Trump also sent a $1 billion legal threat against Hunter Biden after he made the claim as a guest on Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan. Biden dismissed the threat and refused to apologize.

Email arthur.parashar@dailymail.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR, SENIOR REPORTER\n Published:00:49 BST, 8 October 2025 |Updated:00:58 BST, 8 October 2025 \n\nThere was a time when Bournemouth was the archetypal Victorian resort town - a paradisiacal haven attracting the wealth middle classes with its golden sandy beaches, shimmering bay and vibrant culture.\nBut what was once a jewel in the crown for a quintessential British holiday has slowly deteriorated into a town plagued by crime, teenage gangs running amok and a simmering tension which has left the town a shadow of its former self.\nSuch is the demise of Bournemouth, even asylum seekers living in British taxpayer-funded hotels this week told the Daily Mail that they would rather return to their native countries than carry on living here.\nBusiness owners, locals and holidaymakers laid bare the sharp decline they have witnessed over the last few years, revealing their shock at 'zombie' drug addicts and balaclava-clad youths wreaking havoc.\nWith many fearing tourists could soon start shunning the town, the Home Office has ensured there are at least some arrivals after converting three hotels into accommodation for asylum seekers.\nOn Meyrick Road, a wide tree-lined street leading down to one of Britain's best beaches, the 102-room Roundhouse Hotel and the 123-room Britannia Hotel are being used to house migrants. Further along the coast, in Boscombe, is the 79-room Chine Hotel.\nLike many communities around the country, Bournemouth has this summer been at the centre of migrant hotel protests, exacerbated by asylum seekers living there committing violent crimes in the town.\nIn the last week alone, three migrants from the Britannia Hotel have been hauled to court for separate crimes. \nHalil Dal, a Turkish migrant, was spared jail after drunkenly stabbing a man with a broken bottle. Days earlier, Shkar Jamal missed his sentencing for threatening a man with a snooker cue so he could eat fish and chips nearby instead. And Kurdish migrant Hana Hassan was one of a 12-strong mob armed with machetes who attacked a shopkeeper in the town following a nightclub dispute. He was jailed for seven years.\nAmong the asylum seekers we spoke to was Jordanian Ahmad Hani, 25, who arrived in Britain nearly two years ago - but is so fed-up of Bournemouth, he would rather return to the country he fled from.\n\n'Take me home': Jordanian asylum seeker Ahmad Hani (pictured overlooking the sea view) does not feel safe in Bournemouth and wants to return home\n\nPictured is the Britannia Hotel, which is just a short walk from the stunning Bournemouth beachfront\n\nAsylum seekers from Eritrea are seen drinking cans of Stella Artois while overlooking the sea view\nSat on a rock overlooking the glistening ocean, he told the Daily Mail: 'I don't feel safe here. I am an asylum seeker here and the Britannia Hotel is not safe for me.\n'I have spoken to the Home Office to go back to my country. Here, too many people don't have [good] minds and do everything for enemies. There is too much crime. Police don't help any people here in Bournemouth.'\nSpeaking about his hotel accommodation, he added: 'My room is next to the bathroom. I don't want to live in that room, these hotels are not for people to live. It is old and it is not clean.\n'Some people living in the hotel don't have any feelings for animals, people or children. Some are dangerous in the hotel, they are seriously bad people.'\nMr Hani said he had 'problems' in his country and 'needed a relaxed life' but added: 'There's too much danger here… the police don't do serious work.'\nHe claims that his passport was taken by the Home Office and he asked for it back 'seven or eight months ago' so he could make his way back to Jordan.\nAn Eritrean migrant, sitting drinking cans of Stella Artois with a friend on the cliff top view, had a similar opinion, unable to decide whether he prefers the country he fled from or Bournemouth. 'I feel so bad here,' he added before walking back to his hotel.\nIn contrast, Sudanese father-of-one Abdullah, who crossed the English Channel in a small boat from France 45 days ago, is relieved to have arrived in sunny Bournemouth. \nSat on a clifftop bench overlooking the water with the French beaches on the horizon, he tells me of his journey across Sudan, Libya, Greece, France and finally the UK: 'The trip was very dangerous. We didn't know if we would make it or not.'\nDespite being crammed into a tiny dinghy with 50 other refugees, he adds: 'I risked my life to come but I had no other choice because my country is not safe. I am grateful to be hosted by the UK. Bournemouth is beautiful… I like to walk by the sea and play sports.'\nAnother Eritrean migrant, who has been staying at the nearby Britannia Hotel for four months after also crossing the Channel, adds: 'I lived two months in London, but I did not like it, it was too crowded. Bournemouth is nice. I like the beach here.'\nWhen the Mail visited this week, there was a flurry of activity with migrants smoking and drinking, surrounded by a square mile of ten other hotels where paying customers are staying.\nSue Clayton, who was staying at a hotel opposite the migrant accommodation, said: 'It has unnerved me. I shouldn't feel like this in my country.'\n\nAsylum seekers loiter outside the Roundhouse Hotel, one of three migrant hotels in Bournemouth \n\nAsylum seekers walk back to their accommodation, which is along a stretch of several Bournemouth hotels\nShe added: 'Bournemouth has changed a lot. My daughter was at university here. I think I'd be really worried if she was here now.'\nWhen told about migrants complaining about living in Bournemouth, she added: 'They should be considering themselves lucky they have somewhere to live.'\nThe change in the town's demographic is clear, with the non-British born population rising by 47 per cent between the 2011 and 2021 censuses - along with the UK's soaring net migration. \nThe tension brought by asylum seekers in Bournemouth hotels is another layer adding to the crime-ridden town's woes.\nEven Bournemouth's outgoing deputy mayor denounced it as 'not my town anymore' as she blasted the 'pitiful' decision made by her beleaguered council to remove the tourism department.\nIt was, perhaps, the nail in the coffin which reflected the downfall of Bournemouth in recent years.\nFrustration over the state of the town has even led to a so-called 'vigilante' group setting up to patrol the streets at night.\nSafeguard Force, who launched in August, say they were forced to take action due to the spate of crime and lack of policing.\nOne of the most shocking crimes that rocked Bournemouth was last May when two innocent women, Amie Grey and Leanne Miles, were attacked on the beach by criminology student Nasen Saadi. He was sentenced to 39 years in jail after murdering Ms Grey and leaving Ms Miles in a critical condition.\nChaos continued this summer, with a mass brawl breaking out in front of horrified locals and holidaymakers. The fight, on June 30, resulted in a teenage girl being rushed to hospital, while some of the youths hurled missiles at the police.\nA week later, a 20-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a Syrian asylum seeker in a public toilet on the beach. Mohammed Abdullah, who lives in west London, denies rape and sexual assault.\nWhen the Mail joined Safeguard Force for a patrol on Wednesday night, founder Gary Bartlett, 60, said: 'I grew up in Bournemouth, I spent my whole youth here. It's changed massively.\n'We used to come into town and you'd have a tear-up but you'd walk home safe, no problems whatsoever. I've got two daughters, 33 and 32, and they won't come into town.\n'I knew I had to do something, I didn't actually give it enough credit for how bad it actually was until I came out and it was shocking.'\nThe group claim they have had to intervene after seeing a man knuckledusted, an autistic boy set upon by a gang of teenagers, an Asian couple attacked on the beach by a group and a series of suspected knife fights - all since setting up less than two months ago.\n\nThe Mail joined Safeguard Force, a group of volunteers who patrol the streets of Bournemouth. They are led by Gary Bartlett (left)\n\nWe also walked past a makeshift homeless camp in a park which is known for having trouble, say locals \nAs we walk through the 'crime hotspots', there is a stench of cannabis lingering in the air. 'It's everywhere,' Mr Bartlett says.\nThe group is made up of everyday workers who volunteer each night because they feel they 'need to take a stand'. They hope their patrols in official uniform will deter criminals - but insist they are not vigilantes.\nWearing a stab-proof vest and body-worn camera, one of Mr Bartlett's team, Tom, says: 'We will do this for as long as it takes. This will spread from county to county and across the country.\n'It's about people stepping up and wanting to be a part of something bigger than themselves and put themselves in harm's way.'\nThe establishment of Safeguard Force appears to have been welcomed on the whole, but the Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner has warned they are not 'endorsed' by police amid concerns over 'vetting, training and administration.'\nBut fighting back, Mr Bartlett says: '99.9 per cent of people love what we are doing. We've got to prove ourselves. Our vetting process is really stringent. It's harder to get into the Safeguard Force than it is to get in the country!'\nAs we walk down the Old Christchurch Road, there is a feeling it is the calm before the storm. Later, when we return, it is filled with drunken students stumbling around in fancy dress.\nBut the bustling street, packed with bars, clubs and restaurants, has become a hotspot for crime in recent years - both in the day and at night.\nBusiness owners this week laid bare just how bad it has become after a spate of incidents across the summer.\nTakeaway worker Sandip Dhungana, 21, said: 'I see so much crime here. I see fighting and drug dealers every day. It is disturbing. The people are crazy sometimes.'\n\nHalil Dal, 30, was caught on CCTV smashing the glass bottle against a wall outside the Camel nightclub in Bournemouth, Dorset last December before attacking a man\n\nVictim Kashif Chugtai suffered cuts to his back and was lucky his injuries were not 'catastrophic'\n\nIt came just days after fellow asylum seeker Shkar Jamal, 24, who is living in the same hotel as Dal, missed his sentencing hearing for threatening a man with a snooker cue in a public place so he could eat fish and chips nearby \n\nThe Britannia Hotel, where there have been several incidents involving migrants staying there\nNikesh, a 32-year-old shopworker, said: 'There's a drastic change to when I first got here six years ago.\n'The girls can't go to the parties at night. It isn't locals - these are the asylum seekers staying at the hotels. They stop the women, they tease, they shout.\n'We have a lot of shoplifting. Two days ago, I caught someone stealing. He was a refugee again. We can't do anything, police say they can't do anything.'\nHe also laid bare the racial tension in Bournemouth, referencing the migrant protests every weekend. One of my friend's wives was walking around and she was told 'You're brown go back home' by children. This happens.'\nThe Mail was also shown CCTV of a feral teenage gang brazenly stealing boxes of nicotine pouches from one shop in broad daylight.\nAnother area locals say is filled with anti-social behaviour is the Bournemouth Gardens and the beachfront - two adjoined areas that have traditionally been hailed as the best parts of the town.\nSarah, 55, who has been coming to Bournemouth since she was a child, said: 'We've been coming for years and years, but I've only started to notice all the drugs in the last year. In the last three years it's changed massively.\n'There's a lot of drug addicts on the path into town. There are a lot more homeless here. We were sat in the square last year and there were a lot of people that looked like zombies. It was quite bad.\n'There should be more policing in the street. It's not nice for tourists and kids. They just walk around doing what they like.'\nSpeaking about the three asylum seeker hotels, she adds: 'People are sick to death of it now.\n'The problem is they come from war-torn countries. Some of them have mental health problems, we don't know what criminal records they've got. It's a dangerous game.'\nThis week, Turkish migrant Halil Dal, 30, was spared jail after stabbing a man with a broken bottle outside the Camel nightclub, on Old Christchurch Road.\nDal has been staying in the Britannia Hotel since fleeing Turkey, where his lawyer said he faced persecution for his political views.\nHis lawyer said Turkish police had accused him of being a member of a terrorist group, tortured him and forced him to become an informant.\nHe admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was handed a 24-week prison sentence suspended for 18 months, meaning he is not eligible for automatic deportation under Government legislation.\nIt came days after fellow asylum seeker Shkar Jamal, 24, missed his sentencing hearing for threatening a man with a snooker cue in a public place so he could eat fish and chips nearby.\n\nBournemouth has traditionally been a beautiful holiday resort for families to come to \n\nLarge protests have taken place outside the hotels on Meyrick Road. This was in August \n\nOn a Daily Mail visit to the area over the summer, we witnessed a bastion of bin bags and fast food boxes stacked in and around a solitary skip\n\nGroups of youngsters were also seen on the beach appearing to inhale balloons full of nitrous oxide over the summer \nAnd a Sudanese immigrant was cleared of raping a student who he met at the Cameo nightclub, also on Old Christchurch Road.\nLast year, four illegal migrants - all Kurs from Iran and Iraq - were jailed for a combined 22 years after walking down Christchurch Road, near the migrant hotels, armed with large machetes and attacking a shop owner.\nHana Hassan, whose address was given as the Britannia Hotel , was sentenced to seven years in prison, Yosef Shaban, 24, to four years in prison, Osama Qadir, 21, to six years in prison and Dawan Mantik, 28, to five years in prison.\nErkam, a student in his final year at university, said: 'I feel like there is nothing in Bournemouth that is any good, other than the beach. There's nothing really social to do, I think the young people are turning to crime because there's literally nothing else to do.'\nHis friend, Jacob, adds: 'It's a bit dodgy. Drugs is the main problem here. On a Saturday night, it's full of little kids in balaclavas and homeless people.'\nNick Pearse, who works at an amusement arcade on the beachfront, said he deals with anti-social behaviour from teenagers 'literally every day'.\n'You say anything to them and they square up. They don't treat Bournemouth with respect, the state they leave the beach in is unbelievable - the amount of rubbish.'\nMr Pearse said the beachfront is also rife with drugs, adding: 'At night, it's dead down here because no one wants to come down here - they're scared.\n\nA group of friends, believed to be students, stagger through Bournemouth on a Wednesday night \n\nA lone Heineken bottle stands next to a water fountain. Locals have complained of litter across the town\n'Most days you get fights down here. It gets really bad in the square. And at night people don't walk through the gardens.\n'I've worked here for 16 years and it's getting worse and worse and worse every year.\n'The only time you see the police down here is if there's a rape or if something goes badly. I feel like tourism is declining.'\nMr Pearse also revealed how two asylum seekers came into the arcade over the summer and began 'intimidating' women.\nHe explained: 'There were a couple girls in here, they came in and stood behind them, intimidating them. I had to come over and get them out because I could see in the girl's faces they were getting agitated. They came over to me and said thanks after, it shouldn't be like that.'\nIt marks a tragic decline for Bournemouth, a town where locals and workers are visibly upset about how much it has changed.\nDorset Police insist they are stepping up foot patrols, but we did not come across a single officer on our day and night out in the town.\nChief Superintendent Heather Dixey, LPA Commander for the BCP area, said: “Bournemouth remains a safe place to live, work and visit. However, like most large, urbanised areas, we do have crime, which we are tackling and reducing. Often these offences involve individuals who are known to one another.\n“The added influx of visitors we receive during peak periods can lead to additional demand and we have extensive policing plans in place – which includes working with our local partners – to ensure we proactively deter offenders from committing crime.'\nShe added: 'While we welcome the responsible use of volunteers who wish to carry out public service to help us achieve our aim, we do not endorse the activities of Safeguard Force.'\nThe force say anti-social behaviour reduced by 4.6 per cent between April and July this year compared with last year and crime has reduced by 3 per cent.\nThe Home Office have been contacted for comment. \nThe Home Office\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe crime-ridden seaside resort where migrants would rather return home than stay in British taxpayer-funded hotels on the beach\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Approach control will be taken over later by Memphis Center, it added.\n\nBoth political parties are pointing the finger at each other for the impacts. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Democrats were to blame for the aviation slowdown, while California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said President Donald Trump was responsible.\n\nSevere weather is also impacting flights across the country.\n\nSome 13,000 air traffic controllers and about 50,000 Transportation Security Administration officers must still turn up for work during the government shutdown, but they are not being paid. Controllers are set to receive a partial paycheck on Oct 14 for work performed before the shutdown.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday the FAA had seen a slight increase in controllers taking sick leave and air traffic staffing has been cut by 50 per cent in some areas since the shutdown started last week.\n\n\"If we don't have controllers, we're going to make sure the airspace is safe.

I think we should do two verses of ‘Shake It Off,’ into ‘Blank Space,’ into ‘Cruel Summer’ would be great.”\n\nSwift’s remarks come after the Bad Bunny pick prompted a polarized response.\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted the decision on Monday while speaking on Newsmax’s “Greg Kelly Reports,” calling the selection “absolutely ridiculous.”\n\n“I never heard of him. I don’t know who he is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, it’s crazy,” Trump said.\n\nOn Saturday Night Live this past weekend, guest host Bad Bunny told detractors: “I’m really excited to be doing the Super Bowl, I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” and in Spanish added, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself; it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”\n\nHe later quipped in his monologue about Americans needing to learn Spanish, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”\n\nBefore accepting the Super Bowl halftime invitation, Bad Bunny revealed he excluded the United States from his world tour due to concerns that immigration authorities might target his fans.\n\nIn a recent interview, the Puerto Rican performer said he was worried about ICE raids at his concerts and didn’t want to risk the safety of those attending.\n\n“There were many reasons why I didn’t show up in the U.S., and none of them were out of hate — I’ve performed there many times,” he said. “But there was the issue of — like, f***ing ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it’s something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”\n\nWhen asked if he made that choice because of fears of mass deportations of Latino fans, Bad Bunny said the concern was “absolutely real.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned that ICE would be “all over” the Super Bowl and said agents would be present to ensure attendees “have the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave.”\n\n“So yeah, we’ll be all over that place. We’re going to enforce the law,” she said in a video posted to Benny Johnson’s YouTube channel.\n\nSwift used the Fallon appearance to promote her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, which was released on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025.","summary":"The Super Bowl halftime conversation turned political after the NFL announced Bad Bunny as the Super Bowl LX halftime performer last week.

The agency temporarily slowed takeoffs of planes headed to the first three cities. \n\nMajor flight delays a day earlier also were tied to insufficient staffing during the shutdown, which began Oct. 1. The FAA reported delays on Monday at the airports in Burbank, California, Newark, New Jersey and Denver. \n\nTravel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the risk of significant disruptions to the U.S. aviation system “is growing by the day\" as federal workers whose jobs are deemed critical continue working without pay. The longer the shutdown drags on, the more likely it is to affect holiday travel plans in November, he said. \n\n“I’m gravely concerned that if the government remains shut down then, that it could disrupt, and possibly ruin, millions of Americans’ Thanksgiving holidays,\" Harteveldt said in a statement.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday that there has already been an uptick in air traffic controllers calling out sick in a few locations. When there aren't enough controllers, the FAA must reduce the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, which in turn causes flight delays and possible cancellations.\n\nThat's what happened Monday afternoon, when the control tower at Southern California's Hollywood Burbank Airport shut down for several hours, leading to average delays of two-and-a-half hours. \n\nWhen a pilot preparing for takeoff radioed the tower, according to communications recorded by LiveATC.net, he was told: “The tower is closed due to staffing.”\n\nNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the shutdown highlighted some of his union's members already face on a regular basis due to a national airspace system that is critically understaffed and relies on outdated equipment that tends to fail. \n\nA couple of controllers missing work can have a big impact at a small airport already operating with limited tower staffing, he said. \n\n“It’s not like we have other controllers that can suddenly come to that facility and staff them. There’s not enough people there,” Daniels said Tuesday. “There’s no overtime, and you have to be certified in that facility.”\n\nAir travel complications are likely to expand once a regularly scheduled payday arrives next week and air traffic controllers and TSA officers don’t receive any money, the union leader said. If the impasse between Republican and Democratic lawmakers on reopening the government persists, the workers will come under more pressure as their personal bills come due, Daniels said.\n\n“It’s going to eventually be that when people don’t have money, they have time to start making life choices and life decisions,\" he said. \n\nDaniels said it’s not realistic to expect controllers to stay focused only on their difficult jobs of keeping flights safe while they aren't getting paid even if they eventually should be entitled to back pay. \n\n“That’s not reality and it shouldn’t be put on our backs,” he said. “It’s completely unfair that an air traffic controller is the one that holds the burden of ‘see how long you can hang in there in order to allow this political process to play out?’” \n\nJohnny Jones, secretary-treasurer of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter that represents TSA workers, said he was hearing questions like “How are we going to handle paying our bills?” and “How are we going to pay our child support? How are you going to pay for childcare? How are you going to pay your mortgage payments? If I have to miss work, am I going to get terminated?”\n\n“The employees are struggling. They’re assessing what they need to do and they’re assessing how this is all going to work out,” said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the TSA was established.\n\nSome TSA officers already have called in sick, but Jones said he ddid not think the numbers were big enough to cause significant problems and delays at airports.\n\nAviation unions and U.S. airlines have called for the shutdown to end as soon as possible. \n\nThe unions are also making appeals to food banks, grocery chains and airports to secure support for workers during the shutdown. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was offering federal workers $15 food vouchers and allowing them to park in the terminal, according to Jones. \n\nJohn Tiliacos, the chief operating officer of Florida's Tampa International Airport, said the facility started preparing for the shutdown well before it began.\n\nNicknamed “Operation Bald Eagle 2” among airport staff, the efforts center around pulling together resources for the roughly 11,000 federal employees who are working at the airport without pay, including security screeners and air traffic controllers.\n\nTiliacos said the help would include a food pantry, free bus rides to work and a program with the local utility provider to keep the lights on at the homes of the workers. \n\n“Whatever we can do to make life a little easier for these federal employees that allows them to continue coming to work and focus on keeping our airport operational, that’s what we’re prepared to do,” he said.\n\nTampa’s airport provided similar resources for impacted workers when the government closed for 35 days in 2018 and 2019 during President Donald Trump’s first term. Tiliacos said he thinks the assistance helped prevent the widespread staffing shortages that other airports experienced during that shutdown.","summary":"Staffing shortages led to more flight delays at airports across the U.S. as the federal government shutdown stretched into a seventh day","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/federal-aviation-administration-tsa-atlanta-dallasfort-worth-philadelphia-b2841360.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/08/01/Government_Shutdown_85872.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:55:27","author":"Rio Yamat","authors":["Rio Yamat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.5},{"id":367160404,"title":"Survivor’s Account: How a Party at Nova Festival Became a Tragic Event on October 7","text":"On the morning of 7 October 2023, Natalie Sanandaji, a survivor of the Nova festival, recalls waking up “to the sound of rockets being intercepted overhead”.\n\nDespite the impending tragedy, where over 360 lives would be lost and many taken hostage, attendees remained mostly composed.\n\n“I tell people to envision a festival anywhere in the world, with attendees witnessing rockets intercepted right above them,” she shared in an interview with SBS Hebrew. \n\n“Consider how calmly they respond. This wouldn’t likely occur elsewhere. Yet, for Israelis, this is a harsh reality.”\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 47 of whom are still in Gaza. Of those, the Israeli military says 25 are dead.\n\nSince then, more than 66,000 people have been killed in Gaza, the majority of whom are civilians, according to Palestinian authorities.\n\nSanandaji spoke about the shock of what she saw that day, her instinct to protect her mother from distress, and the split-second decisions that saved her life.\n\n“People had been partying all night. As the sun rose, they would have seen paragliders coming in from the direction of Gaza. Then they would have heard gunshots,” she recalled.\n\nSanandaji said people at the festival “took a while to realise that there were terrorists inside of Israel”. \n\n“When we started evacuating to our cars, we still thought it was just rockets,” she said.\n\n“We started driving out and if you can imagine, there was a little over 3,000 people at this festival. Majority were leaving at the same time. Some left first, some that were more nervous. \n\nSanandaji’s mother called her, knowing she was at a festival, but she said she lied about how much danger she was in, not wanting to tell her the truth until she was home safe.\n\n“I lied to her. I told her I was at a different festival. I told her that everything was okay and I told her I was actually on my way home,” she said.\n\nSpeaking about why she wants to continue sharing her story about the life-changing, traumatic incident, Sanandaji said she believes telling her story is a gift.\n\n“When it comes to my voice, specifically, not just as a Nova survivor, but also as a Persian Jew, as someone whose family fled persecution from the Islamic regime when it came into power, I think the purpose of my voice is to teach people history, to show people that history is repeating itself,” she said. \n\n‘Remember lives stolen’\n\nMeanwhile, Australian Jewish organisations are also commemorating the two-year anniversary of October 7, but the diversity of sentiment shows ongoing community division around Israel’s response. \n\nThe Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) said it “remember[s] the lives stolen, the hostages still held, and the pain felt in Israel and here in Australia”.\n\n“Amid hate, we choose unity, resilience, and hope,” the peak body said in a short social media statement. \n\n“While we will never forget, nor forgive, what Hamas did on this day two years ago, and what it continues to do, we live in hope that the hostages will soon be free, the anguish of the families will soon end, and they can all begin to heal,” he said at a press conference today.\n\nColin Rubenstein, executive director of the Australia/Israel & Jewish Affairs Council, said the past two years had weighed heavily on the Jewish community in Australia and around the world.\n\n“Even if the hostages are released, the war ends, and the Hamas threat is decisively disarmed, the Jewish experience can never return to what it was like before October 7 2023,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, other Jewish groups incorporated the commemoration of both Israelis and Palestinians into their observance of the date.\n\nMembers of the Jewish community continue to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi\n\n“Similarly, the deaths of so many innocents in Gaza and the destruction of their cultural, health and educational institutions has traumatised not only those living in Gaza, but the many family and friends who live in Israel, the occupied territories, neighbouring countries and around the world,” the New Israel Fund said in a statement.\n\nThe Jewish Council of Australia acknowledged the date as both two years since the Hamas-led attacks and “two years since Israel began its genocide against Palestinians in Gaza”.\n\n“The continuation of this genocide has only placed the Israeli hostages’ lives, and the lives of all people in Israel, at greater risk,” they said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian National Imams Council made similar claims, saying it marks two years “of relentless genocide and war waged against the people of Gaza”. \n\nIsraelis’ response to October 7\n\nLike Australian Jewish organisations, the Israeli public also remains divided over the country’s response to the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe Hostage and Missing Families Forum said it’s been “an unimaginable two years since October 7, or one long day that never ended since that dark, hellish morning”.\n\n“With both hope and dread in the air surrounding the outcome of [US] President [Donald] Trump’s peace plan, tens of thousands are rallying across the world in support of the families, and to Bring Them Home,” the group said via their Bring Them Home Now social media account.\n\nDelegations from Hamas and Israel have started indirect talks in Egypt around the proposal that would initially lead to the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and those held in administrative detention in Israel, as the first stage for a longer-term peace.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Hebrew.\n\n— With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn the morning of 7 October 2023,

assistance program with money from tariffs","text":"Oct. 7 (UPI) -- While the federal government is shut down without a budget, White House officials said tariffs could pay for food assistance for women, infants and children.\n\nThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children provides assistance for nearly 7 million women, infants and children in low-income families, but it is running out of money due to the lack of a federal budget, according to CNN.\n\nThe program had enough funds for between one and two weeks before the current budget impasse in Congress would cause it to expend all available funds.\n\nThe federal government largely shut down on Oct. 1 because Congress has not passed a budget and continues to battle over a stopgap resolution that would reopen the government for between four and six weeks.\n\nWhite House officials are considering using tariffs to pay for the WIC program until a federal budget is in place, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on X on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"The Democrats are so cruel in their continual votes to shut down the government that they forced the WIC program for the most vulnerable women and children to run out this week,\" Leavitt said.\n\nShe said President Donald Trump and other White House officials have suggested using tariff money that goes into the federal government's general fund to cover the WIC program costs during the shutdown.\n\nThe Treasury Department manages those funds, which are frozen until Congress approves a federal budget and the president signs it into law.\n\nUntil then, Trump has suggested Congress introduce and pass a measure that would designate those tariff funds specifically to cover WIC program costs.\n\nThe Senate repeatedly has voted down a House-approved continuing resolution that would fund the government for seven weeks while continuing to negotiate a 2026 budget for the federal government.\n\nA competing measure sponsored by Senate Democrats would fund the federal government through Oct. 31.\n\nIt also would add $1.5 trillion in spending to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits and expand Medicare coverage that opponents say would fund healthcare for \"illegal migrants,\" whom Senate Democrats have said already are not eligible for the subsidies.","summary":"While the federal government is shut down without

the first thing he’ll have to do as mayor is close budget gaps estimated at $17 billion over his first three years, which is sure to be exacerbated by federal cuts. \n\nMamdani’s vowed to confront President Donald Trump, not sweet-talk him into reversing those savings. \n\nMaking life in the Big Apple more affordable is a fantastic goal, and Mamdani showed real smarts in adopting it as his campaign centerpiece. \n\nIt’s too bad that he’s put zero thought into how he can actually deliver on most of his agenda, but his only priority now is getting elected — and on that front, fantasy math is working great so far.","summary":"“The most important thing is that it’s funded,” Zohran Mamdani blurred at an “affordability”-themed campaign event, insisting his $10 billion \"free stuff\" agenda will go ahead no matter what.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/07/opinion/lying-zohs-fantasy-budget-math-belongs-in-la-la-land/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/democratic-new-york-city-mayoral-112959269-e1759870212489.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:40:57","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":367157090,"title":"Pam Bondi was playing to an audience of one as she tore into Democrats in bitterly partisan DOJ ‘weaponization’ hearing","text":"The cameras were on Pam Bondi as she spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, and she put on the performance of a lifetime — or at least once to keep the boss happy.\n\nFor the verbal abuse she aimed at Democrats like Adam Schiff and Dick Durbin was a clear indication that there was really only one viewer with whom the U.S. attorney general seemed to care about.\n\nTo most, Tuesday’s hearing was a surreal and dismaying look into how the federal government’s political appointees under a second Trump presidency have become consumed with style over substance, and often seem uninterested or not knowledgable about various aspects of their jobs. That image has been born out over the past nine months by the likes of Kash Patel, Trump’s FBI director, who released misleading and incorrect information in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s shooting and Kristi Noem, the Homeland chief, who couldn’t give an accurate definition of “habeus corpus” when asked during a Senate hearing.\n\nFor Bondi, however, the focus was on scoring political points by attacking Democrats at every conceivable opportunity, especially Schiff, who remains one of her boss’ most hated foes in Washington. She was mildly successful, telling Adam Schiff “if you worked for me, you would've been fired,” but appearing to become flustered at other moments when her lack of experience or knowledge of the job was exposed.\n\n“What about the fires in California?” Bondi asked at one point, directing an awkward jab at the senator from California who had led an impeachment proceeding in her boss’ first term, and whom she dubbed a “failed lawyer” as she tossed out increasingly desperate insults.\n\nThe attorney general accused senators on the committee of “hating” the president and refused to answer direct questions from several members relating to the actions she was taking at the DOJ. Instead, she played the role of a comms staffer, demanding to know whether Schiff would “apologize” to Donald Trump after he correctly noted that Bondi was engaged in childish behavior throughout the hearing — including near-constant interruptions of senators and leveling personal insults.\n\nThis was Bondi’s day to prove her worth as a member of the ever-changing inner circle of Donald Trump, where she’s been a fixture for months — even traveling with the president to events like the U.S. Open and the FIFA Club World Cup. For some time, her positioning seemed to be in question thanks to her botched handling of the Epstein files investigation and an unhelpful declaration that files from the case were “on her desk” — but reporting around the DOJ’s handling of the issue and her dust-up with Patel, the FBI director, has largely cooled down.\n\nThe Department of Justice sits square in the center of Washington’s attention right now as the agency has seemingly transformed into a political tool under Donald Trump’s second presidency. In recent weeks, a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia resigned rather than bring what was argued to be a flimsy and politically-motivated case against New York’s Democratic state AG, only to be replaced by an inexperienced White House aide who then brought a case against former FBI director James Comey, another enemy of Trump’s.\n\nBondi, in her role as attorney general, plays a unique role in the second Trump administration. News reporting indicates she and her second-in-command, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, have sought to bridge the gap between the president’s aims to wield the agency as a weapon against his enemies with the realities of criminal law. \n\nUnlike her predecessors in the first Trump administration, she is taking only the most basic steps to concoct excuses for the agency’s new political bent thanks to the political cover the right believes Merrick Garland’s failed attempt to prosecute Donald Trump for the January 6 insurrection now provides.\n\nAs she sparred with the likes of Schiff and others, it was clear that Bondi’s only concern now is shoring up her bona fides with Trump as it pertains to taking on Democrats. Comey remains the only target on Trump’s enemies list actually charged by a prosecutor with the Department of Justice with a crime, and the president has already taken to publicly pressuring Bondi to make further strides against the others.\n\nTime will tell if she managed to do that. The president spent the day meeting with Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney and hadn’t released a statement praising Bondi on Truth Social by the early evening — though it was possible he simply hadn’t watched clips on TV yet. In general, even with her proven ability to do battle with the president’s foes, she remains in a tight spot: responsible, ultimately, for seeing some of Donald Trump’s outlandish revenge fantasies come to life.","summary":"Pam Bondi was ready to smack Democrats around, but found herself floundering when real questions came her way, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bondi-trump-schiff-congress-testimony-b2841349.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/07/23/06/GettyImages-2239752030.jpg?crop=1024,682.7,x0,y0.2&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qYknLQO0-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:40:18","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":367156502,"title":"Trump optimistic about Gaza peace deal – as Israelis mark October 7 anniversary | World News","text":"Donald Trump has expressed optimism about ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, as Israelis mourned those killed two years after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe US president described the negotiations as “very serious”, adding: “I think there’s a possibility we could have peace in the Middle East”.\n\nOne of the key mediators, Qatar’s prime minister, along with senior American diplomats Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will now head to Egypt to join the third day of indirect negotiations between the Palestinian militant group and Israel.\n\nMemorial events took place around the world on Tuesday, including in Israel, as grieving families gathered and relatives hoped a ceasefire deal could see the remaining hostages freed.\n\nIt has been two years since thousands of Hamas-led militants poured into southern Israel after a surprise barrage of rockets.\n\nThey stormed army bases, farming communities and the outdoor Nova music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, including women, children and older adults.\n\nThe attack plunged the region into a devastating war, including a brutal retaliatory offensive by Israel on Gaza that has left tens of thousands of people dead, turned entire towns and cities to rubble, triggered a widespread famine and displaced around 90% of the population.\n\nHamas abducted 251 others, most of whom have since been released in ceasefires or other deals, with 48 hostages remaining inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive.\n\nIsrael mourns October 7 victims\n\nIn Tel Aviv, dozens gathered at a memorial site that was set up in a city square.\n\nOthers visited the scene of the Nova music festival in the border community of Reim, where nearly 400 Israelis were killed and where portraits of the kidnapped and dead have been erected.\n\nThousands of people visited throughout the day to share memories of relatives and friends who were killed.\n\nPro-Palestinian rallies, opposing Israel’s actions in Gaza, were also held in several European cities including Paris, Geneva, Athens, Istanbul, Stockholm, and London.\n\nSir Keir Starmer labelled the UK protests as “un-British” and said they showed a lack of respect.\n\nHamas wants ‘guarantees’\n\nOn the second day of talks, top Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya told Egyptian state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV the group had come “to engage in serious and responsible negotiations”.\n\nHe said Hamas was ready to reach a deal, yet it needed a “guarantee” to end the war and ensure “it is not repeated”.\n\nUS officials have suggested the talks should initially focus on the first phase: halting the fighting and working out logistics for the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.\n\nRead more from Sky News:Two lives torn apart by the Hamas attackTrump’s Gaza peace plan explainedIsraelis and Palestinians grieve two years on\n\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani of Qatar said he would attend the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh “with the aim of pushing forward the Gaza ceasefire plan and hostage release agreement”.\n\n👉Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim on your podcast app👈\n\nThe failure by Hamas to return hostages has left Israel deeply divided, with weekly mass protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIt has also left Israel more isolated internationally than it has been in decades.\n\nThe war has already killed over 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.\n\nExperts and major rights groups have accused Israel of genocide – something Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is seeking the arrest of Mr Netanyahu and his former defence minister for allegedly using starvation as a method of war.","summary":"Donald Trump has expressed optimism about ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, as Israelis mourned those killed two years after the October 7 attacks.

I love you and thank you for understanding.'\nUnderneath the post, Olivia Munn left a string of red heart emojis, while the singer Brandi Carlile praised Parton as 'beyond reproach.'\nCountry star Jennifer Nettles added: 'Big adventures for you, for sure!

Freida concluded; pictured (L) with Dolly (R) in 1981\nActress Julianne Hough shared three heart emojis. \nOther fans echoed the same sentiment: 'Protect this queen at all costs!!!!,' one wrote, while another gushed, 'Heal strong, Queen Dolly!' \nOne commenter summed up the mood of many, writing: 'We love you so much please slow it down and recharge.'\nLast month, Parton sparked concern over her health after canceling a prescheduled trip to Dollywood, where she had been set to announce the park’s latest attraction. \nAlthough the 9 To 5 hitmaker was unable to attend the event in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, she revealed in a pre-recorded video message that she was recovering from kidney stones.\nDespite her absence on Wednesday, Parton looked to be in good health during her video appearance, and she promised fans she will return to Dollywood soon. \nIn 2015, she revealed that she had three kidney stones removed and was 'doing just fine.'\n'I love and appreciate everyone's concern,' she wrote in a statement on her website, at the time.\n\nEarlier this month, Parton sparked concern over her health after canceling a prescheduled trip to Dollywood; (seen in 2023)\n\nParton shared the news directly with fans on Instagram, explaining that she has been facing health challenges that require her to undergo several medical procedures \n\nEarlier this year, Parton's husband, Carl Dean, died at age 82\n\n'Oh, you know what, I get very emotional when people bring it up,' Parton told Today's Savannah Guthrie in May. 'But we were together 60 years. I've loved him since I was 18 years old'\nEarlier this year, Parton's husband, Carl Dean, died at age 82.\nIn her social media post announcing his death from March 3, the songstress wrote, 'Carl and I spent many wonderful years together. Words can't do justice to the love we shared for over 60 years.'\nTwo months later, Parton admitted that she get 'very emotional when people bring [her husband's death] up' while speaking with Savannah Guthrie on the Today Show.\n'But we were together 60 years,' she continued. 'I've loved him since I was 18 years old.'\nThe I Will Always Love You singer added that she was very thankful for all the messages she received since her beloved husband's death.\n'I'm so thankful. I've gotten so many cards, letters, flowers, from all over the world,' she shared before jokingly adding. 'I had no idea Carl Dean was so famous.'\nSeveral weeks after Dean's death, Parton told Knox News, 'I'm doing better than I thought I would. I've been with him 60 years. So, I'm going to have to relearn some of the things that we've done. But I'll keep him always close.'\nShe also shared insight into the end of her famously reclusive husband's life, revealing that he struggled leading up to his death.\n\nParton and Dean met at a Nashville laundromat in 1964, when she was 18 and he was 21. They married two years later, on May 30, 1966\n'He suffered a great deal,' Dolly said. 'I'm at peace that he's at peace, but that don't keep me from missing him and loving him.'\nShe went on to say, 'It's a hole in my heart, you know, but we'll fill that up with good stuff and he'll still always be with me.'\nParton met Dean at a laundromat in Nashville in 1964, when she was 18 and he was 21. They were married two years later, on May 30, 1966.\nDean, who ran an asphalt business for years, didn't care for the fast-paced life in the spotlight that Dean had to accept as a singing superstar.\nAfter attending an awards show early in Parton's career, he swore off public events with her and opted for a private life while allowing her to carry on her public face on her own.\n'He does not want to be in the spotlight at all,' Parton told Entertainment Tonight in a 2020 interview. 'It's just not who he is. He's like a quiet, reserved person and he figured if he ever got out there in that, he'd never get a minute’s peace and he's right about that.\n'I've always respected and appreciated that in him, and I've always tried to keep him out of the limelight as much as I can, she continued. 'He said, \"I didn't choose this world, I chose you, and you chose that world. But we can keep our lives separate and together.\" And we do and we have.'\nDean was also an inspiration for Parton's most famous song, Jolene. After a bank teller that he would regularly see became enamored of him, Parton was inspired to write the song from the viewpoint of a woman begging her competition to not steal her lover away.\nDolly Parton\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDolly Parton's sister asks for prayers for music icon, 79, amid mystery health battle\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 272\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

California cities don’t even have enough money to fund the bare minimum of public services, with essential services like BART shutting down frequently.\n\nThis is a problem that has gone back decades, ever since 1978, when Proposition 13 passed, and has since robbed hundreds of billions of dollars from our communities. Because Proposition 13 has severely capped property tax levels, other taxes have needed to be raised to pick up the slack. Sales tax rates in Oakland are nearly maxed out, and sales taxes are regressive and harm our most disadvantaged community members the most.\n\nIf we were able to tax the corporations that are stealing billions of dollars from us every year, Oakland would be able to fund every public service we need and more.\n\nRhys Hedges\nSan Francisco\n\nU.S. must preserve\nGeneva Conventions\n\nRe: “Cities eyed for military drills” (Page A1, Oct. 1).\n\nAmericans should recoil in horror at Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s expressed skepticism of adhering to the Geneva Conventions and their rules of engagement.\n\nThese are not abstract foreign mandates. The United States helped write them after World War II, ratified them and wove them into the very fabric of our military doctrine. They are a proud expression of our belief that even in war, humanity must not be abandoned.\n\nTo discard them now would be a betrayal, not only of our history but of the moral law that has guided Christian just war teaching for centuries: protect civilians, treat prisoners humanely and resist the savagery that war so easily unleashes.\n\nHegseth’s vision reduces morality to expediency, turning our soldiers into instruments of cruelty rather than guardians of justice. To follow him down that path would not be strength but surrender to barbarism itself.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nHegseth’s vision is\nof American Reich\n\nRe: “Cities eyed for military drills” (Page A1, Oct. 1).\n\nPete Hegseth’s recent speech to America’s top military brass was chilling.\n\nHe stated that the military would “untie the hands of our war fighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country.” He encouraged aggressive tactics, an approach intended to restore what Hegseth described as the “warrior ethos” and a more aggressive, risk-taking mindset. He hinted that current rules of conduct in war should be ignored, and winning at any cost is the only objective.\n\nMore and more, Donald Trump and his cronies appear to be installing an American Reich. Be afraid. Be very afraid.\n\nRobert Thomas\nCastro Valley\n\nGOP should examine its\nrole in political violence\n\nIt’s absolutely stunning that Donald Trump and the Republican Party are saying that political violence is because of leftist policies.\n\nLet’s remember that the GOP and the NRA virtually assured that every household would be armed to the teeth. The GOP has fought to keep guns available to anyone, regardless of mental disease or age. They refuse to have a national gun registry for all enforcement agencies in the country. They won’t prevent ghost guns from being made or 3D printing technology from making parts.\n\nIt might be time for the GOP to take a hard look in the mirror and try to be honest about their role in gun use. Recall that the GOP is making education more difficult, and we know that the inability to communicate is a real cause for violence.\n\nStuart Shicoff\n\nTrump, cronies eulogize\nAmerican values\n\nRe: “Trump, others eulogize activist” (Page A1, Sept. 22).\n\nCharlie Kirk was praised for his beliefs, says the article about the political conservative’s memorial service.

Maura Healey’s fiscal year 2026 budget vetoes on Wednesday, aiming to restore funding for nursing homes, charter schools and economic development programs.\n\nHouse leadership said the overrides would focus on spending deemed \"absolutely necessary\" to meet the state's needs, despite Healey’s warnings of fiscal strain and the implementation of cost-cutting measures.\n\nAmong the vetoes expected to be overridden are $25 million for supplemental nursing home rates, nearly $20 million in charter school reimbursements and $2 million to support the state’s manufacturing industry. Healey vetoed those and other items in the $60.9 billion budget she signed in July, citing fiscal discipline and alignment with her original spending plan.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz defended the House’s decision to pursue overrides on Tuesday, arguing the Legislature had already accounted for potential revenue volatility during budget negotiations.\n\n\"While the House shares the governor's commitment to fiscal prudence amid the Trump Administration’s devastating budget cuts, we continue to believe that the FY26 budget investments that we will vote on [Wednesday] can be made in a financially responsible manner,\" Michlewitz said.\n\nThe Healey administration released new data Tuesday showing that budget cuts stemming from actions by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans could have a $3.7 billion impact on the state over the next three years, through fiscal year 2028. That includes up to $3.3 billion in federal funding reductions approved by Congress and another $399 million in cuts resulting from executive actions by Trump.\n\nDespite rising alarms around the fiscal picture and deep federal cuts, Wednesday will be only the second formal session the House has held since recessing at the end of July.\n\nMichlewitz said leadership is confident that “hundreds of millions of dollars in expected revenue that we set aside during conference committee negotiations” will provide the flexibility to manage the state’s finances through economic uncertainty.\n\nBudget writers built $860 million in unallocated funds into the fiscal 2026 budget. But Michlewitz and other budget managers also heard last week from the commissioner of revenue that Massachusetts is expecting a state tax revenue reduction of at least $650 million this budget year as a result of a new federal law.\n\nHealey vetoed $130.2 million across 28 budget line items in July, significantly less than the $317 million she cut from the fiscal 2025 budget.\n\nThe governor’s largest veto, $27.5 million, targeted the Group Insurance Commission, where she plans to implement midyear changes restricting coverage of high-cost GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. Michlewitz's statement on overrides did not specifically mention that veto.\n\nLawmakers can override gubernatorial vetoes with a two-thirds majority in each chamber. Wednesday’s planned House votes mark the first signal that Democrats are ready to flex that authority this year.\n\nThe Department of Revenue reported that the state collected $4.6 billion in September, 3 percent more than the same month last year, though still 1.4 percent below expectations. Year-to-date, revenues are up $309 million compared to last year but lag the fiscal 2026 benchmark by $64 million, or 0.6 percent.\n\nRevenues from the state's income surtax and capital gains taxes have so far helped stabilize the state’s fiscal outlook.","summary":"Among the vetoes expected to be overridden are $25 million for supplemental nursing home rates, nearly $20 million in charter school reimbursements and $2 million to support the state’s manufacturing industry.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/massachusetts-statehouse-line-item-veto-overrides/article_541686e1-35f4-4415-97a7-4849441b39c9.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/41/541686e1-35f4-4415-97a7-4849441b39c9/68e5a1e0bf504.preview.jpg?crop=1761%2C925%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:30:00","author":"By Sam Drysdale State House News Service,Getty Images","authors":["By Sam Drysdale State House News Service","Getty Images"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":367165774,"title":"Gold price tops $4,000 for the first time ever","text":"The price of gold has surpassed $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever, driven by global instability and uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's policies. \n\nThis surge is attributed to a depreciating US dollar, anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and the nation's growing debts, which led to a Moody's credit downgrade. \n\nMoney managers, investors, and central banks worldwide are increasingly turning to gold as a safe haven, reflecting a lack of confidence in US institutions and the dollar's declining value. \n\nInternational market shocks, including the Japanese yen's drop after Sanae Takaichi's election and the French Prime Minister's swift resignation, have further propelled investors towards gold. \n\nExperts like Ken Griffin express concern over the shift away from the dollar, while Goldman Sachs has raised its 2026 gold price forecast to $4,900 per ounce.","summary":"","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/gold-price-record-trump-b2841353.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/22/16/Gold-Price_Record_53012.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QEpf1g25-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:28:26","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.029},{"id":367157088,"title":"‘Absolutely disgusted’ Marjorie Taylor Greene suddenly is Democrats’ best GOP friend in shutdown fight over Obamacare","text":"As the government shutdown goes into its second week, Democrats have found an unlikely ally as they hope to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). \n\nOn Monday evening, Greene posted on X how she did not like the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, but had come to a stark reality about it.\n\n“Let’s just say as nicely as possible, I’m not a fan,” she said. “But I’m going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children’s insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district.”\n\nFormer president Joe Biden expanded tax credits for people who purchase health insurance on the state by state marketplace enacted by the 2010 law signed by Barack Obama. The subsidies expire at the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats have said they will not vote for a “clean” continuing resolution, a stopgap spending bill to avoid a shutdown that keeps spending at current levels with no additional amendments, and instead want to include an extension of the Obamacare subsidies in the resolution. \n\nGreene for her part assailed her party’s leadership. \n\n“Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING!!!” she wrote on X. \n\nThe words pleasantly surprised Democratic lawmakers, including her home state’s upper chamber rep, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.).\n\n“You are going to hear me utter words I never thought I'd say: Marjorie Taylor Greene is right,” Warnock told The Independent Tuesday. \n\n“I'm seeing what she's seeing. She's seeing what I'm seeing. People's health care premiums on the marketplace are going up astronomically high.”\n\nIn response, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) highlighted Greene’s tweet during his press conference on Tuesday. \n\n“Marjorie Taylor Greene acknowledges this fight is about the health care of the American people,” Jeffries said. “It’s Republicans in terms of the leadership that is missing in action.” \n\nSome Democrats expressed surprise — but pleasure — at the fact Greene mentioned it.\n\n“When Marjorie Taylor Greene is saying we need to pass this, you’re idiots if you’re going to go down to a loss because of Donald Trump and Mike Johnson,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), who served in the House with Greene, told The Independent.\n\nGreene’s words come as the government shutdown moved past the week-long mark. Democrats have continued to dig in and opposed Republican attempts to pass a clean continuing resolution despite multiple attempts to reopen the government. \n\nBut Greene has increasingly challenged her own party leadership despite her steadfast devotion to Trump. Earlier this year, she criticized Trump’s decision to conduct military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. \n\nWhen Congress returned from recess in September, she joined a discharge petition from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This came despite the fact that House Speaker Mike Johnson has opposed such efforts.\n\nFurthermore, Greene broke with many in her party in criticizing Israel’s war in Gaza, going farther than many Democrats in accusing Israel of committing a “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nGreene also criticized the fact that the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump initially included a moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence. Though that provision would later be stripped.\n\nDespite her fundraising prowess and status as a Trump loyalist, Greene’s career has stalled. She passed on running for governor of Georgia and running to challenge her state’s other Democratic Sen. Jon Osoff, who is up for re-election next year. \n\nLast year, she filed a motion to vacate Johnson as speaker, which ultimately failed after Democrats and Republicans blocked the effort. \n\nOn Tuesday, Greene doubled down on her criticism. \n\n“Ruroh. MTG broke ranks and told the truth about the seriousness of unaffordable health insurance plaguing Americans,” she said on X. “Launch the same old controlled DC reporters to ask her Republican colleagues questions about her and write articles to frame and isolate her. Go ahead. It always backfires.”\n\nGreene added a laughing emoji to her tweet.","summary":"‘You are going to hear me utter words I never thought I'd say: Marjorie Taylor Greene is right,’ Raphael Warnock tells The Independent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-democrats-obamacare-b2841272.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/24/19/59/GettyImages-2212918465.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wss8sA8C-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-07 23:26:30","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.346},{"id":367156470,"title":"Dolly Parton’s Sister Asks for Prayers Amid Singer’s Health Issues: “She’s Strong”","text":"Skip to main content\n\nOctober 7, 2025 4:23pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nDolly Parton\n\nJason Kempin/Getty Images\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nFreida Parton is asking Dolly Parton‘s fans to help pray for her sister after she postponed her upcoming Las Vegas concerts due to health issues.\n\nFreida took to her Facebook on Tuesday to share an update on the “Jolene” singer, who shared last month that she’s “been dealing with some health challenges” and that her doctors said she needs to “have a few procedures.”\n\n“Last night, I was up all night praying for my sister, Dolly.

Boardman said she was concerned the plotter would have to serve his sentence in a male prison. Roske also got lifetime supervised release after he serves his eight years.\n\nRoske’s motive for going after Kavanaugh and his family was reportedly over the high court’s pending ruling to overturn the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling in 2022. \n\nThe Justice Department argued that a premeditated plot against a Supreme Court justice warranted a severe sentence. The defense countered that Roske, who had planned to commit suicide after committing the planned assassination, stopped and called a family member before calling 911 to turn himself in.\n\n1. Biden Appointee With Criminal Defense Background\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Boardman to the judgeship in March 2021. She was confirmed along a mostly party-line 52-48 vote the following June. \n\nBoardman spent a decade at the Federal Public Defender’s Office for the District of Maryland, spanning 2008 to 2019. For four of those years, she was the first assistant federal public defender.\n\nIn 2019, she became a federal magistrate judge for the District of Maryland. Magistrate judges are appointed by a team of district judges. \n\nBefore working in government, she worked for the law firm Hogan & Hartson in Washington, D.C.\n\n2. LGBTQ+ Ruling Overturned by Supreme Court\n\nIn 2023, Boardman denied a request from parents in Maryland to opt out their children from public school classes where LGBTQ+ books are promoted. \n\nIn June of this year, the Supreme Court reversed Boardman by siding with the parents. \n\nIn the case, a group of Muslim and Christian parents sued the Montgomery County, Maryland, school board over a policy that would not allow parents to opt their children out of the classes. Boardman denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction that would have reinstated a previous policy that allowed for opt-out. \n\nBoardman ruled that mere exposure to ideas contrary to religious beliefs doesn’t constitute a burden on religious exercise, and “that is not indoctrination.” Boardman also wrote that “a constitutional violation is not likely or imminent” and thus “the plaintiffs are not likely to suffer imminent irreparable harm” if the injunction wasn’t granted.\n\nIn her ruling, she said the school board was concerned too many students would opt out. \n\n“The school board was concerned that permitting some students to leave the classroom whenever books featuring LGBTQ characters were used would expose students who believe the books represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation,” Boardman wrote. “The school board believed that would defeat its ‘efforts to ensure a classroom environment that is safe and conducive to learning for all students’ and would risk putting MCPS [Montgomery County Public Schools] out of compliance with state and federal nondiscrimination laws.”\n\n3. Birthright Citizenship Ruling\n\nIn February, Boardman imposed a nationwide preliminary injunction against the enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship. She determined the order conflicted with longstanding legal precedent. \n\nBirthright citizenship is the view that anyone born in the United States, even a child of illegal immigrants, is automatically a U.S. citizen under the 14th Amendment. \n\nUnder Trump’s order, federal agencies would not recognize citizenship for U.S.-born children who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen. \n\nOn Sept. 26, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to hear the merits of the case.\n\n4. Ruling Against DOGE\n\nIn February, Boardman also sided with the American Federation of Teachers, a union, to block the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing information from the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Education regarding student loans. \n\nDOGE was established as a White House office to identify government waste, fraud, and abuse. \n\nBoardman issued a temporary restraining order after the union and other plaintiffs in the case argued that federal agencies should not have granted DOGE access to records with personal information. This was the case of American Federation of Teachers v. Bessent.\n\nBoardman determined DOGE access could violate the 1976 Privacy Act by granting “sweeping access” to the office. \n\nIn August, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the lower court injunction and allowed DOGE and the Treasury Department to proceed. \n\n5. Democrat Donor\n\nBoardman appears to have been a modest political donor to Democrat candidates before she became a judge. \n\nIn October 2007, she was listed as contributing $500 to the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, according to Open Secrets, which tracks money in politics. Open Secrets listed her employer as Hogan & Hartson, a private law firm, at the time of the Clinton donation.\n\nIn June 2008, Boardman is listed as giving $300 to the presidential campaign of Barack Obama and another $200 to Obama that August, according to Open Secrets. Open Secrets listed her employer as the federal public defender.\n\n6. ‘Grave Threat to America’s Energy Security’\n\nIn August 2024, Boardman sided with environmental lobbying groups to block oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, now the Gulf of America. \n\nGroups such as the Sierra Club sued to block an opinion the National Marine Fisheries Service issued to authorize the drilling. Boardman sided with the environmental groups and determined the agency underestimated risks of oil spills and violated the Endangered Species Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. \n\nEnergy Workforce President Tim Tarpley said the ruling was a “potentially grave threat to America’s energy security and economic prosperity.” \n\n“This misguided ruling could shut down oil and gas operations across the Gulf of Mexico and jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in economic activity,” Tarpley said.","summary":"The federal judge who gave a lighter-than-expected sentence to the would-be assassin of Justice Brett Kavanaugh has built up a record for controversial left-leaning rulings...

The SoCal pop rockers have announced their first album in three years and its title is steeped in nostalgia. I Used to Go to This Bar arrives early next year, on Jan. 30, 2026 via Epitaph Records.\n\nThe band — guitarist Barry Johnson, guitarist Chase Knobbe, and bassist Matt Ebert — tapped SoCal legend and Bad Religion co-founder Brett Gurewitz to produce the new LP. “When it comes to our musical DNA, he’s one of the architects of everything we grew up on,” Johnson said about Gurewitz in a statement. “Having him guide our record helped us make something that we could put next to those classic records that shaped us,” Johnson added.\n\n“I always try to work fast and keep things creative and fun,” Gurewitz said in a statement. That vivacious energy is palpable on Joyce Manor’s new song “Well, Whatever It Was.” A beachy thrum about being down and out, the track comes with a playful music video that parodies The Great British Bake Off.\n\n“Everyone was just firing on all cylinders for this one. Joey Warnoker’s drumming, TLA’s mix, and Lenny Castro’s percussion all just sent it to the end-zone. This song would go insanely hard in a Shrek film,” Johnson said of the song.\n\nIn addition to announcing their seventh studio album, Joyce Manor also shared the news of their upcoming tour. The band will hit the U.K. this fall and take I Used to Go to This Bar on the road in the U.S. next spring. Additional tour information is available on their website.\n\nLast year, Joyce Manor celebrated the 10th anniversary of their seminal pop-punk record Never Hungover Again with a five-show celebration. During the Los Angeles show, Mark Hoppus even came out to perform Joyce Manor’s fan-favorite “Heart Tattoo.”\n\nJoyce Manor are also set to perform during Coachella 2026.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nWho Is Anika Nilles?

Newsom is acting like an extortionist. His threat to withhold university funding unless schools publicly oppose President Trump’s demands is political coercion. Public universities should not be strong-armed into adopting the governor’s preferred positions. Their mission is education and open inquiry, not serving as instruments of partisan pressure.\n\nWhat makes this especially troubling is the hypocrisy. Newsom built his political brand by criticizing Trump for using federal funds as a political weapon. Yet now he is employing the same tactic, undermining the consistency and credibility for which he once claimed to stand.\n\nThe state’s future depends on universities that foster debate, discovery and diversity of thought, not on leaders who use financial leverage to demand conformity.\n\nI teach corporate leadership, and I know credibility and consistency are cornerstones of effective governance. Newsom’s two-faced approach erodes confidence in his judgment and his ability to lead.\n\nCurtis Panasuk\n\nICE tactics terrorize\nimmigrant community\n\nThe U.S Supreme Court issued a decision that clears the way for racial profiling during immigration raids and sweeps.

The Latino community has helped build the culture and diversity of the Bay Area. ICE workers wearing masks and preventing people from seeing their faces strip our community of dignity and show an abuse of power.\n\nWhen groups or institutions act and operate without treating people with basic human dignity, the individuals who experience the institution’s power become alienated and dehumanized. Individuals who pose no threat are being pinned down and criminalized by ICE, leaving our Latino community fearful of stepping outside.\n\nImmigrants seeking opportunity and better jobs deserve to be treated with basic human respect and compassion.\n\nKatie Contreras\nRedwood City\n\nAmericans must stand\nagainst ICE aggression\n\nRe: “Using chemical agents, helicopters, ICE increasing aggression” (Page A4, Oct. 6).\n\nThank you for covering last week’s appalling militaristic attack on the residents of a Chicago apartment building. In the dead of night, federal agents dressed for combat rappelled from helicopters, tossed flash-bangs, kicked in apartment doors, trashed apartments, separated young children from their parents, and indiscriminately detained and zip-tied residents, including children and U.S. citizens — all without a warrant.\n\nIn addition to being cruel and inhumane, this violent escalation of force violated the Fourth Amendment, which disallows unreasonable searches and seizures and requires warrants.\n\nI’d urge people of conscience, regardless of political leanings, to strongly object to the vilification of and aggression against U.S. residents. Speak for decency, humanity and a government that abides by the law. Share your objections with friends and family. Contact your elected representatives. And find other ways to express your values. This is no time for silence, passivity or complicity.\n\nBarbara Fukumoto\n\nRaids, shutdown are\n1-2 punch to families\n\nImmigration raids and now a government shutdown generate fear and frustration among families.\n\nField workers who gather crops are constantly concerned about being brought to prison facilities with horrible conditions. Meanwhile, millions of government employees, such as soldiers, are not paid during shutdowns. Essential personnel must continue to work while not receiving pay, while non-essential employees are instructed not to show up. Services that families rely on begin to collapse. WIC and SNAP food assistance are delayed, airports are understaffed and low-income women struggle to get basic services. Daily, children and parents face uncertainty, worry and fear.\n\nIt is unfair that hard-working people have to deal with both anxiety and financial hardship while caring for their families. Constant anxiety, financial difficulties and delays in essential services will make daily life difficult for the community.\n\nStephanie Ortiz-Mancera\n\nACA subsidies aid more\ncitizens than tax cut\n\nRe: “Democrats battling over Biden-era spending” (Page A9, Oct. 5).\n\nThe ACA health insurance marketplaces opened for enrollment on Oct. 1, 2013. Starting in 2014, the ACA has capped health insurance premiums as a percent of income based on a sliding scale, with the federal government absorbing the remainder as a tax credit.\n\nEnhanced tax credits were introduced in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and later extended in 2022 through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act. The GOP did not support either one.\n\nThe premium payments will more than double for many of the 24 million enrollees if enhanced ACA subsidies are not extended. Three out of four ACA enrollees live in states where Donald Trump won.\n\nThe top 1% of wage earners will get tax cuts of $117 billion a year, while the ACA subsidies would cost just $35 billion.

Another siren marked the anniversary of the day when about 1,200 people were killed during the cross-border assault.\n\nAnd throughout the morning, there were the booms and thuds of artillery and airstrikes landing a few miles away in Gaza, its brutalised residents desperate for it all to stop.\n\nThis year, Israel’s Government elected not to hold a State ceremony on October 7, because it coincided with the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. But many gathered anyhow, in the border communities that were attacked, and in the squares in Israeli cities that have become sites of solidarity and protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his failure to end the war and free hostages held by Hamas.\n\nIf Tuesday’s anniversary offered a clarion call, it was this: people on both sides of the border, in Israel and Gaza, saying enough was enough.\n\n“Two years of war is something terrible, terrible, terrible,” said Pnina Russo, whose son Uri, an engineer, was killed while defending Kfar Aza during the attack in 2023.\n\nYareen Abu Naja, 44, who spent Tuesday as she did every day in Gaza, scrambling for food for her family, said, “enough of this injustice and indignity … enough of this war,” her voice cracking.\n\nThe last two years in Gaza - with tens of thousands of people killed during the Israeli military campaign, and entire neighbourhoods levelled - had passed “as if they are 100 years,” Abu Naja said.\n\nThe backdrop to Tuesday’s commemorations is negotiations to end the war in Gaza, underway in Egypt.\n\nIn Israel, Mr Netanyahu faces pressure from opposing sides: Most Israelis would like to end the war, according to recent polls, and protesters regularly march to call for a hostage deal, while far-right members of his governing coalition have threatened to bring down the Government if Israel agrees to a peace deal.\n\nMr Netanyahu is also facing a reckoning from abroad, as Israel grows more isolated.\n\nThe country’s allies and neighbours are pushing for the kind of permanent resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - a pathway toward a Palestinian state - that Mr Netanyahu has opposed. And a growing number of academics and human rights organisations say Israel’s military campaign in Gaza meets the legal definition of genocide, adding to pressure for its immediate end.\n\nHamas, in recent days, said it would accept US President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan and release all Israeli hostages it was holding, subject to conditions and further talks.\n\nIn Kfar Aza, once a town of 400 people and among the closest to the Gaza border, MS Russo remembered her son Uri as beautiful, smart - “really, a wonderful person.”\n\n“I miss him very much,” she said.\n\nBut she was heartbroken, too, at the continuation of the war, not just the fighting in Gaza, but at the divisions in her own country over the conflict - the “situation between the people,” Ms Russo said. “It has to change.”\n\n“I think about the children in Gaza; they are inside all this mess,” she said. “Really, it’s hard for the mother in us.”\n\nShe did not know whether to place her faith in Mr Trump. He was “not the person” to trust with peace, but on the other hand, Mr Trump had the power to move Mr Netanyahu, who has frequently indicated his preference for continuing the war.\n\n“You have to be optimistic,” Ms Russo said. “To continue to believe it will change.”\n\nIn Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Rotem Cooper, 59, signalled hope in the negotiations taking place in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh, with reservations.\n\nHis parents, Nurit and Amiram, were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz in the October 2023 attack. Nurit, his mother, was released after 17 days; Israel’s army said in June 2024 that Amiram had been killed in captivity.\n\n“We’ve been in that road of false hope, many times,” Mr Cooper said. “I’m trying to be very careful to raise hopes again, although it is looking more promising,” he added, saying that he was “appreciative” of Trump’s ceasefire efforts.\n\nHis own government was not “exactly interested, or at least there is an element in the Government, including the Prime Minister, that is not truly interested, in the release of the hostages,” he said.\n\n“They prefer to continue the war, and having the hostages there is a great reason to continue the war.”\n\nIn Dizengoff Square, another memorial site about half a mile away, Naama Lazimi, an opposition member of Parliament and one of the government’s most outspoken critics, said the fact that the hostages had not yet been released - and that there had been no Government commission of inquiry into the October 7 attack - was a “moral disgrace for the state, for a society”.\n\nRegarding the negotiations to end the war, “people here are full of hope.” But the Government’s priority was “political survival, and it will do everything to sabotage the deal,” she added.\n\n“The Trump administration is working to bring Israeli citizens back to recovery and for burial, while the Israeli government is working to sabotage it. It’s a sick situation that harms us as a society and as a nation,” she said.\n\nFor Iman Al- Ijla, 23, who was staying with family friends west of Gaza City during an Israeli military offensive there, October 7 was a “painful and heartbreaking memory.”\n\n“We’ve been displaced for two years now and constantly on the move every single day, with no electricity, no internet and no real sense of normal life all this time.” Life had been “long days and longer nights,” she said.\n\nDozens of her family members and friends had been killed over the past two years. They included 20 relatives killed in an Israeli airstrike on their home in southern Gaza in the summer of 2024. “They were innocent people, with no connection to the resistance,” she said. “Still, I’m holding on to hope about the talks in Egypt this time.”\n\n“This has to end. Enough is enough.”\n\nYamen Adwan, 26, who is living in a displacement camp in Khan Younis, said there was nothing left of his old life after two years of war. Israeli forces destroyed his home in the city of Rafah. He lost his job as a nurse as the health care system collapsed. Three of his closest friends have been killed.\n\nHe lives with seven family members in a tent. They rely on donated water and food from soup kitchens. He used to go to a site run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to fight for food but stopped a month and a half ago after being injured by shrapnel.\n\n“My life is hell,” he said in a message on WhatsApp. “The future is lost, love is lost, life is lost, our dreams are lost. I feel nostalgic for home, for my memories before the war, for my friends who all died, and for the streets of my city.”\n\nAcross the border, as night fell on Monday, the eve of the October 7 anniversary, Alex Tavgen Goldman, 51, and his wife Natalie, 48, arrived to tend to the memorial site of their daughter, Katerina Tavgen Goldman, who was killed at the Nova music festival, one of the first targets of the Hamas militants as they launched their cross-border attack. Outgoing artillery fire shook the place.\n\n“It feels like a giant cemetery here; the ground is soaked with blood,” Mr Goldman said. His wife knelt on the ground by a tree they planted two years ago, a sapling now about five feet tall, its roots plunging deeper into the soil every day of the war.\n\nTheir daughter’s photograph was framed on a metal stake, among a small forest of others who were killed on Oct 7.\n\n“There’s nothing to say, it’s hard,” Mrs Goldman said. “Two years - the time went by quickly.”\n\n“The heart hurts.”\n\nSoroka reported from Tel Aviv, Berger from Jaffa, Israel, and Fahim from Istanbul.

In each case, he has done so despite staunch opposition from mayors and governors from the Democratic Party, who say Trump’s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality.\n\nA federal judge in September said the Republican-led administration “willfully” broke federal law by putting Guard troops in Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said the president’s strategy is “unconstitutional, it’s illegal and it’s dangerous”.\n\nIllinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to block orders to federalise 300 Illinois Guard troops and send Texas Guard troops to Chicago. During a hearing, US Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge that Texas Guard troops were already in transit to Illinois.\n\nThe judge, April Perry, permitted the deployment to proceed for now, but ordered the US government to file a response by Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, a federal judge in Oregon on Sunday temporarily blocked the administration from sending any troops to police Portland, the state’s largest city.\n\nThe Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its escalation in immigration enforcement.\n\n“These Democrats are, like, insurrectionists, OK?” the president said Tuesday. “They’re so bad for our country. Their policy is so bad for our country.”\n\nOfficials in Illinois and Oregon, however, say military intervention isn’t needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, accused Trump of intentionally trying to foment violence, which the president could then use to justify further militarisation.\n\n“Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarise our nation’s cities,” Pritzker said on Monday.\n\n“There is no insurrection in Portland. No threat to national security,” Democratic Oregon Governor Tina Kotek has said.\n\nWhat is the Insurrection Act, and can Trump invoke it?\n\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump made it clear that he’s considering invoking the Insurrection Act to clear the way for him to send soldiers to US cities.\n\n“We have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that,” Trump said on Monday.\n\nThe federal law dates back to 1807 and gives the US president the power to deploy the military or federalise National Guard troops anywhere in the US to restore order during an insurrection.\n\nConstitutional lawyer Bruce Fein told Al Jazeera that presidential powers under the act apply only in cases of major rebellion, equivalent to the US Civil War, where normal law enforcement and courts can’t function. However, Fein added that it is unclear whether a president’s declaration of insurrection can be challenged in court.\n\n“Congress, however, could impeach and remove Trump for misuse of the act in Portland,” Fein said, adding that military law obligates personnel to disobey orders that are clearly unlawful.\n\nHe said Trump’s use of the act in Portland would be “clearly illegal” even if it cannot be challenged in court.\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked in response to 30 incidents, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe last time it was invoked was in 1992, in response to riots in Los Angeles by Republican President George HW Bush.","summary":"Troops arrive despite active legal challenges from Chicago and the state of Illinois in the courts.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/7/us-national-guard-troops-arrive-in-illinois-as-trump-escalates-crackdown?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-07 22:56:37","author":"Abby Rogers,Apps Support","authors":["Abby Rogers","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.558},{"id":367161330,"title":"Pam Bondi Grilled by Senator Over Alleged Trump-Epstein Compromising Photos","text":"Trump and Epstein were once friends and, according to the Wall Street Journal, Trump purportedly gave Epstein a cryptic letter for his 50th birthday signed by \"Donald\" with a drawing of a naked woman.
