Our fire hydrants were empty. \n\n'Our vegetation was overgrown, brush not cleared. Our reservoirs were emptied by our governor because tribal leaders wanted to save fish. \n\nOur fire department budget was cut by our mayor. But thank god drug addicts are getting their drug kits. RESIGN. Your far left policies have ruined our state. And also our party.'\n\nFormer Dancing with the Stars professional dancer Valentin Chmerkovskiy also expressed his dissatisfaction on social media.\n\n'5th largest economy on the planet. Firefighters didn't have enough water pressure to do their job?! Are you joking me?! The taxes we pay for 3rd world infrastructure is unbelievable?! Come on. \n\nActor James Woods also blasted the mayor, blaming her and California Governor Gavin Newsom for the fire.\n\n'This fire is not from 'climate change,' you ignorant a**hole. It's because liberal idiots like you elect liberal idiots like Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass. \n\n'One doesn't understand the first thing about fire management and the other can't fill the water reservoirs', he wrote.\n\nThe death toll of the historic infernos have now reached six, as heroic firefighters still battle hellish conditions on the front lines of at least five different fires.\n\nOfficials have warned that they expect those figures to climb as they continue to grapple with the infernos.\n\nA new fire prompted evacuations Thursday in and around Los Angeles even as firefighters aided by calmer winds saw the first signs of successfully beating back the region’s deadly and devastating wildfires, while the enormity of the devastation started to emerge.\n\nThe Kenneth Fire started in the late afternoon in the San Fernando Valley near the West Hills neighborhood and close to Ventura County. The evacuation order covered parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties.\n\nAccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, on Thursday increased its estimate of the damage and economic loss to $135-$150 billion.\n\nPreviously, the company had estimated the damage could reach $57 billion.\n\nAlready, 600 service members have arrived from the Cal Guard along with equipment to help local authorities. They brought 10 rotary wing aircrafts and two C-130 planes to help fight the fires.\n\nRoughly 400,000 customers statewide were without power as of Thursday, according to the tracker PowerOutage.us. \n\nNearly 180,000 residents are under evacuation orders, per officials. \n\nThe fires have ripped areas apart, turning the picturesque neighborhoods into smoldering ash-laden sites. \n\nPushed on by powerful winds, the two major fires have wiped out around 10,000 structures and scorched famous landmarks that stood in its path.\n\nThe homes of Anthony Hopkins, John Goodman and Miles Teller are among those destroyed, while dozens of other stars now face an anxious wait alongside their neighbors to learn if anything could be saved.\n\nMandy Moore, Cary Elwes, Paris Hilton, James Woods, Billy Crystal and his wife Janice all claimed to have seen their homes go up in smoke in the Palisades Fire. \n\nLA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley believes the fire started accidentally in a back garden around 10am Tuesday morning.\n\nShe told reporters the fire is 'spreading at a speed beyond anything we've seen... it's now unlike anything we have seen in our lifetime.' \n\n20 people have also been arrested on suspicion of raiding homes in parts of Southern California during the blazes. \n\nSheriff of Los Angeles County Robert Luna mentioned in a Wednesday press conference that two people had been arrested for looting.\n\nHe said: 'It's always sad when I have to say this, but part of our responsibility is to make sure no one loots or steals from our residents or our community members who are already being impacted.\n\n'And I'm sad to report we made two arrests this morning for looting. So if you are thinking about coming into any of these areas to steal from our residents, I'm going to tell you something: You're going to be caught, you're going to be arrested and you're going to be prosecuted.'\n\nOn Thursday, Kathryn Barger, chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said the sheriff's department had now arrested 20 people for looting or burglary.\n\nThe rise in cases has caused a number of residents of the Pacific Palisades neighborhood to hire a private security firm to watch their homes. \n\nMore than 1,500 California firefighters are tasked with quelling the wind-whipped wildfires, while the California National Guard prepares to deploy more military personnel to assist.","summary":"Joe Biden claimed that Los Angeles fire hydrants hadn't run dry because of a water shortage but due to power being cut to water pumps due to the killer wildfires.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14268623/biden-reveals-reason-la-fire-hydrants-dry-gavin-newsom-karen-bass-criticism.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/10/00/93939321-0-Joe_Biden_claimed_that_Los_Angeles_fire_hydrants_hadn_t_run_dry_-a-11_1736470441230.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/09/6233172454452905592/1024x576_MP4_6233172454452905592.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-10 01:01:43","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

On Dec. 3, President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, seemingly as part of an attempted self-coup. Several hours later the National Assembly managed to convene a plenary session to revoke the martial law decree. The ensuing 10 days were marked by political chaos, including a failed National Assembly vote to impeach Yoon, arrests and impeachments of government ministers and a leadership vacuum in the president’s office. On Dec. 14, Yoon was finally impeached by the National Assembly and suspended from his duties. \n\nThis did not stabilize the situation. Acting President Han Duck-soo was impeached on Dec. 27, after refusing to confirm the nominations of three Constitutional Court justices necessary to provide legitimacy for its ruling on Yoon’s impeachment. On Dec. 30, a Seoul court issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, who is accused of insurrection by a joint investigative body (the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, prosecutors and police). A Jan. 3 attempt to serve the warrant at the presidential residence led to an armed standoff between law enforcement and the Presidential Security Service (PSS). Acting President Choi Sang-mok has apparently refused to order the PSS to stand down. Social tension is also high, as pro- and anti-Yoon supporters gather daily in the streets. In short, South Korea is in a profound institutional political crisis. South Korea’s status as a liberal democratic upholder of domestic rule of law is under threat.\n\nThe U.S. response to all of this has been underwhelming. Aside from a Dec. 5 statement by Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell calling Yoon’s actions “illegitimate,” the Biden administration has not volunteered public condemnation of Yoon’s apparent self-coup via martial law, the leadership vacuum from Dec. 3 to 13 (when a triumvirate of Han Duck-soo, Han Dong-hoon and Yoon attempted to run state affairs) or Yoon’s seeming violation of the rule of law in resisting arrest for the insurrection charges. Mostly, Biden’s team has called for “stability,” repeated a mantra invoking the “ironclad” nature of the U.S.-South Korea alliance and offered bromides hoping that South Korea would resolve its crisis by constitutional processes. \n\nPerhaps private communication between the Biden administration and South Korean leaders has been more forceful in insisting on holding Yoon accountable and restoring South Korea to normal liberal democratic functioning of its constitutional order. But there is not much evidence for this. Rather, the U.S. has prioritized pretending that things are business as usual. In early January, the allies agreed to “fully resume” normal diplomatic and security activities. For example, the U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Consultative Group has been reactivated following its brief postponement after the martial law declaration. Secretary of State Antony Blinken — who was in Seoul this week for meetings as though nothing unusual had happened — released a readout that made no mention of South Korea’s political situation. His response to a direct question about the U.S. position on Yoon’s actions vaguely referenced private intergovernmental discussions before pivoting to boilerplate about democratic resilience. Despite a shocking breach of liberal democracy, Seoul has faced the bare minimum of consequences from its supposed “democratic values-based partner.” Why?\n\nThe diplomatic answer is that it would be inappropriate for the U.S. to interfere in the domestic affairs of another state. This is nonsense — the U.S. has a long history of influencing the internal affairs of allies and adversaries alike. A second, charitable interpretation is that the outgoing Biden administration believes it cannot do much about South Korea’s democracy crisis anyway. Indeed, the Donald Trump administration takes office on Jan. 20 and is likely to devalue democracy as a factor in its foreign relations. Perhaps correctly, the Biden team might have figured that it would not have leverage to affect South Korean politics. Yet another possibility is that the Biden administration simply does not care as much about democratic values as it has claimed over the last four years of emphasizing “values-based diplomacy.” Major powers are no strangers to hypocrisy.\n\nSouth Korean leaders and the general public may consider themselves fortunate to have avoided significant public censure from the Biden administration. This is short-sighted. \n\nFirst, in the short term, Seoul needs the Biden administration to clarify that the unconstitutional use of the military in the service of martial law threatens the alliance, and that a return to robust democratic constitutional order is critical to maintaining “ironclad” U.S.-South Korea relations. Continuing down the current path of chaos makes it easier for the Trump administration to sell a U.S. Forces Korea drawdown, or even alliance rupture, to a U.S. Congress and public otherwise supportive of the alliance. \n\nSecond, and more importantly, South Korea’s hard-won democracy has been regressing for nearly a decade, and the current situation represents a dramatic worsening of the trend. Moreover, the country is deeply polarized politically, which will be exacerbated by the ongoing constitutional crisis. In turn, greater political division will make harder the political institutional reforms required to strengthen South Korea’s democracy. Seoul needs the jolt of its ally telling it some hard truths. This might sting, but it would make clear where South Korea’s interests lie, and encourage political compromise and unity. \n\nThese words are unlikely to be offered, and South Korea will be worse off for it.\n\nMason Richey is a professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, president of the Korea International Studies Association and editor-in-chief of the Journal of East Asian Affairs.","summary":"Since my last column in early December, South Korea has experienced massive political turmoil.

The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election, and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public, arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the documents case, to block the Justice Department from releasing the report. Separately, the president-elect's lawyers urged Garland in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter, leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days, though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief, it could file a notice of appeal.In filings with the 11th Circuit, the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public, but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.In their own filing with the 11th Circuit, defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and, in the meantime, prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" they wrote.Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"","summary":"Special counsel Jack Smith submitted his final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/appeals-court-jack-smith-final-report/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/30/f824a5c6-b274-4dc9-90b8-e2a939527789/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ba23f144587aea61f2d48d349b88e0b2/gettyimages-2167993353.jpg?v=c32e88638f4c371ec40100fff0bc2158","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3454043_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:59:37","author":"Melissa Quinn,Robert Legare","authors":["Melissa Quinn","Robert Legare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.416},{"id":279678396,"title":"Awkward ghosting and a death stare: The curious dynamics at Jimmy Carter’s funeral","text":"A rare moment of unity in a divided America.

Rather than just saving individual buildings, they are now trying to stop the overall advance of the flames.\n“Tuesday and Wednesday our priority was saving lives and protecting as much property as possible,” says LA Fire Department spokesperson Margaret Stewart. “Now that we’re able to operate at our full capacity, we’re able to have a more powerful assault.”\nIn a two-pronged attack, aircraft have ramped up dousing the fires from the air while firefighters and bulldozers starve them of fuel on the ground. At times earlier in the week, planes had to be grounded because of the severity of the wind.\n“I would say [the tide] is turning,” says Ken Pimlott, former director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “Today and tomorrow are really the key windows to get through, the red flag fire weather conditions. Then I think we’ll start to see much more progress.”\nMassive fires began clawing through the Los Angeles metropolitan area on Tuesday thanks to a combination of longstanding drought and a bout of strong Santa Ana winds, seasonal air that blows from the high desert of Nevada and Utah into southern California.\nThe Palisades Fire east of Malibu, which has burned almost 20,000 acres, was 0 percent contained on Thursday. Celebrities like Billy Crystal and Paris Hilton were among the many people who had lost their homes. The Eaton Fire in Pasadena, roughly 25 miles to the east, was also uncontained, but the fire department has been able to slow its growth. The Sunset Fire that started in the Hollywood Hills on Wednesday was quickly hemmed in, and two others are partially contained.\n“The only fire that has that potential [to grow] is Palisades, and we have 1,100 people on that,” Stewart says.\nThe key factor has been the winds of up to 99 miles per hour. They’ve been raking down from the northeast to the southwest, fanning the flames and throwing burning embers half a mile in front of the main fire. Canyons running largely the same direction have funneled and intensified that movement of air, creating what Pimlott called a “blowtorch” that spread the Palisades Fire. The flames have been essentially unstoppable.\n“These pressurized winds literally explode out of these canyons,” says Janet Upton, former deputy director of Cal Fire. “All you can do is work to get anything with a heartbeat out of the way.”\nBut the winds began easing up on Wednesday and Thursday. They were anticipated to reach 15–20 miles per hour Thursday afternoon, before ticking up to 30–40 miles per hour on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. Firefighters that were helpless against virtually unstoppable wind-driven blazes have been able to return to their normal tactics.\n“With those winds being very calm this morning, I believe we can actually make some progress, turn a corner, and start to build some containment on these fires,” Brent Pascua, a Cal Fire battalion chief, told the Today Show on Thursday.\nSo far the disaster response has been marred by disinformation and controversy. After some fire hydrants ran dry, president-elect Donald Trump baselessly accused California governor Gavin Newsom of mismanaging the state’s water supplies to save an endangered fish.\nCity employees have now been able to reach three water tanks on hills near the Palisades Fire to turn up the pressure. That allows the tanks to be refilled more quickly so they can keep supplying the hydrants, Stewart says. Each tank can hold 1 million gallons. “We have full flowing hydrants,” she says.\nMore firefighters have begun to arrive from Utah, Oregon, Arizona, Washington, and New Mexico. Several dozen task forces are on their way, according to Stewart, each with five fire engines plus a command vehicle.\nAircraft began flying again on Wednesday. Twelve helicopters are filling humongous water buckets hanging from cables and sucking seawater up through snorkels. Six planes are also working the fires, including a pair of “super scoop” aircraft that have been skimming across the surface of the Pacific to pick up water. The helicopters and scoop planes dump water on spot fires, letting firefighters close in and extinguish them.\nMeanwhile, other airplanes are dropping fire retardant out ahead of the inferno, coating potential fuel with a layer of non-flammable chemicals and slowing its advance. A C-130 cargo plane that Cal Fire acquired from the Coast Guard and retrofitted this summer can dump 4,000 gallons of retardant. That buys time for firefighters to dig and bulldoze firebreaks of bare soil.\nWith the ocean constraining the Palisades Fire to the south, responders will try to prevent it from breaking out to the east or west. “The real spread is going to be on the flank,” Pimlott says.\nA red flag warning for increased fire risk will remain through Friday, with humidity at only 8–12% percent. California has been suffering an abnormally dry winter, with 40 percent of the state under drought conditions.\n“Fuels remain critically dry,” James Magana of Cal Fire said at a Thursday morning briefing. “You can expect to see critical rates of spread, especially on those ridgetops or those drainages that are in alignment with the wind.”\nOn Saturday, the winds are expected to reverse direction. If firefighters aren’t ready, the heel of the fire could become the front and run off to the north.\nEven once they’re able to contain the conflagration within a circle of firebreaks and natural barriers, that won’t be the end of the task. Firefighters will have to stamp out smaller fires within that footprint.\n“That’s a critical stage, to mop up these hotspots or anything that could rekindle if the winds were to increase again,” Upton says.\nMoving forward, the city will need to clean up debris, restore utilities, and analyze damage to the environment before allowing people to move back. With canyons depleted of the trees and vegetation that hold the soil, mudslides could become a threat once the rains return.\nLos Angeles will face the prospect of rebuilding destroyed communities. That’s an opportunity to make them less vulnerable to the next fire, says Max Moritz, a wildfire specialist with the University of California Cooperative Extension.\nAlthough houses are in many cases required to be built with fire-resistant materials, California law doesn’t say anything about how they should be laid out. Techniques like clustering homes rather than spreading them out among the trees can make them easier to defend from fire, and easier to evacuate, he says.\n“That is part of the hope here, is that we can do some of this better, smarter and safer,” Moritz says.","summary":"With wind speeds falling, firefighting reinforcements arriving from out of state, and more water sources online, authorities now have a critical window to take control of the situation.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/the-tide-could-finally-be-turning-against-the-la-fires/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/677ffe68378e2da0c244a1fd/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/fire-LA-sci-2192329131.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:52:23","author":"Alec Luhn","authors":["Alec Luhn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":279678112,"title":"TikTok Says It Will Shut Down In U.S. by Jan. 19 Unless Supreme Court Strikes Down or Delays Ban","text":"In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.\n\n TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok’s sale by its Chinese parent company.\n\n Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a “political resolution” and avoid deciding the case. It’s unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect’s views — a highly unusual attempt to influence a case — into account.\n\n TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution’s free speech guarantee.\n\n “Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,” lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.\n\n The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.\n\n The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that “no one can seriously dispute that (China’s) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.”\n\n Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok’s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.\n\n But the government “concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,” TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.\n\n In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.\n\n Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.\n\n In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.\n\n “President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government — concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,” D. John Sauer, Trump’s choice to be his administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.\n\n Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump’s campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.\n\n The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration’s defense of the law, while Trump’s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.\n\n If the law takes effect, Trump’s Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law’s most severe consequences.\n\n But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.\n\n As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.\n\n TikTok, the app’s users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.\n\n But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.\n\n A decision could come within days.\n\n This story was originally published by The Associated Press.","summary":"The nation's highest court will hear arguments Friday (Jan. 10) over a law aimed at forcing the platform's sale by its Chinese parent company ByteDance.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/tiktok-shut-down-us-unless-supreme-court-stops-ban/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tiktik-phone-keyboard-2024-billboard-pro-1260.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:49:41","author":"Associated Press,Chris Eggertsen","authors":["Associated Press","Chris Eggertsen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":279678128,"title":"Supreme Court rejects Trump’s bid to delay sentencing in hush money case","text":"Washington: A divided US Supreme Court has rejected President-elect Donald Trump’s bid to delay his sentencing in his hush money case in New York.\n\nThe court’s 5-4 order clears the way for Judge Juan Merchan to impose a sentence on Friday (Saturday AEDT) on Trump, who was convicted in what prosecutors called an attempt to cover up a $US130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels.

Nothing outrageous is being proposed.”\n\nMusk was doubling down on his endorsement last month of the anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labeled as right-wing-extremist by German security services, which has caused consternation in Berlin and accusations of undue influence.\n\nThe AfD has almost no chance of forming a government despite polling in second place as other parties refuse to work with it. Still, critics worry that Musk‘s support for the AfD could further bolster its popularity, eroding support for mainstream parties and making it harder for them to form a coherent coalition. Musk‘s endorsement of the AfD and increasingly vocal support for far-right and anti-establishment parties across Europe comes after he last year used X and his vast wealth to help Republican candidate Donald Trump win the November 5 presidential election.\n\nSpeaking in fluent English, Weidel expressed gratitude for Musk‘s support, saying that the opportunity to speak with Musk was the first time in 10 years that she had been allowed a platform to say her piece without interruption from a media world that, she said, was biased against her.\n\nWhile the two touched on policy, agreeing that Germany’s decision to exit nuclear power was “crazy” and that immigration was out of control, they were more animated when discussing abstract matters.\n\nAsked by Musk to dispel any concerns that her party might be similar to Hitler’s Nazis, Weidel said the genocidal dictator “was a communist” whereas hers was a “conservative libertarian” party.\n\n“The biggest success (of other parties) after that terrible era in our history was to label Adolf Hitler as right and conservative. He was exactly the opposite. He wasn’t a conservative, he wasn’t a libertarian. He was a communist socialist guy,” she said.\n\nAlmost all historians agree that Hitler, an eliminationist nationalist, was of the far-right.\n\nMusk has defended his right to weigh in on German politics because of his “significant investments,” namely Tesla’s first European plant, and has praised the AfD’s approach to regulation, taxes and market deregulation.\n\nMusk recalled the bureaucratic hurdles that confronted him in opening the German Tesla plant.\n\n“I think it was 25,000 pages was our permit. And it had to be all printed on paper,” Musk said. “And then there has to be many, many copies made. So it literally was a truck of paper.” Last August, Musk held a similar talk with Trump, who has since tasked the entrepreneur with leading a drive to make U.S. government more efficient.\n\nWeidel led the second half of the conversation, inviting Musk to explain his vision for peace in Ukraine, the colonisation of Mars and the concept of God. On the latter two points, Musk was forthcoming, but he declined to be drawn on Ukraine, saying a settlement was a matter for Trump.\n\nOn energy, Musk backed Germany’s renewable ambitions but agreed with Weidel that turning off the nuclear power plants was a bad idea.\n\n“When I saw that Germany was turning off the power plants after being cut off from gas supplies from Russia, I thought ... this is one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen,” he said.\n\nLeaders across Europe have expressed alarm over Musk‘s political activities in recent days, with some urging the EU to use its laws more robustly to guard the continent’s democracies from outside influence.\n\nThe European Commission has said it will look at the discussion as part of its ongoing probe into X and possible violations of its Digital Services Act for potentially giving preferential treatment to “certain types of content.”\n\nMusk has in recent weeks targeted the UK’s Labour government with a series of social media attacks centred on grooming gangs after Labour’s decision to decline a Whitehall-led inquiry into child sexual abuse in Oldham.\n\nHe has accused home office minister Jess Phillips of being a “rape genocide apologist” who “deserves to be in prison” and also claimed prime minister Sir Keir Starmer is complicit in the scandal and criticised his handling of it while he was director of public prosecutions.","summary":"Tech billionaire tells Germans to vote for far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in upcoming election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/elon-musk-afd-germany-interview-b2676965.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/09/15/SEI235441856.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/oRenA8Ag-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:46:29","author":"Sarah Marsh","authors":["Sarah Marsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.163},{"id":279679300,"title":"‘Pizzagate’ gunman fatally shot by police during traffic stop","text":"A man who became know as the “Pizzagate” gunman died earlier this week after he was fatally shot by North Carolina police who had pulled him over in a traffic stop, authorities reported Thursday.\n\nThe dead man, Edgar Maddison Welch, was charged years ago in 2016 after brandishing an assault weapon and revolver at a Washington D.C. pizza shop at the center of the notorious fake “Pizzazgate” conspiracy theory that the restaurant was the headquarters of a child sex-trafficking ring run by Democrats. \n\nWelch had driven from his North Carolina home then to hunt for Hillary Clinton. He was sentenced to four years in prison for assault with a dangerous weapon, and interstate transport of firearms. \n\nLast Saturday night an Kannapolis police officer recognized Welch’s car and pulled it over over because Welch had an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony probation violation, officials reported. When the officer opened the car door to arrest the 36-year-old man, he pulled a gun, said authorities The arresting officer and a second officer shot the Pizzagate gunman when he refused orders to drop the weapon, according to a police statement.\n\nWelch was rushed to a local hospital but died of his injuries two days later. City of Kannapolis communications director Annette Privette Keller confirmed Welch was involved in the “Pizzagate” incident.\n\nNone of the three officers on the scene, the vehicle’s driver, or a third passenger in a back seat were injured. The officers who fired on Welch have been placed on administration leave as the shooting is further investigated.\n\nThe confrontation marked a bloody end to one of the most notorious anti-Democrat conspiracy theories that kicked off an era of increasingly wild, completely false political fantasies. Pizzagate conspiracists claimed Hillary Clinton and her then-presidential campaign manager in her race against now President-elect Donald Trump were involved in the satanic nest of child sex-traffickers\n\nThey cited leaked emails between the two that were actually conversations about an possible upcoming political fundraiser at the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong pizzeria, which the conspiracy theorists insisted were in “code.”\n\nWhen Welch stormed the restaurant brandishing his weapons, families with children fled for their lives. He searched for members or any evidence of the ring, but found nothing because it didn’t exist. He fired once into the door of a closet at the restaurant, but no one was injured. \n\nHe said after his arrest that the information he read in extremist news and social media sites that “the intel on this was not 100 percent.”\n\n“I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,” Welch later told The New York Times in an interview. “I regret how I handled the situation.”\n\nThe restaurant became the targeted of a deluge of death threats and staff and customer harassment as the fake conspiracy circulated.\n\nThe restaurant’s owner, James Alefantis, told The New York Times at the time: “From this insane, fabricated conspiracy theory, we’ve come under constant assault.

One of the chapters is titled \"The Case For Letting Malibu Burn\". In it, he argued that the area between the beach and the Santa Monica Mountains simply never should have been developed. No matter what measures we take to prevent it, those hills are going to burn, and the houses we erect upon them are only so much kindling.California's binary wet/dry seasonal cycle means rain in the winter, which feeds the growth of chaparral and sage in the hills and coastal mountains, followed by dry summer heat, which turns that biomass into fuel for wildfires. In Los Angeles, add to that mix the warm Santa Ana winds, which sweep into the basin of the San Fernando Valley and are then channeled into the canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains, reaching hurricane-level velocities in the process. Then add human settlement, and all of the millions of opportunities it presents to produce a spark. The likelihood of a disaster like this happening is, in Davis' words, \"a statistical certainty.\"Pointing to urban development as the culprit at a time like this feels a lot like blaming the victim. But it's more honest than the many other culprits being trotted out on social media, like DEI, Gavin Newsom, or Donald Trump. Certainly, there is blame to go around—Mayor Karen Bass shouldn't have been in Ghana; we need to know why the fire hydrants went dry; climate change exacerbates the natural conditions that produce the wildfires in the first place. But the fundamental engine for these disasters is the simple, physical reality of California, which prevailed before any of us were born: We built a massive civilization in a place where fire is as much a part of the natural habitat as summer rains are in the east.Anyone who has lived in L.A. for more than a year has experienced either a season of active wildfires or a season of worrying about whether they would come. Joan Didion has written about it. The area around Pacific Palisades, in particular, has been on fire countless times before. There was a huge conflagration in Malibu in 1929. Then 1930 and 1935. Then 1938 and 1943, and so on, averaging two per decade up to the current day.There's a reason this happens so much in Los Angeles: It is unique among American cities for the degree to which it directly abuts wild nature. Older cities grew more gradually. Around the urban core of cities like Boston, Atlanta, or St. Louis emerged suburbs, around them exurbs, and around them rural agricultural zones. Only then do you reach wild forests, mountains or prairies.Los Angeles grew up in a hurry. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, development occurred so rapidly that urban and suburban density extends unabated all the way up until it collides into wildlands. A long portion of the city's perimeter is fenced in by the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains. Dense residential neighborhoods and freeways sit directly beneath towering bluffs populated by mountain lions, which occasionally hop the fences of backyard swimming pools to feast on domestic cats and dogs. Where New York has its meticulously designed Central Park, Los Angeles has Griffith Park, a sprawling expanse of wild mountain terrain right in the middle of the city.These abrupt borders between nature and city are called\n\"wildland-urban interfaces,\" and they're inherently volatile. Man-made sparks from homeless encampments, discarded cigarettes, and downed power lines easily ignite wildfires, while brush fires that start from natural causes like lightning easily make the leap into residential areas and become urban conflagrations.The pattern of residential development that has yielded these interfaces isn't limited to Southern California. In 2018, the Camp Fire in Northern California's rural Butte County started as a human-ignited forest fire, but ended up killing dozens and displacing thousands because towns like Paradise were carved out of the landscape and were edged up directly against the forests.People should be held accountable for the mistakes they make in forest management, climate emissions, or reckless behavior with flammable objects. But the hazards of California's built environment are nobody's fault, or at least no one who is still alive. Many of the state's wildland-urban interfaces are the result of residential developments that began in the nineteenth century or the first half of the twentieth.This is the tinderbox we inherited. This will not be the last time we watch it burn.Leighton Woodhouse is a journalist and documentary filmmaker based in Oakland, California.

This will make the GOP’s hold over government complete, since it retained control of the House after the election. It’s also seen as a commitment by Senate Republicans to prioritize crypto legislation and support Trump&apos;s campaign promise of making America the crypto epicenter of the world. The creation of the crypto subcommittee is one of South Carolina Senator Tim Scott’s first orders of business as the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees banks and financial regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). TRUMP NOMINATES PAUL ATKINS TO LEAD SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Scott is hoping to emulate the success of the crypto subcommittee in the lower chamber established in 2023 by former North Carolina Congressman Patrick McHenry. Last year, the House Financial Services Committee made history by passing a piece of crypto legislation drafted by the digital assets subcommittee called the \"FIT21\" bill, which aimed to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. The bill still needs to be presented to the full House of Representatives for a debate and vote and, if passed, advance to the Senate. CRYPTO INDUSTRY AWAITS TRUMP&apos;S CFTC CHAIR PICK News of the new Senate subcommittee was first reported by Punchbowl News and confirmed to FOX Business by two Senate aides. The aides also confirmed that Scott has tentatively selected Republican Senator from Wyoming Cynthia Lummis, a bitcoin advocate, to chair the subcommittee pending an approval vote which will take place in the coming days. Republican members tentatively tapped for the subcommittee, according to an internal memo issued by Scott and viewed by FOX Business, include freshman Senators Bernie Moreno from Ohio and Dave McCormick from Pennsylvania as well as Thom Tillis from North Carolina and Tennessee’s Bill Hagerty. Moreno and McCormick both received significant financial support from the $3.5 trillion crypto industry during their respective races in the 2024 election thanks to their pro-crypto leanings. Moreno received more than $40 million in industry funds funneled through pro-crypto super PACs, helping him win the seat from incumbent Senator Sherrod Brown who had occupied it for eighteen years. It’s currently unclear which Democratic Senators will serve on the subcommittee. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is now the top Democrat on the Banking Committee and her historically anti-crypto views are expected to continue. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Two freshman Democratic Senators, Arizona’s Ruben Gallego and New Jersey’s Andy Kim are both considered supporters of the industry and may get a look to serve on the subcommittee. Senator Pete Ricketts, the former governor of Nebraska, is also very pro-crypto. While governor, Ricketts signed the Nebraska Financial Innovation Act, which authorized a new charter for digital asset depositories, allowing them to custody crypto.","summary":"The creation of the subcommittee underscores the GOP&apos;s commitment to prioritizing crypto legislation","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/senate-banking-committee-launch-subcommittee-digital-assets","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1466857291.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:39:27","author":"Eleanor Terrett","authors":["Eleanor Terrett"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.014},{"id":279678796,"title":"Amazon Is Going To Be A Real Player in UFC Bidding War","text":"This Saturday, the Steelers-Ravens NFL playoff matchup will air exclusively on Amazon Prime. Amazon outbid NBC's Peacock to secure the right to the streaming-only wild card window for an estimated price of $150 million, as Prime Video seeks to establish itself as the premier streaming service for sports fans. It sounds like Amazon could soon look to strengthen its stake in that claim by adding the fastest-growing sports league in America: The UFC. \"Dana [White] and that team, I mean, that’s an incredible success story,\" Amazon Prime Video’s Global Head of Sports Jay Marine told CNBC’s Alex Sherman in an interview this week. \"They’ve grown that into just an incredibly valuable franchise, incredibly passionate fan base. I have huge respect for them over there, and if that comes to market, I think they’re an exclusive window right now, we’d be very interested in taking a look as I expect every broadcaster would.\" As Marine notes, the UFC remains in an exclusive negotiation window with ESPN, though it expires later this year. Marine is also correct in that most, if not all, notable broadcasters will show interest in the UFC if ESPN does not secure a renewal for exclusive rights in the U.S. There's an argument that UFC is the best bang for your buck in professional sports. ESPN currently pays just $300 million a year for the product, about $100 million less than ESPN pays for the NHL. And when on ESPN and ESPN2, the UFC dwarfs the NHL in the ratings. But the UFC's impact on linear television is just a bonus. The value of the sport is tied mostly to its rabid fan base's willingness to pay for monthly pay-per-views on top of specific streaming, as is currently the case for ESPN+. So, expect at least NBC (Peacock), Warner Bros. Discovery (Max), DAZN, and Netflix to show interest in the UFC. Netflix, the undisputed king of the streaming wars, could have an advantage over its competitors after recently inking a 10-year, $5 billion deal with the UFC's TKO sister company, WWE, to air weekly episodes of Raw. WWE Raw debuted on Netflix this past Monday to 2.6 million viewers in the U.S. and 4.9 million viewers internationally. Not bad. Granted, Netflix is unlikely to add pay-per-view ad-ons to its service and thus would have to bank on the UFC driving enough new subscribers (think Tyson vs. Paul in November) to justify a bid. It's also possible that the UFC could split up its rights by working with more than just one broadcaster. For example, one partner could air the pay-per-views, and the other could air the biweekly Fight Nights. Another possibility is two streamers rotating the monthly pay-per-views. For reference, ESPN and TNT currently rotate the Stanley Cup Finals every other year. Either way, UFC is about to finally get paid what it deserves. The UFC also faces an incredible opportunity for further growth by leaning into its fighters' support for Donald Trump. The UFC is the only sports league that leans right, juxtaposed to the left-leaning NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. Under Dana White, the UFC found a niche: half of the country. When asked about Amazon's interest in MLB, Marine didn't rule it out, but his lack of enthusiasm was palpable. \"We look at everything,\" he told CNBC. \"I think it’s only responsible to look at everything.\" Translation: Amazon wants the UFC.","summary":"Amazon confirms interest in adding the UFC.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/amazon-going-real-player-ufc-bidding-war","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/11/gettyimages-2185190088.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:37:33","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":279677240,"title":"Supreme Court rejects Trump’s bid to delay sentencing in his New York hush money case","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President-elect Donald Trump’s bid to delay his sentencing in his hush money case in New York.\n\nThe court’s 5-4 order clears the way for Judge Juan M. Merchan to impose a sentence Friday on Trump, who was convicted in what prosecutors called an attempt to cover up a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels. Trump has denied any liaison with Daniels or any wrongdoing.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the court’s three liberals in rejecting his emergency motion.\n\nThey found his sentencing wouldn’t be a serious burden since Merchan has indicated he won’t give Trump jail time, fines or probation. Trump’s arguments against the verdict, meanwhile, can be handled as part of the regular appeals process, the majority found.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh would have delayed the sentencing, the order states.\n\nTrump’s attorneys have argued that evidence used in the Manhattan trial violated last summer’s Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from prosecution over acts he took as president.\n\nAt the least, they have said, the sentencing should be delayed while their appeals play out to avoid distracting Trump during the presidential transition.\n\nProsecutors pushed back, saying there’s no reason for the court to take the “extraordinary step” of intervening in a state case now. Trump’s attorneys haven’t shown that an hourlong virtual hearing would be a serious disruption, and a pause would likely mean pushing the case past the Jan. 20 inauguration, creating a yearslong delay in sentencing if it happens at all.\n\nTrump’s attorneys went to the justices after New York courts refused to postpone sentencing, including the state’s highest court on Thursday.\n\nJudges in New York have found that the convictions on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to personal matters rather than Trump’s official acts as president. Daniels says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. He denies it.\n\nTrump’s attorneys called the case politically motivated, and they said sentencing him now would be a “grave injustice” that threatens to disrupt the presidential transition as the Republican prepares to return to the White House.\n\nTrump is represented by D. John Sauer, his pick to be the solicitor general, who represents the government before the high court.\n\nSauer also argued for Trump in the separate criminal case charging him with trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which resulted in the Supreme Court’s immunity opinion.\n\nDefense attorneys cited that opinion in arguing some of the evidence used against him in the hush money trial should have been shielded by presidential immunity. That includes testimony from some White House aides and social media posts made while he was in office.\n\nThe decision comes a day after Justice Alito confirmed that he took a phone call from Trump the day before the president-elect’s lawyers filed their emergency motion before the high court. The justice said the call was about a clerk, not any upcoming or current cases.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It makes me emotional still.

We're just living full lives, real lives, just like everyone else.' \nFor the cover shoot, Nava looked nothing short of incredible in a series of leggy outfits, including a black bodysuit complete with a stylish oversized leather jacket.\nShe further showcased her sensational figure as she slipped into a denim vest top and a racy maxi skirt, which featured a large cut out along the side.\nOther ensembles included a zebra-print trench coat, a busty white mini dress, and a blue denim jacket.\nNava wore her brunette locks in loose waves and opted for a glowing palette of makeup.\nReflecting on her younger years as a transgender woman, Nava admitted that trying to enter the workforce as a trans person can be 'soul crushing,' and lead her to 'crumble'.\nShe revealed that her struggle with being accepted by society led to anorexia and how, at 19, a rehab programme saved her life.\n\nNow, as Cosmopolitan's latest cover star, Nava discussed 'the shame society creates around transgender relationships'\n\nNava said: 'Donny's love for Teri is in the form of awe, and I had never seen a trans woman represented quite in that way'\n\nShe recalled: 'It was undeniable.

Anorexia is the deadliest mental health disorder, and I learned, in a way that I can never unlearn, how to truly love myself, and how to practise acceptance and mindfulness.\n'It built a foundation of self-love and trust in myself that I think allowed my intuition to blossom.'\nShe added: 'I think that more than anything, it was that I hadn't transitioned. It was the most all-consuming effort that I was making to try to fit myself into a world that was not built for me.'\nWhen she finally got her big break on Baby Reindeer, a doctor had to inform her she had an elevated heart rate due to the shock of the show's incredible success.\n'We realised that I was in literal, physical shock, because it was undeniable that my life had changed,' she revealed.\nLifting the lid on where society is today with transgender representation on TV, Nava spoke of how there is still room for improvement.\nShe told the publication: 'I think there are some people who have this imagined belief that there's a trans takeover. \n\nRichard Gadd said that Donny's relationship arc with Teri drew on his own experiences of a relationship with an unnamed trans woman (Nava pictured as Teri in the show)\n\nReflected in the series, Richard added that feelings of shame around his sexuality kept him from telling the truth about his name and occupation from her\n\n WHAT IS ANOREXIA? \n\nAnorexia is a serious mental illness where a person restricts their food intake, which often causes them to be severely underweight.\nMany also exercise excessively.\nSome sufferers may experience periods of bingeing, followed by purging. \nSufferers often have a distorted view of themselves and think they are larger than they really are.\nUntreated, patients can suffer loss of muscle and bone strength, as well as depression, low libido and menstruation ceasing in women.\nIn severe cases, patients can experience heart problems and organ damage.\nBehavioural signs of anorexia include people saying they have already eaten or will do later, as well as counting calories, missing meals, hiding food and eating slowly.\nAs well as weight loss, sufferers may experience insomnia, constipation, bloating, feeling cold, hair loss, and swelling of the hands, face and feet.\nTreatment focuses on therapy and self-help groups to encourage healthy eating and coping mechanisms.\nSource: Beat Eating Disorders\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'And it's like, we're such a small population – a tiny fraction of the world's population – and we're barely getting to make headway into the kinds of roles that are available to us. \n'Trans people should be considered and invited to be a part of projects that do not revolve around a trans narrative, and that's because trans people are so much more than our gender identity. \n'It's a matter of seeing trans people as human, and valuing us for our humanity, and not as a token simply because we are trans.' \nRichard Gadd, who both wrote and starred in the show, told The Independent, that Donny's relationship arc with Teri drew on his own experiences of a relationship with an unnamed trans woman.\n'It's in the public consciousness now, but it wasn't back then, when I was dating,' he explained.\n'It felt so new that it added a certain pressure, to me, that I really regret now. But that's what it explores in the show. This story was set back in a time when things were very different.'\nReflected in the series, Richard added that feelings of shame around his sexuality kept him from telling the truth about his name and occupation from her.\nHowever, he has also said that his girlfriend became 'the voice of reason in my life at that point' although he never 'listened to her as much as I should have'.\nThe full interview can be read in the Feb/March issue of Cosmopolitan UK on sale from 14 January\nRichard GaddNetflix\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBaby Reindeer star Nava Mau says the award winning Netflix show 'healed her own wounds' after devastating pre-transition anorexia battle fuelled by 'self-hatred' forced her into rehab\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nThe celebrities whose homes were lucky to survive LA fire... as neighbors are left devastated\n\nClose shave \n\nEXCLUSIVERICHARD EDEN: New trauma for Holly Willoughby as taxman seeks to close her company\n\nNoughties pop star looks completely different as she promotes new single in her hometown \n\nAll change \n\nCelebrity homes destroyed in LA wildfires mapped: As thousands lose their properties use our interactive graphic to behold the devastation\n\nRichard Hammond's wife Mindy kicked him out to sleep in the castle's barn after SHE ended 28-year marriage'\n\nNew year, stronger you: Healthy habits for bones and joints\n\nPrince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas reveals that she's expecting her second child using an embryo she froze\n\nEXCLUSIVEGrace Tame SPLITS from her fiancé but it's not your usual break-up: THE GROUP CHAT WITH LUCY MANLY\n\nEXCLUSIVEAnt McPartlin looks happy as he struggles to keep his hands off wife Anne-Marie in rare uninhibited PDA on Barbados beach\n\nSay hello to a happier you! 10 top brands to help you glow inside and out this January\n\nKatie Price continues to spark concern with her noticeably slimmer frame after new gym regime as fans worry she's risking damage'\n\nKyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner 'is considering scrapping her £27million divorce bid as he eyes up £400K per week move'\n\nEPHRAIM HARDCASTLE: What happened to friendship between Justin Trudeau's estranged wife and Meghan Markle?\n\nThe Traitors brand Anna a 'ticking timebomb' after she turns down their recruitment offer \n\nWrong decision?\n\nWant to take control of your finances?

She sought legal advice about the finances last year and knows that the deal in Saudi is worth a lot.'\nKyle is a to be a top contender for clubs like Al Nassr with deals in the oil-rich nation are said to be worth upwards of £20million, meaning he could earn £400,000 per week.\nThe insider insisted a decision to stay with Kyle would be about keeping their family together but she will have thought about his 'earning potential'. \nA source told MailOnline Kyle and Annie are both 'committed' to keeping their family unit together.\nThey said: 'There is so much speculation and scrutiny on whether Kyle and Annie will get through this phase of their marriage but as it stands nothing much has changed since the situation blew up a year ago. \n'The couple are committed to keeping their family as united as possible and protecting their four boys from any fallout. \n'They enjoyed Christmas together, as a family, and continue to work on their own relationship but as yet no decisions have been made. They would love time and peace away from the spotlight and rumours to be able to continue working on things behind the scenes.'\nThe insider also insisted claims Annie would stay with Kyle for purely financial reasons are not true.\n\nHis estranged wife served him with divorce papers in October and if she is to proceed he will face a mammoth battle for his £27million fortune (pictured with three of their children Roman, 12, Riaan, eight, Reign, six, in December 2023)\n\nA source said: 'It was just a few months ago that Annie served Kyle with divorce papers, but she's having second thoughts'\n\nKyle is a to be a top contender for clubs like Al Nassr with deals in the oil-rich nation are said to be worth upwards of £20million\nThey added: 'Alluding to the fact that Annie is considering staying purely for financial benefit is ludicrous, she is a Mum first and foremost and will always put her children first.\n'Kyle is fully committed to his football career here in the UK and isn’t taking heed of any of the speculation or rumours on a transfer./' \nMailOnline has contacted representatives for Kyle Walker and Annie Kilner for comment. \nIt comes after the couple made a very public statement as they rang in the New Year together.\nThe pair were seen wearing matching pyjamas in the Instagram update with their sons Roman, 12, Riaan, eight, Reign, six, and five-month-old Rezon.\nSharing the new snap to his Story on Sunday, Kyle wrote: 'Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.'\nA fellow football WAG who is close to the family told MailOnline last month: 'Kyle and Annie are putting their marital problems aside to celebrate Christmas with their children.\n'They are the pairs' priority and they want to be able to bring Christmas joy into the household for their young family.\n'This involves having both parents there. Whilst Annie bears the brunt of looking after the family, Kyle is hands on with his four boys and they adore him.\n\nKyle, as well as his four children with Annie, shares a son, Kairo, four, and a daughter, Kinara, 18-months, with Lauryn\n\nIt was revealed by Lauryn that the football ace didn't get any Christmas presents for their children, Kairo and Kinara \n\nDuring an Instagram Q&A she was asked: 'Did 'that' even attempt to buy the kids for Christmas or even a card or does the ball and chain not allow?' Lauryn replied: 'You said it...' \n'The talks continue between the two at what their future looks like but for now it’s all about their children and what is best for them.\n'Annie is a strong woman who just wants to see her boys happy, she will do anything for them but she hasn’t forgotten what Kyle has done. This is about the kids, and the kids only.'\nMeanwhile, it was revealed by Lauryn that the football ace didn't get any Christmas presents for their children, Kairo and Kinara.\nThe reality star also hit out at Annie by re-posting a message from a fan branding Kyle's estranged wife his 'ball and chain'.\nDuring an Instagram Q&A she was asked: 'Did 'that' even attempt to buy the kids for Christmas or even a card or does the ball and chain not allow?'\nLauryn replied: 'You said it...'\nJust hours later on Monday, Annie shared her 'biggest blessing' on Instagram as she looked back at 2024.\n\nJust hours later Annie shared her 'biggest blessing' on Instagram as she looked back at 2024 and uploaded a sweet photo from earlier this year as she cradled her newborn baby Rezon\n\nThe WAG uploaded a sweet photo from earlier this year as she cradled her newborn baby Rezon sleeping on her chest in bed.\nShe simply wrote: 'Out biggest blessing joined us in 2024'.\nIt comes as Kyle is hoping that Lauryn will stop 'goading' him on social media in the new year as he claims the reality star is using his name to stay in the spotlight.\nThe footballer has seemingly hit back amid backlash after it was revealed he didn't send their two children Christmas presents this year.\nWhile the footballer didn't give Kairo or Kinara any presents, Kyle is committed to supporting them financially.\nAn insider told MailOnline: 'Kyle’s never been involved in the kids’ celebrations and not brought gifts, except for a coat for Kairo a few years ago.\n'The latest story seems like Lauryn using his name to stay in the spotlight.'\nThey added: 'He’s not part of Lauryn’s kids’ daily lives but supports them financially—paying for their house, school, and more.\n'Kyle and Annie just want to put all this behind them in 2025 and move on without the drama. They hope that Lauryn will do the same instead of goading them on social media.'\nA source close to Lauryn added: 'Lauryn has been getting on with her life with the children making sure they are shielded even though it has been tough for them especially Kairo who asks for his daddy.\n'It’s really sad that he isn’t stepping up for all of his children and you would've thought he learnt that lesson from not doing it the first time round.'\nLauryn GoodmanKyle WalkerAnnie Kilner\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner 'is considering scrapping her £27million divorce bid as footballer eyes up £400K per week move'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nThe celebrities whose homes were lucky to survive LA fire... as neighbors are left devastated\n\nClose shave \n\nEXCLUSIVERICHARD EDEN: New trauma for Holly Willoughby as taxman seeks to close her company\n\nNoughties pop star looks completely different as she promotes new single in her hometown \n\nAll change \n\nCelebrity homes destroyed in LA wildfires mapped: As thousands lose their properties use our interactive graphic to behold the devastation\n\nRichard Hammond's wife Mindy kicked him out to sleep in the castle's barn after SHE ended 28-year marriage'\n\nNew year, stronger you: Healthy habits for bones and joints\n\nPrince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas reveals that she's expecting her second child using an embryo she froze\n\nEXCLUSIVEGrace Tame SPLITS from her fiancé but it's not your usual break-up: THE GROUP CHAT WITH LUCY MANLY\n\nEXCLUSIVEAnt McPartlin looks happy as he struggles to keep his hands off wife Anne-Marie in rare uninhibited PDA on Barbados beach\n\nSay hello to a happier you! 10 top brands to help you glow inside and out this January\n\nKatie Price continues to spark concern with her noticeably slimmer frame after new gym regime as fans worry she's risking damage'\n\nKyle Walker's wife Annie Kilner 'is considering scrapping her £27million divorce bid as he eyes up £400K per week move'\n\nEPHRAIM HARDCASTLE: What happened to friendship between Justin Trudeau's estranged wife and Meghan Markle?\n\nThe Traitors brand Anna a 'ticking timebomb' after she turns down their recruitment offer \n\nWrong decision?\n\nWant to take control of your finances?

It is axiomatic that there is only one President at a time,” they wrote.\n\nJustice Juan Merchan and prosecutors have argued that Trump’s actions at the center of the case — in which he falsified accounting records to hide reimbursement payments to his former attorney for so-called “hush money” to an adult film star – have nothing to do with the “official” actions of the presidency that are protected by “immunity.”\n\nThat immunity “is strictly limited to the time of the President’s term in office,” prosecutors added.\n\nOn May 30, a jury of 12 New Yorkers found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records after a six-week-long trial.\n\nProsecutors said Trump falsified records in connection with a scheme to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, whose story about having sex with Trump threatened to derail his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump’s reimbursements to his then-attorney Michael Cohen, who paid off Daniels, were falsely recorded in accounting records as “legal expenses.”\n\nThe former president insists he has done nothing wrong.","summary":"Trump is scheduled to face New York Justice Juan Merchan at 9 a.m. Friday — 10 days before his second inauguration to the presidency","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-supreme-court-hush-money-sentencing-b2676931.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/08/23/2192374757.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ezc36z0k-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:26:08","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":279676584,"title":"President-elect Trump hit with disastrous loss weeks before inauguration","text":"President-elect Donald Trump will be sentenced Friday in his New York hush money case after the Supreme Court refused to postpone the sentencing.

Mike DeWine, who will choose his successor.\n\n“As I prepare to assume my duties as Vice President of the United States, I would like to express that it has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio in the Senate over the past two years,” Vance wrote in the letter.\n\nIn a separate statement released by Vance, the outgoing senator nodded to his hardscrabble roots growing up in Appalachia.\n\n“When I was elected to this office, I promised to never forget where I came from, and I’ve made sure to live by that promise every single day,” Vance said.\n\nDeWine has said he would make the appointment once Vance vacates the seat. DeWine’s spokesperson said DeWine was at a governors’ event with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday evening, making it unlikely he would announce any appointment before Friday.\n\nDeWine has the sole duty of appointing a successor to Vance, who was elected to a six-year term in 2022. A long list of elected Republicans in the state has expressed interest in the seat, including Secretary of State Frank LaRose, Treasurer Robert Sprague, U.S. Rep. Mike Carey, state Sen. Matt Dolan, former Republican state chair Jane Timken and GOP attorney and strategist Mehek Cooke.\n\nHowever, speculation has most recently zeroed in on Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, who accompanied DeWine on a recent trip to Mar-a-Lago to speak with President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nDeWine declined to even hint as to the subject of those discussions when asked by reporters during a Wednesday bill-signing at the Statehouse.\n\n“I’m not ready to make an announcement yet, but the announcement will be coming soon,” he said.\n\nHusted, who was also present, said merely, “We’re considering all the options, and just, that’s really all I have to say.”\n\nHusted has been considered a front-runner to run for governor in 2026, after spending years positioning for the job.

Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.They noted in multiple filings this week that Merchan already telegraphed his sentencing decision on Jan. 3, when he said he was inclined to release Trump without incarceration or any other restriction.In May, a unanimous jury found Trump guilty for authorizing a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a so-called \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. The payment was made before Trump's first election in 2016, but Trump signed off on the reimbursements to his former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen — and an accompanying coverup — during his time in the Oval Office. Trump says it was unconstitutional for the jury to see evidence and hear testimony from the years when he was in the White House. Trump's lawyers urged the Supreme Court to prevent his sentencing, set for just 10 days before his inauguration, \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\" The case has wound its way to the Supreme Court repeatedly since Manhattan prosecutors began their investigation in 2018. In a landmark 2020 decision, the court ruled that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records. Trump continued to fight their release even after that decision, until 2021, when the Supreme Court again rejected his efforts to shield the financial records.Merchan gave Trump the option of attending the sentence via video, as opposed to in-person, and prosecutors said in court filings and arguments this week that he has said he will take the virtual appearance option.","summary":"President-elect Trump's sentencing for his criminal conviction is scheduled for Friday morning.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-sentencing-hush-money-case/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/29/acd032c6-f730-47f8-bb24-370a63c6ea26/thumbnail/1200x630/901dce2b7e3a781e9151bf4cd800eeb4/gettyimages-2154611694.jpg?v=c32e88638f4c371ec40100fff0bc2158","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3455621_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:19:08","author":"Graham Kates","authors":["Graham Kates"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":279675756,"title":"Trump’s Hush Money Sentencing Will Take Place Friday As Supreme Court Rejects Last-Ditch Appeal","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's criminal sentencing will take place Friday in Manhattan as scheduled, as the Supreme Court rejected his last-ditch effort to have the guilty verdict against him thrown out—though the president-elect is still unlikely to face many, if any, penalties for his crimes.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump looks on during Turning Point USA's AmericaFest at the Phoenix ...

A five-minute video in which he sprinkles ash on his head, says that Meta made a mistake, that it went too far, .that we fell into too much censorship. I'm talking about Mark Zuckerberg announcing that Meta is changing its internal corporate policy and platforms like Instagram and Facebook are no longer policing the veracity of content. In other words, Instagram, Facebook is no longer about exposing misinformation, at this point in time still only in the U.S. environment, but very likely with an effort here to spread this new policy globally and we have Josef Holý, co-author of the podcast Canaries in the Net, who is looking at not just misinformation but just the impact of technology on our individual social lives. Hello, Josef.Josef Holy: Hello, thank you for having me.Bohumil Kartous: We talked briefly before we recorded this interview about how we find this incredible, but it probably fits into the overall picture of the United States today. How do you feel about the message that Mark Zuckerberg has delivered to the world with such enthusiasm?Josef Holý: You have to look at it in the context of what is happening in the United States right now. Basically, the oligarchic clique of Silicon Valley now has the President of the United States. Elon Musk gave Trump over 200 million dollars and he was not alone. Then there are hundreds of millions more from other big investors, and so the interests of the platforms and the interests of the American state will be the same after January 20th, when Trump officially takes office. Logically from the point of view of the CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world, the most valuable company in the world, that is Facebook, they're still in the top 5 or top 10 of various companies, so it's basically a logical step that they're going to kiss the ring so to speak. That is, they have to become part of this new, I'm already calling it, doctrine, new doctrine and but it's not just that suddenly Zuckerberg would kneel down and jump over to Trump. It's important to remember that the first Facebook investor, the angel investor, the first person to give a million dollars to Mark Zuckerberg was Peter Thiel, who is an ally of Elon Musk and the person who put in place or helped put in place J.D. Vance as a vice presidential candidate and future vice president, who is still in the background right now, but it's just this clique that's just an interconnected techno-oligarchy that is now going to try to exert this enormous technological influence in manipulating our perception of reality. That is, how we perceive reality through the information that we receive through social networks increasingly.Bohumil Kartous: This was the same investor, excuse the interuption, the same investor who was behind the effort as a grey eminence to remove some of the leaders of American universities accused of anti-Semitism, very very unfairly.Josef Holý: Among other things. And he's also the owner or co-owner of Palantir, which is the biggest data firm today that takes contracts from or works for the Pentagon. That means Peter Theil is tied to government contracts. So you have the structure here. Then there's the so-called crypto bros, that is, again, the technologarchs who have made money in cryptocurrencies, then it's not without interest that there's also a guy named Jeff Yass, who gave the Republicans, or Trump, or the Republicans, about $100 million as well, who holds 15% in ByteDance, which is the operator of Tiktok. So we have this conglomerate, this kind of true techno-oligarchic group that will now hold the United States government.Bohumil Kartous: It seems to me a lot like entering into a form of dystopia, because we have a group of people like Mark Zuckerberg, who quietly, the moment he senses, sees that the political course is changing towards Trump, as it is, and immediately adapts and may do the same if the course reverses again, which we should hope for. But he will do it again. He'll quietly support the other party again and he'll adapt again. And he knows that there's nothing we as companies can do about it because the technology is pretty much in our hands. They've got it in their grasp.Josef Holý: A couple of things here on that. You're saying that in four years the US government will change, that then the course will change and Zuckerberg will switch his allegiance. This clique is trying to make sure that the odds don't change anymore. We need to accept the new reality. That course is not going to change, if the Democrats, or some other party that might emerge in the future, we don't know in the United States, can succeed, then if the plan that this clique, together with Trump, has is successful, then basically there will be an autocratic takeover of the United States, and the United States will become basically an autocratic state, basically a fascist state, in the sense of that Mussolini-esque fascism, where you have the biggest, the biggest capital intertwined with the state. We mustn't forget, too, of the techno-oligarchs, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, who has supported the Democrats all along. And then, when it looked like before the election that Trump was really probably going to win, maybe he made that assessment, he refused to run a supportive op-ed in the Washington Post in support of Kamala Harris and now he's talking openly about Trump and Musk, saying that he's looking forward to working together and that it's going to be great how they form the government. That's one thing. The other thing. They're going to try to exert that influence through the entire power apparatus of the United States. I'll try to give an example. Zuckerberg said several things in that video. You mentioned in that introduction that they want to abolish fact-checking, that is, they want to abolish cooperation with those organizations that oversaw, that fact-checked, that is, verified information. He talks a lot about freedom of speech, he talks a lot about censorship. He even says that Facebook, under pressure from these organisations and also under pressure from the former Biden establishment, that it censored, that it was forced to censor and that it is still forced to censor in Europe, in the European Union, for example, he says that Europe is over-regulated. Which may be true in many respects.On the other hand, it is in that digital world that the Digital Services Act makes an impact. This is the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Marketplaces Act or AOI as it is called in Czech, so these are the first regulations of this type and scope in the world. And I've been following the discourse in the regulatory community, listening and watching podcasts, statements from various people in the regulatory community from other countries, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and they all say, this is great, this is interesting. We take a lot of inspiration from that.I mean, Europe has shown some direction here in this and in light of that, Zuckerberg at the same time in the video we're talking about, he's saying that he wants to work together, literally that 'we're going to work with Donald Trump to push back on other countries elsewhere in the world that are also pushing similar censorship policies.'Bohumil Kartous: By the way, he makes no distinction at all in that video between Europe and Latin America and China. He lumps them all together as countries or as territories, regions that are trying to censor unnecessarily. That's completely out of line, excuse me.Josef Holý: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, and this is an important sentence for me here that underscores that thesis about this techno-oligarchic fascism, this concept here where this industrialist of the new industry, the digital industry, one of the most powerful people in the world because his platforms serve and supply information to over 3 billion people on basically a daily basis, globally, so he's saying that with Trump, that is, with a representative of political power, he's going to use that political power to help his business, and at the same time, of course, there's going to be an intertwining to help spread the ideology that Trump represents, which is, to put it in the finest terms, populism. And if we say it in a very realistic way, as Timothy Snyder, for example, the American historian, says, it is totalitarianism, dictatorship, fascism, basically.Bohumil Kartous: I'll maybe add one more important thing there, maybe not so perceptible to many people, which he announced that the team that has been doing the content management, let's say, the control of that content, is moving from California to Texas, and he justified that by saying that those people were too biased in the way they judge that content, which is terribly, absolutely flagrant. So it's obvious that simply when you move something from a Democratic state in the US to the most biased conservative state in the US, this is not about bias, this is again just about trying to please the new highly toxic leadership of the United States.Joswef Holý: Absolutely, absolutely. Here too, of course, it was important in this and just what's in it for Zuckerberg, they've had problems in the long run complying with these European regulations. They're using the excuse that it slows down innovation and so on. On the other hand, really 80% of the regulations that are there are about ensuring democratic principles, they're about defending democratic concepts in relation to those big platforms. These are not censorship regulations that the European Union has put in place. For example, one of the regulations that is in there is that when there are some major social events, whether it is natural disasters or democratic elections, for example, it is imposed on those platforms to increase surveillance and to communicate better with the relevant parts of the state if something happens. That is, when there are floods, so that they take information from security and other state forces and then publish it. Verified information from the state as to where people should report where, how, how to evacuate and so on. And when there's an election, if there's foreign influence, which we've seen by the way, in the last two months in Romania, where basically on the pro-China platform TikTok, an unknown extreme candidate managed to shoot up from 0 to 43 and a half percent or whatever.So this is what these regulations impose and they also impose, for example, privacy protections. Which then requires increased costs from those companies because they have all the data inside, simply put, in one pile. And suddenly the European Union, a major world market, wants them to treat that data, to treat it differently in some way, for example, to store the data of European users on the European continent, to subject it to different protection regimes and so on.This is not censorship, this in light of the fact that, if we go back to the fact that fascism is on the rise in America, which yes, it is not just Holý and Kartous here who are saying this, but established intellectual leaders across the spectrum. Yeah for example Liz Cheney, who can hardly be described as a left wing liberal, she's a Republican, daughter of Dick Cheney, who invaded Afghanistan and Iraq he was the architect of these wars basically.So she's saying the same thing, that is, at the moment when it's about to happen here, it's in our vital interest to resist that pressure from the techno-oligarchs. That is, to insist on compliance with the regulations that we have agreed to, and please do so in a pretty democratic way. Ursula von der Leyen didn't make these regulations up. They went through several years of wrangling by the European Parliament, that is really European democracy, that is the result of a European democratic process that all states have agreed to in principle.Bohumil Kartous: And of course, it is based on the necessary need to protect the public interest. What is really happening is the identification of the public interest with the interest of this new technological plutocracy represented by Zuckerberg. Musk, Bezos and other people who are completely unelected by anyone, but who, by supporting Trump, will buy his favour and then subsequently buy the fact that when the MAGA legion, that bunch of Trump-loyal idiots, negotiate with the European Union, they will either be there directly. I'm convinced that Musk will be sitting there and they will be pushing the European Commission and the European Union to the effect of -Josef Holý: Absolutely.Bohumil Kartous: - you're not going to regulate us, otherwise we're going to raise tariffs or we're just going to destroy your prices for critical supplies, it's a very uncomfortable situation. On the other hand, we don't really have a choice, if we let ourselves be broken in Europe, we become vassals of this strange form of digital feudalism. Slash Slash as autocracy. So, of course, that feudalism inherently owns it. Just to put the whole thing in context, here we're talking about a new government that, through the mouth of its president, who is very much a puppet, in his own way, a completely narcissistic idiot who stands at the top of the heap here, is threatening to take over Greenland, to take over Panama, to threaten Canada. That he's going to turn them into another US state. That's nothing that isn't obvious.Josef Holý: Exactly. Exactly. It's such a new reality that we still refuse to admit it. What you just said in that last sentence. The American - let's just repeat that, the American president, even before he took office, threatened Denmark that he would take Greenland away from them, and when asked directly by journalists, he didn't rule out the use of military force. And this Denmark and the United States are in NATO. He wants to get control of the Panama Canal and basically wants or says Canada should become the 51th state of the Union of the United States. I mean this is the reality, it's exactly the same as Slovakian Prime Minister Fico going to Russia, nobody knows what he's doing there, he's just making weird propaganda pro-Russian videos and then suddenly he's discovered in a €6,000 room in a hotel somewhere in Hanoi. This is the same level or a very similar level, the level of the new reality, which is completely different from what we had. Exactly.And you really have to look at it that way, that this is not normal. This is not normal and we as Europe have to push back very strongly against this because if we care about our system and now of course it's about what cards we play and the problem is that Musk is openly supporting, at least populist, but moreover often pro-Russian, downright pro-Russian parties that have a record of being paid by the Russians, for example the German AfD, then he wants to help the Farage Reform Party, with or without Farage in the UK and so on and so forth.That is, we are really looking at a frontal assault on our democratic systems here, and what Sasha Alvarova, my podcast colleague, also wrote about in Feeding the Demons. That Steve Bannon, Trump's propagandist, ten years ago invented the populist international, which failed in that first period and they wanted to install Salvini and just all the AfD and so on, the only one that succeeded was Orbán in some respects, and today we're looking at that version 2.0, which will be with the heavy use of these modern data-driven artificial intelligence-based information platforms..Bohumil Kartous: How do you see the problem? I perceive the problem a bit like those people who, before the real rise of Nazism in Germany, didn't believe that it could really happen. A lot of those people who said no, kept pushing back -Josef Holý: \"That's just his rhetoric.\"Bohumil Kartous: It's still just his rhetoric it's just him just blabbing. It's just a lot of people think that Trump, like, he's just going to say something and then the next day he's not going to do it, but this Trump 2.0 as a lot of critics of people who are involved and follow the political world, global events have pointed out. Trump 2.0 is something different than Trump between 2017-2020 and yet this clearly proves that it is, after all, he has everything on his plate. And just what you said, that is, the misuse of the tools of digital influence and social discourse, social discourse will undoubtedly lead to this.","summary":"This interview is conducted in Czech, but further below there is an English translation: \n\n\nThere's a lot more to what Mark Zuckerberg said in his five-minute \nvideo about the changes to the internal politics of Meta (Facebook, \nInstagram, etc.) than just freeing up the vast space of these platforms \nto spread misinformation and hate.

The policy area was among President-elect Donald Trump's key talking points while on the election campaign trail, promising to carry out mass deportations of illegal immigrants.What To KnowSenators voted to push the legislation forward, after the House approved it earlier in the week without debate or amendment. It will now be debated and likely voted on next week.Democrats who have shown their support for the bill say it will make their constituents safer, while those against it have warned about racial profiling and a lack of resources for immigration officials.What Is the Laken Riley Act?The bill, reintroduced to Congress by Georgia Republican Representative Mike Collins on January 6, covers two key areas, but the focus has mainly been on one: mandating the detention of illegal immigrants arrested or charged with theft or other similar offenses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Republicans, including Alabama Senator Katie Britt who first introduced the bill, say that this would have prevented the death of Riley. The 22-year-old Georgia student was killed by Venezuelan Jose Ibarra, 26, in February. He had been detained three times since arriving illegally in the U.S., but the Border Patrol and police in New York and Georgia let him go.Reichlin-Melnick told Newsweek that ICE was unable to place detainers on Ibarra both times he was arrested by police, for minor offenses, because he was released too quickly and, therefore, it was unlikely agents would have been able to place him in detention anyway.Could the Laken Riley Act Stop Immigration?Also in the bill is a provision allowing attorneys general at the state level to sue the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or the secretary of Homeland Security, for failing to enforce the first part of the bill. One of the penalties could be an injunction stopping visas being issued for whichever country a suspected migrant criminal has come from.Immigration attorneys and advocacy groups have raised concerns that the Laken Riley Act would disrupt the workings of the U.S. immigration system—namely its federal management. By allowing attorneys general to effectively have a voice when it comes to visa allocations, it would hand power to the states.\"We think that inverts the separation of powers and puts the states above the federal government and has the potential to set off international incidents,\" Reichlin-Melnick said. \"If you had a single federal district court judge in, say, Texas, ordering the Secretary of State to sanction China and ban Chinese nationals from getting certain visas, that's a scenario I could easily see happening under the bill.\"On the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, Democratic Party minority leader, New York Senator Chuck Schumer, said that he welcomed the bill's continuation so that it could be thoroughly debated and amended.\"This is an important issue. We should have a debate and amendments, which is why I am voting yes on the motion to proceed,\" Schumer said. \"To remind my colleagues that this is not a vote on the bill itself.\"Other Democrats, including Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal, have spoken out against the bill, saying it wipes away due process for immigrants and could lead to increased racial profiling by immigration officials.Deporting illegal immigrants, especially those charged or convicted of other crimes, has been a unifying issue for voters, with the majority supporting the measure. But a majority also said they wanted more legal immigration pathways for those who have lived in the U.S. for years, which this bill appears to go against if state attorneys general are able to intervene.What People Are SayingAllyson and John Phillips, Laken Riley's mother and stepfather, in a news release: \"The Laken Riley Act has our full support because it would help save innocent lives and prevent more families from going through the kind of heartbreak we've experienced. Laken would have been 23 on January 10th. There is no greater gift that could be given to her and our country than to continue her legacy by saving lives through this bill.\"Maya Wiley, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in a statement to Newsweek: \"The senseless murder of Laken Riley should not be used to justify making unprecedented changes to immigration detention laws that will invite more discrimination and do little to increase public safety. Mandatory immigration detention on the basis of a mere arrest without requiring conviction would almost certainly — and disproportionately — invite abuses that harm people of color.\"Britt, in a press release: \"The American people did not just deliver a mandate on November 5th, they delivered a verdict. They made it clear they want to remove criminal illegal aliens and protect American families. We will soon know whether Democrats hear, respect, and obey that verdict.\"Kerri Talbot, co-executive director of the Immigration Hub, in a statement: \"The Laken Riley Act creates a pipeline for mass detention, not a sensible solution for public safety. This is political gamesmanship at its worst, planting a trap for lawmakers by exploiting a tragedy. This bill weaponizes the justice system to incarcerate immigrants for minor infractions, empowers extremists to rewrite immigration policy, and tears apart families who have long called this country home.\"Illinois Democratic Representative Sean Casten, on X: \"Undocumented people in the US who are convicted of felonies are already subject to deportation. If that is your concern you should be happy with existing law. As I am.\"Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, in a statement: \"As a pastor and a voice for Georgians in the Senate, I continue to pray for Laken Riley's family and friends who are still grieving her loss. I'm voting to begin floor debate on the Laken Riley Act because I believe the people of Georgia want their lawmakers in Washington to address the issues in this legislation.\"David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, on X: \"The Laken Riley Act pretends to be about stopping ILLEGAL immigrants who commit crimes. In fact, it's a Trojan horse designed to destroy legal migration because nativists cannot help themselves. They simply don't care about illegal immigration as much as legal immigration.\"Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, in a statement: \"I support this effort because federal authorities need to protect our communities from criminals. Keeping Arizonans safe is my top priority and I'm committed to working with Republicans and Democrats on solutions to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system.\"Who Voted Against the Laken Riley Act?Eight Democratic senators and one independent voted against advancing the Laken Riley Act:\nCorey Booker - Democrat, New Jersey\nAndy Kim - Democrat, New Jersey\nMazie Hirono - Democrat, Hawaii\nEdward Markey - Democrat, Massachusetts\nJeff Merkley - Democrat, Oregon\nBernie Sanders - Independent, Vermont\nBrian Schatz - Democrat, Hawaii\nTina Smith - Democrat, Minnesota\nElizabeth Warren - Democrat, Massachusetts\nWhat's NextThe bill's passage was approved 84-9 Thursday afternoon, paving the way for a debate and likely vote in the Senate next week.","summary":"Senators on Thursday voted to advance the legislation, but experts warn it doesn't tackle the problem.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/laken-riley-act-senate-vote-immigration-2012803","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2561343/senate-democrats-laken-riley-act.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:13:16","author":"Dan Gooding","authors":["Dan Gooding"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.358},{"id":279677088,"title":"How a Phone Call Drew Alito Into a Trump Loyalty Squabble","text":"Justice Samuel A.

Milo, I call him 'the mayor of Malibu,' and he's running around. I asked him, 'How's things looking there, Milo?' He says, 'Not good, Pops.'\"\"He sent me a video of my neighborhood,\" he added. \"And it's in flames. It looks like an inferno. So, not good.\"Rogan, who frequently pushes conservative rhetoric and endorsed President-elect Donald Trump last year, suggested that Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom was responsible for the fires because the state \"spent $24 billion last year on the homeless,\" while blaming the governor for having \"ruined the state personally.\"Gibson, an outspoken conservative who also endorsed Trump, agreed with Rogan. He went on to claim that Newsom was responsible for San Francisco supposedly becoming \"apocalyptic\" and \"a mess\" because homeless people live there. He then suggested that civilization itself was ready to \"cave in and collapse.\"\"I read a book once by Jared Diamond called Collapse,\" Gibson said. \"It says all the things you need for a civilization to cave in and collapse. And a lot of those things are present, all those earmarks, the precursors of a collapse. They're present in our time. So, it's an interesting observation.\"The actor later spoke about his belief that a divine \"intelligence\" was controlling everything in the universe, just before joking that the ongoing fires in California would \"do\" nothing except possibly \"give [him] a new house.\"Gibson's publicist declined Newsweek's request for comment on Thursday.What People Are SayingNewsom, commenting on the status of the fires on Thursday in a post to X, formerly Twitter: \"We just activated hundreds of additional California National Guard members to help battle blazes and keep our Southern California communities safe. Grateful for our men and women who are willing to jump in and help fight these unprecedented wildfires. We will forever be in your debt.\"Actress Jamie Lee Curtis, who lives in a fire-struck neighborhood but did not lose her own home, in a post to Instagram on Thursday: \"As the fire still rages on... all the available first responders and agencies involved in fighting fire and saving lives are still hard at work and neighbors and friends are banding together to save each other, my husband and I and our children have pledged $1 million from our Family Foundation to start a fund of support for our great city and state and the great people who live and love there.\"I'm in communication with Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass and Senator Schiff as to where those funds need to be directed for the most impact.\"What Happens NextSouthern California emergency workers and agencies were continuing to deal with the fires and issues related to the fires as of late Thursday afternoon.

costs rise","text":"Rachel Reeves faces further pressure to balance the books as the UK’s borrowing costs hit their highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Chancellor is said to be prepared to impose more severe spending cuts on departments if necessary, having already ruled out increasing either borrowing or taxes.\n\nShe has also asked ministers to draw up alternative plans for securing growth and “cease anti-growth measures” as she attempts to meet the Government’s aim of improving living standards across the country.\n\nAny further spending cuts could be announced in the Chancellor’s planned fiscal statement on March 26, ahead of a spending review that has already required Government departments to find efficiency savings worth 5% of their budgets.\n\nThe prospect of further cuts follows a rise in the yields on government bonds, which reflect how much it costs the Government to borrow money.\n\nYields on government bonds continued to rise on Thursday, up eight basis points to 4.89% for 10-year gilts, which is the highest since 2008.\n\nThese yields settled later on Thursday afternoon, sitting one basis point higher for the day at 4.82% when London’s market closed.\n\nThe rise in gilt yields has an inverse effect on the price of these government bonds, which are falling as a result, with some saying the current market woes echo those seen in the fallout from the disastrous mini-budget of former prime minister Liz Truss in 2022.\n\nThe rise in the cost of servicing government debts could cut into Labour’s expected financial headroom in a potentially worrying sign of how investors see fiscal sustainability in the UK.\n\nThat headroom against Ms Reeves’s debt target was already “razor-thin”, according to Isabel Stockton of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), meaning persistently higher interest rates could force the Chancellor to act or break the fiscal rules she set herself at the Budget in October.\n\nMs Stockton added: “If continuing to meet the fiscal target requires new tax rises, or cuts to the already tight-looking spending envelope for the subsequent spending review, then the Chancellor – and we – should not be surprised.”\n\nThe Chancellor has previously ruled out both increasing borrowing and raising taxes following the significant tax hikes in October’s Budget, leaving her with few options beyond further spending cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conservatives have criticised the Chancellor for proceeding with her planned trip to China this weekend rather than remaining in the UK to address the rising cost of borrowing.\n\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said Ms Reeves was “missing in action” and accused her of “wheeling out her deputy to defend her loss of control of the public finances” as Treasury Chief Secretary Darren Jones answered questions in the Commons in her place.\n\nMr Jones said the trip was “important” for UK trade and would continue.\n\nWhile Mr Stride said the Government was making “a panicked attempt to reassure the markets”, Mr Jones insisted that the bond market was functioning in an “orderly way”.\n\nMr Jones also pointed to global factors influencing the gilt market, saying there was “no need for emergency intervention”.\n\nGovernment bonds have faced a sell-off around the world in recent months in the face of worries that US President-elect Donald Trump could introduce a tariff policy which would be inflationary for many international economies.","summary":"The Chancellor has been criticised for continuing with a planned visit to China amid rising yields on

super-rich after pollution limit breached in just 10 days","text":"John Swinney has been urged to make “rich polluters pay for their lavish lifestyle” as campaigners warned the world’s wealthiest 1 per cent have already burned through their share of the annual global carbon budget this year. The stark warning comes as it is revealed the amount of harmful carbon dioxide that can be added to the atmosphere without pushing the world beyond the dangerous 1.5C of warming has been used by by the superrich within the first ten days of 2025. The analysis from Oxfam claims the emissions of the richest 1 per cent since 1990 have caused - and will continue to cause - trillions of dollars in economic damage, extensive crop losses, and millions of excess deaths. Oxfam Scotland has branded the alarming milestone “pollutocrat day”, saying it should serve as a wake-up call to MSPs to harness an unused devolved tax to target private jets such as those used by Donald Trump. READ MORE: Labour opens the door for SNP to finally roll out unused devolved tax power Campaigners are urging the Scottish Government to use devolved powers to introduce a private jet tax as well as examine plans for a frequent flyer levy. Scotland is yet to introduce devolved air departure tax over a long-standing row with the Treasury to do with an exemption for the Highlands and Islands. But the UK government told The Scotsman last month there was no barrier for SNP ministers to bring forward plans for the levy. Jamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said: “Private jets are the poster child of climate injustice, heaping yet more unnecessary pollution on a planet that’s already consumed by a deadly combination of floods, fire and famine. “The Scottish Government faces a stark choice: take bold action to make these rich polluters pay for their lavish lifestyle choices or remain complicit in their deadly destruction. READ MORE: Stark warning 'cold blob' could cause 'very serious problems' for Scotland's climate “A private jet tax would send a powerful message that Scotland won’t tolerate the reckless demolition of our collective future.” He added: “With the Scottish Budget on the line, MSPs have a no-brainer opportunity to help get Scotland’s climate credibility back on track – tax private jets, raise vital funds for green initiatives and show the world that Scotland really means business on climate action.” A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “The Scottish Government continues to explore all options for implementing air departure tax in a way that protects airline connectivity in the Highlands and Islands. “We will review the rates and bands of air departure tax, including the rates on private jet flights, prior to the introduction of the tax to ensure they are aligned with our net zero ambitions.”","summary":"SNP ministers should target the “poster child  of climate injustice” by introducing a private jet tax, campaigned have warned.","url":"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-government-john-swinney-climate-crisis-private-jet-tax-oxfam-4937627","image":"https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/10/30/15/41/PA-6028598.jpeg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-10 00:01:11","author":"David Bol","authors":["David Bol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":279674792,"title":"'LA fires have caused widespread destruction - we should not forget about ordinary Americans'","text":"The wildfires sweeping through the Los Angeles area have cost lives, destroyed buildings and forced tens of thousands of people to leave their homes.\n\nThe destruction of celebrity mansions has caught the attention but we should not forget the plight of ordinary Americans.
