I keep my reservations.” \n\nA politicization of the Fed and, to a lesser extent, the hollowing out of the IMF and World Bank are almost too much to fathom for most officials. \n\nDeprived of a lender of last resort, some $25 trillion of bonds and loans issued abroad would be called into question. \n\nAt the heart of policymakers’ concerns is that there is no ready alternative to the United States as the world’s financial hegemon - a situation that economists know as the Kindleberger Trap after renowned historian Charles Kindleberger. \n\nTo be sure, the euro, a distant-second reserve currency, is gaining popularity in light of the European Union’s newly found status as an island of relative stability. \n\nBut policymakers who spoke to Reuters were adamant that the European single currency was not ready yet to dethrone the dollar and could at best hope to add a little to its 20% share of the world’s reserves. \n\nOf the 20 countries that share the euro only Germany has the credit rating and the size that investors demand from a safe haven. \n\nSome other members are highly indebted and prone to bouts of political and financial turmoil - most recently in France last year - which raise lingering questions about the bloc’s long-term viability. \n\nAnd the euro zone’s geographical proximity to Russia - particularly the three Baltic countries that were once part of the Soviet Union - cast an even more sinister shadow. \n\nWith Japan now too small and China’s heavily managed currency in an even worse position, this left no alternative to the dollar system underpinned by the Fed and the two Bretton Woods institutions.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Global policymakers gathering in Washington this week breathed a collective sigh of relief that the US-centric economic order that prevailed for the past 80 years was not collapsing just yet despite Donald Trump’s inward-looking approach. \n\n\n\nThe Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were dominated by trade talks, which also brought some de-escalatory statements from Washington about its relations with China. \n\n\n\nBut some deeper questions hovered over central bankers and finance ministers after Trump’s attacks on international institutions and the Federal Reserve: can we still count on the US dollar as the world’s safe haven and on the two lenders that have supported the international economic system since the end of World War Two? \n\n\n\nConversations with dozens of policymakers from all over the world revealed generalised relief at Trump’s scaling back his threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the guardian of the dollar’s international status whom he had previousl","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40359714/world-breathes-sigh-of-relief-as-trump-spares-fed-imf","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/04/680d6aa9249c9.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 00:46:25","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.027},{"id":315194666,"title":"Trump news at a glance: US president meets Zelenskyy at Vatican as popularity plunges at home","text":"Donald Trump spent his Saturday at the Vatican, attending the funeral of Pope Francis along with his wife Melania and leaders from more than 150 countries.

Why doesn't this lightweight reporter say that it was Obama who made it possible for Russia to steal Crimea from Ukraine without even a shot being fired. It was also Liddle' Peter who wrote an absolutely fawning, yet terribly written Biography, on Obama. It was a JOKE! Did Baker ever criticize the Obama Crimea Giveaway?

Are more documents coming?","text":"President Donald Trump this week addressed an unexpected question from a reporter about whether he intends to release more information on Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHis remarks came just days before Virginia Giuffre, one of the first and most prominent survivors of Epstein’s abuse to speak out, died by suicide. \n\nEpstein, a sex offender accused of orchestrating a massive child sex trafficking ring with his associates, died by suicide in 2019 while in custody on federal sex trafficking charges. He was associated with dozens of celebrities and powerful politicians, bringing international interest to the case.\n\nMuch of this interest centered around redacted court documents naming alleged associates and victims known as the “Epstein files.” Attorney General Pam Bondi moved to release some of these documents in February in what she labeled the “first phase” of declassified files — but much of the information was already public.\n\nTrump, when asked by a reporter on April 22 when the public could expect to see the release of more documents, said he would speak to Bondi.\n\n“I don’t know, I’ll speak to the attorney general about that, I really don’t know,” Trump said. \n\nOn January 23, Trump signed an executive order directing the declassification of records surrounding the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n“I do know that we’ve done the RFK, the Kennedy, Martin Luther King is out there very shortly, so we’ll find out,” Trump added. “We’ve really announced we’re doing them in full transparency.”\n\nBondi moved to declassify several documents from Epstein’s criminal prosecution, many of which were already published.\n\nThe files previously published pilot logs related to the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s close associate, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021. The files also included redactions from prosecutors to protect victims. Bondi also published Epstein’s “little black book,” containing names of his alleged associates. However, that too was already published.\n\nOne never-before-seen document was an \"Evidence List,\" a catalogue of evidence obtained by investigators.\n\nItems included a “LSJ logbook,” believed to refer to his private island Little St. James, and a CD labelled “girl pics nude book 4.”\n\nSeveral big names had already been linked to Epstein through previously released documents, including Trump, Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger.\n\nBondi had invited several prominent right-wing influencers to the White House — including “Libs of TikTok” owner Chaya Raichik and Republican activist Scott Presler — to see the documents the day they were released.\n\nBut virtually all of that information was already public, and many Republicans turned to social media to criticize Bondi.\n\n“GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR instead of leaking old info to press,” far-right Representative Anna Paulina Luna wrote on social media at the time.\n\nLuna, who chairs a House Republican-led Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, said the Justice Department did not provide her or her committee with the documents.\n\n“1) If the Epstein files are out, where do we find them? (2) What’s the difference between ‘phase 1’ and ‘phase 2’?” asked Republican Senator Mike Lee. “Will the Epstein files tell us whether he killed himself?”\n\nFar-right influencer Laura Loomer raged that “THERE ARE NO EPSTEIN FILES!!!”\n\nBondi said releasing the first-phase documents “sheds light on Epstein’s extensive network and begins to provide the public with long overdue accountability.” \n\n“This Department of Justice is following through on President Trump’s commitment to transparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators,” she added.\n\nFollowing the release of “phase one,” Bondi reportedly pushed the FBI and her own agency to urgently review and declassify more files, according to ABC News. The FBI enlisted thousands of agents to help with the effort, the outlet reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has vowed to declassify documents in several high-profile cases during his second term.\n\nThis includes the release of 2,200 files related to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, which critics blasted as “just another nothing burger” that revealed little new information.\n\nTrump also promised to release sealed files about the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.","summary":"Epstein was accused of orchestrating a massive child sex trafficking ring","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-epstein-files-virginia-giuffre-pam-bondi-b2740172.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/26/22/26/Vatican-Trump-Pope-kmvjg2xf.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/hEKw50bv-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-27 00:30:40","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.025},{"id":315189478,"title":"Nearly 800 illegal immigrants — including convicted killer and suspected terrorist — arrested in massive Florida ICE raid","text":"In a groundbreaking joint effort, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Miami and Florida law enforcement agencies arrested nearly 800 illegal immigrants during the first four days of Operation Tidal Wave, a massive, multi-agency immigration enforcement crackdown. \n\nFox News obtained information on some of the ICE arrests from the ongoing operation, which include a convicted Colombian murderer, alleged MS-13 and 18th Street gang members and a Russian with an Interpol Red Notice for manslaughter.\n\nJose Sanchez Reyes, a Colombian illegal immigrant who entered the U.S. as a getaway, was convicted of homicide in his home country.\n\nRafael Juarex Cabrera, a Guatemalan illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member, has illegally reentered the U.S. three times and was convicted of felony reentry. \n\nSavva Klishchevskii, a Russian illegal immigrant, has an Interpol Red Notice out of Russia for vehicular manslaughter.\n\nAron Isaak Morazan-Izaguirre, a Honduran illegal immigrant, is a known or suspected terrorist member of the 18th Street gang and has allegedly reentered the U.S. illegally two times.\n\nOperation Tidal Wave remains ongoing, and Florida continues to work with ICE to enhance President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.\n\nOfficials said Customs and Border Protection (CBP) provided “extraordinary support” during the operation, which they claim was highly successful.\n\n“We appreciate our [Department of Homeland Security (DHS)] partner’s commitment to public safety,” ICE wrote in a statement posted to X.\n\nThe announcement was made after two judges were arrested this week for allegedly hiding illegal immigrants from ICE.\n\nMilwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan is charged with obstruction of an official proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent discovery and arrest for allegedly shielding a migrant from ICE agents.\n\nFormer Doña Ana County Magistrate Judge Joel Cano, 68, and his wife, Nancy Cano, 67, were charged with evidence tampering amid allegations they harbored a member of Venezuela’s violent Tren de Aragua gang, Cristhian Ortega-Lopez.","summary":"In a groundbreaking joint effort, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Miami and Florida law enforcement agencies arrested nearly 800 illegal immigrants during the first four days of Operation Tidal Wave, a massive, multi-agency immigration enforcement crackdown. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/26/us-news/nearly-800-illegal-immigrants-arrested-in-massive-florida-ice-raid/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Florida-ICE-Operation.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/171YgdM3-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-27 00:26:25","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.113},{"id":315192536,"title":"World News | Under Patronage of UAE President, Abdullah Bin Zayed Inaugurates 34th Abu Dhabi International Book Fair","text":"Abu Dhabi [UAE], April 27 (ANI/WAM): Under the patronage of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, has inaugurated the 34th edition of the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair (ADIBF), organised by the Abu Dhabi Arabic Language Centre (ALC), from 26 April - 5 May 2025 under the theme: Knowledge Illuminates Our Community.\nHeld at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi, the 2025 edition of the fair has selected the Culture of the Caribbean Basin as Guest of Honour, Ibn Sina as its Focus Personality, and One Thousand and One Nights as its Book of the World.\nAlso Read | 'Vladimir, Stop': Donald Trump Threatens to Deal 'Differently' With Vladimir Putin After Recent Russian Airstrikes on Ukraine.\nSheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan toured the pavilions at the fair and viewed the latest publications from local and international publishing houses.

The event will see significant participation from publishers, with 1,400 publishing houses from 96 countries taking part. The notable turnout reflects the fair's status as a global platform for publishers, intellectuals, and creators, as well as a key destination for launching and promoting new releases, capitalising on its renowned reputation in the international publishing industry and its credibility among book and cultural enthusiasts worldwide.\nMohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of DCT Abu Dhabi, said: \"The Abu Dhabi International Book Fair reflects our shared belief that knowledge is the cornerstone of connection, progress, and understanding. With a rich tapestry of cultural events, this year's edition reaffirms Abu Dhabi's commitment to fostering an inclusive, knowledge-driven society. The theme Knowledge Illuminates Our Community, speaks not only to the power of books to inform and inspire, but also to their unique ability to bring people together--across cultures, languages, and generations. In the Year of Community, we continue to champion the Arabic language, while also celebrating literature's enduring role as a universal source of inspiration and a guiding light for our collective future.\"\nAli bin Tamim, Chairman of the ALC, said: \"Through its various themes and programmes, the Abu Dhabi International Book Fair highlights the level of attention given to the Arabic language, the book and publishing industry, and the creative industries, as part of efforts to serve the community by nurturing a strong connection between the community and the Arabic language as a vital pillar of its cultural identity, rich with authentic values derived from the region's culture and heritage. This edition reflects the UAE's goals and vision to promote cultural diversity, enhance the role of the publishing sector in sustainable development, and accelerate efforts to complete the knowledge-based economy system.\n\"ADIBF's projects and initiatives are in line with the ALC's objectives of enhancing the status and presence of the Arabic language and promoting the culture of reading, tolerance and coexistence. This is showcased through the selection of the great scientist Ibn Sina as the Focus Personality, the most influential Arabic book in the imagination of mankind, One Thousand and One Nights as the Book of the World, and the celebration of the unique Culture of the Caribbean Basin in the Guest of Honour programme to emphasise the human dimension that Abu Dhabi seeks to achieve in all its cultural projects.\"\nThe current edition of the ADIBF embodies Abu Dhabi's cultural vision, firmly positioning the emirate as a destination for Arab culture, a platform of global intellectual exchange, and the promotion of cultural dialogue. The fair's activities cover a wide range of themes - including society, fantasy, sustainability, Arab sciences, artificial intelligence, and innovation - divided across five broad programmes.\nThe Cultural Programme follows the theme Inspire, which organises events in the fields of poetry, literature, arts, translation, and cultural discussions. It includes debates, dialogues, workshops, and lectures led by renowned thinkers, writers, and creatives, offering audiences direct engagement with influential figures and a platform to discuss contemporary cultural issues.\nThis year, the Cultural Programme introduces the first-ever Poetry Majlis, inspired by audience engagement with poetry in previous ALC activities. It also includes poetry evenings focusing on Nabati and classical Arabic poetry, accompanied by music inspired by the poems and their rhythms, in addition to cross-cultural poetry evenings, where Arab poets interact with their international counterparts in an innovative creative exchange across borders.\nAs part of the second edition of the World Book Initiative launched by ADIBF last year, the cultural programme features the renowned book One Thousand and One Nights. It offers the audience an insight into one of the most remarkable products of human imagination, taking readers on a fantastic journey through literature, film, and music.\nThe Podcast from Abu Dhabi programme is also returning for its third season, following the huge success of its previous editions. The programme will feature leading podcasters from the Arab region and around the world, who will present their unique content to engage audiences, discuss inspiring topics, and feed their passion for knowledge, all while providing space for new, younger voices to be heard.\nIn addition to the Focus Personality programme (Ibn Sina) and the Guest of Honour pavilion, the programme includes book signings at the Book Signing Corner where several prominent writers will be available for the public to meet and get their latest publications.\nADIBF's Professional Programme Evolve is designed to cement Abu Dhabi's role as a driver of sustainability in the global publishing industry, offering unparalleled networking opportunities with 1,400 international publishing houses.\nThis programme explores the future of the publishing and creative industries, focusing on the impact of AI through workshops and keynote discussions. It also delves into new opportunities in the digital and creative industries with the inaugural edition of the Digitising Creativity Conference, integrating technology in arts and publishing, and providing participants with valuable insights into growth and innovation strategies. The Business Lounge programme offers a platform for networking and collaboration among publishers.\nIn addition to its educational side, the ADIBF makes room for entertainment with the Creative Arts Programme Create, which showcases heritage-based culinary arts from around the world, along with photography exhibitions and workshops. The Black Box Cinema is also part of the ADIBF, screening a selection of short Arabic films, while the dedicated music programme features performances by outstanding artists throughout the fair.\nThe Children and Youth Programme remains a top priority on the Abu Dhabi ALC's agenda, as part of its strategy to promote passion for the Arabic language and empower young minds to express themselves in Arabic, strengthening their connection to their cultural identity, in line with the UAE's vision of children as the future representatives of the country's civilisation and guarantors of its leading cultural status on the international stage.\nThe Learn theme of the programme offers a magical educational experience for children and youth, combining education with entertainment, offering workshops and interactive activities that highlight the Arabic language in dedicated children and youth areas, namely the Children's Oasis and the Alpha Corner.\nThe Explore pillar of the Exhibitors and Partners Programme highlights the role of government partners in cultural activities, which reinforce links within the global literary community. In a section called Under the Ghaf's Shade, attendees can enjoy unique literary experiences with renowned authors who will read excerpts from their works, interact with the audience, and sign copies of their books.\nThe ADIBF supports the promotion of the Arabic language through innovative programmes that encourage reading and creativity, in line with the UAE's strategy to build a society of avid readers capable of producing Arabic content that keeps pace with digital transformations. The strategy supports emerging literary talents and enriches the Arabic library with publications that reflect the modern era.\nThis year's edition of the event is expected to welcome a record number of visitors exceeding 300,000, which reflects the success of the Abu Dhabi ALC in promoting an interest in knowledge and culture, restoring momentum to book fairs as social and cultural events.

According to a US official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017 and she was marked for removal from the US a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep. Also Read | 'Putin Doesn't Want to Stop the War': Donald Trump Expresses Doubts Vladimir Putin Is Willing to End Ukraine War, Day After Saying Deal Was Close. The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control centre to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem. Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement. HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from. The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman's identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment. The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into US government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station. An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs. In a statement, the Navy said that it \"fully cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities on this matter. We take security and access at naval installations seriously\".

He also called for fervent prayers to avert imminent calamities.\n\nAyodele, who gave the advice in an interview with Sunday Sun, said that criminal elements in the county are plotting to carry major attacks in some parts of the North and other states.\n\nHis words: “Let us pray against a major security crisis in the North. I foresee bombing, shooting and a serious security crisis in the North especially in Kano. The government must beef up security in the North to avoid being taken unawares. Also security should be beefed up around the national mosque. There is a plot by agents of instability to attack the national mosque. We must pray against these.\n\n“Let us pray against landslide in Benue, Abuja and Plateau.\n\n“The security agencies must be watchful in Benue and Plateau states because bandits are still planning a large scale attack in both states.\n\n“Herdsmen attack is also imminent in the Southwest states of Ogun and Lagos. The governments of both states should be vigilant and they must beef up security architectures in the states.”\n\nSpeaking on the hardship in the country, the man of God urged Nigerians to exercise more patience with the current administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, saying respite “is on the horizon for the masses” as the country waddles through the current economic challenge.\n\nPrimate Ayodele, however, warned Nigerians not to be carried away by the promises made by politicians especially those in opposition who parade themselves as messiahs and alternative to the incumbent.\n\nCuriously, Ayodele’s latest revelation came as a major U-turn to his pre-2023 general election prophecy when he warned Nigerians against voting the then All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate whose victory he foretold would be a misadventure and disastrous plunge into a very deep water.\n\n“If Nigerians vote for Tinubu in the 2023 presidential election, he will lead Nigerians into ‘Ibu’, meaning a large body of water,” he had foretold before the presidential polls.\n\nThe popular Nigerian cleric warned Nigerians not to be delusional about the ongoing alignments among politicians in the opposition, saying, “Atiku, Obi, El-Rufai, Bala, Seyi Makinde will make things more difficult for Nigerians, even worse than what Nigerians are going through under Tinubu now.\n\n“Voting for any of these politicians in the next election will be more disastrous. Nigerians must never contemplate the choice of any of these politicians. Rather they should stick with Tinubu. Tinubu’ s second term will be better than his first term. The same Tinubu that has taken Nigeria to where it is now will also bring the nation out of its current situation in his second term. Nigerians should exercise patience.”\n\nHe said as a prophet, he is obliged to declare the revelation given to him.\n\n“I am saying it as it was revealed to me. I don’t have anything to do with Tinubu or his foot soldiers. Some people may view this as a contradiction to my earlier prophecy, but they cannot fault the efficacy and the fulfillment of these prophecies. Everything I foretold has turned out exactly the way I said it.\n\n“When I predicted the coup against Ibrahim Traore of Burkina Faso, it was deemed a fake prophecy by some people, but it happened exactly the way I said it. I also foretold the election of the Gabonese President, which many people also deemed to be fake. I foretold that if he would remove his uniform and contest as a civilian that he would win and it happened just as I said.\n\n“I warned Ghanaians against electing Mahama, but I was not taken seriously. You can see the hardship in Ghana after his election. Just like in Ghana, I also warned the people of Liberia against voting for Joseph Boaki so that the progress made by the immediate past administration would not be derailed, but everyone can see what is going on in that country now. These are indications that Nigerians must not joke with these prophecies,” he pointed out.\n\nAyodele predicted Malam Nuhu Ribadu, National Security Adviser, as the likely successor of President Tinubu.\n\n“After Tinubu, Nuhu Ribadu will take over. Majority of these PDP governors are not going to be with their presidential candidate. APC will lose Anambra State because the people will still vote for (Prof Chukwuma) Soludo.\n\n“The Senate President (Godswill Akpabio) must pray against another scandal.\n\n“Ambode (Akinwunmi) will re-launch his political career if he prays very well,” he predicted.\n\nOn security, Primate Ayodele admonished the president to overhaul the security around himself, warning that his security has been compromised. He also called on the security authorities in the country to be on the alert, saying that “American submarines are on Nigeria’s water. What they are doing there I cannot say. Nigeria must be on the alert because their presence is not in Nigeria’s interest. The President should be very careful about Donald Trump’s government. Nigeria’s security agencies should carry out discreet investigations on this and be watchful.\n\n“Shettima must tread softly to avoid being removed as Tinubu’s Vice President in his second term.\n\n“The wife of the Imo State governor should be careful and vigilant so that she doesn’t fall victim to kidnapping.\n\n“I foresee the removal of the Inspector General of Police.”","summary":"…Shettima, Atiku, Obi, Akpabio, Ribadu, Soludo, Ambode, Uzodimma’s wife too • Calls for urgent, fervent prayers &#160; By Olakunle Olafioye The leader of Inri Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Babatunde Elijah Ayodele, has called on the Federal Government to beef up security in the North and other parts of the country to avoid major security breach.

On March 2, Israel imposed a complete humanitarian blockade on Gaza, stopping the entry of food, medicine and other items from entering the besieged territory. Speaking to CNN, an Egyptian official said that Israel has been invited to meet negotiators on Monday. It is not clear whether Israel has agreed to come or not. An Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel has not received a new offer from the mediators for now. \"Israel only reacts to offers passed on by the mediators,\" the source said.\nEarlier this week, Mossad head David Barnea was in Qatar's capital, Doha, for ceasefire talks. So far, there is no clear indication of a breakthrough.

We're taking care of it.\" The Trump administration, which has been supporting Israel, has provided no details regarding what steps the US is taking to allow the humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. Netanyahu and other officials have maintained that the humanitarian aid blockade in Gaza has been imposed as part of a pressure campaign against Hamas, along with Israel's increased bombardment of Gaza to destroy Hamas and bring back 59 Israeli hostages. Earlier this month, Israel presented a ceasefire proposal that called for the disarmament of Gaza without guaranteeing an end to the war.\nAccording to the Palestinian Health Ministry, over 2111 Palestinians have been killed since Israel resumed its war in Gaza on March 18. Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called Hamas \"sons of dogs\" and called for the disarmament of the group and the release of the Israeli hostages, CNN reported.\nHe called for stopping the \"Israeli genocide that the Gaza Strip is being subjected to\" a top priority. He said that the hostages present an excuse for Israel to attack the Gaza Strip.\nIn a televised speech from Ramallah on April 23, Abbas said, \"Sons of dogs, release the hostages and block their justifications.\"Israel has rejected accusations of genocide, stressing that it is fighting the war in Gaza in self-defence and targets Hamas.\nHe also outlined a vision to create a Palestinian state and demanded an end to the war in Gaza and renewed calls for the unification of Palestinian political factions under the umbrella of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).\nHe also called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. He accused Hamas of inflicting \"severe damage to the Palestinian cause\" since it took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007.

Praised as a step towards bolstering alliances, it has also rattled nerves in South Korea and raised questions about whether Japan’s ambitions are more political than practical.\nAt the heart of the proposal, reportedly unveiled by Nakatani to Hegseth during a meeting in Tokyo on March 30, is a vision of East Asia as a single, interconnected “theatre” of operations. This expansive zone would encompass the East China Sea, South China Sea and the Korean peninsula, where Japan, the United States, and regional allies would collaborate more closely to counter rising military threats.\n“Japan plans to deepen partnerships by viewing Japan, the US, Australia, the Philippines, South Korea and others as [partners focusing on] a single theatre,” Nakatani was quoted as telling Hegseth, who reportedly responded positively to the proposal.\nBut the plan has triggered concerns in South Korea that the mission of US Forces Korea (USFK) could shift from defending against North Korea to containing China.\n\n“This could be read as potentially opening the door to the USFK being deployed in conflicts outside the Korean peninsula, including a possible contingency in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea,” the Korea JoongAng Daily reported.\nMasafumi Iida, director of security studies at Japan’s National Institute for Defence Studies, characterised the “one-theatre” concept as a framework for understanding the region’s security challenges rather than a detailed military plan. As China, Russia and North Korea deepen their strategic cooperation, Iida said that simultaneous military conflicts in areas like the South China Sea and the Korean peninsula could overwhelm existing defence arrangements.\nThe US, allies and partners are not well prepared to respond to simultaneous military conflicts in East Asia,” Iida said.\n“Sharing a one-theatre concept is the crucial first step for these countries to effectively deter any attempts by the revisionist nations to use their military forces simultaneously in this region to overwhelm the status quo nations.”\n\nIn recent years, Russia, China and North Korea have increasingly coordinated their economic and military efforts, challenging what they see as a Western-dominated global order.\nFor Japan and its allies, the “one-theatre” concept represents an attempt to respond to this evolving dynamic.\nChing-Chang Chen, an international-politics professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University, said the proposal was “more political than strategic at this stage”. According to Chen, the idea of aligning the US and its Indo-Pacific allies into a single operational theatre makes sense given that any escalation in one area – such as the Taiwan Strait – is unlikely to remain geographically confined.\n“For a successful invasion of Taiwan to take place, the Chinese military must deny unwanted access to the Taiwan Strait area, which connects the East and South China Seas, by striking at targets such as the neighbouring US forces in Okinawa as early as possible,” Chen said.\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not recognise it as an independent state, but Washington has made commitments to the self-ruled island’s defence.\nWhile Chen acknowledged the concept’s “sensible” logic, he argued that its actual adoption was unlikely in the short term, largely due to South Korea’s opposition and domestic scepticism in Japan.\nSome in Japan saw the proposal as “a dangerous provocation that could drag Japan into a US war with China,” he said.\nSouth Korea’s unease\nSouth Korea’s concerns were “less strategic and more psychological”, Chen said. If a large-scale armed conflict did occur in the Taiwan Strait, he said US forces in South Korea would likely stay put, at least in the initial stage, to deter North Korea “from exploiting a window of opportunity”.\n“The theatre could also be organised into several areas of responsibility in which the [South Korean] forces would have more limited involvement in conflicts outside the vicinity of the Korean peninsula by sharing intelligence or providing rear support,” he said.\n\nThe main concern was the anxiety that the US military commander based in South Korea might be downgraded, Chen said, which would give South Koreans the impression that their country “carries less importance to the US”.\nSouth Korea remains uneasy about any shift in the US-South Korea alliance away from the immediate threat of North Korea towards a broader confrontation with China, according to Alexander Hynd, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne’s Asia Institute who specialises in Korean politics and international relations.\nSuch a move “is not in its interests”, he said of Seoul, adding that Japan was still reeling from Washington’s “hostile” tariff announcements.\nJapan faces a 25 per cent tariff on all vehicles and auto parts exports to the US. Separately, there is a proposed 24 per cent levy on other Japanese goods, which has been paused for 90 days.\nHynd said Japan and other US allies were “scrambling to understand what the US currently wants from them that they are capable of delivering.”\n“The one theatre concept is an answer that the Japanese government has come to,” he added.\nIt’s potentially a ‘win-win’ for the US and Japan\nAlexander Hynd, international relations lecturer\nThe concept may also serve as “a good political gesture” towards the US, Chen said. Amid persistent pressure from Washington for Tokyo to shoulder a greater share of defence costs, the proposal signalled Japan’s willingness to “walk the walk” as a reliable ally.\nEarlier this month, US President Donald Trump reiterated his criticism of America’s security treaty with Japan, labelling it “one-sided” – raising concerns that Tokyo may face demands to increase its financial support for hosting US troops or to further boost its defence spending.\n“It’s potentially a ‘win-win’ for the US and Japan,” Hynd said, noting that it could help bolster US regional power while binding the two allies closer together “amid widespread perceptions that the US is in a period of relative decline”. However, he questioned whether Japan would truly prioritise all parts of the proposed theatre equally.\n“It isn’t clear to me that in reality Japan would care equally about, say, events off the coast of Australia as it does about the East China Sea,” Hynd said.","summary":"Despite US enthusiasm, South Korea fears being drawn into conflicts beyond the Korean peninsula, such as the Taiwan Strait.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3307994/why-japans-unified-defence-zone-proposal-us-makes-south-korea-uneasy","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/25/09eafdda-6518-47f8-bee7-0515892c2004_073f6232.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-27 00:00:09","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.446},{"id":315187790,"title":"Anti-Woke Movement Flips the Script in Hollywood","text":"One of the unintended—but providential—side effects of America’s anti-woke wave isn’t just that companies are walking away from LGBT extremism, but that entertainment is. In a market pivot that’s gone somewhat under the radar, key Hollywood players seem to be quietly turning away from the wokeism that’s financially punished the industry for years. Families in this country want more wholesome options—and, in a surprising twist, producers seem much more willing to provide them.\n\nThe sex, violence, profanity, gay and trans themes, and other vices that have characterized modern entertainment have started to give way to more decent and uncontroversial fare. And audiences are eating it up. While other movies continue to tank at the box office, PG-rated films made up a whopping third of ticket sales in the U.S. in 2024, the highest percentage, Axios points out, since 1995. A quarter of those profits went to animated films, four of which topped the charts as last year’s highest-grossing movies.\n\nEven industry titans like Disney—who, not so long ago, bragged about intentionally “queering” content to indoctrinate kids—have taken some modest steps back from their personal pride parades, reining in recent projects and internal goals. Although the signs of impending doom were all around them (the Mouse House lost a jaw-dropping 700,000 streaming subscribers in the last three months of 2024), very little about CEO Bob Iger’s social agenda changed. After Donald Trump’s landslide election in November, however, alarm bells finally went off.\n\nSuddenly, Disney began rethinking a transgender storyline in its new Pixar series about a middle school softball team, “Win or Lose.” By December, writers of the show had scrapped the idea from their character development altogether. A spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter, “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nIn its place, Iger’s team leaned into explicitly Christian content for the series. To the astonishment of most Americans, one of the team’s girls is shown bowing her head and praying. “Dear Heavenly Father, please give me strength. I have faith, but sometimes the doubt creeps in. I promise I’ll be good, and I uh, won’t do that thing again. I’m not sure where you stand on it, but I WON’T do it. I just want to catch a ball. Or get a hit. For my team, of course.”\n\nIt was the first time in 30 years that a Disney character openly embraced prayer, a move producers hadn’t made since the 1996 classic, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” Ian Giatti noted. That’s not to say Iger’s brand is completely quitting its Human Rights Campaign pals. At another point in the same series, there’s a “love-charged same-sex scene” between the umpire and janitor, Breitbart warns.\n\nBut at least the brand seems to be slowly moving in the right direction. According to its latest U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Disney is dropping its controversial project, “Reimagine Tomorrow,” which was meant to help amplify “some of Disney’s [DEI] commitments and actions,” Fox Business explained. Whether that’s part of a genuine turn away from radical social politics remains to be seen.\n\nIt wouldn’t be entirely far-fetched, given the growing number of content creators who don’t have the stomach for open LGBT extremism anymore. And the data bears that out. According to GLAAD’s—Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation—so-called Studio Responsibility Index, there was a 30% drop in the number of LGBTQ-identifying characters in the movies they tracked (down from 100 to 70) in 2023. The authors complained that Hollywood isn’t doing more to feature their movement, writing, “the overall lack of representation in the kids and family genre is disappointing.” Last year, the 2024 report notes, “GLAAD called for more representation in this area, and rather than stepping up, studios told even fewer LGBTQ stories in kids and family films this year.”\n\nIn some pockets of the industry, executives who are more reluctant to pare down sexually-deviant themes are losing audiences to other networks. Hallmark, which, at one time, had cornered the Christmas market, is watching viewers walk toward the exits. Alternatives like Great American Family, whose leaders pride themselves on sticking to the winning recipe its Gold Crown competitor partially abandoned, is rocketing up the ratings chart.\n\nLast year, while Hallmark stubbornly stuck to same-sex themes in movies “The Holiday Exchange,” “The Groomsmen Trilogy,” “The Holiday Sitter,” “The Christmas House,” and “Notes of Autumn,” Great American Family was busy becoming a Top 25 channel—just three years after it launched. In the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, the network saw a household growth of 19%, a female audience spike of 13%, and a total viewership boom of 21%.\n\nThat’s thanks, in large part, to the president and CEO of Great American Media—and former Hallmark executive—Bill Abbott. During a sit-down with Family Research Council President Tony Perkins on “Washington Watch,” he talked about the evolution of entertainment and what prompted him to leave the once-beloved Kansas City franchise.\n\nAbbott explained that “it used to be that the 9:00 hour or the 10:00 hour was the only place on television that you would see anything even a little bit salacious or violent—or that didn’t meet up to the values of most people.” Now, he shook his head, the standards have really “diminished to now any time of the day.” “Anything goes,” Abbott said. “And actually, the more salacious, the more rewarded the content is in Hollywood, and the more it’s celebrated in so many ways.” It’s really “a race to the bottom” in the industry.\n\nThat wasn’t always the case with Hallmark, but increasingly, the network proved that it wasn’t immune to the Left’s woke pressure campaign. Abbott thought back to when things changed for him there. “We ultimately became the highest-rated network, especially [during] Christmas. And in 2017, there was a dramatic change in terms of the way [that] they were approaching the entertainment landscape.” Leadership “really wanted to become much more ‘diverse’ and abandon the audience that had made us number one.”\n\nAbbott disagreed, knowing very well that the tastes of their audience were family-friendly themes. “[T]hey didn’t want to have a conversation about certain things with their 10-year-old at 9:00 at night during the Christmas season. … A large part of the management team did not agree with the wokeness and really the pursuit of normalizing activity and behavior that [contradicted] the vast majority of the values that we believed our audience held.”\n\nAsked who was driving these changes, Abbott pointed to the family that owned the business. “It was a private company. And so, certainly, as time changed and time moved on, the family became much more liberal. And they wanted to be cool at the cocktail party. And you’re not going to be cool at the cocktail party with faith and family content,” he acknowledged.\n\nAnd yet, Perkins observed, “When the Lord shuts one door, he opens another. You started the Great American Family channel.” Abbott nodded, explaining that the company has “a tremendous group of backers … not only from a viewership point of view, but from a financing point of view.” The network’s chairman, he explained, “is a big believer in the values that we hold dear: faith, family, and country. And so, everything we do is to uplift family. It is to portray faith in a respectable and earnest and really authentic way—and [also] to support … the military and the things that have made the country great over the years. … [A]ll of our content that we create is focused on portraying those elements positively.”\n\nAs one of his most prominent stars, Candace Cameron Bure, put it, “Most networks are not trying to be all things to all people. What really differentiates our channel from some of the other ones out there is that we’re not afraid to talk about God and God’s hand in our lives instead of fate or providence.”\n\nAbbott pointed to another one of their domains acquired in 2023, PureFlix, a streaming service that he describes as “relentlessly faith-focused.” These are movies, he wanted people to know, that only tell stories that “are uplifting, positive, and ultimately make you feel good.” More than a million people are already subscribed—another sign that there’s a booming market for clean and inspiring options.\n\nJust as they’ve done in the corporate world, Americans are rewriting the future of entertainment, breaking the chokehold of woke, offensive, and provocative content with their demand for less edgy, uncomfortable, and divisive themes. Embrace the trend, recent history shows, and be rewarded. Ignore it, and wildfires won’t be the only thing threatening Hollywood.\n\nOriginally published by The Washington Stand.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Only citizens and some legal noncitizens can do so.\n\n“We’ve already made arrests in Minnesota and New York and Colorado, and we’re just getting started,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\n“We’re going to be extremely, extremely aggressive. Now, hopefully it acts as a deterrent also.”\n\nThe USDA is asking states to cross-check Social Security numbers with a death master file and to use the free Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provided by the Department of Homeland Security for noncitizens applying for the benefits, among other steps to verify immigration status.\n\nRollins said it’s “the president’s vision to ensure that we’re being the most efficient and effective with taxpayer dollars.”\n\n“So, we think we’ll be able to cut down on billions of fraud and save the taxpayers a lot of money,” she said. \n\nJohn Walk, acting deputy under secretary for food, nutrition, and consumer services, wrote in a letter Thursday to state SNAP agencies, explaining the existing law. \n\n“By law, only United States citizens and certain lawfully present aliens may receive SNAP benefits. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) established that ‘aliens within the Nation’s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs.’ SNAP is not and has never been available to illegal aliens,” Walk wrote. \n\nThe crackdown comes as there is heightened scrutiny on the eligibility of illegal immigrants for benefits, such as California’s Medicaid program that allows people to enroll without their immigration status being considered, even though it’s funded by state and federal taxpayer dollars.\n\nCalifornia Republicans have said illegal immigrants’ eligibility in the program is responsible for its insolvency, whereas Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said it’s only a factor in a larger healthcare cost issue nationwide.\n\n“The federal government is now paying attention a lot more closely than ever before on how the states are spending the money,” Rollins said. “I am from Texas. I actually have a lot of confidence in the Texas system. I think the red states, honestly, are probably a little more intentional and careful about this. Of course, it’s the blue states that tend to want to put everyone on the taxpayers’ back. And I think that we’ll find a lot more of that moving forward, but hopefully it’s a deterrence for everyone.” \n\nOutside of immigration, SNAP has also faced calls for reform in several states to no longer allow the purchase of “junk food.” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently asked the USDA to allow the state to prohibit the purchase of candy and soda with SNAP benefits, while adding rotisserie chicken to the list of available options.\n\n“President Trump and his administration have put a laser focus on solving America’s chronic disease epidemic, and reforming our food stamp program is a great place to start,” Sanders said in a news release April 15. \n\n“Banning soda and candy from food stamps will remove some of the least healthy, most processed foods from the program and encourage low-income Arkansans to eat better.”","summary":"The United States Department of Agriculture is demanding that states ensure illegal immigrants are not using food stamps.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/26/us-news/trump-wh-demands-crackdown-on-illegal-immigrants-use-snap-cut-down-on-billions-of-fraud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103376573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xBApa38D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-26 23:53:38","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":315189570,"title":"Trump demands ‘free’ transit for US ships through Panama, Suez canals","text":"US President Donald Trump on Saturday called for American military and commercial vessels to be granted free passage through the Panama and Suez canals, directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to act on the issue \"immediately.\"\"American Ships, both Military and Commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals!\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Only a day earlier, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were “very close to a deal.”\n\n“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,” Trump said in a social media post as he flew back to the United States after attending Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican, where he met briefly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nTrump also hinted at further sanctions against Russia.\n\n“It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through “Banking” or “Secondary Sanctions?” Too many people are dying!!!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe new doubts aired by Trump come as the president and top aides intensify their push to come to a deal to end the war that began in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe comments also sharply contrasted with Trump’s positive assessment that the two sides were “very close to a deal” after his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow on Friday.\n\nThe Trump-Zelenskyy conversation on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral was the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders since they argued during a heated Oval Office meeting at the White House in late February. That confrontation led the White House to briefly pause U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.\n\nDays after ordering the pause, Trump also announced he was “strongly considering” imposing new sanctions and tariffs on Russia to try to prod Putin to negotiate in earnest. Trump has not yet followed through on the threat — something even some of his staunch Republican allies are now pressuring him to do. In fact, when Trump announced new global tariffs this month, one major economy he excluded was Russia’s.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Friday urged Trump to “put the toughest of sanctions on Putin,” arguing there is “clear evidence that he is playing America as a patsy.”\n\nIt’s the second time in a matter of days that Trump has rebuked Putin, whom the American president rarely publicly criticizes.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump publicly urged the Russian leader to “STOP!” after a deadly barrage of attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.\n\nAfter their brief meeting Saturday, Zelenskyy’s office had said the U.S. and Ukrainian teams were making arrangements for the leaders to talk again Saturday. But Trump went directly to the Rome airport after the funeral and boarded Air Force One for the 10-hour flight back to the United States.\n\nZelenskyy’s spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, said Trump and Zelenskyy did not meet again in person because of their tight schedules.\n\nZelenskyy called it a “good meeting” on social media after the funeral.\n\n“We discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,” said the Ukrainian leader, who also held talks Saturday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you.”\n\nThe White House said the discussion was “very productive.” The meeting lasted about 15 minutes inside St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican, where Francis often preached the need for a peaceful end to the war, just before Trump and Zelenskyy took their seats at the outdoor funeral service.\n\nThe Vatican long ago had offered to help facilitate peace talks and Francis had regularly called for peace and dialogue from the altar of the basilica. That Trump and Zelenskyy spoke privately, face to face and hunched over on chairs on the marbled floors of the pope’s home, on the day of his funeral, was perhaps a fitting way to honor his wishes.\n\nTrump said on social media, after he arrived in Italy late Friday, that Russia and Ukraine should meet for “very high level talks” on ending the war.\n\nNeither Putin nor Zelenskyy have commented on Trump’s calls for direct talks.\n\nTrump has pressed both sides to quickly come to a war-ending agreement, but while Zelenskyy agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on and has continued to strike at targets inside Ukraine.\n\nPutin did not attend Francis’ funeral. He faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, which has accused him of war crimes stemming from Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement Friday night, Zelenskyy said “very significant meetings may take place” in the coming days, and reiterated his calls for an unconditional ceasefire.\n\n“Real pressure on Russia is needed so that they accept either the American proposal to cease fire and move towards peace, or our proposal — whichever one can truly work and ensure a reliable, immediate, and unconditional ceasefire, and then — a dignified peace and security guarantees,” he said.\n\n“Diplomacy must succeed. And we are doing everything to make diplomacy truly meaningful and finally effective.”\n\nThe meeting Saturday also came shortly after Trump had issued his most definitive statement to date about the need for Ukraine to give up territory to Russia to bring the war to a close. He said in a Time magazine interview published Friday that “Crimea will stay with Russia.”\n\nRussia seized the strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine in 2014, years before the full-scale invasion that began in 2022. Zelenskyy wants to regain Crimea and other Ukrainian territory seized by Russia, but Trump considers that demand to be unrealistic.\n\nRussia has also seized Ukrainian territory in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since invading in February 2022.\n\nReferring to Crimea during the interview, which was conducted at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said, “everybody understands that it’s been with them for a long time,” meaning Russia.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The SSA later clarified these figures were misinterpreted, explaining the records Musk referenced include individuals who, while not receiving benefits, have records lacking a recorded date of death.What To KnowDuring a Wednesday appearance on Flagrant, which was hosted by Schulz, Akaash Singh and Mark Gagnon, Buttigieg provided a detailed explanation about Social Security records.\"Again, DOGE says they make it sound like there's like millions of dead people getting Social Security. Exactly. We're just not. That's just not true.\"Singh then asked: \"So how many are getting? Are there dead people? That's because this seemed to me, fact.\"Buttigieg responded: \"One thing to think about is like, obviously, the vast majority of people who die of old age are getting Social Security the day they die, right? So, like, for at least a minute or a week or a month or however long it takes, right? There's that process of updating. But part of it had to do with how the database was built, and you just didn't necessarily remove everybody from the database. It didn't mean they were getting money, but it meant they were in the database.\"He continued: \"You could twist that into looking like, this is what the president [Donald Trump] did in his speech. Like, it's true there's this database that had all these people from a hundred years ago. It was not true that they were getting checks, okay? But he said the one part, and your brain fills in the blanks, and now you think, 'oh, s*** there's, like...millions of people who are 150 years old getting it was not true.\"During his joint address to Congress in March, President Donald Trump said his administration was investigating widespread fraud in the Social Security program, stating that government databases list millions of beneficiaries at improbable ages, including individuals over 160 years old.\"We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors, and that our seniors and people that we love rely on, \" he said during his speech. \"Over 130,000 people according to the Social Security databases are aged over 160 years old. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119....3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them.\"Trump added that the database shows one person on the rolls aged 360 years. There's no evidence of hundreds of thousands of people over 100 years old collecting benefits illegally. There is no one in the U.S. older than 116.In a statement on February 19, then-acting SSA Commissioner Lee Dudek clarified that individuals listed as over 100 years old in the Social Security system are \"not necessarily receiving benefits,\" but are instead individuals without a recorded date of death.In a March 2015 review, the SSA conceded it has not kept its filings up to date and that death records had not been updated for 6.5 million individuals over the age of 112 who were presumed deceased. The SSA later clarified that these Social Security numbers are not receiving benefits, noting that the agency automatically suspends payments to anyone listed as 115 years old or older.What People Are SayingElon Musk initially brought attention to the SSA's records on dead Social Security number holders in February. On X, he posted a spreadsheet of data showing \"the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to FALSE!\"He added: \"Maybe Twilight is real and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security.\"Pete Buttigieg responded to Musk's attack on the SSA and wrote on X last month: \"What he said about Social Security payments has been repeatedly debunked - so the question isn't whether he's lying about this, the question is why. What is this a pretext for? He and the GOP have long shown interest in going after Social Security. What are they going to try?\"President Donald Trump in a February interview with Fox News: \"Social Security won't be touched, other than if there's fraud or something. It's going to be strengthened. But it won't be touched.\"Rennie Glasgow, a claims technical analyst at the SSA's Schenectady office in New York, recently told The Daily Beast that DOGE's cleanup efforts had mistakenly marked thousands of living Americans as deceased: \"We have people who did not receive benefits come in every day with their ID and say, 'I'm not dead, I'm alive!'\"Glasgow added: \"What used to take 15 days to get done when we send something to a payment center is now taking about 30 to 45.\"What Happens Next?In an X post on April 24, DOGE wrote that it continues to update records: \"For the past 7 weeks, @SocialSecurity has been executing a major cleanup of their records. Approximately 11 million numberholders, all listed age 120+, have now been marked deceased. Another ~1.4 million to go with expected completion in 2 weeks.\"","summary":"Buttigieg's explanation comes amid controversy surrounding DOGE, which has been conducting what it calls \"a major cleanup\" of Social Security records.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-pete-buttigieg-explanation-social-security-flagrant-viral-2064657","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2634001/pete-buttigieg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 23:38:43","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":315183968,"title":"'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'?

Remembering Francis’s often repeated mantra – that in his church there was ‘room for everyone’ – I felt as welcome as any of the clerics and devotees amassed below the colonnade. \n\nIndeed, immersed in this ambience of total harmony and awed by the magnitude of an occasion whose traditions date back two millennia to the saint who gave the square its name, I’m not ashamed to admit that emotion momentarily overcame me, and a teardrop smudged my notepad.\n\nI was far from alone. As the mass began and 14 pallbearers carried the Pope’s simple, cypress wood coffin into position, to the lilting chants of the choir, I saw several other supposedly hard-bitten and detached journalists discreetly dabbing their eyes.\n\nHere was a man so steeped in the virtues of ordinariness and simplicity that he had stipulated that, along with his ornate funeral robes, must be buried in the scuffed, tread-worn orthopaedic boots he had worn in his later years.\n\nA pope who rode around in the sort of cars driven by his least well-off subjects, lived frugally, and loved football, ‘the people’s game’, so much that, in addition to the pomp and pageantry we witnessed yesterday, he wishes to be remembered with a charity match.\n\nIt was this earthiness that won people’s hearts. Driving me towards St Peter’s Square, my taxi driver pointed out Santa Marta, the unprepossessing lodging house where Francis, who eschewed the luxury of the Vatican apartments, chose to reside.\n\n‘The Holy Father was happy to live in a shoebox while his cardinals complain that their huge homes aren’t big enough,’ he said, adding that he would be abandoning the cab to pay his respects. \n\nThe atmosphere around ‘the square’, as Francis liked to call it, had begun to build on Friday evening when people bedded down on the marble flagstones to be sure of their place when the gates opened at 5.30 the next morning. It was a bitterly cold night, but they didn’t care, singing Christian songs to pass the time.\n\nAndrea Favaretto, 50, and his wife Eva, 42, who had driven five hours from the northern city of Treviso, huddled under a gold foil blanket from the emergency kit in their car-boot. ‘It’s important for us to be here,’ Andrea said.\n\n‘The Pope was one of the common people, like us.’\n\nArriving in St Peter’s Square just after dawn yesterday, the first recognisable person I saw was Joe Biden, a staunch Catholic, who arrived long before the other important mourners and wandered about looking a little lost. \n\nSoon, however, the front of cobbled piazza began to fill up and I found myself talking with Annamaria Puri Purini, a veteran Vatican PR who met the Pope many times and saw different sides of his character.\n\n‘He was always nice with me, but he had a very short temper and could fly off the handle,’ she said. ‘I remember one time when a nun threw out some flowers because she thought they were withering. The Holy Father got so angry that he made her cry.’\n\nSomehow, amid all the eulogising, it was reassuring to hear a story like this. A reminder that, as he often told people, he really did have his faults.\n\nBy 8.30am, as a Vatican flunky indiscreetly vacuumed the red carpet surrounding the altar, the steady trickle of world leaders brought my binoculars into use.\n\nAt previous papal funerals, royals sat apart from the politicians and the Catholics among them were afforded front-row seats. \n\nBut in another egalitarian break with tradition yesterday, faith and blue blood didn’t come into play, and the unaccompanied Prince William was positioned beside German chancellor Olaf Scholz.\n\nThe place with the best view of the ceremony went to the Pope’s compatriot, Argentina’s bouffant-haired president Javier Milei (escorted as always by his sister), a hardline Right-winger who somewhat uncomfortably despised Francis’s supposed wokery and once called him ‘evil’.\n\nBut, hey, this was a day for reconciliation, and Milei last night claimed the Pope had privately forgiven his words as those of the ‘mistakes of youth’ – a bit odd, we might think, given that he is 54.\n\nWith the service due to begin at 9am, a frisson of excitement through the colonnade, for the Trumps still hadn’t shown up.\n\nThankfully, however, there was a short delay and he and the veiled First Lady Melania, who turned 55 yesterday, took their seats just before the coffin was carried out of the basilica and placed in front of the altar.\n\nIn keeping with the ‘pathetic fallacy’ that the weather mirrors events, the casket emerged just as the last few puffs of cloud dissipated, leaving a cobalt sky disturbed only by soaring swallows and a solitary drone, presumably there for security.\n\n‘I hope it’s one of ours,’ the reporter next to me quipped, momentarily puncturing the solemnity.\n\nNow Cardinal Re was incensing the altar and an open book of the Gospel was placed on the coffin, its pages fluttering ethereally in a gathering breeze.\n\nThough age-old tradition dictated many aspects of the service, at Francis’s behest there were marked differences with past papal funerals and decidedly less pomp.\n\nSymbols and titles deemed superfluous were eliminated and there was more focus on the word of God and the Resurrection.\n\nFor all the evident pageantry, it was a comparatively stripped-down ceremony that reflected the Pope’s character. \n\nCardinal Re delivered his homily with a steadiness of tone that belied his 91 years. He had penned it personally, and his affection and admiration for Francis resonated with every passage.\n\nThe cardinal spoke of the Pope’s ‘charisma’ and his unique way of ‘welcoming and listening’, saying that the ‘guiding thread of his mission was a home for all, its doors always open’.\n\nRecalling how Francis’s first apostolic mission had been to the island of Lampedusa, off the southern tip of Italy – the first stop on the migrant trail from Africa – he said the Pope’s ‘exhortations in favour of refugees and displaced persons’ were ‘countless’.\n\n‘He was a pope among the people with an open heart towards everyone. Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today’s challenges… he gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people’s hearts in a direct and immediate way,’ Cardinal Re said.\n\n‘The final image we have of him, which will remain etched in our memory, is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday, when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of St Peter’s Basilica. \n\nHe then came down to this square to greet the large crowd gathered for the Easter Mass while riding in the open-top popemobile.’ \n\nThe applause that followed his eulogy rippled all the way to the back of the square and along the Via della Concilazione, the broad avenue sweeping down to the River Tiber.\n\nThe two-hour proceedings were brought to a thunderous close with clangs from the huge St Peter’s bell and handshakes of peace among the congregation. \n\nBut then, momentarily, a strange silence descended over the vast crowd, as if they had been dumbfounded by all they had experienced and weren’t sure what to do.\n\nAs they gathered themselves and began to disperse, the coffin was hoisted aboard a flatbed truck and driven for three miles – at little more than walking pace, so people thronging the streets could also pay their respects – to the Basilica Santa Maria Maggiore, its final resting place. \n\nWaiting beside its central door, clutching white roses, were dozens of people on the lowest rung of Italian society: homeless migrants, convicted criminals, those who have suffered discrimination because of their gender. \n\nIn a hugely symbolic final gesture, Francis had decreed that these marginalised members of society should be among the last ones to see his casket before it was interred in a simple white marble tomb cut into the basilica’s floor.\n\nAs his grave was being sealed, news emerged that a second session of talks between Trump and Zelensky, expected to follow the funeral, would not go ahead.\n\nFor a moment, hearts sank, for it seemed the hard realities of the world had returned. But then came Trump’s about-turn as he criticised Vladimir Putin.\n\nNo doubt Francis would have played up the positives.\n\nFor a couple of hours, delegates from Russia, Ukraine and America had prayed side by side.\n\nAnd the Pope of Peace would have considered that to be progress.","summary":"For two unforgettable hours yesterday, as sun poured down on the Vatican, a bitterly divided world came together.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14651349/Beneath-glorious-cobalt-skies-disturbed-Romes-soaring-swallows-250-000-turned-say-goodbye-Pope-Francis.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/26/21/97734403-0-image-a-13_1745698863674.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 23:32:34","author":"David Jones,Editor","authors":["David Jones","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.254},{"id":315183070,"title":"Trump demands free passage via Suez Canal","text":"President Donald Trump has claimed that neither the Panama nor Suez Canal would “exist” without the United States, demanding that American commercial and military vessels be allowed to pass through the crucial waterways totally free of charge.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his intention to “take back” control of the Panama Canal, using economic or military means if necessary. On Saturday, the US president’s desire to protect American “national security” interests from Chinese competition extended to another strategic waterway – Egypt’s Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.\n\n“American ships, both military and commercial, should be allowed to travel, free of charge, through the Panama and Suez Canals! Those canals would not exist without the United States of America,” the president said in a Truth Social post.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio was already instructed “to immediately take care of, and memorialize [sic], this situation,” Trump added.\n\nTrump did not elaborate on how exactly Washington ensured the existence of the Suez Canal, which was conceived, financed and built without US involvement in the 1850s. It operated under French, British, and later Egyptian control, all without American construction or funding. The US, however, led an international mine-clearing effort in the waterway following the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel in 1973.\n\nThe construction of the Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was indeed carried out by the US in the early 20th century after an initial French project stalled. The canal was transferred to Panamanian control in 1999 under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which stipulated that it would remain neutral and open to all nations.\n\nTrump and US officials have argued that China’s economic activities – including infrastructure projects and port operations – may violate the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty, which grants the US the right to “defend” the waterway.\n\nPanamanian officials have previously rejected Trump’s assertions and threats, while the Panama Canal Authority maintains that the canal is operated solely by Panamanians, with no evidence supporting claims of Chinese control. President Jose Raul Mulino has stated that the canal is part of Panama’s “inalienable patrimony” and stressed that the country maintains full control over its operations.\n\nHowever, after Rubio personally delivered Trump’s ultimatum to Panama in February, Mulino made a concession to Washington by refusing to renew the country’s 2017 agreements with China under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nEarlier this month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that multiple US Navy vessels, Coast Guard assets, and aircraft have been deployed in and around Panama as part of “bold first steps to revive our defense and security ties between our countries.”","summary":"President Donald Trump has claimed that neither the Panama nor Suez Canal would “exist” without the United States \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/616379-trump-suez-panama-canal/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/680d6af985f540258c2bd461.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 23:24:13","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":315187994,"title":"'Thank you, POTUS': Trump and Zelenskyy discuss ceasefire and lasting peace","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nBig Weekend Show April 26, 2025 05:37 \n\n 'Thank you, POTUS': Trump and Zelenskyy discuss ceasefire and lasting peace \n 'The Big Weekend Show' panelists discuss President Donald Trump meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about a 'full and unconditional ceasefire' while in Vatican City.\n Tags POLITICSSHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE BIG SATURDAY SHOW | VIDEOUKRAINEDONALD TRUMP","summary":"&apos;The Big Weekend Show&apos; panelists discuss President Donald Trump meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about a &apos;full and unconditional ceasefire&apos; while in Vatican City.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371982977112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/583bef4f-4d73-4119-802f-a8bc9ed2b760/b00082e7-d463-4cc8-b972-eabbc403f888/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 23:19:26","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.519},{"id":315181050,"title":"Musk says DOGE’s work recalls Clinton-era cuts.

The problem is not even his sloppy disclosure of war plans to people outside the military command structure. No, Hegseth knew the culprit: “the deep state.”\n\nThe former Fox News host’s invocation of the “deep state” is familiar territory for conservatives over the past few years. President Donald Trump loves talking about the so-called “deep state.” According to the Trump Twitter archive, Trump referenced the “deep state” at least 95 times in social media posts made between November 2017 and October 2024.\n\nTrump told millions that the “deep state” had performed a “coup” against him in stealing the 2020 election, which he lost (fair and square) to Joe Biden. He has also claimed that the “deep state” was behind the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, and that the “deep state” was behind delays at the Food and Drug Administration responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his second presidency, Trump has signed executive orders purportedly curtailing the actions of the “deep state” by firing civil service employees within the federal government.\n\nIn addition to being invoked by Hegseth and Trump, the “deep state” boogeyman has been singled out by adherents to the QAnon conspiracy, who believe that the shadowy group is behind outlandish and ghoulish crimes like stealing children—ideas that echo old antisemitic tropes. Trump has welcomed some disgraced QAnon figures, like retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, back into the fold, giving the conspiracy a foothold within the federal government.\n\nThe right argues that the deep state is a network of operatives inside the federal government, tweaking and controlling world events for their sinister agenda, which is usually left-wing and/or communist in nature. By design, the right avoids specifics on who precisely the deep state is; it could be people as prominent as former Presidents Joe Biden or Barack Obama, or merely a grocery store clerk doing the bidding of the New World Order.\n\nIn reality, it is a catchall phrase for failure.\n\nRecently, the mainstream right has merged with what was previously the fringe right, embodied by figures like conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. For decades, Jones and his ilk have preached to their audiences about the “deep state,” which has purportedly coordinated events like the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, earthquakes, the 9/11 attacks, and multiple mass shootings.\n\nNow Republicans bring up the “deep state” when they can’t get the job done. To them, when they lose elections, it isn’t because voters rejected them—no, it’s because the “deep state” manipulated voting machines and stuffed ballot boxes. To them, when Trump mishandles the response to a pandemic, it isn’t his fault for underestimating the virus or attacking safety procedures—no, it’s because of the “deep state.” And to them, when the defense secretary blabs about military maneuvers on an unsecured app, the fact that the public knows about it is the dastardly work of the “deep state.”\n\nConservatives refuse to take responsibility for their failures. It’s easier for them to blame the “deep state” and rile up the most diehard followers to fight an invisible force supposedly making everything so terrible.\n\nThen the right can coast along without needing to change their behavior. After all, “the deep state” did it.","summary":"Explaining the Right is a weekly series that looks at what the right wing is currently obsessing over, how it influences politics—and why you need to know.\n\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared on Fox News on Tuesday to discuss the true culprit behind his rocky nomination and scandal-plagued tenure as America’s Pentagon chief.\n\n\n\nThe problem isn’t his own personal conduct, including an allegation of assault, nor is it his embrace of bigoted policies.

Liddle’ Peter Baker, the very biased and untalented writer for The Times, followed his editor’s demands and wrote that Ukraine should get back territory, including, I suppose, Crimea, and other ridiculous requests,\" the US leader wrote in a post on his Truth Social page, commenting on The New York Times article, in which the authors adhered to pro-Ukrainian rhetoric.\n\nTrump's position on Crimea\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph, the United States was to present in London a seven-point plan to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, including the US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, at talks in London on April 23. Vladimir Zelensky rejected this possibility the day before, and then, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to travel to the UK, The New York Times reported. It was noted that the US side at the meeting would be represented by US presidential special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg.\n\nOn April 23, Trump said that Zelensky's comments that Ukraine would not recognize Crimea as Russian were bad for negotiations \"in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Obama and is not even a point of discussion.\"\n\nThe next day, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed out that Trump's words about Crimea's ownership not even being a point of discussion now were fully in line with Russia's position on the issue. As Trump later said in an interview with Time magazine, Zelensky understands that Crimea will remain in Russia's possession.\n\nOn March 16, 2014, a referendum was held on the peninsula’s reunification with Russia. Over 80% of voters participated in the plebiscite, the overwhelming majority of whom supported reunification (96.7% in Crimea and 95.6% in Sevastopol). On March 18, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty on the admission of Crimea and Sevastopol to Russia, and on March 21, the document was ratified by the Federal Assembly. Despite the convincing results of the referendum, reflecting the clear will of the local population, Kiev has refused to recognize Crimea as part of Russia.","summary":"US president commented on The New York Times article, in which the authors adhered to pro-Ukrainian rhetoric","url":"https://tass.com/world/1949941","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 22:46:25","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":315184136,"title":"Inside Trump’s whirlwind trip to the pope’s funeral: Biden, Melania’s birthday and a Zelensky rematch","text":"When then-President Joe Biden attended the funeral of the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2022, Donald Trump complained about the seating arrangements. \n\nHe argued that Biden’s spot, several rows from the front, showed “no respect” and indicated that the United States was no longer being taken seriously.\n\n“If I were president, they wouldn’t have sat me back there — and our Country would be much different than it is right now!” Trump said at the time. “In Real Estate, like in Politics and in Life, LOCATION IS EVERYTHING!!!”\n\nThe president appeared to get his wish for the funeral of Pope Francis funeral on Sunday, when he was seated in the front row, with Biden, yet again, seated a few rows back. The two presidents did not appear to acknowledge one another, despite clearly being within each other’s line of sight.\n\nTrump seemingly didn’t even know Biden was going. He didn’t offer him a ride on Air Force One.\n\n“Oh, he is? I didn’t know,” Trump told reporters on the plane on his way to Rome. Meeting Biden in Italy was “not high on my list,” he said.\n\nHundreds of foreign dignitaries and world leaders made their way to Vatican City for the funeral, attended by roughly 250,000 people. It was Trump’s first international trip of his second presidency — and it was short. He was out of there within 14 hours.\n\nIt was also Melania Trump’s 55th birthday. By the end of the whirlwind trip, when they landed back on U.S. soil, the couple parted ways immediately after stepping off Air Force One.\n\nThe trip also arrived in the middle of growing tensions between the United States and longtime allies after his controversial tariff policies threatened to blow up international trade partnerships. But the funeral didn’t stop the president and his counterparts from exchanging warm greetings.\n\nThe pope’s funeral marked the first time Trump and Biden were in the same place since Trump’s second inauguration in January.\n\nThe last funeral of a sitting pope in 2005 offered more bipartisanship as former President Bill Clinton flew on Air Force One alongside sitting President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush.\n\nBiden, the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy, attended the proceedings alongside former First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nThe former president, who regularly attends mass, has long admired Francis, a man with similar views on the climate crisis, immigration, and helping the less fortunate. After Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, Francis comforted the Biden family and met privately with Biden to discuss cancer research. Biden also displayed a photo of Francis in the Oval Office.\n\nBut Biden still appeared to be in good spirits at the funeral while greeting world leaders and smiling for selfies.\n\nTrump, who was raised and confirmed as a Presbyterian, said in 2020 that he’s now a non-denominational Christian. \n\nThe president met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in St. Peter’s Basilica, their first one-on-one meeting since last month’s now-infamous showdown in the Oval Office, when the president and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky in front of a roomful of reporters.\n\nSitting in two red chairs on the marble floor, the two leaders were photographed Saturday bent towards each other, seemingly deep in conversation.\n\nThe discussion ahead of the funeral didn’t last long, and neither the White House nor the Ukrainian administration revealed precisely what was said.

The two presidents did not appear to acknowledge one another, despite clearly being within each other’s line of sight.\n\nTrump seemingly didn’t even know Biden was going. He didn’t offer him a ride on Air Force One. \n\n“Oh, he is? I didn’t know,” Trump told reporters on the plane on his way to Rome. Meeting Biden in Italy was “not high on my list,” he said.\n\nHundreds of foreign dignitaries and world leaders made their way to Vatican City for the funeral, attended by roughly 250,000 people. It was Trump’s first international trip of his second presidency — and it was short. He was out of there within 14 hours. \n\nIt was also Melania Trump’s 55th birthday. By the end of the whirlwind trip, when they landed back on U.S. soil, the couple parted ways immediately after stepping off Air Force One.\n\nThe trip also arrived in the middle of growing tensions between the United States and longtime allies after his controversial tariff policies threatened to blow up international trade partnerships. But the funeral didn’t stop the president and his counterparts from exchanging warm greetings. \n\nThe pope’s funeral marked the first time Trump and Biden were in the same place since Trump’s second inauguration in January. \n\nThe last funeral of a sitting pope in 2005 offered more bipartisanship as former President Bill Clinton flew on Air Force One alongside sitting President George W. Bush and his father, former President George H.W. Bush. \n\nBiden, the first Catholic president since John F. Kennedy, attended the proceedings alongside former First Lady Jill Biden.\n\nThe former president, who regularly attends mass, has long admired Francis, a man with similar views on the climate crisis, immigration, and helping the less fortunate. After Biden’s son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, Francis comforted the Biden family and met privately with Biden to discuss cancer research. Biden also displayed a photo of Francis in the Oval Office.\n\nBut Biden still appeared to be in good spirits at the funeral while greeting world leaders and smiling for selfies. \n\nTrump, who was raised and confirmed as a Presbyterian, said in 2020 that he’s now a non-denominational Christian. \n\nThe president met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in St. Peter’s Basilica, their first one-on-one meeting since last month’s now-infamous showdown in the Oval Office, when the president and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky in front of a roomful of reporters.\n\nSitting in two red chairs on the marble floor, the two leaders were photographed Saturday bent towards each other, seemingly deep in conversation.\n\nThe discussion ahead of the funeral didn’t last long, and neither the White House nor the Ukrainian administration revealed precisely what was said. But the meeting came after several days of public statements about a possible ceasefire, with Trump recently cautioning Russian president Vladimir Putin following strikes on civilians in Kyiv. Trump has also suggested Ukrainians should give up Crimea and other regions as part of a peace deal, a non-starter for Zelensky and his administration. \n\nThe president and First Lady Melania Trump stayed the night at the U.S. ambassador's residence after arriving shortly after 11 p.m. on Friday, ahead of the funeral the following morning. \n\nThe Trumps were attending the funeral of a man they had only met once, in May 2017, just months into Trump’s first term. \n\nAs they arrived, the first lady wore a black double-breasted trench dress and a black veil.\n\nTrump was one of the few world leaders not dressed in black.

It's up to you,'\" Toroama said. \n\nEven though the mine has been dormant since 1989, it's still estimated to hold 5.84 million tons of copper and nearly 20 million ounces of gold, which would be worth around $60 billion. \n\nKuhns has a newfound optimism for a deal between Bougainville and the US, likening potential cooperation to President Trump's proposed mineral agreements with Ukraine.\n\n'Given President Trump's interest in securing tangible returns for American diplomatic and military support, Bougainville represents a low-cost, high-yield strategic investment,' Kuhns said.\n\n'It's exactly the type of deal that fits Trump's vision - affordable, strategically invaluable and economically beneficial.' \n\nBougainville is a lush cluster of about 200 islands and has remained largely unknown to most of the world. \n\nBeneath its serene tropical façade lies a history marked by a devastating civil war, ongoing economic challenges and renewed global attention due to its vast natural resources - a region increasingly contested by China and Western powers.\n\nKuhns first arrived in Bougainville in 2015 on what seemed an unrelated business venture. \n\nWhile he saw the aftermath of the deadly conflict, he also saw a chance for the locals there to make something new. \n\n'They had fought a civil war and won the right to an independence referendum, but they hadn't gotten their act together economically, and they were afraid they'd run out of time,' Kuhns said.\n\nSeeing both opportunity and purpose, Kuhns founded Numa Numa Resources in 2018, a company dedicated to revitalizing Bougainville's struggling economy and supporting the islanders' long-held independence aspirations.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Kuhns met Toroama, a legendary figure widely revered across Bougainville as the commander of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army during the civil war. \n\nToroama had transitioned from military leader to respected community mediator. After witnessing Toroama expertly navigate a complex business dispute, Kuhns identified him as a natural political leader.\n\n'I asked him if he'd ever thought about being involved in politics because he was a natural,' Kuhns says. \n\n'He told me about his unsuccessful run for president in 2015, and I said, 'Well, if you ever reconsider, I'm sure my shareholders would be interested in backing you.' \n\nWith Kuhns's backing, Toroama ran again for president and emerged victorious in 2020. \n\nTheir partnership quickly solidified around two intertwined goals: rebuilding Bougainville's economy through vital infrastructure projects, and securing international diplomatic support to turn the dream of independence into reality.\n\nIn late 2023, Kuhns orchestrated President Toroama's visit to Washington, D.C., arranging high-level talks with the Biden administration and the Special Select Congressional Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, chaired by Congressman Mike Gallagher.\n\nTheir diplomatic mission aimed to demonstrate to U.S. policymakers the viability of an independent Bougainville and its strategic importance in countering China's regional ambitions.\n\nKuhns highlighted the archipelago's extraordinary natural wealth - particularly the Panguna mine, home to roughly $60 billion in copper, gold and silver reserves - as well as its strategic deep-water port at Lolo.\n\n'Bougainville has the best deep-water port in the third island chain,' Kuhns emphasized. 'There are island chains that ring Asia and essentially protect China from us, and protect us from China.' \n\nThough initial talks with the Biden administration produced limited results, Kuhns remains optimistic due to shifting political circumstances, especially under former President Trump's strategic approach to foreign policy. \n\nThe urgency of American involvement is underscored by China's growing influence across the Pacific. \n\nKuhns disclosed persistent Chinese attempts to seize control of the Panguna mine through questionable means, likening it to the fate of nearby Solomon Islands.\n\n'China has tried multiple times to corruptly acquire the mine,' Kuhns warned. 'They'd love to take over Bougainville like they did our neighbors, the Solomon Islands. The Solomon Islands is gone as a country the West can depend on - they're in China's thrall until further notice.'\n\nDecisive U.S. action, he believes, is crucial to preventing a similar scenario in Bougainville.\n\nBeyond diplomacy, Kuhns's company has initiated essential economic development projects designed to demonstrate Bougainville's readiness for independence.\n\nCentral among these is a groundbreaking infrastructure initiative — the first major road constructed in over 40 years connecting isolated communities across Bougainville Island.\n\n'When we started constructing the road, local women - who previously walked hours just to buy basic goods - were literally in tears,' Kuhns recounted. 'Roads, hospitals, education - these are essentials for any developing nation.' \n\nDespite previous setbacks under the Biden administration, Kuhns remains highly optimistic about a potential collaboration with Trump.\n\nStrong congressional support from key figures like Congressman Gallagher and Congressman Neil Dunn bolsters his conviction that Bougainville's independence is attainable.\n\nKuhns is actively planning another strategic trip to Washington, confident that the evolving political climate favors Bougainville's cause. \n\nHe argues that decisive American support would shift the balance dramatically, compelling Papua New Guinea's parliament - which has stalled on recognizing Bougainville's overwhelming 98 percent pro-independence vote - to finally relent.\n\n'If the U.S. was to support Bougainville, PNG would have no real argument,' Kuhns asserts. 'Then the world would say, \"Just let them go.\"' \n\nUltimately, Kuhns sees Bougainville not merely as another aspiring nation but as a beacon of successful self-determination. Through strategic alliances and sustained economic growth, he believes Bougainville could reshape Pacific geopolitics.\n\n'With the right support,' Kuhns concludes confidently, 'Bougainville's independence isn't just possible; it's inevitable.","summary":"After a decade on an island loaded with $120 billion in gold, John Kuhns is urging Trump to buy the isle and secure a strategic win over

to 'profound' Pope Francis as 400,000 mourners gather for touching Vatican funeral","text":"Pope Francis was eulogised as a pontiff “among the people, with an open heart towards everyone” during a moving funeral that brought the world to a standstill.\n\nThe first South American to lead the Roman Catholic Church was laid to rest on Saturday afternoon following his death last Monday at the age of 88.\n\nHeads of state, royalty and religious leaders joined 400,000 mourners in Vatican City to bid Francis a final farewell after his 12-year papacy. \n\nThe crowd erupted into applause as Francis’ wooden casket — marked with a white cross — was carried by pallbearers from the altar of St Peter’s Basilica, where it had lain in state for three days, to St Peter’s Square for the open-air ceremony.\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Prince of Wales and French president Emmanuel Macron were among the foreign dignitaries who attended the solemn day.\n\nThere was also a salient encounter between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky on the marble floor of St Peter’s Basilica.\n\nShortly before the procession, the two men sat on chairs inside the basilica and held a 15-minute meeting just yards from His Holiness.\n\nMr Zelensky said the conversation had the \"potential to become historic\", as Mr Trump continues to push for a deal between Russia and Ukraine to end the three-year-long conflict.\n\nNo details of the one-to-one were shared, but Professor Father Francesco Giordano — who attended the funeral — told Sky News the meeting had been a \"miracle\".\n\nAlso in attendance for the funeral was Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who spent years holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London before being imprisoned at Belmarsh Prison, and his wife and children.\n\nHe said they visited the Italian capital to “express our family’s gratitude for the Pope’s support during Julian’s persecution”.\n\nOther guests included former US president Joe Biden, Argentinian president Javier Milei and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nCrowds had gathered in nearby streets for the funeral as early as 5am, including nuns and pilgrims.\n\nMore than 8,000 police officers were out in force, as well as firefighters, medics and volunteers.\n\nSpeaking during the 90-minute requiem mass, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91, said Francis “incessantly raised his voice” for peace and urged people to “build bridges not walls”.\n\nHe spoke of Francis’s care for refugees, his pleas for peace and the importance of protecting the climate.\n\n“The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this Earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts,” Cardinal Battista added.\n\nHe blessed the Pope's coffin with holy water, before burning incense in a thurible.\n\nThe basilica's bells then tolled three times after the blessing of the coffin was conducted.\n\nAfter the service ended, Francis' coffin arrived at St Mary's Major Basilica where he was buried near an icon of the Virgin Mary at around 3pm. \n\nMembers of the public will be able to visit Francis’ tomb from Sunday before 130 cardinals gather to elect the next Bishop of Rome, in a process known as the conclave. \n\nFrancis lies entombed in an undecorated niche that until now has been used to store candlestick holders, inscribed only with his papal name in Latin: Franciscus.","summary":"Heads of state, royalty and religious leaders joined 400,000 mourners in Rome

The Vatican said that “a group of the poor and the needy” would be on the steps of St. Mary Major Basilica to pay homage to the first Jesuit and first Latin American pope before his burial in the church.\n\nPope Francis chose his place of burial in St. Mary Major Basilica, near an icon of the Madonna that he revered, because it reflects his “humble, simple and essential’’ life, the archbishop who administers the basilica said Friday.\n\nThe Holy See press office said that the poor had a special place in Francis’ heart. He had chosen for his papacy the name of the medieval Italian saint who famously renounced his family’s wealth when he joined the church.\n\nAlready, long lines of the faithful have paid their homage to Francis, who died Monday at age 88, over the three days that his body was lying in state in a simple wooden coffin inside St. Peter’s Basilica.\n\nFrom the beginning of his papacy in 2013, Francis won over many around the world, Catholic or not, with his advocacy for migrants and the environment. His legacy was more mixed on the topics of clergy sexual abuse and LGBTQ+ outreach, which made waves for increasing inclusion but some criticized for not going far enough.","summary":"From some of the world’s most powerful leaders to those on society’s margins whom Pope Francis always made a point to minister to, hundreds of thousands of people participated at the Vatican Saturday for his funeral rites.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/26/from-mightiest-to-humblest-hundreds-of-thousands-gather-for-pope-francis-funeral/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pope-funeral-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 22:30:51","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.217},{"id":315183372,"title":"US, Iran clash over uranium enrichment, missile program at talks — newspaper","text":"NEW YORK, April 27. /TASS/.

Martin Luther King Jr. speak out against the city’s segregated school system and the entrenched poverty in poor communities.\n\nSixty years on, Lucas was back on the Boston Common on Saturday to celebrate the anniversary of what became known as the 1965 Freedom Rally. He joined others in calling for continued activism against many of the same injustices and inequities that King fought against, and in criticizing President Donald Trump and his administration for current divisions and fears about race and immigration across the country.\n\n“The message was … that we still have work to do,” said Lucas, 75. “It was a lot of inspiration by every speaker out there.”\n\nThe gathering drew several hundred people on a rainy and windy day, conditions similar to those during the 1965 event. It was preceded by a march by a smaller group of people, mostly along the route taken to the Boston Common 60 years earlier. Up to 125 different organizations took part.\n\nRally-goers urge activism\n\nKing’s son, Martin Luther King III, gave a keynote speech, saying he never thought racism would still be around and on the rise like it is today.\n\n“We must quadruple our efforts to create a more just and humane society,” he told the crowd. “We used to exhibit humanity and civility, but we have chosen temporarily to allow civility to be moved aside. And that is not sustainable, my friends.”\n\nHe added, “Today, we’ve got to find a way to move forward, when everything appears to be being dismantled, it seems to be attempting to break things up. Now, you do have to retreat sometimes. But dad showed us how to stay on the battlefield, and mom, throughout their lives. They showed us how to build community.”\n\nThe gathering was near the site of a 20-foot-high memorial to racial equity, which shows Martin Luther King Jr. embracing his wife, Coretta Scott King.\n\nU.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the work of 1960s civil rights leaders remains unfinished, with too many people still experiencing racism, poverty and injustice.\n\n“We are living through perilous times,” she said. “Across the country, we are witnessing … a dangerous resurgence of white supremacy, of state-sanctioned violence, of economic exploitation, of authoritarian rhetoric.”\n\n1965 protest brings civil rights movement to the Northeast\n\nThe original protest rally in 1965 brought the civil rights movement to the Northeast, a place Martin Luther King Jr. knew well from his time earning a doctorate in theology from Boston University and serving as assistant minister at the city’s Twelfth Baptist Church. It was also the place where he met his wife, who earned a degree in music education from the New England Conservatory.\n\nIn his speech, King told the crowd that he returned to Boston not to condemn the city but to encourage its leaders to do better at a time when Black leaders were fighting to desegregate the schools and housing and working to improve economic opportunities for Black residents. King also implored Boston to become a leader that other cities like New York and Chicago could follow in conducting “the creative experiments in the abolition of ghettos.”\n\n“It would be demagogic and dishonest for me to say that Boston is a Birmingham, or to equate Massachusetts with Mississippi,” he said. “But it would be morally irresponsible were I to remain blind to the threat to liberty, the denial of opportunity, and the crippling poverty that we face in some sections of this community.”\n\nThe Boston rally happened after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and months ahead of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed in August.\n\nKing and other civil rights movement leaders had just come off the Selma to Montgomery march in Alabama, also referred to as Bloody Sunday, weeks before the Boston rally. The civil rights icon also was successful in the 1963 Birmingham campaign prompting the end of legalized racial segregation in the Alabama city, and eventually throughout the nation.\n\nDEI comes under threat by Trump administration\n\nSaturday’s rally came as the Trump administration is waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in government, schools and businesses around the country, including in Massachusetts.\n\nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges — public and private — that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.\n\nThe Defense Department at one point temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.\n\nThe administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies’ celebrations of Black History Month and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools.\n\nKing’s son: Attacks on diversity make ‘little sense’\n\nMartin Luther King III told The Associated Press that the attacks on diversity make little sense, noting, “We cannot move forward without understanding what happened in the past.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean that it’s about blaming people. It’s not about collective guilt. It’s about collective responsibility,” he continued. “How do we become better? Well, we appreciate everything that helped us to get to where we are. Diversity hasn’t hurt the country.”\n\nKing said opponents of diversity have floated an uninformed narrative that unqualified people of color are taking jobs from white people, when the reality is they have long been denied the opportunities they deserve.\n\n“I don’t know if white people understand this, but Black people are tolerant,” he said. “From knee-high to a grasshopper, you have to be five times better than your white colleague. And that’s how we prepare ourselves. So it’s never a matter of unqualified. It’s a matter of being excluded.”\n\nImari Paris Jeffries, the president and CEO of Embrace Boston, which along with the city put on the rally, said the event was a chance to remind people that elements of the “promissory note” King referred to in his “I Have A Dream” speech remain “out of reach” for many people.\n\n“We’re having a conversation about democracy. This is the promissory note — public education, public housing, public health, access to public art,” Paris Jeffries said. “All of these things are a part of democracy. Those are the things that are actually being threatened right now.”","summary":"As a teenager growing up in Boston, Wayne Lucas vividly remembers joining about 20,000 people to hear the Rev.

And here we are: AP-NORC 39% approve, 59% disapprove. \n\nI’ve said repeatedly that we are in the midst of a lengthy national struggle and that it is fundamentally over public opinion. To understand where we are, where we’re going and what the future possibilities are everything must be seen through that prism. But I noticed a conversation yesterday that prompts me to be more specific. \n\nNYT/Siena also released a poll showing Trump at 42% approval, 54% disapproval. One social media discussion of that poll pressed the point that public polls had underestimated Trump’s support three cycles in a row. That’s mostly true. With the NYT/Siena poll specifically, but like most other polls, the underestimation in 2024 was marginal. But still, three successive cycles in one direction for a specific candidate is striking in itself and very much out of the norm. But here’s the point I wanted to get to. President Trump won’t ever be on the ballot again. Maybe you think he’ll come up with an end-run around the 22nd amendment. I don’t for reasons I’ve discussed elsewhere and am happy to discuss again. I raise the point here though to note that in all these polls, which give us some broad sense of the public mood, satisfaction with or opposition to Trump’s presidency, we’re really talking not about Trump but about congressional and other Republicans who sustain his rule. \n\nHe is, to put it as clearly as we can, a lame duck. But his supporters in Congress are not. It’s not a major point. It’s a level of detail which is either missed or just implicit in every discussion of public opinion. But it’s worth pulling it to the surface because it’s important to know just who these number impact. They impact Trump indirectly, through the behavior of those who again have to face the electorate.","summary":"I said yesterday that I thought we likely weren&#8217;t far away from the first national poll which showed Donald Trump&#8217;s...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/best-wishes-to-all-who-celebrate","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/tpm-media/images/tpm-logo_square.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-26 22:12:14","author":"Josh Marshall","authors":["Josh Marshall"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.209}]}
