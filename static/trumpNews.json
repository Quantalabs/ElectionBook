It was our chance,' they added. 'Emwazi was evaporated, kebab in hand.'\n\nKuwaiti-born Emwazi joined a terror cell alongside three other Brits who were called the IS Beatles. They executed at least 29 hostages - one being aid worker David Haines. \n\nEmwazi arrived in Britain when he was six years old and appeared to embrace British life, playing football in the affluent streets of west London and supporting Manchester United.\n\nNeighbours said he was a polite, quietly spoken, shy boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class.\n\nHe was also reportedly bullied at his secondary school, Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John's Wood, north London, for having bad breath.\n\nIt was only after he won a place studying computing at the University of Westminster that his behaviour began to change.\n\nThe university has since been linked with several proponents of radical Islam, and Emwazi appeared to have fallen under their sway.\n\nHe began attending different mosques and was known to associate with Bilal el-Berjawi, who was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago.\n\nIn August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania in East Africa with friends and told authorities they were going on a wildlife safari.\n\nBut the group was refused entry and put on a plane to the Netherlands, where Emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an MI5 agent called 'Nick'.\n\nEmwazi's hatred of the West stemmed from the perceived injustice of how he was dealt with by MI5 and Scotland Yard.\n\nIn August 2014, the terrorist was seen threatening the West after beheading American journalist, James Foley, in scenes that shocked the world\n\nEmwazi posted two more clips of brutal beheading, the first of another American journalist - Steven Sotloff - and the other of British aid worker David Haines.\n\nAs well as Haines, Foley and Sotloff, the gang's victims also included Americans Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.\n\nRobert Hannigan, a former director of GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, said it was Emwazi's voice and his British accent that was key to unveiling his identity.\n\nIn 2019, he told the documentary: 'We had a race to find out who he was - his size, his hands, but, above all, his voice, made identifying him quite easy.'\n\nEmwazi reportedly used very strong encryption and virtual private networks to communicate and wiped every computer he sent or received messages to safeguard it from bugs.\n\nHe also regularly surrounded himself with women and children to make a drone attack likely to result in civilian deaths.\n\nDetails about his death, come as his accomplice, El Shafee Elsheikh - known as Jihadi Ringo - applied to move back to his 'home country' Britain so he can be closer to family and friends\n\nBethany, the daughter of David Haines - Elsheikh's bid to move prisons an 'outrageous insult'. \n\nElsheikh was born in Sudan and grew up in London but had his British citizenship revoked in 2018. For his crimes, he was tried by a Federal jury in Virginia and handed eight life sentences.\n\nHe has now applied to be switched from his Colorado prison to a UK jail under the International Prisoner Transfer Program, claiming he would like to be closer to family and friends, The Sun reports.\n\nFamilies of the victims fear Elsheikh could be moved to somewhere like London's Belmarsh where convicts have access to a number of luxuries like TVs and games consoles and can mix with other extremists.\n\nUS President Donald Trump's Deputy Assistant Sebastian Gorka recently called for the UK to honour a 'commitment' to take back IS Brits. \n\nBethany, 28, from Perthshire, also recently raised fears that a second member of The Beatles terror cell, Alexanda Kotey, will attempt to follow the lead of Eisheik and will apply to move to a UK jail.","summary":"ISIS fighter, who was identified by GCHQ analysts as Mohammed Emwazi, was traced to a takeaway in Raqqa, Syria, by MI6 in 2015.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15052993/Beatle-Jihadi-John-killed-kebab-hand.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/01/01/101716257-0-image-m-57_1756686959742.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/05/28/5366434518548630570/1024x576_MP4_5366434518548630570.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-01 01:33:44","author":"Editor,Shannon McGuigan","authors":["Editor","Shannon McGuigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":356213814,"title":"'Our Country Would Be Completely Destroyed': Donald Trump Defends Tariffs, Blasts Court Ruling","text":"US President Donald Trump on Monday defended his tariff policies, saying they have been vital for the country’s economy and military strength.\nHe also took aim at a recent court ruling that went against him, decided in a 7–4 opinion, which he described as being led by “a Radical Left group of judges.”\n“Without Tariffs, and all of the TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS we have already taken in, our Country would be completely destroyed, and our military power would be instantly obliterated,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n Trump noted, however, that one judge broke ranks.\n“In a 7 to 4 Opinion, a Radical Left group of judges didn’t care.”\n“But one Democrat, Obama appointed, actually voted to save our Country.

Another week of drama looms.President Donald Trump has signalled his intention to sign an executive order that will require all voters in the United States to present identification.Should he try to do so, it will almost certainly be challenged in court.“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!” Mr Trump posted on social media.America’s Constitution gives most of the power, concerning the regulation of elections, to the states, which is why you’ll find a patchwork of different rules across the country. It does also give Congress the power to pass laws that regulate elections.The President is given no power to change election rules unilaterally. So this would be another example of Mr Trump testing the limits of his authority.The President was seen in public for the first time in almost a week yesterday as he embarked on yet another round of golf. Mr Trump’s extended absence from the spotlight, which was rare by his standards, had fomented speculation about his health.00:09XLearn MoreMorevideos\n\n ShareFacebookX/TwitterCopy URLCopied URL to clipboardSUBSCRIBER ONLYThis video is available for subscribers only.

It’s Sunday in the United States, but I’m sure we can still find a few things to talk about. About which to talk? Bah, it’s too early in the week for proper grammar.President Trump was spotted briefly yesterday after a days-long absence from the public spotlight, which had sparked mild concerns about his health. He went golfing again.Scrolling Twitter? Playing candy crush? Who knows or cares.

More ⌄9 minutes ago HIGHLIGHT 'It's insane': Trump's push to put soldiers in Chicago defendedSamuel ClenchA prominent Republican Congresswoman, Nancy Mace, has backed Donald Trump’s idea of sending National Guard troops into one of America’s largest cities, Chicago.The city’s mayor has issued an executive order prohibiting local police from cooperating with federal forces on “joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations or other law enforcement duties”, though it is unclear whether that order would survive a legal challenge.“I hope that President Trump has the resources to send soldiers to Chicago, if that’s what it takes,” Ms Mace told Fox News.“That is one of the most violent cities in America, particularly for the hardest-hit communities there.” More ⌄58 minutes ago HIGHLIGHT Images that should chill Donald TrumpSamuel ClenchI’m not sure whether this qualifies as a full middle finger to Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts, or merely a cocked eyebrow and a smirk. Whatever the answer, it’s awkward.Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have all featured together at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Tianjin. It’s a yearly event, with 26 nations attending.Other invited leaders included Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. You may have, by now, detected a distinctly authoritarian flavour.There are a couple of elements that might bother Mr Trump. The first is the sight of Mr Modi yukking it up with China, given the deteriorating trade relationship between India and the United States.

Kennedy Jr, has spoken out.Mr Kennedy, an environmental lawyer by trade but an anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist by reputation, was made head of America’s federal health system by Mr Trump after he ditched his independent bid for the presidency last year and endorsed Mr Trump instead.Dr Demetre Daskalakis was one of four senior CDC officials who left their jobs last week after Mr Trump tried to fire the body’s director a mere month after appointing her.“From my vantage point as a doctor who’s taken the Hippocratic Oath, I only see harm coming,” Dr Daskalakis told America’s ABC News today. More ⌄11:15 PMAug 31, 2025 HIGHLIGHT Los Angeles 'would not be standing' if not for Trump, secretary claimsSamuel ClenchDonald Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed, with nary a hint of ironic hyperbole, that Los Angeles, a city of 12.5 million people, “would not be standing today” if the President had not sent in the National Guard to help quell some protests.You will hopefully recall the controversy from a couple of months ago, when Mr Trump ordered the National Guard in over the quite strident objections of local leaders, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, both of whom are Democrats, and the former of whom is very much posturing to be the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee in 2028.At the time, Mr Trump described the city as being “under siege”. In reality, there were a few days of quite unimpressive protests, which did sometimes devolve into vandalism. Mr Newsom and Ms Bass claimed to have the situation under control, and local police did not ask for help from the National Guard, but Mr Trump sent military personnel into the city anyway.Good thing, too! Otherwise, apparently, Los Angeles would no longer exist. More ⌄10:51 PMAug 31, 2025'We caught them': Trump angry about White House patioSamuel ClenchStill catching up on a few of Donald Trump’s social media posts here. He has published a fairly long screed about a contractor who did an unsatisfactory job on his renovation of the White House’s Rose Garden, which was mostly grass, but is now a patio with some chairs and tables on it.Oh dear. Picture: Jacquelyn Martin “I used, at the White House, the most beautiful marble and stone available anywhere,” said Mr Trump.“Surfaces are very important to me as a Builder. As everyone knows, I built many GREAT Buildings, and other things, over the years. At the White House, I am very proud of the beautiful stonework we did in the Rose Garden, in this case, using limestone plus.”What is limestone plus? Is it like Paramount Plus? Or Ten News Plus, is that what it’s called? Sorry, the branding is so beige and awful, I do struggle to remember.

A result in-line or softer would cement market expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its meeting on September 17, which futures imply is a near 90 per cent probability. \n\n\"Although inflation and growth data don't scream out for a rate cut, at this stage it would likely require a significant positive employment surprise to stop the Fed from moving forward, given their concern about the sharp recent deceleration in job growth,\" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.\n\nThe prospect of lower borrowing costs has underpinned Wall Street near record highs, and would be timely given September has been the worst performing month of the year for the S&P 500 over the past 35 years.\n\nEarly Monday, S&P 500 futures were up 0.2 per cent, while Nasdaq futures added 0.3 per cent. EUROSTOXX 50 futures firmed 0.3 per cent, while FTSE futures rose 0.1 per cent and DAX futures gained 0.3 per cent.\n\nJapan's Nikkei fell 0.9 per cent, tracking a drop in U.S. tech stocks on Friday, while South Korea's market slipped 0.5 per cent. \n\nIS IT LEGAL?\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched down 0.1 per cent, having hit a four-year high last week on the back of a bull run in Chinese stocks.\n\nTrade uncertainty remained a drag after a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled many of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs were illegal, but left them in place until mid-October awaiting an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe White House has other means to apply sectoral levies but it puts a question mark over trade agreements already reached or being negotiated. Talks with Japan have hit a stumbling block over rice, while negotiations with South Korea have bogged down.\n\n\"If the Supreme Court upholds the ruling, the Treasury would still need to return most of the now-close to $100 billion in additional customs duties collected over the past five months, and there is a danger that other countries would back-track on any preliminary agreements,\" noted Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.\n\nInvestors will also be wary of Trump's attacks on the independence of the Fed this week, with Fed Governor Lisa Cook set to file fresh arguments against her firing on Tuesday.\n\nA confirmation hearing for Stephen Miran, Trump's pick for another Fed position, is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe political pressure for faster rate cuts has been a drag on the U.S. dollar, which was pinned at 97.788 having shed 2.2 per cent last month. The euro edged up 0.1 per cent to $1.1697, while the dollar held at 147.17 yen.\n\nIn commodity markets, gold has benefited from the dollar's decline and the outlook for lower rates to rise 2.2 per cent last week.

Not only has she had to watch her beloved husband suffer for almost four years but her financial worries have never been far away from her thoughts.\n'It has cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to look after Derek and do everything she could to get him better but it's left her struggling.\n'The house is about all she has left financially and she is now facing up to the fact it might have to be sold.'\n\nKate has since been forced to sell her second home in order to pay off the debts, but it appears that her money woes are not yet over\n\nLast month, it was revealed that Kate has had to sell her stunning three-bed, four-storey townhouse in Islington, north London, which the couple bought for £550,000 in 2004 (pictured) \nAccording to the rental listing for her Islington pad, it has a roof terrace and private garden.\n'This beautifully presented 3-bedroom terraced house offers a perfect blend of modern living and period charm. Spread across four spacious floors, this property is ideal for those seeking comfort, style, and convenience.\n'The ground floor features a welcoming living area with original features and ample space for relaxing or entertaining. The fully fitted kitchen is stylish and functional, leading directly to a private garden, perfect for outdoor dining or enjoying the fresh air.\n'On the first and second floors, you'll find well-sized bedrooms, each offering plenty of natural light and built-in storage. The top floor boasts a stunning roof terrace with panoramic views across London, making it the perfect spot to unwind or entertain guests,’ states the blurb.\nAn identical property on the same street sold for £1.865M in June last year.\nThe most recent liquidator’s report for Astra Aspera Ltd shows that Kate has been trying to repay some of the debt she owes - and HMRCS have dramatically decreased their tax demand.\nThe directors' loan account was overdrawn by £139,849, but the liquidator, Greenfield Recovery, hired solicitors, The Wilkes Partnership, 'to assist in the recovery… and the sum of £21,000 has been received in this report period’.\nAccording to the latest liquidator's report, HMRC has submitted a new preferential claim of £288,054.\n\nIt was previously reported that Kate was having to sell her five-bedroom family home in Muswell Hill (pictured), but by selling her second home, this seems to have been avoided\n\nThis is a third of its previous submission of £716,822. It’s not known why the HMRC has dropped its demand.\nThere are also creditor claims of £196,548 from four other firms including a £50,000 bank loan. It looks like there’ll be no pay out for creditors.\nIn 2012, two other companies jointly controlled by Kate and Derek were wound up by creditors.\nFulfill Media Ltd had debts totalling £922,807, which included £88,486 owed to HMRC, £90,882 to trade creditors, and £462,808 in 'third party loans’.\nCountrymouse Media Ltd was liquidated owing £189,121, which included £98,944 to the taxman and £48,000 on an overdrawn directors loan account. \nDerek and Kate were both personally owed £24k each by the business.\nHMRCDerek DraperLondonKate Garraway\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKate Garraway suffers fresh financial blow as her media company reports losses of £288,000 last year after she was forced to sell £2M second home to pay off £800,000 debt from caring for late husband Derek Draper\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Someone then came out of the bullpen and handed him a towel, which he pressed to his face.\n\nAngels personnel quickly ran to him and he stood in the outfield as they and paramedics tended to him.\n\nWard was bleeding after suffering a gruesome cut above his right eye. He held a smaller cloth to his head as he was slowly carted off the field while resting his head on the shoulder of a team employee who rode the cart with him.\n\nHe was taken to a hospital by ambulance where interim manager Ray Montgomery said he would receive stitches to close the cut and be evaluated.\n\nScary scene here in Houston.\n\nHopefully Taylor Ward is OK.\n\n(Just last night after the game, he and Jo Adell were talking about how dangerous it can be to hit that that out of town scoreboard wrong.) pic.twitter.com/P6yAzKLCtx\n— Jeff Fletcher (@JeffFletcherOCR) August 31, 2025\n\nAngels star Taylor Ward was taken to hospital on Sunday after crashing into a scoreboard\n\nWard suffered a gruesome cut above his right eye after colliding with the metal scoreboard\n\nBREAKING NEWS\n\nMajor League Baseball chiefs make decision on punishment of two stars named in gambling probe\n\n'Obviously he hit the wall pretty good,' Montgomery said.

He's being aggressive on a play,' Adell told reporters, via Angels reporter Jeff Fletcher.\n\n'At the Bottom line - and I've talked about this before - but there should be no out-of-town metal scoreboard anywhere on the baseball field.

This is the day Mounjaro prices soar, turning what many of us call a miracle jab into something we can no longer afford. \n\nThanks to an edict by Donald Trump, US maker Eli Lilly has been forced to raise prices in the UK, with new wholesale costs to chemists increasing by up to 102 per cent.\n\nLast week, Mounjaro sales were paused as buyers rushed to get their hands on the drug before the price hike – while pharmacies have been urging customers to make the switch to its cheaper rival jab Wegovy, made by Danish company Novo Nordisk.\n\nToday, we’ll see how the move plays out across the weight-loss market and whether stock returns to the shelves. \n\nBut whatever happens, the Mounjaro bubble has burst – while Wegovy, now more than £100 cheaper at stores like Boots and Asda, and £150 less at smaller online pharmacies, mops up disaffected former users.\n\nAnd yet I am something of a cautionary tale, one of those who has tried both Mounjaro and Wegovy in quick succession over an 18-month period. \n\nThough I lost weight on Wegovy, I also endured savage side-effects – the worst constipation of my life, followed by violent vomiting and diarrhoea. None of this happened on Mounjaro.\n\nAlice Dogroyul started her GLP-1 journey in 2023. Two years before, she’d been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and found it impossible to stop the pounds piling on\n\nWhen Alice stopped using Mounjaro, the hunger roared back, her portions increased and the weight crept back on\n\nThough I lost weight on Wegovy, I also endured savage side-effects – the worst constipation of my life, followed by violent vomiting and diarrhoea. None of this happened on Mounjaro.\n\nI also know what it’s like to stop using Mounjaro. Despite my best efforts, I fell apart. \n\nWithout any jabs at all, the hunger roared back, my portions increased, and the weight crept back on. \n\nNo wonder I am looking at these price increases – a possible extra £1,000 a year – with a trepidation verging on fear.\n\nMy GLP-1 journey began back in December 2023, when, at the age of 46, I jumped onto the fat-jab bandwagon. Two years before, I’d been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes – not the type 2 associated with obesity, which also unlocks NHS treatment – and found it impossible to stop the pounds piling on.\n\nUtterly miserable, I hauled my 19st 9lb body into the private clinic of specialist endocrinologist Dr Dipesh Patel at The Cleveland Clinic and after lots of tests, he started me on Wegovy. \n\nAnd yes, it worked. In the first ten months I lost 2st 9lb. But while many who use Wegovy don’t experience any issues, for me the side-effects were gruesome.\n\nThe first month on 0.25mg was manageable: appetite suppression was instant. There was a constant hum of nausea but it was tolerable. I couldn’t finish a plate of food and I’d skip breakfast without noticing.\n\nThen in January, I upped the dose to 0.5mg and hit my first bump in the road. One afternoon I binged on a box of four protein bars. I hadn’t had enough fibre or water, and what followed was agonising constipation.\n\nWeight-loss jabs work in part by slowing gastric emptying – it makes your stomach release food into your intestines at a much reduced pace. That’s one of the reasons you feel full sooner and for longer.\n\nBut the flipside is that your digestive system becomes sluggish. Combine that with protein bars full of dense whey and very little fibre, and you have the perfect recipe for a compacted stool.\n\nI was doubled over with pain, convinced I’d end up in hospital. When things finally did, ahem, move, it tore me inside, causing what I later found out – after a colonoscopy – was a fissure. \n\nMy doctor advised daily laxatives, which I started taking religiously just to keep everything moving. Despite that unfortunate episode, which in truth was somewhat self-inflicted, I was determined to carry on.\n\nWhen I upped the dose to 1mg in February, however, disaster struck again. Out of nowhere, I was hit with 48 hours of relentless sickness and diarrhoea, like food poisoning but worse. \n\nAnd then came a new horror I hadn’t expected: the dreaded ‘Wegovy sulphur burps’. If you know, you know – stomach-churning little eruptions that make you want to hide under the duvet and not speak to anyone.\n\nThis violent reaction wasn’t anything to do with what I’d eaten – again it was to do with how slowly the stomach empties. For some people it causes nothing but queasiness. For me, my body went into full revolt. I couldn’t keep anything down or in.\n\nMy doctor reassured me that my symptoms sounded familiar, and that I should take a week off the jabs and drop my dose back down to 0.5mg. He suggested I use Imodium, and hydration sachets and, because of my diabetes, keep an eye on my glucose and ketone levels which I did.\n\nStill, I persevered, and three months later tried to increase the dose to 1mg again. \n\nTo mitigate the side-effects, I tried to drink at least a litre of water every day, increase my intake of green low-carb veg, and use gentle laxatives. \n\nOver ten months I increased to 1.7mg and then the strongest dose of 2.4mg – which is when, perversely, the weight-loss benefits began to blunt.\n\nAlarmingly my appetite felt like it was returning. My weight loss plateaued. The truth is, the drivers that made me overeat were still there. I’d always battled with my weight. \n\nSince my mid 20s I’d tried everything: a gastric balloon (months of nausea and discomfort before removal), diet after diet, self-development, therapy, health retreats, hypnotherapy, gym memberships. I’d lose weight, then re-gain it, over and over.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone was talking about the new jab in town – tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.\n\nAfter hearing my concerns about Wegovy’s effectiveness apparently waning, my doctor agreed to try me on Mounjaro. We began at 5mg, then effortlessly climbed to 7mg and 10mg.\n\nTo be honest, it felt like a smooth, supercharged upgrade with far milder side-effects. Using Mounjaro helped me shed a further 17lb in eight months. It felt like the medication I’d been waiting for all my life.\n\nMost importantly, my blood sugars had never been better. I was able to stick to a low-carb/ketogenic diet, and the spikes and crashes that define type 1 diabetes softened. My energy and mood were improved. For me, it was nothing short of miraculous. At 12mg, I felt euphoric. And then life threw another twist.\n\nThis summer I was keen to start IVF, but my clinic told me I had to stop Mounjaro for a few months first. There simply isn’t robust safety data for pregnancy, so the risk was too high.\n\nI thought I could handle it, that after nearly a year-and-a-half of eating less, and dropping close to 4st, I’d be fine. Instead, it was hell. Within eight weeks, I regained 13lb. My carefully managed keto lifestyle fell apart. I binged, I snacked, I panicked.\n\nI felt so dreadful, physically and emotionally, that for the first time I even questioned whether I could go through with IVF at all. \n\nI'm so horrified by the Mounjaro price hike I'm taking drastic action, says JENNI MURRAY\n\nLife without Mounjaro left me feeling so unwell and out of control, I doubted whether I had the strength to put my body through it. That’s how much this drug has steadied me.\n\nI tried more natural alternatives to stimulate GLP-1 which did have a positive effect, but I kept forgetting to take the supplements when I was supposed to. I felt unstable. My motivation and mood plummeted – I felt like I was unravelling. \n\nEventually, I chose to restart Mounjaro and press pause on IVF. Back on a low dose of 2.5mg for a month then rising to 5mg, it was like switching the lights back on. The hunger quietened and my mood lifted. I felt in control again.\n\nThis time, I was proactive: hydration, fibre, gentle laxatives. No nausea, no chaos. Just calm and back into low carb/keto and intermittent fasting – the diet that works best for me.\n\nBut I’d learned a harsh lesson about what I call ‘Mounjaro withdrawal’. \n\nThe hunger, the sugar spikes, the weight regain – it terrified me. That’s when I rang my friend, personal trainer extraordinaire Kate Rowe-Ham. \n\nShe refused to let me wallow. Instead, she suggested we channel my fear into something bigger. Maybe we could help others cope with the cravings, the habits, and the emotional rollercoaster that GLP-1s never fully erase. \n\nSo we decided to create The Shift – a one-day workshop for women navigating life before, during and after GLP-1s. Because here’s the truth: GLP-1s can silence hunger, but they don’t wipe out decades of habits or coping mechanisms.\n\nI’ve lived through every twist and turn of this. The despair of Wegovy’s brutal side-effects. The joy of shedding almost 4st. The chaos of Mounjaro withdrawal. And the sheer relief of being back on it.\n\nBut now I’ve made my decision. Both Wegovy and Mounjaro gave me steady weight loss, mental calm, and the strength to stick to a low-carb lifestyle. But Mounjaro did it better.\n\nI’m on 5mg now and it’s working well. In a few months, once I’ve increased the dose and shifted the weight I put back on, I’ll taper off it again.\n\nBut this time I’ll be ready for the return of the dreaded food noise and the pull of old habits. And once IVF is behind me, I’ll almost certainly restart it – or whatever new wonder drug is next. \n\nNewer, stronger jabs are already on the horizon that promise even greater results. (I hope they deliver, though I fear they’ll come with punishing price tags.)\n\nAnd yes, after today’s hikes, it seems as though Mounjaro – at the strength I need it – may well cost me more than £3,500 a year. But nothing tastes as good as healthy feels, so I will find the money. I will cut back, compromise, re-prioritise. Meanwhile, if for any reason I have to go back on Wegovy, I will do so armed with the knowledge and the tools I now have to soften the side-effects I experienced last time.\n\nThese drugs are the difference between chaos and control, despair and dignity for me.\n\nAnd if survival has a price tag, then it’s clearly worth paying.\n\ntheshift.life\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nI've taken both Mounjaro and Wegovy and lost four stone.

Email sophie.carlin@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SOPHIE CARLIN, TRAINEE REPORTER \n Published:01:55 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:01:59 BST, 1 September 2025 \n\nFinland has belatedly admitted its air force flags probably should not have a huge swastika in the middle. \nThe Nordic country is set to remove the symbol from the standard because its presence has created 'awkward situations with foreign visitors'. \nThe nation adopted the insignia as the emblem of its airborne military when it was founded in 1918. \nThis was years before Germany's Nazi Party chose the swastika as its crest and became primarily associated with the logo during its rise to power in the 1930s. \nFinnish air force commanders removed the symbol from widespread usage in 2020 - but five years on, it remained on the flags of some units, the Telegraph reports. \nNow, the swastika - which is illegal in many European nations, including Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic - will be banned across the entire fleet. \nColonel Tomi Böhm told Finland's public broadcaster YLE: 'We could have continued with this flag but sometimes awkward situations can arise with foreign visitors. \n'It is wise to live with the times.' \n\nFinland has belatedly admitted its air force flags (pictured last year) probably should not have a huge swastika in the middle\n\nThe Nordic country is set to remove the symbol from the standard (pictured in 2019) because its presence has created 'awkward situations with foreign visitors'\n\nThe nation adopted the insignia as the emblem of its airborne military when it was founded in 1918. Pictured: An air force flag in 2019 \nThe new chief of peacetime unit Karelia Air Wing continued: 'The world has changed and we live according to the times. There has been no political pressure to do this.' \nThe commander added he hoped the change would happen during his time in post.\nFlags will from now on bear a new emblem of a golden eagle in flight, over a blue circle, surrounded by white wings. \nPlans to redo the unit flags were proposed in 2023, the year Finland joined Nato - but some kept using the swastika, raising eyebrows in the international community.\nFinland's government noted it was seen as an 'embarrassing symbol in international contexts'. \nIt added it wishes to 'update the symbolism and emblems of the flags to better reflect the current identity of the air force'.\nThe country has seen public discourse about the use of the swastika on air force flags reawaken in recent times. \nIt comes after the publication of a book named History Of The Swastika by Dr Teivo Teivainen, a professor at the University of Helsinki. \n\nFlags will from now on bear a new emblem of a golden eagle in flight, over a blue circle, surrounded by white wings (pictured) \n\n Finland's air force quietly ditches infamous SWASTIKA symbol from its command insignia \nHe said Finland has always maintained its air force's use of the symbol has 'nothing to do with the Nazi swastika'. \nThis comes despite the country briefly allying with Nazi Germany during the Second World War.\nA blue swastika on a white background was emblazoned on all Finnish planes as the national symbol from 1918 to 1945, during its intervention in the major global conflict. \nAfter the war ended, the crest was taken off some flags - but many units, as well as the Air Force Academy, continued to use it on their standards and decorations. \nBut now Finland has joined Nato, the 32-state defensive alliance established in 1949, the government has changed tack, Dr Teivainen explained. \n'There's now a need to get more integrated with the forces of countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and France - countries where the swastika is clearly a negative symbol,' he continued. \nHe recalled a notable moment in 2021, when German air force units withdrew from a ceremony at a base in Finland's Lapland region when they learnt swastikas would be displayed. \nBefore it became synonymous with fascism, the swastika was a widely used and innocuous motif. \n\nA blue swastika on a white background was emblazoned on all Finnish planes as the national symbol from 1918 to 1945. Pictured: Historic Finnish airforce planes featuring the blue swastika\n\n Airgun attack on Jewish teenager and swastikas daubed on homes put Bournemouth police on alert \nMeaning 'wellbeing' in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit, it was even widely seen as a good luck symbol at the start of the 20th century. \nThis was how it found its way into the Finnish air force, the New York Times reports. \nThe country declared independence from Russia in 1918, after the Bolshevik Revolution. \nAn aircraft, bearing a swastika as a good luck symbol, was gifted to Finnish anti-communist forces in the civil war that ensued. \nBut, in a subject of controversy, Erik von Rosen, the Swedish aristocrat behind the present, was later close with Nazi figures. \nThe symbol was also previously widely used in advertising, including by Coca-Cola and on Carlsberg beer bottles, the BBC reports. .\nThe sign was used by American military units during World War One and on RAF planes as late as 1939. \nBut most of these previously inoffensive uses stopped when the swastika began to be associated with Nazism. \n\nThe black swastika of Nazism (pictured, on the armband of far-right Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, in 1935), on a white circle and red background, has become one of the most despised symbols of the 20th century\n\n Mutilated seagull called Belinda has swastika daubed on its head by sick prison inmate \nThe far-right party used it because of the work of 19th-century German scholars on translating ancient Indian texts, who noted similarities between Sanskrit and their language. \nThe thinkers felt this meant Indians and Germans had a shared ancestry and thought up a race of white godly warriors they dubbed Aryans. \nThis was taken to extremes by the Nazis who used the swastika as a sign of Aryanism as the ancient heritage of the German nation. \nIt means the black swastika, on a white circle and red background, has become one of the most despised symbols of the 20th century. \nHolocaust survivor Freddie Knoller previously said: 'For the Jewish people the swastika is a symbol of fear, of suppression, and of extermination.' \nGermany banned the swastika at the end of World War Two, before attempting unsuccessfully in 2007 to prohibit it across the EU. \nIn certain cultures, the swastika is still considered a sacred symbol - which has caused widespread confusion and revision of positions. \nBefore the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, a Japanese mapmaker said it would stop using the manji - a swastika-type symbol - to mark temples, to avoid any such confusion. \nFinlandNATOGermany\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFinland belatedly admits their air force flags probably shouldn't have a huge SWASTIKA in the middle\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

as Trump has done in Los Angeles and Washington, and urged the Republican president to reverse course. \n\n“This is about making sure that we are prepared,” he told reporters as he signed the order, adding that the order aimed to offer “real, clear guidance” to city government workers and “all the Chicagoans of how we can stand up against this tyranny.” \n\nThe executive order says that Chicago police officers will continue to enforce state and local laws but will not assist with any patrols, arrests or other law enforcement actions alongside federal officers, including the National Guard. \n\nIt also directs city police to wear their official police uniforms, continue to identify themselves, follow body camera procedures and not to wear masks to clearly distinguish themselves from any federal operations, according to a copy of the order. \n\n“The deployment of federal military forces in Chicago without the consent of local authorities undermines democratic norms, violates the City’s sovereignty, threatens civil liberties, and risks escalating violence rather than securing the peace,” the order says. \n\nTrump has been threatening to expand his federal crackdown on Democrat-led US cities to Chicago, casting the use of presidential power as an urgent effort to tackle crime even as city officials cite declines in homicides, gun violence and burglaries. \n\nLocal officials and residents in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest city, have been preparing for the possible arrival of federal agents and troops, and Johnson said they have received credible reports that action could come within days. \n\nThe White House dismissed Johnson’s move and accused Democrats of trying to make tackling crime a partisan issue. \n\n“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \n\nWhile it is unclear how much state and local officials can do to push back against any US deployment, the mayor said he was pursuing any legal and legislative measures available, including possible lawsuits. \n\n“We will use the courts if that’s necessary,” Johnson said. \n\nTrump, meanwhile, has repeatedly said he wants to be asked for federal agents to be deployed to various cities even as he continues to threaten to send them anyway without any formal request.","summary":"WASHINGTON: Chicago police will not collaborate with any National Guard troops or federal agents if US President

administered by the United States for at least 10 years, the newspaper said.\n\nAnother goal of the plan modeled on President Donald Trump’s stated vision of making it the “Riviera of the Middle East”

distributing food inside the enclave amid much criticism from aid groups and the United Nations.\n\nOn July 22, the UN rights office said Israeli forces had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the GHF started operations, nearly three-quarters of them in the vicinity of GHF sites.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The entire population of Gaza would be relocated and the

invasion","text":"CHICAGO: US President Donald Trump’s ultimate aim in sending troops to American cities is to seize control of elections in 2026, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Sunday, calling such deployments an invasion.\n\nTrump — who has unleashed unprecedented military patrols in Los Angeles and Washington to curb protests against his immigrant deportation drive and combat what he deems out-of-control crime — has said he’s also considering sending troops to cities like Baltimore and Chicago.\n\nDemocrat Pritzker said there had been no effort by the Trump administration to coordinate such plans with officials in Illinois, a Democratic stronghold. \n\n“So it’s clear that, in secret, they’re planning this, well, it’s an invasion with US troops, if they in fact do that,” Pritzker told CBS Sunday show “Face the Nation.”\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier told the network she would be adding resources to Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Illinois, but that any decision to send National Guard reservists or other troops was up to Trump.\n\nIf troops are sent along with ICE, “they’ll be in court pretty quickly, because that is illegal,”

say","text":"TIANJIN, (China): India and China are development partners, not rivals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Sunday, as they discussed ways to improve trade ties amid global tariff uncertainty. \n\nModi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and leaders from Iran, Pakistan and four Central Asian states in a show of Global South solidarity. \n\nAnalysts say Xi and Modi are seeking to align against pressure from the West, days after US President Donald Trump imposed a punitive total of 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly in response to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. \n\nTrump’s moves hurt decades of carefully cultivated US ties with New Delhi, which Washington had hoped would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing. \n\nModi told Xi his country was committed to improving ties with China and discussed reducing India’s burgeoning bilateral trade deficit of nearly $99.2 billion, while emphasising the need to maintain peace and stability at their disputed border after a clash in 2020 triggered a five-year military standoff. \n\n“We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi said during the meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a video posted on his official X account. \n\nHe said an atmosphere of “peace and stability” has been created on their disputed Himalayan border and that cooperation between the two nations was linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people of the world’s two most populous countries. \n\nThe nuclear-armed Asian neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. \n\nXi said that China and India are each other’s development opportunities rather than threats, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. \n\n“We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,” Xinhua reported Xi as saying. \n\nChina-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focus on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added. \n\nTies between the nations were ruptured by the 2020 clash, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat, following which the Himalayan border was heavily militarised by both sides. \n\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters later in the day in that the border situation had evolved over the course of last year, following a patrolling agreement in October. “The situation at the border is moving towards normalisation,” he said. \n\nTo a question on the US tariffs, he said that Modi and Xi discussed the international “economic situation” and the challenges it created. \n\n“They tried to ... see how to leverage that for building greater understanding between themselves and how to ... take forward the economic and commercial relationship between India and China,” he said. \n\nThe leaders also discussed expanding common ground on bilateral, regional, and global issues, and challenges like terrorism and fair trade in multilateral platforms, a statement from the Indian foreign ministry said. \n\nDIRECT FLIGHTS, TRADE CURBS \n\nBoth leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington. \n\nDirect flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are being resumed, Modi added, without providing a timeframe. \n\nChina had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilisers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi. \n\nChina opposes Washington’s steep tariffs on India and will “firmly stand with India,” Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month. \n\nIn recent months, China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Hindu and Buddhist sites in Tibet, and both countries have lifted reciprocal tourist visa restrictions. \n\n“I see the meeting as a step in the direction of incremental improvement. The readouts indicate a lot of mixed political signalling ... But there’s also a sense of the need to stabilise the relationship in the context of broader geopolitical currents,” said Manoj Kewalramani, a Sino-Indian relations expert at the Takshashila Institution think tank in Bengaluru. \n\nOther long-term irritants remain in the relationship, too. \n\nChina is India’s largest bilateral trade partner, but the long-running trade deficit - a persistent source of frustration for Indian officials - reached a record $99.2 billion this year. \n\nMeanwhile, a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet has sparked fears of mass water diversion that could reduce water flows on the major Brahmaputra River by up to 85% in the dry season, according to Indian government estimates. \n\nIndia also hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader whom Beijing views as a dangerous separatist influence. India’s arch-rival Pakistan also benefits from staunch Chinese economic, diplomatic and military support.","summary":"TIANJIN, (China): India and China are development partners, not rivals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on Sunday, as they discussed ways to improve trade ties amid global tariff uncertainty. \n\n\n\nModi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and leaders from Iran, Pakistan and four Central Asian states in a show of Global South solidarity. \n\n\n\nAnalysts say Xi and Modi are seeking to align against pressure from the West, days after US President Donald Trump imposed a punitive total of 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly in response to New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil. \n\n\n\nTrump’s moves hurt decades of carefully cultivated US ties with New Delhi, which Washington had hoped would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing. \n\n\n\nModi told Xi his country was committed to improving ties with China and discussed reducing India’s burgeoning","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40380642/india-china-are-partners-not-rivals-modi-and-xi-say","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/09/010439313880eb8.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:57:56","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.214},{"id":356210934,"title":"Israel mulls West Bank annexation in response to moves to recognise Palestine","text":"OCCUPIED JERUSALEM: Israel is considering annexation in the occupied West Bank as a possible response to France and other countries recognising a Palestinian state, according to three Israeli officials and the idea will be discussed further on Sunday, another official said. \n\nExtension of Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank - de facto annexation of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war - was on the agenda for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet meeting late on Sunday that is expected to focus on the Gaza war, a member of the small circle of ministers said. \n\nIt is unclear where precisely any such measure would be applied and when, whether only in Israeli settlements or some of them, or in specific areas of the West Bank like the Jordan Valley and whether any concrete steps, which would likely entail a lengthy legislative process, would follow discussions. \n\nAny step toward annexation in the West Bank would likely draw widespread condemnation from the Palestinians, who seek the territory for a future state, as well as Arab and Western countries.

Mellon Auditorium on July 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump signed executive orders related to his Artificial Intelligence Action Plan during the event. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWhen a technology entrepreneur created an industry-changing AI product with a colleague in Beijing, little did he consider that he now owned a multimillion-dollar intellectual property asset — unprotected and subject to U.S. income tax, estate tax, and extensive reporting obligations. This is the unspoken reality for many multinational innovators and investors. While focus is often on seed funding, scaling, and corporate infrastructure, individual consequences — cross-border tax, valuations, succession planning, and asset protection for intergenerational wealth preservation — are frequently an afterthought.\n\nThe U.S. AI Action Plan And Individual Tax\n\nReleased in July 2025, the U.S. AI Action Plan sets out more than 90 initiatives to accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence, expand infrastructure, and strengthen the nation’s role in international diplomacy. The framework positions the United States to pursue global dominance in AI by prioritizing development and innovation over regulation. Among its provisions are broad measures to promote research and technological advances, including a general reference to tax-free reimbursements for employer training supporting IP and innovation.\n\nAs with most infrastructure-oriented policy documents, the Plan offers little insight into individual tax consequences or cross-border risks. It does not address valuation methodology for intellectual property, the taxation of cross-border profits, or the navigation of conflicting international tax regimes. For investors, founders, and entrepreneurs, this omission leaves a critical gap: corporate infrastructure development and policy frameworks may not anticipate how AI assets will be treated in succession planning, valuation, or personal tax compliance. Therefore, individuals should navigate these factors independently, even if their advisors or the underlying policy do not address them.\n\nDetermining Taxable Locations For Intellectual Property\n\nIntangible assets, such as IP, are by their very nature not fixed to a location - unless a government body wants to tax them - then they have a location. The domestic and international protections afforded by patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law supports the need for identifying the location of the IP. Patent box regimes in the EU, incentivizing commercialization of innovation, R&D credits in Asia and in the U.S., among other innovation fostering tax incentives illustrate government interest in preserving IP value, especially where it has domestic impact. However, IP, and especially AI, as a system of codes and digital assets, are easily transferable globally. Both asset protection and tax incentives may drive an innovator to hold the IP offshore or abroad, but the global U.S. tax system creates burdensome tax compliance and liabilities. Some of the tax and reporting exposure occurs due to taxable income being in Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC), subject to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (now, Net CFC Tested Income (NCTI)) treatment, and otherwise falling within the scope of Subpart F (foreign sourced or foreign derived) income.\n\nTherefore, the tax implications on the individual investor or innovator may differ from the corporation or entity holding the IP.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nOECD and Global Minimum Tax\n\nAI and intellectual property overall is in the global forefront more than ever before. The OECD, the international collaboration forum for policy-making, has also focused its policies on the taxation of intangibles. The OECD’s Pillar Two framework imposes a 15% global minimum tax based on the residence of the corporation and focusing on mobile intangible income. The U.S. is not a member of the OECD.\n\nHowever, investments are multinational and often subject to multijurisdictional demands. Companies growing rapidly, as is the case for most successful AI companies, from seed funding to international operations, may be subject to OECD even though they were not initially. When tax reform is heavily focused on intangible income, AI businesses fit squarely within the target zone because their value and income is significantly, if not entirely, based on intellectual property, not physical assets.\n\nTax Exposure For Entrepreneurs\n\nThe location of the IP has several consequences for personal income and transfer tax purposes for entrepreneurs. Valuation of the IP is at the core of the tax implications. From concept to commercialization, tracing the valuation of the IP to ensure that asset protection strategies are properly aligned to protect the investor is critical.\n\nOftentimes, estate planning and asset protection are not prioritized because most AI startups do not have liquidity to support a high value for the investor. However, at the time of exit, or scaling, when liquidity events occur, the investor or founder often faces an insurmountable personal tax liability with few channels to offset the liability. Additionally, hurried or reactive infrastructure development may expose the investor to significant foreign asset reporting and tax burdens (NCTI, for example) that could have been mitigated if a multi-disciplinary framework had been considered. Structuring to allow for some flexibility in the location of IP or the ownership structure of the IP can mitigate capital gains and allow for valuation discounts when a liquidity event is anticipated.\n\nEstate Planning and asset protection are often treated as separate from corporate structuring, especially for founders and startups. Additionally IP asset protection is often deemed to be within the realm of patent prosecution or trademark filings. Asset protection should incorporate determining and preserving the value of the asset, and IP is no different. Several of the trust and holding company structures used in wealth preservation is applicable to intangible also, but the valuation methodology, transfer and licensing impact, and overall succession planning relies on an interplay with the IP protections through the patent and trademark systems, corporate structuring and investment analysis. The best time to incorporate succession planning may be at inception of the IP, not merely at exit.\n\nModern Family Offices and Intergenerational Wealth Preservation with IP\n\nFor family offices and institutional investors, treating IP as a corporate asset alone and separate from an estate asset can have dire consequences. If the underlying asset is improperly structured, or its value is not properly determined, it can trigger significant estate and gift tax on transfers, fiduciary litigation, or foreign compliance and tax reporting hurdles.\n\nAs family offices grapple with modernizing with technology, they have to also address whether the IP their clients own are adequately identified, valued, and protected. The underlying structures, whether trusts or holding companies may not survive cross-border scrutiny and the assets may be subject to global exposure. Without cross-border and IP proficient planning, families may lose value and control over their core assets.\n\nThe Policy Opportunity\n\nThe U.S. AI Action Plan focuses on supporting domestic innovation. However, the U.S. tax system, being only one of two global tax regimes, may incentivize foreign tax exposure for IP especially where it can be placed favorably. IP holding companies abroad provide liability and tax-efficiency that may surpass the current U.S. system but for the investors and innovators within those enterprises, the offshore structures create a hefty trade-off. They may be subject to significant individual tax exposure and reporting obligations. If an investor who has not sold the IP expatriates for example, valuation of the interest will be included in determining the investor’s net worth and may subject the investor to unexpected taxes as a covered expatriate, for both income and estate tax purposes.\n\nFor entrepreneurs and investors seeking to maximize returns from the policy, they should consider a multi-disciplinary approach and develop a protective framework that protects not only their corporate interest but also their individual interest, for both immediate and succession goals. Navigating technical proficiency in the IP itself, along with related areas in finance, tax, and law are essential to build an adequate framework.\n\nTechnology As A Taxable Asset\n\nAI is a core taxable asset for innovators and investors. AI is directing compliance, valuation, and succession. Planning to mitigate tax-impact once with IP once it is structured is limited— transfer pricing, exit taxes, and valuation complicate mitigate strategies. Investors and entrepreneurs who plan early can align location, governance, tax, and wealth preservation before growth limits options. Innovation has limited impact without the appropriate structure to preserve its value and enable its growth.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"As AI innovation continues to grow, policies are shifting to promote development domestically, but investors often miss optimally-timed tax planning","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/priyaroyal/2025/08/31/missing-in-ai-action-tax-risk-for-investors-in-intellectual-property/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68b4de65578287a5814afbf3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:54:49","author":"Chip Somodevilla,Contributor,Priya Prakash Royal Esq.

Email: olivia.christie@dailymail.co.uk\nBy OLIVIA CHRISTIE, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:01:45 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:01:45 BST, 1 September 2025 \n\nDubai has long tempted sun-seeking Brits with the lure of high salaries, wealthy lifestyles and low taxes. \nIn recent years, an increasing number of professionals have been making the move to the glitzy city on the Persian Gulf in a bid to escape the daily grind of UK employment. \nHowever, mounting living costs and increased competition for jobs is making the Dubai dream a more difficult reality for some. \nAnd in some cases, the issues have become so bad that British expats have decided they have no other option but to pack up their bags and return home.\nMeanwhile, residents have also complained their city is being overrun with people - with videos on social media showing crowded beaches, streets and shopping malls. \nA new TikTok trend based on the phrase 'Habibi, don't come to Dubai' has gone viral on the platform. \nRoss Irvine, the financial director of William Russell which specialises in insurance for expats, told the Daily Mail that Dubai is starting to 'lose its shine'.\nHe said: 'For many years, Dubai has been the jewel in the crown for British expats, offering tax-free salaries, year-round sunshine, and a fast-moving lifestyle.\n\nOne woman, who posts on TikTok under the username 'thesojournerstravel' revealed she was forced to leave Dubai because 'she couldn't afford it anymore'\n\nA new TikTok trend based on the phrase 'Habibi, don't come to Dubai' has gone viral on the platform\n\nScreengrab from a video on TikTok which shows huge numbers of people in a shopping centre in Dubai \n'But recent reports indicate that for some, the shine is dimming slightly. \n'The cost of living has risen sharply, housing rents are at record highs, schooling and healthcare are increasingly expensive, and everyday costs from groceries to leisure are far steeper than they once were. \n'At the same time, the job market is becoming more competitive as the city matures and becomes a victim of its own success in attracting global talent.'\nOne British entrepreneur who was attracted to Dubai for its lucrative tax-free earnings and safety recently revealed that he has quit the city - despite making £30million there. \nCharlie Morgan moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2023, as a 'business decision' more so than a personal one. \nAnd in a video on his YouTube channel, he praised Dubai for promoting a healthy lifestyle, with its strict laws on heavy drinking.\nHowever, after two years of living there he has now left - on the basis that the cons of the city outweigh its advantages. \nMr Morgan said: 'The issue with Dubai is everyone plans to leave. It's a revolving door of a city which means that people come and people leave.'\nHe also explained that despite many people assuming their earnings are tax free in the UAE, the rules are actually 'totally unclear'. \n\nElbi Henshaw, 23, (pictured) from north London, set off for Dubai in January after falling in love with the Arabian peninsula while on holiday there\n\nOne person shared a video of a packed beach on TikTok, with the caption: 'So crowded'\n\nCharlie Morgan (pictured) moved to the United Arab Emirates in 2023, as a 'business decision' more so than a personal one, thanks to Dubai's lucrative tax-free earnings\n\nEXCLUSIVE Is moving to Dubai all it's cracked up to be? How Britons are heading to the UAE for a better life \nMeanwhile one woman, who posts on TikTok under the username 'thesojournerstravel' revealed she was forced to leave Dubai because 'she couldn't afford it anymore'. \nShe said: 'We left Dubai because we just genuinely could not afford the cost of living anymore.\n'But for us it was not because we could not afford the cost of living because we were paid a low salary, it was because things were changing and costs were rising at a rate that didn't make sense for the investments and savings we wanted to have.'\nAnother Brit, Aidan Doyle, who moved to Dubai three years ago, said things have drastically changed in the city. He explained there is an increased pressure to match the wealth of your neighbours. \nHe told The Times: 'When you get a little sniff of money, and the next thing you're spending £1,000 a day at a beach club. \n'There's a lot of pressure to keep up with the Joneses.'\nMoreover, a British woman who moved to Dubai to escape the 'miserable' UK lifestyle revealed that she has ending up working six days a week to afford living in the city.\nElbi Henshaw, 23, from north London, set off for Dubai in January after falling in love with the Arabian peninsula while on holiday there.\nShe had previously done a stint working in Saudi Arabia and believed she would score a better quality of life in Dubai - but soon found herself struggling to make ends meet.\nWith financial support from her parents, Elbi was able to afford the initial move earlier this year and quickly found herself a job in a gym full of 'high end clients'.\nElbi said she has now settled in the city, where influencers flock for VIP treatment, but admitted she misses British culture and pubs.\nShe has also struggled to fully immerse herself in the opulence touted by influencers online due to the high cost of living in the city.\n\nOne TikTokker, who specialises in opening up companies in the UAE, warned people who cannot guarantee a secure income against coming to Dubai\n\nElbi has been forced to pick up extra shifts at the gym and now works six days a week. Pictured: A beach in Dubai \nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nLuxury restaurants are a major draw in Dubai, including this one near Burj Khalifa Lake \n\n I moved to Dubai to escape the miserable UK lifestyle but now have to work six days a week \nAnd because of the exorbitant price of nearly everything - with even a pot of yoghurt costing £12 - she has been forced to pick up extra shifts at the gym and now works six days a week.\nIt comes as the influx of expats looking to cash in on Dubai's property market has increased the price of houses and rent. \nJobs are also in higher demand - with it becoming more and more difficult for Brits to find roles with competitive salaries. \nOne TikTokker, who specialises in opening up companies in the UAE, warned people who cannot guarantee a secure income against coming to Dubai.\n Marium, who posts on the account 'yahesaaccounting', said: 'It [Dubai] is not what it is on social media. \n'It might not necessarily be like that for you if you were to move out here. \n'So bear that in mind and don't be disheartened if when you come here you are not driving around in Lamborghinis every day because that is not reality. \n'And here are my dos and don'ts for moving to Dubai. The first thing is, I would get a legitimate job offer. \n'I've heard of a lot of people where the employers would actually pull out last minute and they have made all their moves in the UK. \n'They have their packing company sorted, they have told their employer they are moving etcetera. \n'Also definitely consider income, the reason for this is that a lot of the jobs here are not paying what they used to pay anymore because there are just so many people coming here. \n'You really need to stand out from the crowd now [on job applications] as there are just so many applicants.' \n\nVehicles are driven along a road with Dubai's iconic skyline in the background last December \n\nShannon Hynes, who runs TikTok account 'thesimplestep', explained the things in Dubai that were more expensive than in the UK\n\nMounting living costs and an increased competition for jobs is making the Dubai dream a more difficult reality for some (stock photo) \n\n I made £30m in Dubai but this is why after two years I HAD to leave \nDubai is currently the world's 15th most expensive city to live in, having climbed three places in Mercer's 2024 ranking.\nIt has the highest cost of living in the Middle East, caused by the 21 per cent jump in house prices.\nIt was exceeded by London, which increased nine places to 8th position. However, Dubai is still now more expensive than Tel Aviv, Miami, Chicago, Paris and Berlin.\nIn January this year, the Daily Mail reported on data from crowdsourced database Numbeo, which revealed an imported 330ml beer was half the price in London, at an average of £5.25 - compared to £10.93 in Dubai.\nMeanwhile, a cappuccino was £3.74 in London against £4.67 in Dubai.\nA McDonalds meal was roughly the same, at £8 in London compared to £7.65 in Dubai.\nCigarettes were 70 per cent cheaper with a 20 pack of Marlboro costing an average of £16.25 in London or £5.03 in Dubai.\nAn average basic utility bill for electricity, heating, cooling, water and garbage for an 85 sq metre apartment in London was £236.75 or £183.23 in Dubai.\nBut internet access was significantly more in the UAE, with a minimum 60 mbps connection with unlimited data costing £80.97 in Dubai or £31.53 in London.\nAs for clothes shopping, a pair of Levi 501 jeans was £77 in London or £60 in Dubai, while a pair of mid-range Nike running trainers was £90 in London or £84 in Dubai.\nShannon Hynes, who runs TikTok account 'thesimplestep' said: 'These are the things that are just so expensive in Dubai there is nothing you can do about it.\n'Number one is gyms. You just have to accept that if you want to look you will have to pay for it. \n'Clothes - the shops are quite considerably more expensive here. Your high street stores - H&M, Zara - however the collections are way better than at home. \n'You pay about 25 per cent more. Everything is more expensive here. So when you can buy things pre-coming over here or when you fly elsewhere, try and do that.\n'Random things like toiletries, shampoo, toiletries, body wash are just way more expensive.' \nLondonDubai\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHas Dubai lost its shine?

Speculation began to build late last week after it appeared that the President did not have anything in his published schedule and had not been seen for days. After weeks of discourse about Trump's appearance and unexplained bruising on his hand, by the weekend, this speculation over his whereabouts had reached a fever pitch. But on Saturday, this internet rumour mill was finally shut down after photographers captured President Trump leaving the residence in a motorcade with his grandchildren, heading out for a day of golf . However, some social media users speculated that the photos weren't actually of him but of a body double that resembles him. READ MORE: NATO scrambles warplanes as Russia shoots down West's F-16 fighter jet in Ukraine onslaught A Redditor in the r/conspiracy subreddit also posted one of the photos, titling the post \"Trump Body Double\" and explaining briefly why they believe the person pictured isn't actually Trump. \"Look at his photos today: Notice how he’s with two diminutive people (grandchildren) so that when people look at him, they can’t speculate accurately on his height?\" they began. An article from Tyla dated June 26 was attached, which the redditor claimed was the first media coverage of the president's alleged body double. \"Additionally, from the article, body doubles wouldn’t be used for high profile events but for 'journey management' aka…above,\" they wrote. \"Additionally…dude in the photos doesn’t look like Trump. Straight up.\" In a brief Truth Social post on Sunday evening, the president attempted to lay to rest fears that he was unwell — and even rumors that he had died late last week. He wrote: \"NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.\" His post was made in a repost of another post from MAGA loyalist and commentator, Rogan O'Handley, which espoused conspiracy theories about former President Joe Biden and his health while in office, In his original comment, O'Handley makes a series of unfounded remarks, including that former President Biden \"was wearing diapers and napping\" during his time in office. He also claimed that \"President Trump puts in more public work hours than any other POTUS in US history,\" despite the MAGA strong man's record-breaking 378 days spent on golf courses in his first term alone - which was more than a quarter of his time in power. According to Forbes, in his current term, Trump has spent a third of his time on properties he owns, like his Mar a Lago resort in Florida. Trump signed his reply to that Truth Social post, also boasting about his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown. He wrote, \"Also, DC IS A CRIME FREE ZONE!\" Trump was recently diagnosed with a condition called chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), which affects the veins and causes impaired blood flow to the heart. CVI is not considered fatal, but can be painful and impair daily function. However, some health experts have warned that this condition, if deteriorating, can badly effect a person's legs and lead to amputation.","summary":"Donald Trump broke his silence after rumors of his death circulated online, penning a short six-word message in all caps as he attempted to lay to rest the baseless rumors","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-breaks-silence-health-35824136","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35823340.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/3_US-POLITICS-NASCAR-DAYTONA500-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:44:27","author":"Paige Ingram","authors":["Paige Ingram"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":356207970,"title":"Revealed: What's really happening at luxury hotel where Jacob Rees-Mogg went viral peering over the wall 'to investigate migrants'","text":"Latest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Sep 1st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPubs urge Rachel Reeves to fix rates in fight to survive: More than 600 landlords warn in letter to Chancellor\n\nA blatant revenue raiser: Dartford Crossing charge increases by 40% from tomorrow - despite Queen Elizabeth II Bridge being paid off 22 YEARS AGO\n\nThe common mistakes millions of savers make that could send YOUR pension on a slippery slope to disaster - and the actions you must take now\n\nPlaying 'nasty' Nick Cotton in EastEnders opened unexpected doors for JOHN ALTMAN: I was driven around in limos and paid £1,000 to insult crowds in nightclubs\n\nFive tell-tale signs that investing money is not for you: 2.9m households in UK are investing when they should not be\n\nUK bidder in last-ditch tilt for Thames Water: Castle boss claims he can wade in to save utility\n\nThe next dotcom 'bubble burst' could be coming and these are the signs anyone with investments or a pension must not ignore\n\nJEFF PRESTRIDGE: This is the champagne socialist who I fear is plotting a vicious raid that'll destroy your pension\n\nWes Streeting waging war on pharma and Health Secretary is playing with fire, says ALEX BRUMMER\n\nCurrys update to spell more gloom for wounded High Street: Retailer will publish a trading update ahead of AGM\n\nKnoops' boss says Labour's workers' rights reforms 'will make it more difficult to find the right employees'\n\nChancellor right to be fearful of another bond market rout: Government borrowing everywhere is unsustainable, says HAMISH MCRAE\n\nSeaside amusement arcades face gambling tax raid: Slot firms on losing streak as fear of hike grows\n\nMIDAS SHARE TIPS: Four high-flying household names who you should dump NOW\n\nBillions wiped off value of banks in Budget tax fright: Think-tank close to Labour wants levy to raise £8bn a year\n\nWhat does it really mean to buy a share of freehold flat - and is it better than leasehold?\n\nSkoda's powerful Kodiaq is an ideal family roadtripper: RAY MASSEY follows in the footsteps of his POW dad\n\nWith summer coming to an end, ANNE ASHWORTH reveals how you can perk up your portfolio - before it's too late\n\nMinisters get stingy with EV discounts: Price cap added to Electric Car Grant to exclude more luxurious models\n\nWould you move to Dubai to get away from tax hikes and live a richer life?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JAMES FIELDING, SENIOR REPORTER \n Published:01:31 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:01:35 BST, 1 September 2025 \n\nA 17th century country house filmed by Jacob Rhys Mogg is being used to house asylum seekers, the Daily Mail can reveal.\nThe former Brexit minister went viral this week when he was filmed being rebuffed by security as he tried to investigate suggestions that secluded Winford Manor in North Somerset is now accommodate illegal, small boat migrants. \nThat clip and his report on his GB News programme State of the Nation, Rees-Mogg, 56, ended inconclusively as guards blocked him at the wrought-iron front gates and he was unable to speak to the groups of men he saw wandering the grounds from over the wall.\nBut today the Daily Mail can reveal that the suspicions of the former minister were correct: the property in the sleepy village of Winford has been used as an asylum centre for some three years.\nAnd we can plot the full story of the takeover of the 36-bedroom property - and how its change of use has infuriated locals.\n Winford Manor was once a luxury hotel and wedding venue - and prior to that it had been a religious retreat, before being bought by investment firm IntSol.\nBut that changed in September 2022 when at a parish council meeting villagers were told that it was going to cease operating as a hotel and become an asylum centre with migrants being bussed into the countryside.\nVillagers say that at no point were they given any prior notice. This change came without warning, they say. \n\nWinford Manor (pictured) the 36-bedroom former luxury 17th century hotel in the Somerset countryside had a rare visitor this week in the shape of Tory grandee Jacob Rees-Mogg \n\nOn his GB News programme State of the Nation, Rees-Mogg tried to establish whether rumours were true - that Winford Manor had shut its gates to guests and was housing asylum seekers\n\nWhile Rees-Mogg's investigations were inconclusive and failed to provide a definitive answer, when the Daily Mail visited the Winford Manor hotel in Somerset hotel this week we confirmed migrants had been living there for three years. A young man is pictured in the hotel grounds\n\nAt a parish council meeting held not long after the hotel temporarily changed use, residents were told 'not to worry' and that 'it won't be as bad as you think' as the contract with the Home Office would last for two years only.\nBut two years has been and gone and as we approach the third anniversary of that meeting the non-paying guests are still there. \nThey are still continuing to turn up in minibuses and taxis nearly a year on from the supposed termination date. \nThey are from a variety of countries including Eritrea, Syria, Ethiopian, Kenya and Somaliland. Most are single men. \nOperations at the manor are run by Clearsprings, a company owned by 'migrant hotel king' billionaire Graham King, on behalf of the Home Office. \nLocals told the Daily Mail how a steady stream of police cars and ambulances enter the manor at all hours, migrants regularly encroach onto private land and start camp fires in nearby fields.\nTony Gould and Carly Gibbs live on a former poultry farm behind the manor house with their nine-year-old son and daughter, aged four.\nCarly, 38, said: 'This has affected us massively but nobody was given any notice by the Government or the local council that the hotel was being turned into an asylum centre.\n'There was no consultation beforehand which would have given us time to bolster our security arrangements, which we've had to do since.\n'We feel like we've been s*** on from a great height to be honest with you.\n'There's a real sense of unease locally with such large numbers of undocumented men living on our doorstep. We don't know who they are or what their intentions are.\n'There's some families living there but hardly any, it's almost exclusively single men.\n'I certainly don't feel safe at home alone when my partner's away. I don't go out running any more because some of the men hang around in groups and they used to shout things out when I ran past them. I found it very intimidating.\n'You would think that living out in the countryside would be relaxing and give us freedoms that people in towns and cities don't have.\n'But that just hasn't been the case for the last three years. I don't let the kids out of my sight.\n'I used to let my son play in the fields around the house but not anymore, no way. He suffers from anxiety and is very nervous in the evenings when it gets dark.\n'You can hear groups of men talking and arguing in the grounds. Some of them are very loud and we hear them right up until about 1.30am on occasion.\n'It's very common for taxis to turn up at all times outside our home after taking the wrong turn and dropping off men. They get out the cab and say 'hotel, hotel?' thinking that my house is the asylum centre.\n'There was one time when a minibus drove up the driveway, parked outside my kitchen and six men got out. They all had cigarettes in their mouths and they were unloading their suitcases when I came out and said 'no, no. Not here. Wrong place. Get back in the bus, get back in'. They looked at me as though I was mad.\n\nCarly Gibbs and her partner Tony Gould live on a former poultry farm behind the manor house with their nine-year-old son Jake and daughter Sophie, aged four. Carly is angry about the situation and says that she has received no reassurance from the Home Office\n'For some reason police cars and ambulances are forever going into the hotel. We did hear rumours of a stabbing a few weeks ago but nobody ever tells us what's going on there.\n'My daughter broke her leg in May while playing at home. I called for an ambulance but because she wasn't unconscious and wasn't bleeding they wouldn't send one.\n'I had to take her to Bristol Children's Hospital about half an hour away. It was awful because she was screaming in pain the whole journey yet not a day seems to go by that an ambulance isn't arriving at that place.\n'We've had enough, the migrants were only supposed to be there for two years but it's coming to three years and more are still coming every week.\n'I emailed the Home Office last September and asked them when is it going to end and how could they guarantee our safety.\n'The reply I got was that Home Office doesn't know who exactly is in the asylum centre but that we were safe. They added that they weren't able to be drawn on how long the migrants will actually be there. They just palmed me off essentially and there's been nothing in the way of communication from anyone since.'\nTony, 66, who runs his own company buying and selling commercial catering equipment, said he had spent more than £2,000 on installing CCTV cameras and upgrading security lighting since the asylum centre set up operations.\nHe said: 'We regularly have strange men walking onto our property, I don't think they grasp the notion of land being private.\n'Earlier in the year, I was in my office when I saw one bloke come walking up the driveway as bold as brass and he sat down on my front lawn and started scrolling through his phone. I had to shoo him away.\n'They come onto our land all the time. I swear one of them went to toilet in the long grass the other day. I caught him walking out and hitching up his trousers.\n'The money they're costing the taxpayer doesn't bear thinking about.\n'I remember a car approaching the house about a year or so ago and I initially assumed it was a taxi dropping off another migrant especially as the driver wound down his window and said he was looking for Winford Manor.\n'But it turned out he was an interpreter. He told me that his business had never been so lucrative. He was earning £160 an hour.\n'The journey from his office in Bath to the manor was a two hour round-trip and he'd spend a hour or so with the migrant he was helping and so was claiming for three hours. We're all paying for that.'\nWhen the Daily Mail visited on Friday, just like Rees-Mogg, we were told by security that we would not be able to approach staff or migrants and that they had been prohibited from speaking to us.\nHowever, several migrant men were seen relaxing in the sprawling grounds of the manor house soaking up the last of the late summer sunshine.\nClare Rippingale, 56, a self-employed gardener and cafe owner moved from Bagshot, Surrey to a cottage opposite Winford Manor four years ago.\nShe said: 'The last thing I wanted when I escaped further into the countryside was for an asylum centre to open up on my doorstep.\n'I went to the parish council meeting along with other upset villagers and members of the parish council - who were sat with members of the county council- told us 'not to worry…it won't be as bad as you think'.\n\nClare Rippingale, 56, (pictured) a cafe owner moved from Bagshot, Surrey, to a cottage opposite Winford Manor four years ago\n'But the issue is that we live in a small isolated community where everybody knows everybody and all of a sudden without warning people start turning up who we know nothing about and who don't know us and are not familiar with our culture.\n'When they first arrived, there was an issue with female horse riders being jeered at by groups of migrant men who would congregate in groups in the village.\n'Some of the migrants have visitors who drive up to see them but because the visitors can't stay with them in the manor, they sleep rough in their cars parked up in the neighbouring fields. The migrants come over to see them and they start camp fires.\n'I've been forced on more than a few occasions to go over and say 'look this is private property, you're going to have to leave'. I'm always very polite and to be fair there's never a problem, they leave the land without issue.\n'A few nights ago the police were called because one of the residents was roaming the grounds of the manor being drunk and abusive at 3.30am.\n'I think a fair few of them struggle to deal with the isolation out here and get bored and frustrated which in turn affects their mental health.\n'I always try to speak to the migrant residents if I see them out in the village. There is a language barrier a lot of the time but one man told me in broken English that they'd been told not to mix with locals as the locals don't want them here.\n'I asked what he did and he said he was a cook in his home country. I told him that he should come work for me in my cafe when he could.\nHe was a decent man, as I'm sure most of them are, it's the unfamiliarity and the lack of communication from the government and council that has been the problem.'\nMs Rippingale said that recently asylum documents were found shredded all along the country lane outside Winford Manor stoking fears that some migrants are fleeing to go live with friends or family elsewhere in the UK illegally.\nThe document belonged to a man who had recently arrived at the manor from another asylum centre in Cardiff.\nShe added: 'We believe it could be that whoever the paperwork belonged to didn't want to be processed but wanted to sneak off and work in the black market somewhere.\n'It's a tough situation to be in. What we don't want to happen is for violent protests to start erupting outside like they have done in Epping and Canary Wharf. That won't do anyone any good.\n'There are rumours anyway that the asylum centre is due to close either later this year or early next and a newly refurbished boutique hotel will take its place…whether that will ever happen remains to be seen.'\nWhen the Mail contacted Avon and Somerset Police they had no record of a stabbing taking place at Winford Manor nor of officers being called to deal with a drunken abusive resident. \nA couple, who asked not to be named, are currently selling their stone cottage opposite Winford Manor.\n\nResidents around the hotel are fed up because they say they were given little prior warning at at parish council meeting three years ago that the premises were being repurposed\n\nResidents say that they were given reassurances that the contract with the Home Office would only last two years, but nearly three years on, minibuses and taxis taking mostly single men from various countries to the property. Pictured: Staff in the grounds this week\n\nSigns have been put up around the hotel in a number of languages so that they are understood by the hotel guests from countries like Eritrea, Syria, Ethiopian, Kenya and Somaliland\nThey admitted they feared the asylum centre may hamper the sale especially as police visit the property regularly and an air ambulance landed in fields behind their home last summer to deal with an incident.\nLess than a mile from the manor is the tiny village of Winford, which has just 1,316 residents.\nWhen the asylum centre was first set up, groups of migrants would head up the dark country lanes to the Prince of Waterloo pub.\nOne regular said: 'They haven't been in for a few years but when the hotel was first converted into an asylum centre, there'd be a small group of migrant men who'd come in during the evening.\n'There'd be four or five of them and one had a bank card that he'd use to pay for the drinks. How someone in a migrant centre had access to a bank card I don't know, but there was never any tension with any of the locals.\n'They sat by themselves mostly because their English wasn't too good.'\nBuilt in the 1600s with extensions added in the 19th and 21st centuries, Winford Manor is half a mile from Bristol Airport and under the flight-path but sits in seven acres of neatly manicured land surrounded by peaceful countryside.\nWhen it operated as a hotel, guests paid £78 a night from a room and were offered a shuttle service to and from Bristol Airport.\nPhotographs from 2017 show lavish weddings taking place at the hotel and in gazebos set up in the grounds.\nDuring his report for GB News, Eton-educated Rees Mogg, dressed in a tailored suit and peering comically over the wall, appeared to suggest that asylum seekers were being 'hidden' in the hotel.\n'You're actually in the middle of nowhere... it seems perhaps a good place to hide illegal migrants in,' he opined.\nThe former MP, who lost his North East Somerset and Hanham seat to Labour last year, poked his head over the wall and called out to what appeared to be security staff: 'Hello! Is this an illegal migrant place?' They did not reply.\n'No-one we've seen looks like someone who would've come over here on a boat,' he added, as he watched a man talk into a walkie-talkie.\nNoting signs in Persian, French and Vietnamese alongside some in English dissuading people from littering, Rees-Mogg defended his reporting on the hotel adding: 'The public deserve to know who is living in their communities.\n'These hotels are appearing in remote locations and the authorities' unwillingness to be transparent about them means it is left to us to do so.'\nDocuments published by the local parish council suggested Winford Manor is made up of mainly single men but had 18 children aged from three years old to 14.\nAn email sent to the parish council by North Somerset Council officers in August 2022 noted: 'Winford Manor has been identified by the Home Office as a hotel for asylum seekers awaiting their application to remain in the UK to be processed.\n\nInvestigations by former Brexit minister Rees-Mogg as he peered over a wall were inconclusive - as security guards prevented him from getting beyond the wrought-iron front gates\n\nFormer Conservative minister Rees-Mogg's probe for GB News this week ended without establishing what the former hotel and one-time wedding venue was now being used for\n'The council was only alerted to this a short time ago and it has been made clear to us that we cannot object to the use of the premises.'\nOfficial land records show the Winford Manor Hotel was sold to IntSol in 2022 via a holding company, Winford Holding Ltd.\nThe company's director, Antonio 'Tony' Kounnis, also runs a security firm and heads up the UK arm of a facial recognition company.\nUpon completion of the sale, acting agents Christie & Co said IntSol had begun a 'sizeable' refurbishment project, including a renovation of the existing rooms and the addition of several more.\nThe Mail has contacted IntSol, the Home Office and North Somerset Council for comment.\nBrexitGB NewsThe Home Office\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRevealed: What's really happening at luxury hotel where Jacob Rees-Mogg went viral peering over the wall 'to investigate migrants'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy EIRIAN JANE PROSSER IN LAUSANNE \n Published:01:40 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:01:42 BST, 1 September 2025 \n\nFor decades Switzerland has been perceived as Europe's most stable country, with its picture-perfect Alpine vistas, private banking vaults and neutral status during conflict.\nIt has long appeared immune to the rising social and political tensions its French, German and Italian neighbours - and increasingly the UK - have been grappling with.\nBut that perception was shattered this week - after the death of 17-year-old Marvin 'Shalom' Manzila in Lausanne sparked rioting that exposed bitter social divisions that have been quietly festering there without coming to the attention of the wider world.\nLausanne police, called to reports of a stolen motor scooter, soon identified Manzila as a suspect - and gave chase when he refused to pull over.\nDuring the pursuit that followed, the boy lost control of the vehicle and was flung into a nearby wall, suffering a fatal head injury.\nMarvin's violent death in the early hours of last Sunday morning marked a final straw for many of those living in the city's multicultural neighbourhood Prélaz and soon the demonstrations turned to rioting.\nThe Daily Mail today reveals for the first time Manzila's identity, along with unseen images of him, and pieces together the back story of the boy whose death caused Lausanne to erupt in violence.\nAnd we can reveal that - for all the talk in the country about immigration that his death has inspired - Marvin was actually born in Switzerland.\n\nRiots erupted in Lausanne, Switzerland, last week following the death of 17-year-old rapper Marvin Shalom Manzila \n\nMarked out lines on the floor show the path Marvin took on his scooter before crashing into the wall \n\nA young person walks past fires in a street, in Lausanne, on August 25, 2025, following Marvin's death\n\nProtesters burn containers during the second night of riots following the fatal accident involving a minor on a scooter in Lausanne, Switzerland, 25 August 2025\n\nHis birth certificate shows he was born in the country on 13 July 2008, to parents of Congolese descent but who had been granted Swiss citizenship, the youngest of three brothers.\nHe and his brothers grew up in the family home near the city's Cathedral, his mother a social care worker, his father in the medical sector, with an apparently stable upbringing - the couple having celebrated 30 years together recently.\nHaving failed to find lasting employment after leaving school and had been due to start a so-called Semester of Motivation (SeMo) - a semi-mandatory national training service for the unemployed - next Monday, eight days after he died.\nBut perhaps the reason he was seen as needing state-provided motivation was that his real interest was in rap music.\nMarvin seems to have been spending his unemployed days making music, under his stage name MNS, and posting the results on YouTube or Instagram.\nWhether he had stolen the scooter remains unclear - his family insist he hadn't.\nSpeaking to the newspaper, his distraught mother insisted: 'My son wasn't a scooter thief. He wasn't a bandit, he wasn't known to the law. He was never a complicated child. He was stable.\n'We didn't see a scooter stolen from home. There was a group effect. They passed this scooter around among the kids.\n'Who brought this scooter? We don't know. Talking about it makes my stomach ache.'\nAnd she insisted that any suggestion Marvin came from a broken home were completely untrue, saying: 'I work, my husband works. We are integrated in Switzerland.\n'We are a practicing Christian family. There is a framework. If our children don't come home, we call them.'\nOn Friday night, a service in memory of Marvin was held at the local Catholic Church.\nMarvin’s mother and father were there, sitting together united in their grief amongst hundreds of heartbroken friends and family.\nThe hall of the local Catholic Church was packed full as they listened to stories about the teenager.\nIt was clear from the turnout that Marvin and his family are well-loved members of their community.\nWe spoke to friends of Marvin who all echoed his mother's insistence that he had been a decent boy.\nWe found Anania, who says she was Marvin's best friend, sitting on a bench watching people visit the memorial of flowers and other tributes that has sprung up at the spot where he died.\n\nRiot police clashed with around 200 protesters in the neighbourhood of Prélaz on August 25\n\nDamage on the main street in Prélaz almost a week on from the riots following Marvin's death\n\nMarvin's real interest was in building his rap career under his stage name MNS, and posting the results on YouTube or Instagram.\n\nDozens of flowers, candles, letters and pictures of Marvin have gathered in the spot where he died\n\nMarvin's mother is comforted by a friend as she attends a memorial service for her son \nHis friend group is still coming to terms with their sudden loss and can't believe their friend, who was 'always smiling' is no longer here, she said.\n'He was a very nice boy, everyday he was smiling,' Anania told us.\nAnother friend Vesa added: 'He had the best smile ever. He was the nicest guy. This is all really hard.'\nAltuna, who also knew Marvin, told us: 'I don't know what to say. This is an awful tragedy. He was a good boy.\n'He was very respectful and he was too young to die. He shouldn't have died because of the police.'\nAnother friend, Medina, agreed: 'We are sad and angry with the police, with what happened. He did not deserve it.'\nThis final sentiment is one that has been echoed by many, particularly among migrant communities, across Switzerland. There is great anger at the police.\nThe tragedy surrounding Marvin's death has sparked a wider conversation about Swiss Police's attitude - especially towards minorities.\nThe self-styled rapper is the third person of non-Swiss ethnicity to die during a police operation in the pretty lakeside city in just three months.\nIn June this year, a 14-year-old girl named Camila, of Portuguese descent, also died in a similar incident, crashing while she was on a scooter being chased by police.\nThat same month, the death of a young Nigerian man being held in police custody sparked protests with police officers in the canton of the Vaud being branded racist.\nAnd that's why when news of Marvin's death emerged on there were protests so quickly in one of the poorer quarters of the wealthy city of Lausanne - and quickly turned to violence.\nBetween 150 and 200 of those protesting are thought to have been involved in the violence that broke out around 9.30pm.\nSome wearing masks threw Molotov cocktails. Bins were set on fire, as well as a bus belonging to Lausanne's transport company.\nThe next evening, the chaos continued as anger continued unabated.\nPolice officers were pelted with stones with the 140 cops retaliating with tear gas and rubber bullets.\nBut in perhaps a peculiarly Swiss way, the riot was focused solely on the authorities. \nUnlike what might be expected during civil disorder, the violence did not impact any local businesses.\n\nA mother-of-three visits the memorial to Marvin, fearing for her children's safety in the city\n\nA passer-by pays his respects to the teenager, reading the letters written about Marvin\n\nOliver Phan Sy, who lives in the flats directly above the scene of the accident, told the Daily Mail: 'This neighbourhood is very cosmopolitan, and everyone lives in harmony together\nNo shop fronts were smashed in and no businesses were looted. Just the police and the authorities bore the brunt.\nAlmost a week on from those two nights of violence, most of the damage has been cleared up, with burn marks on the tarmac and missing glass at a bus stop the only visible legacy.\nBut people are still angry, with a long stream of mourners visiting the memorial where he died, many in tears all week.\nAnd Marvin's death comes at a tense time for the local police force, who are currently battling allegations of racism, sexism and discrimination.\nFour police officers have been suspended after two WhatsApp groups of up to 48 officers reportedly shared images and messages deemed racist, anti-Semitic, sexist, homophobic, and discriminatory to those with disabilities.\nMeanwhile, a complaint was filed against an officer who is said to have taken a picture and placed a thumbs up in front of a memorial for the Nigerian man who died in June.\nAnd the conduct of six officers involved in that death is currently being examined in an ongoing case at the Lausanne District Court.\n\nA damaged road following the riots almost a week ago. No shop fronts were smashed in and no businesses were looted. Just the police and the authorities bore the brunt\n\nMarvin spent a lot of time in the neglected area of Borde in the city. Pictured: A man walks past a Black Lives Matter mural \n\nA week on from the riots, a bus shelter remains without glass after it was shattered during the protests\nEven Grégoire Junod the City Mayor - head of a left-leaning coalition of Socialists and Greens - said: 'There is a systemic discrimination problem that needs to be addressed.'\nAll of this has led to mounting calls for deeper institutional reform and further action to be taken - amid a good deal of Swiss political soul searching.\nFor decades, Switzerland - untouched by migrant‑driven unrest that affected its neighbours - seemed immune.\nThe country prided itself on neutrality and emotional detachment from colonial legacies. It watched from the sidelines as France, Britain and Germany struggled with integration and violent clashes - and stayed confident in its own social model.\nBut the unrest in Lausanne - and recent echoes in Zurich, Bern and Basel - brings a new dynamic to any complacency.\nThe Alpine country has become a nation of immigrants. Nearly 40 per cent of Swiss residents are either immigrants or children of immigrants, making Switzerland one of the most diverse countries in Europe.\nForeign nationals account for 27 per cent of the population, according to the Federal Statistical Office, while illegal immigration has significantly decreased in the last year.\nIn 2024, 14,963 illegal stays in Switzerland were recorded from January to the end of July. In the same period this year there were 8,461, mostly Turkish nationals with arrests mainly made in Ticino, the canton bordering Italy.\nThe total number of illegal immigrants in 2024 was 29,459 with Syrians the majority. In 2023 the figure was 50,185 with Afghans and Moroccans the majority.\nThe year 2023 also saw the largest population increase in more than six decades.\nOne man originally from Albania, who did not want to be named, insisted that there is a grave problem with police racism in Lausanne.\nBy way of proof he showed us a video purported to show him and a group of friends being beaten up by police officers as they tried to make their way to the airport for a holiday.\nHe told the Daily Mail: 'We have too many problems with the police here but people don't talk about it here in Switzerland. People want to protect the police and the police just want control.\n'My friends in Germany, in France, they all believe Switzerland is safe and there are no problems here, every country believes that because we don't advertise the issues we have.'\nHis friend added: 'We always have a lot of problems here, all we get is problems with the police. They never seem to have body cameras on. Maybe one out of 10 do.'\nOthers, however, are not so quick to blame the police, claiming that new protocols need to be introduced for relatively new crimes, such as stealing scooters.\n\nPolice officers intervene during the second night of riots following the fatal accident involving a minor on a scooter in Lausanne, Switzerland, 25 August 2025\n\nIt was the third death in less than three months in Lausanne during a police intervention\n\nA memorial to Marvin has been made where he crashed on the road last Sunday night\nMarco Bocquet, who lives nearby the spot where Marvin died, I think it's really sad what happened but I don't want to blame the police either, they were doing their job but the poor guy unfortunately died.\n'The only thing I think is why could they not have let him go and try to speak with him later in a safer way. It's such a sad story.'\nHis husband Max added: 'The police are not trained for this sort of thing, when people try and escape from police checks. They don't know how to handle it.\n'It had already happened once at the beginning of the summer to a 14-year-old girl and I think this is why the population is quite shocked. Two incidents so close together.'\nMarco added: 'Young people are sick of these things happening. The police are not well trained for these sorts of situations and they don't know how to handle it.'\nAnd there was particular shock in the working-class area of Prélaz, with its pretty coloured flat blocks and quiet streets, as it had long been known for being peaceful and pleasant.\nOne resident told us: 'These scenes of violence are more commonly associated in troubled places like Marseille or in the Parisian suburbs. Not in Lausanne.'\nAs the editor of 24heurs Eric Lecluyse said in his column this week: 'The Prélaz district of Lausanne is not a neglected no-go area, like some municipalities on the outskirts of Paris.\n'And the standard of living of residents is generally much higher in Switzerland.\n'Yet, here too, the anger of some young people is exploding, igniting a neighborhood. This trend is worrying.'\nIndeed, Oliver Phan Sy, who lives in the flats directly above the scene of the accident, told the Daily Mail: 'This neighbourhood is very cosmopolitan, and everyone lives in harmony together.\n'It is very peaceful unlike in France, where I am from, where the cities are very segregated. Here everyone is mixed together and it's usually very peaceful.\n'But what hasn't been discussed in the media, is that while the protesting was going on just two streets from here, at the same time the boy's family, including his mother, were here holding a vigil.\n'It was very sombre and quiet. There was a very heavy ambience. It was very different from what the images on the news showed.'\nYet commentators have said the violence on the streets of Prélaz is down to left-wing policies, particularly on over-migration - and fear this is just the tip of the iceberg.\nA headline in Die Weltwoche read: 'Lausanne burns like the Parisian suburbs… Politicians with irresponsible immigration policy to blame.'\nA headline in Die Weltwoche this week read: 'Lausanne burns like the Parisian suburbs… Politicians with irresponsible immigration policy to blame.'\n\nMarvin seems to have been spending his days making music, under his stage name MNS, and posting the results on YouTube or Instagram\n\nMarvin's friends Vesa, Medina and Anania visit the shrine of their friend Marvin\n\nAltuna (pictured right), who also knew Marvin, told us: 'I don't know what to say. This is an awful tragedy. He was a good boy. 'He was very respectful and he was too young to die. He shouldn't have died because of the police.'\n\nThree teenage girls look on at the memorial for Marvin almost a week after his death\nCommentator Hubert Mooser lamented that Lausanne - with 42 per cent foreign residents - has become a staging ground for African gangs peddling drugs, calling the city 'Lausanne or Lagos?'\nCédric Weissert, President of the SVP in the Grand Council of Vaud, told MailOnline: 'I think integration is less widespread than it was a few years ago. Currently, a certain number of immigrants come seeking a better life but without giving themselves the necessary means to integrate and participate in community life.\n'Controlled and successful immigration is better than uncontrolled integration that ends up derailing, as is happening in some countries around us.\n'People who come must make this effort to integrate. Clearly, no racist or xenophobic incidents should be tolerated.\n'On the other hand, we sense frustration among the population, realizing that we work hard, that prices are rising and that some people are taking advantage of the system and sometimes committing crimes.'\nAnd while peace has been restored in Lausanne for now, experts fear this could be just the beginning of the chaos as Switzerland's way.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFor decades Switzerland has been the quiet neighbour of Europe.

The summit also includes leaders from 16 observer or ‘dialogue partner’ countries.\n\nLike Xi and Putin, all of them have been accused of restricting free speech and political representation in their countries.\n\nXi told the reception that, in the past century, there had been a ‘significant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors’ and the SCO had become an ‘important force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind’.\n\nPutin and several other attendees are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression.\n\nNorth Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un is also expected to attend the military parade.\n\nIt is the largest summit to be held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001.\n\nThe SCO is a key part of Beijing’s push for stronger multilateral alternatives to Western or US-led blocs such as Nato.\n\nThis goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by the US President’s global tariff regime.\n\nThe meeting took place five days after Washington imposed 50 per cent levies on Indian goods because of Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.\n\nIt is Mr Modi’s first visit to China in seven years and comes after a period of simmering tensions over long-running Himalayan border disputes.\n\nBut the world’s most populous nations on Sunday pointed to a new era of co-operation, pledging to resume suspended flights at an unspecified date.\n\n‘We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,’ Modi said after meeting Xi.\n\nHe added: ‘The interests of 2.8billion people of both countries are linked to our cooperation. This will also pave the way for the welfare of the entire humanity.’ Footage shown by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin warmly greeting each other before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation.\n\nLim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said: ‘As long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia’s off-limits cooperation will remain.\n\n‘Their cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt is a summit designed to challenge the West&#8217;s historical dominance of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Putin, Xi, and Modi: A Trio Meeting That Raises Questions in the West first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/putin-xi-and-modi-a-trio-meeting-that-raises-questions-in-the-west/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Putin-and-Xi-in-picture-to-chill-West-so-what.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:31:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.278},{"id":356211446,"title":"Trump dismisses health worries with a confident response","text":"Donald Trump issued a defiant response Sunday to the wild recent rumors and conspiracy theories about his health. \n\nThe 79-year-old president had been the focus of both curiosity and harsh jokes about his location from liberals all weekend.

Frankly, I think he has a major lawsuit against Baseball. If it were me, I'd sue them.'\n\nTrump then referenced Pete Rose - baseball's all-time hits leader - who was banned for life in 1989 for gambling on games but was removed from MLB's ineligible list. \n\nRose is now eligible for Hall of Fame consideration despite being excluded during his lifetime. \n\nTrump continued: 'PUT ROGER CLEMENS IN THE HALL OF FAME, NOW — NOT LIKE YOU DID WITH PETE ROSE, WHEN YOU WAITED UNTIL HE WAS DEAD! That wasn't the deal I made with the Commissioner, Rob Manfred, many months before he died.\n\n'The deal was that he was going to be put up, immediately, but they waited and waited and waited, and then, put him up because of 'death.' \n\n'It shouldn't have been because of death, it should have been because of TALENT! This is not going to happen with Roger Clemens.'\n\nIn March, Trump hit out at MLB, claiming the league needed to 'get off its fat, lazy ass, and elect' Rose posthumously to the Baseball Hall of Fame. \n\nThe president took to Truth Social to plead Clemens's case yet again in a fiery rant\n\nThe late Pete Rose became Hall of Fame eligible in May after a ruling from Rob Manfred\n\nThe late baseball legend was then made Hall of Fame eligible in May when the commissioner altered the policy, consequently lifting the lifetime ban handed down to the 17-time All-Star by then-commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti in 1989.\n\nAnd Manfred later confessed that the president's outspoken support of Rose - despite the scandals that plagued his career - influenced his decision. \n\n'The President was one of a number of voices that was supportive of the idea that this was the right decision,' he told reporters, via TMZ. 'Obviously, I have respect for the office, and the advice that he gave, I paid attention to.' \n\nHowever, the commissioner did also stress that Trump wasn't the only voice he listened to when weighing up the decision. \n\nRose, a three-time World Series winner, passed away at the age of 83 in September 2024 without ever fulfilling his wish to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile he is considered one of the greatest players in history, the legend was slapped with a lifetime ban for betting on the Cincinnati Reds as both a player and manager of the team in 1989.\n\nYet, Trump has long been an advocate for Rose, saying that he belongs in Cooperstown despite the all-time hit king's issues with gambling, tax fraud, and alleged statutory rape. \n\nMeanwhile, Clemens' legacy in baseball is complicated to say the least.\n\nDuring his career, Clemens established himself as one of the game's premier pitchers\n\nConsidered by many to be among the greatest pitchers ever, he set a Major League record with the Boston Red Sox by striking out 20 batters in a game in 1986 and did it a decade later to boot. Along the way, the former Texas Longhorns star established himself as one of the game's premier pitchers before moving on to Toronto and New York, winning a pair of World Series titles in the Bronx.\n\nBut Clemens will forever be linked to baseball's steroid era.\n\nDonald Trump's golf struggles revealed by baseball legend and accused steroids cheat\n\nHe was named in the infamous Mitchell Report, which was a 20-month investigation into steroid use in baseball. \n\nIn the report, former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee stated he injected Clemens with steroids in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Former teammates Jose Canseco, Andy Pettitte and Jason Grimsley also claimed to know that Clemens used steroids as well.\n\nClemens was ultimately found not guilty of lying to Congress in 2008, when he testified that he did not take steroids.\n\nThe controversy nonetheless tarnishes his reputation as Clemens has been passed repeatedly over for the Hall of Fame, having never received the 75 percent of votes required for induction over his ten years on the ballot. However, he could theoretically be inducted down the road by the Hall's Eras Committees.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nFurious Donald Trump urges MLB icon to sue baseball chiefs over drug scandal as he doubles down on Hall of Fame demand\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Clemens is considered one of the greatest players to take to the mound following his glittering 24-season career in the majors - but had his reputation tarnished after a drug scandal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/mlb/article-15053013/Donald-Trump-MLB-drug-scandal-baseball.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/01/01/101716255-0-image-m-50_1756685536986.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:21:10","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":356205872,"title":"Trump Labels DC a ‘CRIME FREE ZONE’ During Federal Crackdown Efforts","text":"President Donald Trump has declared Washington, D.C. to be crime-free.\n\nPosting on Truth Social on Sunday, the president wrote: “DC IS NOW A CRIME FREE ZONE, IN JUST 12 DAYS!!!

sides to be friends, who have good neighbourly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other's success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,\" Mr Xi said during the summit's

‘Never felt better in my life’","text":"President Donald Trump has responded to speculation about his health in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE,” the president wrote on Sunday night, linking back to a Truth Social post from another user making disparaging comments about former President Joe Biden’s health, before adding the “media freaks out if Trump disappears for 24 hours.” \n\nUnfounded rumors swirled on social media this week about the president’s health. Conspiracy theorists pointed to the fact that Trump hadn’t been seen publicly since his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and had a clear weekend schedule. \n\nOthers also cited Vice President JD Vance’s interview on Wednesday with USA Today, in which he said he’s ready to assume the presidency if a “terrible tragedy” occurred. In that same interview, Vance also noted Trump is in “incredibly good health.” \n\nQuestions about the president’s health were among the top Google searches at noon on Saturday, while “Where is Donald Trump” was trending on X, Forbes reports. However, Trump was spotted again on Saturday en route to his Virginia golf course.\n\nIn the same Truth Social post, Trump also declared Washington, D.C., a “crime free zone.” Trump deployed the National Guard to the nation’s capital this month, claiming he did so in response to a “crime emergency.” Violent crime has been declining in D.C. since 2023. \n\nTrump has been especially active on Truth Social this weekend, sharing dozens of posts since Saturday, including more declarations that D.C. is now safe and a call to end mail-in voting. He also posted a bizarre rant lashing out at a White House Rose Garden worker for damaging a piece of stone and shared surveillance footage of the incident.\n\nQuestions about Trump’s health mounted earlier this year as photos of his swollen ankles and bruised hands circulated online.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt disclosed in July that Trump, 79, had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. The condition is fairly common in older people, and occurs when veins in the legs struggle to carry blood to the heart. \n\nLeavitt added that there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. A blood count test and echocardiogram also came back normal, she said.","summary":"Trump was seen en route to his golf course in Virginia on Saturday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-health-rumors-response-truth-social-b2817486.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/31/05/Trump_52046.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5j8KAymy-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:00:47","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":356207220,"title":"As China’s military closes gap on US, economic security becomes the new frontier","text":"As next-generation tanks and fighter jets roll past the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, many in China will be swept up in a sense of national pride.\nThe Chinese leadership has set a target for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to emulate the American military – often described as the greatest fighting force in history – by 2049.\nThe futuristic hardware on show by the PLA will prompt optimism at home that China is on track to meet that goal. Indeed, the dazzling display is a testament to the stunning progress the military has made over the past decade.\nThe days of a handful of American electronic warfare aircraft being capable of paralysing half of China’s air defence system have gone. Yet, Washington has found another Achilles’ heel to target on its superpower contender.\nWhile the PLA has been closing the gap on its American counterpart, Washington has perfected the art of turning its “exorbitant privilege” in the global financial system into weapons of mass economic destruction.\nCombining its commanding lead in technology with its position as the world’s largest consumer market, the US is creating powerful choke points over its potential rivals and adversaries.\nThe strategy of using economic weapons to weaken your enemy is as ancient as war itself, but no power in history has enjoyed the kind of leverage that Washington wields over others.\nWhen Napoleon Bonaparte tried to sanction Great Britain into submission 220 years ago, he had to rely on the inadequate French navy to blockade trade routes – an attempt that was doomed to fail.\nToday, the US does not need to send a single warship to inflict much greater economic damage – all it needs is a roomful of accountants and lawyers.\n\nThe American share in global trade has shrunk from an estimated 22 per cent in 1944 – when the dollar hegemony was established under the Bretton Woods system – to about 10 per cent in 2024, yet the usage of the US dollar in global trade has surged from about 50 per cent then to nearly 90 per cent today.\nNo power in history has enjoyed such a stranglehold over the international trade and financial system. But while the US has occupied this advantageous position for 80 years, it only started to seriously weaponise it during Barack Obama’s presidency.\nWorried over the potential collateral damage to the economy and the impact on US dollar hegemony, previous presidents never fully utilised the arsenal of American economic weapons at their disposal.\nObama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, famously said in 2005 that the US could not continue to press Iran through sanctions “because we’ve sanctioned ourselves out of influence”.\nHowever, as the US reeled from the exorbitant costs of the second Iraq war, economic arm-twisting was becoming a much more palatable alternative.\nOver the next two decades, Washington grew increasingly confident and open to using economic and technological choke points as tools of political pressure. It was also willing to experiment with ever more creative ways of deploying them.\nThe US sanctions strategy transformed – from a relatively focused approach, mainly targeted at terrorist groups and rogue regimes and with a heavy stress on cooperation – into a vast, complex policy arsenal, often used regardless of international agreement or support.\n\nThe number of designated entities sanctioned by the US in 2005 was in the thousands and, 20 years later, has ballooned to tens of thousands. But the sheer number comparison is misleading. The scale of these sanctions is also much larger and more complex.\nWashington discovered that it could sanction countries such as Iran or Cuba, which have little direct trade with the US, because it does not need to ask other countries for support.\nInstead, it can bypass national governments and go directly to the commercial banks – threatening to kick them out of the US dollar-dominated financial system unless they comply with America’s sanction laws and regulations.\nThe 2005 Banco Delta Asia case was a wake-up call for many, in what it revealed about the true extent of American dollar hegemony after the US did not consult Beijing when it decided to sanction North Korea.\nA unilateral move to ban a small bank in Macau for carrying out transactions on behalf of Pyongyang was enough to trigger a bank run in the Chinese city, prompting all other banks to cut ties with North Korea within weeks.\nHenry Kissinger used to describe American aircraft carriers as “100,000 tonnes of diplomacy”. Now the US only need a few suitcases of legal documents to achieve the same results.\nThe weaponisation of the global trade and financial system accelerated significantly in Donald Trump’s first term, with China emerging as the primary target of what had become a vast and sophisticated toolset.\nThe US was by now capable of carrying out “precision strikes” – targeting specific entities, such as Huawei or ZTE, or geographical regions, like Xinjiang – without engaging in a full-blown economic war with the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 saw an explosion in Washington’s weaponisation of its economic and technological choke points. Alarmingly, the rationale behind the US sanctions strategy has also undergone a drastic evolution.\nIn the past, Washington saw sanctions as a tool to force behavioural change – such as compelling Tehran to give up its nuclear programme.\nHowever, the ultimate goal against China is to significantly weaken the country, preventing it from ever challenging US hegemony. The sanctions and technology controls, dressed in the language of “de-risking”, become an end in themselves.\nBeijing is acutely aware of the danger it faces.\nSome observers may dismiss the effectiveness of Washington’s economic choke point strategy as “overrated” – a claim that seems to be justified by the Russian experience.\nThe unprecedented sanctions imposed on Moscow in 2022 caused some economic difficulties, but never led to the doomsday scenario predicted by economists. Instead, Russia’s economy registered 4.1 per cent growth in 2024, after a moderate contraction in 2023.\nBut this is misleading. China’s economy is fundamentally different from Russia’s, which is mainly based on sales of natural resources. As the world’s largest trading power, China relies heavily on international trade.\nEven as Beijing deliberately shifts its trade away from the US, it still depends on the dollar-dominated systems to complete its business with others.\n\nOver the past two decades, China has sought to reduce its dollar dependence through traditional methods – such as currency swap agreements – and innovative approaches, including the digital yuan.\nYet, the yuan’s share of China’s cross-border trade – which peaked at around 28 per cent in 2015 – declined to 15 per cent in 2021 amid market volatility. It returned to 28 per cent this year, but it is hard to see China greatly reducing the use of dollars soon.\nAt the same time, Trump made arguably one of the most consequential moves in his second term with the Genius Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar.\nAmerican stablecoins promise to combine the price stability and liquidity of fiat money with the speed, convenience and global connectivity of blockchain technology. If they become mainstream, they would significantly enhance the exorbitant privilege of the US dollar.\nIt is a small wonder that Beijing, known for its extreme caution regarding cryptocurrencies and capital controls, is willing to allow Hong Kong to explore the idea of stablecoins.\nWhile it is not clear how far China is willing to go down that path, Hong Kong – as China’s most prominent fintech hub – is crucial to the nation’s quest to achieve financial security.\nThis week, the world’s attention will be on the massive military parade in Beijing, with its impressive array of hardware a demonstration of China’s growing capability in national defence.\nYet an equally important frontier is just beginning to take shape in Hong Kong. This time, we must lead the charge rather than watch from the sidelines.","summary":"As next-generation tanks and fighter jets roll past the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, many in China will be swept up in a sense of national pride.\nThe Chinese leadership has set a target for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to emulate the American military – often described as the greatest fighting force in history – by 2049.\nThe futuristic hardware on show by the PLA will prompt optimism at home that China is on track to meet that...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3323606/chinas-military-closes-gap-us-economic-front-opens-race-security","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/29/83c9cf9f-4294-40e8-b6dd-47f68fc92534_36e8de87.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:00:09","author":"Chow Chung-yan","authors":["Chow Chung-yan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.246},{"id":356207142,"title":"How a tiny metal part showed a $100 million bag maker the high cost of obscure trade codes","text":"As President Donald Trump's new trade tariffs take effect, business owners are scrutinizing every item in their catalogue and scouring obscure import codes for savings.For viral beach tote maker Bogg, the stakes became painfully clear when CEO Kim Vaccarella's team reviewed a small keychain. They saw that a zinc alloy key ring was incorrectly classified as stainless steel under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, or HTS.That caused duty rates to be 30% higher than expected, Vaccarella told Business Insider.\"As if the tariffs weren't bad enough, getting charged incorrectly adds to the mayhem,\" she said.The HTS is essentially the government's master list of about 20,000 product codes.Before Trump's tariff hike, most goods fell between zero and 7%, keeping the US average at about 1.4%, said Scott Maberry, a Washington-based trade lawyer at Sheppard Mullin. Now, with a 10% baseline tariff layered on top of country- and product-specific duties, the average rate has surged closer to 18%.That means even small oversights in classification can result in big costs for importers like New Jersey-based Bogg.\"It wasn't even like we picked this particular material for aesthetic purposes or anything like that — it's just what we sampled out and were using. So we did have to go back to the drawing board on that one to be able to bring that product back,\" she said.Bogg is now reclassifying the part as zinc alloy, which comes with a lower tariff rate than stainless steel.To cope, some businesses are turning to tariff engineering — a well-established and legal move to qualify for a lower duty code by tweaking materials, product design, or the way an item is used.Emil Stefanutti, the CEO of trade-tech startup Gaia Dynamics, said one client shifted a beanie's material blend from 50% wool to just over 50%, moving it into a different tariff category.\"Somebody would say, 'Let's just change the composition of our material so that it has more wool in it, so that we can classify it with this HTS code as opposed to the previous one we were using, and now we're saving 4.2% on every beanie we sell,'\" Stefanutti said.Vinny Licata, the head of logistics and import compliance at Fictiv, a digital manufacturing platform, said classification can also hinge on how a product is used.\"A motor goes into a medical device versus a motor that may go into a car — you could just optimize the way you put it in the correct category,\" said Licata.Even the biggest retailers are paying attention.On Walmart's May earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said suppliers were \"shifting materials from tariff-impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass, where there is no tariff.\"\"Our merchants, sourcing team, and suppliers are being creative,\" McMillon said.With more than 20,000 classifications for everything from shoes to circuit boards, mistakes are common — and costly.\"It's like getting your own taxes wrong,\" said Stefanutti. \"If you misdeclare taxes in most countries, you'll be in trouble, potentially.\"The same applies to HTS codes.Getting HTS classification wrong can mean the difference between paying a modest duty or getting hit with a massive surcharge.It can also lead to fines, seizures, and reputational damage if Customs decides an importer crossed the line.Penalties escalate quickly: A simple mistake might cost the importer based on the duties owed or a portion of the goods' value, gross negligence increases the hit, and fraud can cost you up to the full value of the shipment.In March 2024, Ford agreed to pay $365 million after authorities found it misclassified vans to dodge a 25% tariff — one of the largest customs penalties in recent history.Importers are scrutinizing HTS codes not just to lower tariffs but to keep up with enforcement.According to a May memo from the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, trade and customs fraud is now a top enforcement priority.Maberry's law firm has received 35% more client queries about HTS classification and reclassifications in an average month than before the 2024 election, he said.At Gaia Dynamics, requests for audits are surging and now make up about 40% of the business.In the past, projects were more routine and involved classifying new items being imported, said Stefanutti, Gaia Dynamics' CEO.\"Now, companies are saying, 'We need to classify everything in our inventory, right away, to make sure everything is correct,'\" he said.At Fictiv, Licata said customers are increasingly demanding visibility into how classification and tariffs affect costs.Rather than focus narrowly on tariff percentages, Licata pushes clients to calculate the all-in cost of getting a product from the seller's door to its final destination.His advice to importers still recalculating costs under Trump's tariffs is blunt. \"Even if you bring it to the US, you will just have a higher labor rate,\" Licata said.With \"just no way to avoid a higher cost,\" Licata advises businesses to better manage their costs.Bogg had relied exclusively on Chinese factories for more than a decade. Tariffs led the company to diversify its supply chain.The bag maker has shifted 30% of its production from China to Vietnam and aims to move 50% of its production outside China by early next year.The company generated $100 million in revenue last year and aimed for $170 million in 2025, but tariffs and supply chain disruptions have put that target out of reach, said Vaccarella, the CEO.Despite the strain, Vaccarella has resisted passing costs on. Her original bag model costs $90.Instead, like many importers, she's finding that the difference between protecting her margins and losing them can be as small as a few digits in the HTS code.\"Now we're hyper-focused on paying attention to what we're using to make sure that we're not getting killed in tariffs on a particular product,\" Vaccarella said.","summary":"Trump's new tariffs are forcing businesses to pore over obscure HTS import codes, rework products, and diversify supply chains to keep costs down.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/hts-code-lookup-trade-tariff-engineering-import-business-trump-economy-2025-8","image":"https://i.insider.com/68b16136cfc04e97619c41f1?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-01 00:00:02","author":"Huileng Tan","authors":["Huileng Tan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":356204818,"title":"Modi and Xi Jinping discuss strategic autonomy and strengthening India-China relations","text":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that India and China both pursue strategic autonomy and that their relations should not be seen through a third-country lens, in what’s being seen as a strong message as both sides seek to stabilise ties hit by border tensions in 2020. Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping also underscored efforts to settle their differences. The Prime Minister’s comments were made on Sunday during his meeting with Xi Jinping ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) two-day summit in Tianjin from Sunday. This is Modi’s first visit to China in seven years. Xi echoed Modi on strategic autonomy and independent diplomacy. The formulation is significant as it’s often been alleged that other countries have used India to counterbalance China and Sino-Pakistan ties. The two leaders also recognised the role of their economies to steady world trade.PM Modi and the Chinese President underlined the need to proceed from a political and strategic direction to expand bilateral trade and investment ties and reduce their trade deficit. This comes amid the global trade upheaval stemming from US tariffs. Live EventsIndia has its own trade issues with China, given the curbs imposed on exports of rare earth magnets, fertilisers and other key products by Beijing, although these have been relaxed since a thaw set in a few weeks ago. India doesn’t allow automatic approval of Chinese investments in Indian companies. New Delhi is willing to allow Chinese investments through joint ventures in non-strategic sectors.Modi “underlined the importance of peace and tranquillity along the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations,” according to a statement issued by the foreign ministry. The two leaders “expressed commitment to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question proceeding from the political perspective of their overall bilateral relations and long-term interests... They recognised the important decisions taken by the two special representatives in their talks earlier this month, and agreed to further support their efforts,” the ministry said. “The two leaders noted with satisfaction the successful disengagement last year and the maintenance of peace... since then.”They deemed it necessary to expand common ground on bilateral, regional and global issues and challenges, such as terrorism and fair trade on multilateral platforms, according to the readout. People in the know said the PM raised the issue of terrorism “emphatically” during his meeting with the Chinese President. Modi called terrorism a global threat and urged China to work jointly with India in combating the menace. Sino-Pakistan military ties and Beijing’s support to Islamabad during Operation Sindoor have been a big irritant in IndiaChina ties. Both leaders welcomed the positive momentum and steady progress in relations since their last meeting in Kazan in October 2024, and reaffirmed that the two countries were “development partners and not rivals, and that their differences should not turn into disputes.”Xi Jinping pointed out that they are the world’s two most populous nations and part of the Global South and emphasised the importance of being friends and good neighbours. Achieving a “Dragon-Elephant dance” is the right choice for both sides, he said. People aware of the matter said Sunday’s meeting will give the necessary political direction to stabilise the relationship, amid the low in the India-US ties and US President Donald Trump insisting he placed the role of peacemaker during Operation Sindoor. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods and US administration officials have made aggressive comments targeting India over Russian oil purchases.In his opening remarks at the meeting, Modi spoke of peace and stability in ties with China. “Last year in Kazan, we had very productive discussions, which gave a positive direction to our relations. After the disengagement at the border, an atmosphere of peace and stability is now in place. Our special representatives have also reached an agreement on border management,” he said. “The Kailash Mansarovar Yatra has resumed. Direct flights are also being resumed between the two countries. Our cooperation is linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people. This will also pave the way for the welfare of all humanity. We are committed to advancing our relations based on mutual trust, respect, and sensitivity.”The two leaders noted the need to strengthen people-to-people ties through tourist visas. It may be recalled that at the special representatives-level meeting, India and China announced several confidence building measures (CBMs), including setting up an expert group, working group and general-level mechanisms, to stabilise the Line of Actual Control. The PM expressed support for China's presidency of the SCO and the summit. He also invited Xi Jinping to the BRICS Summit that India will be hosting in 2026. The premier has offered China's support to India's BRICS presidency.

Modi shared with Cai his vision for bilateral relations and sought the official’s support to realise this.

Rice exports to the US fell 4.8% in the same period while rising to Bangladesh, the UAE, Togo, and Kenya. Similarly, India’s exports of certain types of tractors to the US slipped 22% in the first three months of FY26 while those to Italy, Bangladesh, and Belgium rose. “There are more than 10 products where export diversification has already begun happening away from the US to other geographies,” said an official.Live EventsThe US first imposed 25% tariffs on Indian goods from August 1, doubling to 50% effective August 27 due to India’s purchases of Russian crude oil.The commerce and industry ministry has prepared a phased export diversification plan in response to the high US tariffs, mapping critical HS codes, clusters, and alternative markets, officials said, adding that the strategy is two-pronged. “We plan to scale up exports to existing markets like the EU, UK, UAE, Japan, Canada, and Australia in the short run,” a second official said. “The long-run strategy is to enter new and untapped markets in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe and East Asia.” An ET analysis showed some products such as gems and jewellery, and organic chemicals have a less than 10% tariff gap between the US and the next largest export destination while being at 15% for some others. These goods make up about a third of India’s exports to the US and offer scope for diversification.Although mineral fuels are a major export item to the US, the country accounts for 6.3% of India's exports in this sector compared with 19.7% for the Netherlands, the top market. The UAE is the second-largest market for Indian plastics, iron and steel articles, and textile made-ups, among others while pharmaceutical and apparel exports can be diversified to the UK.

However, as they reconvene in Washington this fall following an August break, they must either collaborate with Democrats or find alternative strategies to avert a looming government shutdown.\n\nThe spending debate will dominate September’s agenda, with Senate Republicans potentially amending rules to counter Democratic delays on nominations. Additionally, the Senate is contemplating legislation imposing hefty tariffs on some of Russia’s trade partners as a strategic move against Russian President Vladimir Putin concerning Ukraine.\n\nIn the House, Republican members persist with their investigations into former President Joe Biden, while Speaker Mike Johnson deals with internal disagreements regarding the Trump administration’s potential release of more files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n\nA look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:\n\nKeeping the Government Open\n\nThe immediate priority for Congress is averting a government shutdown on September 30, when federal funding is set to expire. There is still uncertainty about whether Republicans and Democrats can reach an agreement on how to prevent this scenario.\n\nA temporary spending plan must be passed to maintain government operations for a short duration as they finalize the complete financial package. Republicans will require Democratic support to approve such an extension, and Democrats will be seeking notable compromises. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s previous cooperation with Republicans to prevent a shutdown in March faced significant criticism within his own party.\n\nThe Trump administration’s initiatives to retract previously sanctioned funds may further complicate discussions. Earlier this summer, Republicans passed a bill retracting approximately $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds. On Friday, Trump once more notified Congress of his intention to block $4.9 billion in foreign aid that had been congressionally approved.\n\nDemocrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.\n\nSenate Nominations Fight\n\nSenators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump’s nominees.\n\nExasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration’s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!”\n\nRepublicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.\n\nRussian Sanctions\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won’t move without him.\n\nGraham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.\n\n“If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.\n\nOversight of the CDC\n\nHealth and Human Service Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.\n\nKennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez’s lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”\n\nLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.\n\nDivisions over Epstein\n\nThe House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump’s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.\n\nDemocrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.\n\nInvestigating Biden\n\nThe House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden’s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president’s inner circle.\n\nThe Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.\n\nOversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.\n\nStock Trading Ban\n\nCongress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.\n\nThat push is now gaining momentum.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy DOMINIQUE HINES \n Published:00:55 BST, 1 September 2025 |Updated:00:58 BST, 1 September 2025 \n\nOrlando Bloom has joined a rush of Britons embracing their Irish roots to bag a passport to get around Europe post-Brexit.\nThe actor, 48, revealed: ‘I’m getting my Irish passport. [My grandfather] was actually from Northern Ireland.’\nIrish broadcaster Ryan Tubridy replied: ‘And there’s a lot of people from the UK who, after a certain political move, found themselves looking for a granny down the back of the couch.’\nThe Pirates Of The Caribbean star laughed, adding on the Virgin Radio show: ‘Part of it was actually just for work, like, when I was working in Prague for a while, [there was] a whole bunch of new paperwork.\n‘And also, I love the fact that I’ve got Irish heritage. That’s all it is.’ \nOrlando plays a retired Irish boxer trying to rediscover his form in psychological thriller The Cut, which is released this week.\n\nOrlando Bloom has revealed he is embracing his Irish roots and has signed up to get his EU passport following split from Katy Perry (pictured in his latest film The Cut) \n\nOrlando with his mum Sonia at a Dublin restaurant that shares their family name. His grandfather was from Northern Ireland\nAnd it isn't the first time the star has harked back to his Irish roots after her surprised revellers by belting out a folk tune on a St Patrick's Day back in 2023. \nOrlando left onlookers open-mouthed as he took to the stage at The Alma pub in Windsor.\nHe could be seen wearing a navy blue baseball cap and matching jacket as he grabbed the microphone to treat people to a sample of his raspy tones, singing a traditional Irish classic, She Moved Through the Fair.\nOrlando split from his fiancée, pop star Katy Perry, 40, in June after nine years together.\nThey have a daughter, Daisy, four, with friends saying they remain on cordial terms.\nLast month Orlando revealed the grim reality of his drastic weight loss - including the only two foods he was allowed to eat and some grisly side effects.\nThe actor appeared on This Morning to talk to Rylan Clark, 36, and Josie Gibson, 40, about his upcoming role in psychological thriller movie The Cut, which focuses on how boxers cut to drop weight categories. \nRylan pointed out: 'Your physical transformation was absolutely insane, what you had to do.

I had a great nutritionist. \n'I was recommended by one of my agents who worked with Christian Bale on some stuff, so he was checking my bloods and stuff. \n'He basically tiered me down from a three meals a day to two, to one.\n'Suddenly all these foods were being taken away from me and my protein powder was the last one. I was like \"No! Don't take that one.\" \n'Then basically I came down to [eating] just tuna and cucumber for the last three weeks. \n'We shot the film in reverse chronological order because of the weight. I had no energy or brain power. \n'Mentally, physically, I was hangry. I was a horrible person to be around.' \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOrlando Bloom reveals he is embracing his Irish roots as he signs up to get his EU passport following split from Katy Perry\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Labor Day weekend is one of the busiest times of year for the otherwise sleepy enclave.\"You're all here in the Hamptons enjoying $200 caviar as though your money isn't funding an actual fascist regime!\" one protester bellowed into a crowd of diners, according to a video posted on X by Planet over Profit, a climate advocacy group.The action was part of the larger nationwide \"Workers Over Billionaires\" campaign, a series of Labor Day weekend demonstrations taking place from San Francisco to Chicago to New York. A group of protesters also targeted the Hamptons home of billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman on Saturday.\"The Hamptons protest is meant to be both symbolic and strategic as it directly confronts the billionaires who summer in East Hampton while making visible the hidden flow of money fueling Cuomo, Adams, and Trump,\" Planet Over Profit said in a press release, referring to Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor now running for mayor, Eric Adams, the current New York mayor, and President Donald Trump. \"At the same time, it forecasts a longer-term campaign to cut billionaires down to size and redirect resources to workers, families, and communities.\"The Hamptons have long been home to some of the country's elite. The amount some Hamptons residents are paying to get a taste of a viral smoothie is just one small indication of the difference in lifestyle between the very wealthy and everyone else. And while most of the country frets over the economy, multimillion-dollar home sales in the Hamptons are booming.The famous Meadow Lane in Southampton, dubbed \"Billionaire Lane,\" is the summer home of Ken Griffin, the billionaire CEO of the investment firm Citadel, fashion designer Calvin Klein, and hedge-fund founder Daniel Och.As part of the nationwide campaign, organizers also established what they are calling the Department of Class Solidarity, a \"national war room\" that tracks the names, ages, and industries of billionaires in the United States. It also aims to show how billionaires' wealth impacts poverty.The Department of Class Solidarity is aligned with other nationwide protest movements, including the Tesla Takedown Protests, Purge Palantir, which objects to what organizers say is Palantir's contribution to mass surveillance, and Stop Billionaires Summer, a protest movement in the Bay Area.","summary":"Protesters disrupted the Labor Day weekend in the Hamptons as part of a nationwide action called \"Workers Over Billionaires.\"","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/workers-over-billionaires-protest-labor-day-hamptons-2025-8","image":"https://i.insider.com/68b4c500cfc04e97619c5b4c?width=711&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 23:55:15","author":"Lakshmi Varanasi","authors":["Lakshmi Varanasi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.208},{"id":356205866,"title":"Xi and Modi Discuss Strengthening Friendship Amid Global Turmoil While Trump’s Tariffs Take Effect","text":"The much-anticipated meeting between Xi and Modi took place on Sunday, alongside a regional summit in the eastern port city of Tianjin.

And, the very public engagement could be good for American culture. Marriage and fertility rates have descended to all-time lows in recent years. An analysis from Morgan Stanley projects that by 2030, 45% of American women aged 25 to 44 will be single and without children. Users of popular dating apps — Tinder, Bumble, Hinge and the like — report fatigue from the superficial interactions in which endless options make meaningful selection difficult. Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, thinks the Swift-Kelce engagement could have a major influence on the American public. Swift has sent “a powerful signal that marriage is something that one should consider.” If more Americans are influenced, even a bit, to get married and have babies, then “baby, just say, yes.”\n\n(Adapted from “Speak Now, Or Forever Hold Your Peace (Taylor’s Version),” by Faith Bottum, published on August 28, 2025, by the Wall Street Journal)\n\nSolid US consumer spending\n\nUS consumer spending increased solidly in July while underlying inflation picked up as tariffs on imports raised prices of some goods, but that data will probably not prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates next month against the backdrop of softening labour market conditions. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose 0.5pc last month after an upwardly revised 0.4pc gain in June, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday. Consumption is being supported by low layoffs that are underpinning solid wage growth. But President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imports are raising costs for businesses, adding another layer of caution that has resulted in employers being reluctant to increase headcount. Employment gains have averaged 35,000 jobs per month over the last three months through July, compared to 123,000 during the same period in 2024, the government reported this month.\n\n(Adapted from “US Reports Solid July Consumer Spending; Core Inflation Firmer,” published on August 29, 2025, by Reuters)\n\nAI-powered hackers\n\nJaxon, a malware developer, lives in Velora, a virtual world where nothing is off-limits. He wants to make malicious software to steal passwords from Google Chrome, an internet browser. That is the basis of a story told to ChatGPT by Vitaly Simonovich, who researches AI threats at Cato Networks, a cybersecurity firm. Eager to play along, ChatGPT spat out some imperfect code, which it then helped debug. Within six hours, Mr Simonovich had skirted the safeguards built into ChatGPT and used it to create functioning malware. Artificial intelligence has “broadened the reach” of hackers, according to a cybersecurity expert. Generating deepfakes, fraudulent emails, and social-engineering assaults is now far easier and cheaper. AI could enable fraud to the tune of $40bn by 2027, up from $12bn in 2023, reckons a consultancy. \n\n(Adapted from “How AI-Powered Hackers Are Stealing Billions,” published on August 19, 2025, by The Economist)\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 1st, 2025","summary":"India’s fantasy games \n\n\n\nHow quickly can you get rich in India?

The bloc has showcased itself at Tianjin as a ‘pillar of multipolarity’ rooted in the ‘Shanghai Spirit’ characterised by “mutual trust, equality, benefit and respect for diversity”.\n\nThe timing of the summit is crucial as the world is torn by recent wars, rising US-led trade protectionism and climate emergencies. The meeting is expected to push deeper economic and security cooperation among member states and signal the emergence of an alternative to a global order dominated by the US-led west. The gathering’s significance is underscored by its scale, as leaders from more than 20 countries and 10 international organisations are in Tianjin to attend the largest SCO summit in the alliance’s history.\n\nAmong the headline participants is Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, who has made his first trip abroad since talks with Donald Trump in Alaska earlier last month. Equally significant is the participation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has returned to China after a seven-year hiatus amid US pressure over oil purchases from Russia and Washington’s new tariffs of 50 per cent on its goods — dubbed as “sanctions” on New Delhi. Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian, who would seek Tehran’s quest to further integrate itself into the alliance after its recent twelve-day war with Israel, is also present. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is another prominent participant, with the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres and the Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also attending.\n\nBorn in 2001 as a six-member security bloc, the SCO now spans 26 countries — 10 full members, two observers and 14 dialogue partners — across Asia, Europe and Africa, representing 40pc of the world’s population and more than a third of global GDP. Together, India, China and Russia account for nearly $54 trillion in output, almost a third of global GDP, and exports worth $5.1tr, about one-fifth of international trade.\n\nThis year’s agenda of the SCO conference ranges from climate resilience and biodiversity protection to digital connectivity, trade facilitation and counterterrorism cooperation. Chinese officials have framed the SCO as a counterweight to what they call “hegemonism and power politics”.\n\n ‘In today’s world, outdated mindsets of hegemonism and power politics still have influence, seriously threatening world peace and stability’\n\nAt a media briefing a few days before the start of the summit, China’s assistant foreign minister, Liu Bin had, in a veiled reference to Washington, argued that solidarity and cooperation are the antidote to instability, warning that unilateralism threatens global peace. “In today’s world, outdated mindsets of hegemonism and power politics still have influence, with certain countries attempting to prioritise their own interests above others, seriously threatening world peace and stability,” he said.\n\nSCO members support an open, transparent and inclusive multilateral system with the WTO at its core. They stress the need to strengthen stable and diversified supply chains at a moment when unilateralism and protectionism loom large. As Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar during his visit here last month, “The bloc must resist unilateralism and uphold multilateralism to remain credible.”\n\nIn fact, this kind of mindset prevalent in the western capitals is bringing SCO countries closer. For example, the fraught bilateral ties between Beijing and New Delhi — badly damaged by the deadly 2020 border clashes between the two sides — show tentative signs of thaw. The recent decisions, like India’s resumption of tourist visas for Chinese people alongside discussions on restoring direct flights, may seem like modest steps, but they carry a lot of symbolic weight. Trump’s tariff war has nudged New Delhi closer to China, lending a new layer of significance to India’s noticeable presence in Tianjin.\n\nThe summit also highlights China’s closest regional partnerships. Pakistan remains pivotal, with both sides reaffirming plans to upgrade the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor into a “growth, livelihood, green and open corridor”. At their sixth Strategic Dialogue last month, the two countries had pledged to expand cooperation in industry, agriculture, mining and connectivity from Gwadar Port to the realignment of the Karakoram Highway as they tighten counterterrorism coordination and continue discussions on Afghanistan’s fragile stability.\n\nThe SCO summit will likely adopt today a 10-year development strategy spanning security, trade, infrastructure and cultural exchange — clear evidence of its transformation from a security club into a multidimensional platform for governance and multipolar cooperation. Proposals under discussion include an SCO Development Bank, local currency settlement systems and enhanced energy cooperation, all designed to reduce dependence on Western-dominated financial and energy structures.\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, September 1st, 2025","summary":"The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) heads of state summit underway in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin (Aug 31–Sept 1) showcases the group’s ambition to anchor what analysts describe as an ‘alternative model’ of multilateral cooperation within the rules-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) framework at a time of heightened global economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

This measure was introduced under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\nBut the move could be devastating to the ailing tourism sector, which is already feeling the pressure of President Donald Trump’s policies.\n\nDue to Trump’s tense relationships with several world leaders and his tariff policies, some tourists, especially from Canada, have pledged to avoid vacationing in the United States. \n\nOverseas travel to the US fell 3.1 percent year-on-year in July to 19.2 million visitors, according to government data. \n\nIt was the fifth month of decline this year, defying expectations that 2025 would see annual inbound visitors finally surpass the pre-pandemic level of 79.4 million. \n\n‘Any friction we add to the traveler experience is going to cut travel volumes by some amount,’ said Gabe Rizzi, President of global travel management company Altour.\n\n‘As the summer ends this will become a more pressing issue, and we’ll have to factor the fees into travel budgets and documentation.’\n\nThe newest visa fee is likely to hit hardest in Central and South American countries that have been a rare bright spot for U.S. travel this year.\n\nAs of May, travel from Mexico to the U.S. was up nearly 14% in 2025, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nArrivals from Argentina rose 20% and from Brazil 4.6% year-to-date. Overall, travel from Central America grew 3% and from South America 0.7%, compared with a decline of 2.3% from Western Europe.\n\nInternational visitor spending in the US is projected to fall below $169 billion this year, down from $181 billion in 2024, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.\n\nThe visa fee reinforces a bleak perception of the US under Trump, whose immigration policies, cuts to foreign aid and sweeping tariffs have eroded America’s appeal as a destination – even with major events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Los Angeles 2028 Olympics on the horizon.\n\nThe Trump administration on Wednesday proposed government regulation that aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media.\n\nAnd just two months ago, Trump imposed a travel ban restricting the arrival of tourists from 12 primarily African and Middle Eastern countries. \n\nThe ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. \n\nIt also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don’t hold a valid visa. \n\nThe impacted countries had ‘deficient’ screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens, Trump said.\n\nHe relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the US after their visas expired.\n\nTrump also tied that ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump administration is introducing a new $250 &#8216;visa integrity fee&#8217; for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New $250 &#8216;Visa Integrity Fee&#8217; to Impact Millions first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/new-250-visa-integrity-fee-to-impact-millions/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/New-250-visa-integrity-fee-to-be-imposed-on-millions.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-31 23:37:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0},{"id":356200898,"title":"Chicago Immigration Update: Prayer Gathering Held at Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago Before Donald Trump’s Immigration Measures Take Effect","text":"NORTH CHICAGO, Ill.

This site is expected to host federal agents soon for significant immigration enforcement efforts, possibly starting next week. Young children were among the group undertaking this endeavor.\n\n“These detentions, these operatives, these raids have an impact on human beings,” said United Giving Hope Pastor Julie Contreras.\n\nAlthough ABC News has reported that these operations could commence as soon as Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem refrained from revealing specifics during her appearance on Face the Nation.\n\n“I can’t share the details because there are law enforcement and investigators deployed there, and ensuring their security is our top priority,” stated Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nWhile on the same show, Pritzker spoke about a potential National Guard deployment to accompany federal immigration officials.\n\n“If this happens, they’ll find themselves in court swiftly because it’s unlawful. Posse Comitatus prohibits U.S. troops from being deployed in U.S. cities for crime fighting or law enforcement tasks. That’s not their duty,” said Pritzker.\n\nMeanwhile, at Naval Station Great Lakes, Contreras led her group in prayer, even including those managing the base in her petitions. She acknowledged the difficulty in encouraging many regular attendees to come on Sunday due to prevailing fears.\n\n“This morning, a mother shared that others advised her against coming, warning that she would be seen and targeted. Can we assure her of safety tomorrow? Unfortunately, we cannot,” Contreras explained.\n\nMeanwhile, over in the west suburbs, an immigrant rights group held a protest outside the ICE staging facility in Broadview on Sunday.\n\nThe group wants the facility shut down. They say people are being held there for days at a time, and do not have access to beds or showers.\n\nAfter a protest at the facility last month, an ICE spokesperson told ABC7, “Any accusations that detainees are treated inhumanely in any way are categorically false.”\n\nAnd while Pritzker said the Trump administration has not communicated their plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago, North Chicago’s mayor told ABC7 on Friday that he has been led to believe that some 300 federal immigration agents will be making the city and the surrounding area their home as the administration’s plans unfold.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNORTH CHICAGO, Ill.

Conspiracy theorists pointed to the fact that Trump hadn’t been seen publicly since his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday and had a clear weekend schedule.\n\nOthers also cited Vice President JD Vance’s Thursday interview with USA Today, in which he said he’s ready to assume the presidency if a “terrible tragedy” occurred. In that same interview, Vance also noted Trump is in “incredibly good health.”\n\nQuestions about the president’s health were among the top Google searches at noon on Saturday, while “Where is Donald Trump” was trending on X, Forbes reports. However, Trump was spotted again on Saturday en route to his Virginia golf course.\n\nIn the same Truth Social post, Trump also declared Washington, D.C. a “crime free zone.” Trump deployed the National Guard to the nation’s capital this month, claiming he did so in response to a “crime emergency.” Violent crime has been declining in D.C. since 2023.\n\nTrump has been especially active on Truth Social this weekend, sharing dozens of posts since Saturday, including more declarations that D.C. is now safe and a call to end mail-in voting. He also shared a bizarre rant lashing out at a White House Rose Garden worker for damaging a piece of stone, sharing surveillance footage of the incident.\n\nQuestions about Trump’s health mounted earlier this year as photos of his swollen ankles and bruised hands circulated online.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt disclosed in July that Trump, 79, had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency. The condition is fairly common in older people, and occurs when veins in the legs struggle to carry blood to the heart.\n\nLeavitt added that there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. A blood count test and echocardiogram also came back normal, she said.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.
