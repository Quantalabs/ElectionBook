The official added that federal ethics officials certified the purchases as in compliance with applicable laws.\n\nCritics have alleged that Trump, a billionaire businessman and TV personality before becoming president, has continued highly lucrative activities while holding office.\n\nUnder federal ethics laws, presidents are not required to divest assets that might pose a conflict of interest, but most have done so anyway since the late 1970s, moving their assets into blind trusts managed by independent monitors.\n\nTrump is the first president not to have done so since 1978, and his business empire is held in a trust managed by his two sons.\n\nThe Republican’s net worth has more than doubled since the final year of his first term, and since retaking office, the president has continued to promote his business interests, including by visiting a new Trump golf course in Scotland and hosting top investors in his cryptocurrency business for a tour of the White House in May. \n\nOn average, the president has visited one of his properties roughly once every other day since taking office, and has promoted his businesses at least 60 times, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Ethics in Washington. \n\nThe president’s sons, meanwhile, have pursued lucrative deals in the crypto world alongside Zach Witkoff, son of U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. \n\nA fund linked to the United Arab Emirates government, a U.S. ally, used $2 billion in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency to invest in a crypto exchange.\n\nThe Trump sons have also inked multiple business deals in the Middle East since their father took office, including a Trump branded golf course in Qatar partially backed by the country’s sovereign wealth fund.","summary":"Presidents aren’t required to divest potentially conflicted assets, but most except for Trump have anyway","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-bonds-millions-meta-tmobile-ethics-concerns-b2811354.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/16/13/TrumpZuck.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jfiRkxjF-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-21 01:04:13","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":352728776,"title":"Nip/Tuck star Dylan Walsh and his family involved in mysterious car crash that sends two to hospital","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Aug 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Connolly to walk FREE: Tory councillor's wife who was jailed last year for 'racist' Tweet during the Southport riots is being released from prison in a matter of hours\n\nBritain's most targeted shop: Robbed, set on fire, ripped off and forced to tackle thieves herself.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy BRIAN MARKS, US SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:36 BST, 21 August 2025 |Updated:01:42 BST, 21 August 2025 \n\nThe actor Dylan Walsh was involved in a major car crash over the weekend that left passengers injured.\nThe 61-year-old Nip/Tuck star — whose costar Julian McMahon died last month from cancer — was in an SUV with four other people on Sunday, August 17, when it collided with a utility pole in Rumson, New Jersey, according to TMZ.\nAccording to the Rumson Borough Police Department, the crash was serious enough that two people in the vehicle were taken to then nearby Riverview Medical Center for treatment after they complained of pain at the scene.\nIt’s unclear who was driving the vehicle — a 2022 Ford Explorer — and it’s also unknown who required medical attention after the crash, which caused significant damage to the SUV.\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Walsh’s representative for comment but hasn’t yet received a response. \nIn a statement to TMZ, the actor’s representative said: ‘Over the weekend, Dylan Walsh and his family were involved in a car accident in Rumson. Thankfully, everyone is safe and has since returned home.\n\nThe Nip/Tuck star Dylan Walsh, 61, was involved with a mysterious single-vehicle car crash that sent two people to the hospital over the weekend, TMZ reported on Wednesday; pictured in NYC in July 2024\n\nWalsh is best known for starring on FX's medical drama Nip/Tuck with Julian McMahon (L), who died in July after a battle with cancer; pictured in a still from Nip/Tuck\n‘The family is deeply grateful for the swift response of the Rumson Police, Fire Department, and EMS, as well as the staff at Riverview Medical Center for their care,’ they continued. \n‘They would also like to extend a special thank-you to the management and staff of The River Point Inn for their support in the immediate aftermath.’\nRumson is a tony community known for supporting commuters working in New York City. \n\n EXCLUSIVE: Dylan Walsh says he is 'very proud' of chef son Thomas after he heroically saved drowning driver from car plunged into Baltimore harbor \nThe Rumson Patch previously reported on the crash, but Walsh's connection to it wasn't detailed. \nRumson Police Lt. Christopher Isherwood told the outlet that the SUV was traveling in the northbound lane of a local street before it veered without explanation into the opposing lane.\nThe Explorer then crashed into a utility pole, but it kept driving before it hit and damaged a second pole. \nPolice were called to the scene around 5 p.m. on Sunday, but the intersection by the crash was kept closed until 7 a.m. on Tuesday morning to allow crews to replace the damaged utility poles. \nThe crash reportedly knocked out power for eight neighboring residents, though their power was restored later on Sunday evening. \n\nAccording to police, Walsh was in a 2022 Ford Explorer with four other people when it veered into the opposing lane and crashed into a utility pole, before hitting a second pole; pictured with wife Leslie Bourque, son Hudson and daughter Amelie in 2014 in NYC\n\nWalsh’s SUV veered into the opposing lane without explanation and hit two utility poles before coming to a stop. Two people were taken to a hospital after complaining of pain, but it’s not clear who was injured or who was driving; still from Nip/Tuck\n\nThe crash reportedly knocked out power for eight residents for a few hours. The nearby intersection was closed from Sunday evening until Tuesday morning as crew replaced the utility poles; Walsh is pictured on Superman And Lois in 2022\n\nWalsh shares two children — daughter Amelie Bell, 13, and son Hudson Scott — with his third wife, Leslie Bourque (pictured in 2015 in NYC). They tied the knot in June 2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana, but have been together since at least 2010\nPhotos of the crash show that the SUV had ridden up onto the sidewalk and was stopped in front of a large wooden pole. \nThe front of the vehicle was significantly damaged, and debris from the crash was littered around it, along with a metal street sign. \nAccording to the local news outlet Towns Of: Monmouth County, NJ, Walsh’s wife Leslie Bourque wrote about the crash in a since-deleted Facebook post.\n\nBREAKING NEWS Julian McMahon dead at 56: Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four star passes away after private health battle \n‘It was our family who was involved in the car accident on River Road yesterday afternoon. We just want to thank everyone who took care of us in this scary time,’ Bourque reportedly wrote. ‘1st of all to the managers/staff at River Point Inn who immediately ran out to make sure we were ok and comfort our kids (literally one lady wrapped her arms around all of us letting us know it would be ok) — bringing ice bags and the fancy Evian water bottle.’\nShe continued, thank the ‘first responders who came faster than one would think,’ as well as the ‘EMT who put up with my corny jokes in the ambulance. And the ER staff at Riverview Medical.’\nWalsh's wife included an update on how her family members were doing after the crash.\n‘We are a bit bruised from seatbelts, but grateful for them and air bags which saved our lives,’ she concluded. ‘We apologize for anyone who lost power or inconvenience.’\nWalsh shares two children — daughter Amelie Bell, 13, and son Hudson Scott — with Bourque, who is his third wife. The couple tied the knot in June 2022 in New Orleans, Louisiana, but they have been together since at least 2010. \nHe was previously married to Boogie Nights actress Melora Walters — with whom he shares two adult children, Thomas and Joanna — from 1996 to 2003, and he later married the actress Joanna Going, with whom he welcomed his daughter Stella in 2003. Walsh filed to divorce Going in 2010. \nWalsh's son Thomas, who is a chef, made headlines in March 2023 after he saved a drowning driver after his car drove into Baltimore Harbor.\nThomas was left with a bloodied, injured hand after he jumped into the harbor and punched a car window until it broke, allowing him to pull the driver — who was reportedly experiencing a mental health crisis — to safety and swim to shore.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNip/Tuck star Dylan Walsh and his family involved in mysterious car crash that sends two to hospital\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

During the arrest, bystanders asked the agents for a warrant signed by a judge; they apparently did not provide one. \n\nThe men making the arrest wore labels on their vests that referred to federal agencies. One was marked “ERO,” which is the acronym for Enforcement and Removal Operations, an arm of ICE. Other vests said “ATF,” the acronym for another federal law enforcement agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \n\nICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the arrest. \n\nIn a statement, State Senator Catherine Blakespear said the men making the arrest “appear to be federal police working for ICE” but they did not show identification, and they gave no reason for the arrest. The man had just pulled over to drop his daughter at school, Blakespear said, when agents “abruptly separated him from his child and family.”\n\n“This is inhumane, barbaric, and lawless. We should all be outraged,” Blakespear said. She referred to the current state of the country as a “police state… where any person can be apprehended on the street without probable cause for arrest.”\n\nAndrée Grey, the superintendent of the Encinitas Union School District, said in a statement that the arrest, which was witnessed by parents, students, and school staff, had caused an atmosphere of “fear and trauma.” Grey said the district’s policy is to not share any information with authorities unless through a court order or judicial subpoena. \n\nIn a statement posted to social media, the Parents of Encinitas Union School District said the man’s daughter “has suffered a life-altering loss” and is “a victim of policy.” The group posted a gofundme link to help the family. \n\nIf the arrest is immigration-related, it marks a pattern of at least three incidents outside schools in San Diego County in the last two weeks. \n\nOn August 6, ICE arrested a woman while she was dropping off her child at Camarena Elementary in Chula Vista, and on August 14, ICE made a similar arrest of a father outside Linda Vista Elementary. \n\nAfter the Linda Vista raid, ICE responded to the Times of San Diego and said that any rumors that ICE agents were targeting the school were “smears.” School superintendents argue that even if the arrests happen just outside school grounds, instead of on school property, their proximity still deeply affects the community.\n\nOn his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order allowing ICE to make arrests in schools, churches and hospitals, areas that had previously been off-limits to protect essential services and prevent disruptions for children. \n\nIn a statement responding to the arrest at Park Dale Lane Elementary posted on social media, U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, D-Carlsbad, said that raids at schools like this one are “wrong and unacceptable,” and that he had personally asked the Department of Homeland Security to cease this practice. “No child should face that fear, particularly not when being dropped off at school,” he said. \n\nWhen a parent is deported, a family may face a choice of whether a child will stay with a qualified family member in the U.S., move to a foreign country or enter the child welfare system. \n\nIn the video outside Park Dale Lane Elementary, as the agents are putting the arrested man in the back of their car, a bystander yells at the officers to let the man have a moment to say goodbye to his family. The agents place him inside their black SUV without ceremony. \n\nLillian Perlmutter covers immigration for Times of San Diego and NEWSWELL.","summary":"Educators and elected officials blasted ICE for what they said was the third arrest this month of a parent outside a San Diego-area elementary school. ","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/08/20/encinitas-elementary-school-ice-arrest/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1678.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 00:30:00","author":"Lillian Perlmutter • Times of San Diego","authors":["Lillian Perlmutter • Times of San Diego"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":352725356,"title":"Putin's Delegation Paid $250,000 In Cash To Refuel Jets In Alaska Amid Us Sanctions, Says Rubio N18G","text":"Last Updated:August 21, 2025, 05:52 IST Videos\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio revealed that Russian President Vladimir Putin had to pay nearly $250,000 to refuel three jets while returning from the United States.When Putin arrived in Alaska, August 15, 2025, for a high-stakes meeting with US President Donald Trump concerning the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, he was welcomed with a red carpet reception.Despite the cordial welcome, the Russian delegation was required to pay in cash for refueling.

The woman, identified as Nathalie Rose Jones, now faces serious federal charges, the Department of Justice revealed in a press statement.\nAuthorities say Jones was apprehended while attending a protest event in the nation’s capital. According to court filings, she had already drawn the attention of the US Secret Service due to a series of disturbing online posts targeting Trump.\nOne of her most alarming messages, dated August 6, was posted to Facebook. In it, she allegedly wrote, “Literally told FBI in five states today that I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea.” Other posts made on Instagram reportedly called for Trump’s removal from office, labelled him a “terrorist,” and described his presidency as a “dictatorship.”\nJones voluntarily spoke with Secret Service agents. During the interview, she allegedly referred to Trump as a “terrorist” and “Nazi,” and stated that if given the chance, she would kill him “at the compound.” She also claimed to possess a “bladed object” to “carry out her mission of killing” Trump, which she said was to “avenge all the lives lost during the Covid-19 pandemic.”\nAs a result of these threats, the US District Court has charged Jones with multiple offences. These include threatening to take the life of, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States, as well as transmitting threats to kidnap or injure another person.\nIn a press release, the Department of Justice confirmed the ongoing investigation, led by the US Secret Service. Authorities also stated that Jones admitted to being the owner of the Facebook account from which the threatening posts originated.\nUS Attorney Jeanine Pirro commented on the case, emphasising its severity, “Threatening the life of the President is one of the most serious crimes and one that will be met with swift and unwavering prosecution. Make no mistake—justice will be served.”\nIf convicted, Jones could face significant prison time under federal law.","summary":"As a result of these threats, the US District Court has charged Jones with multiple offences.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/secret-service-arrests-indiana-woman-who-posted-death-threats-against-trump-ws-l-9518090.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-6-2025-08-791848d84747bfd4483729dc1add9d16.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 00:17:25","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.507},{"id":352728774,"title":"Britain's most targeted shop: Robbed, set on fire, ripped off and forced to tackle thieves herself.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR, SENIOR REPORTER\n Published:00:49 BST, 21 August 2025 |Updated:01:16 BST, 21 August 2025 \n\nPreyed upon by fraudsters, rocked by Hollywood-style heists and nearly blown up by a petrol bomb - this is the luxury handbag store fighting for survival in Cheshire's Golden Triangle.\nChristine Colbert, 58, has suffered a series of 'catastrophic' setbacks which have routinely threatened to destroy Dress Cheshire, the beloved boutique she set up in the celebrity enclave of Prestbury back in November 2018.\nIn the last five years, she has fallen victim to the notorious 'Kardashian of Cheshire' handbag fraudster, lost £430,000 worth of stock in two separate heists and suffered £10,000 in damage when the building next door was blown up by arsonists.\nOn one occasion, she even had to take matters into her own hands by wrestling a shoplifter to the ground after they stuffed one of her Louis Vuitton handbags in an Aldi bag before brazenly walking out the front door. \nSpeaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, Ms Colbert said: 'I have felt like a target, a massive target. It's made me very anxious and more nervous... I've had some very, very dark days.'\nShe added: 'As a business, we've been rocked absolutely to the core through all of these unfortunate events. We're not sitting there feeling sorry for ourselves, but it's just been catastrophic. You couldn't write it.'\nDress Cheshire suffered its first major burglary in March 2024 when four men scaled the back of the building, ripped out a window and drained the company of £180,000 worth of handbags in a terrifying heist.\nIn the same month, she turned 'Miss Marple' to help bring down Jack Watkin, the self-proclaimed 'rich kid of Instagram' who conned victims including Ms Colbert out of thousands of pounds in an elaborate designer handbag scam.\n\nPreyed upon by fraudsters, rocked by Hollywood-style heists and nearly blown up by a petrol bomb - this is the luxury handbag store fighting for survival in Cheshire's Golden Triangle. Pictured: owner Christine Colbert outside Dress Cheshire, in Prestbury\n\nIn the last five years, Ms Colbert has fallen victim to misfortune, including suffering £10,000 in damage when the building next door was blown up by arsonists\n\nThe shop also lost £430,000 worth of stock in two separate heists. Pictured: a CCTV grab shows footage from the heist in June\nWatkin, who befriended Ms Colbert in September 2020 and became a regular visitor to her shop, defrauded her out of £44,000. \nThe scammer, who described himself as the 'Kardashian of Cheshire', persuaded people to invest huge sums - which he claimed was to buy and sell luxury handbags - but stole the money to fund his millionaire lifestyle.\n\nLuxury handbag seller's five years of hell \n\n2020: Christine Colbert is befriended by Jack Watkin, a man who would go on to defraud her and others out of tens of thousands of pounds.\nMarch 2024: Dress Cheshire suffers its first major burglary as four men scale the back of the building and take £180,000 worth of handbags and stock.\nMarch 2024: Ms Colbert turns 'Miss Marple' to help bring down Watkin, luring him into a trap before police arrest him.\nAugust 2024: The building next door to Dress Cheshire is blown up in an arson attack, leading to £10,000 in damage to the shop.\nJune 2025: Dress Cheshire suffers a second major burglary. This time £250,000 worth of handbags are stolen after thieves tunnelled their way in.\nThroughout all this time, Ms Colbert has had to fend off petty thieves and credit card scammers who have tried to bleed her accounts dry. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, in August 2024, five months after the first major burglary, the building next door to Dress Cheshire was blown up in an arson attack, which left the shop moments away from being destroyed in a gas explosion.\nRecalling the terrifying moment to the Mail, she said: 'Somebody petrol bombed next door and nearly blew us up. At like midnight, the police were banging on my door and I looked out the bedroom window and it was police blues and twos.\n'I was thinking \"what now?\" because it had only been within weeks of the first burglary, and I answered the door in my dressing gown. And she said, \"it's Dress Cheshire\".\n'And I said, \"Don't tell me we're being burgled again.\" She said it wasn't us directly but the shop might catch fire if we don't get the gas turned off.'\nUnfortunately, this was just the latest in a string of 'traumatic' incidents for Ms Colbert.\nOn June 8 this year, she was forced to watch a group of brazen thieves steal £250,000 worth of luxury handbags after tunnelling through her shop.\nThree intruders circumvented Dress Cheshire's sophisticated security set-up by identifying the 3ft-wide chimney stack as a weakness. \nHaving smashed their way through, one used a duvet cover as a giant pouch to steal the highly sought-after pre-owned bags from brands including Chanel, Gucci, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.\nLive CCTV footage showed the skilled thieves ransacking the shop, where bags valued at as much as £30,000 were snatched.\nThe second heist coincided with the start of Watkin's trial in June. Ms Colbert said: 'I knew June was going to be a horrendous month. I didn't anticipate the heist, who could. \n\nDress Cheshire was left with £10,000 of damage in August 2024 when the building next door was set ablaze in an arson attack\n\nOn June 8 this year, Ms Colbert was forced to watch a group of brazen thieves steal £250,000 worth of luxury handbags after tunnelling through her shop\n\nThe gang carried out the heist by tunnelling their way into Ms Colbert's shop from next door\n\nOn June 8, three intruders circumvented Dress Cheshire's sophisticated security set-up by identifying the 3ft-wide chimney stack as a weakness \n\nIt was the second time Ms Colbert fell victim to a robbery in just over a year after thieves broke in through a window and stole bags worth £180,000 in March 2024\n\nChristine Colbert with one of the Hermes handbags she sells from her designer boutique\n\nBREAKING NEWS Fake millionaire who bragged family were like the British Kardashians admits £200k fraud \n'Because of the arson next door, that led to the heist because that building has been unoccupied since then and boarded up. So they took advantage of that situation and were going in and out.'\nWhen asked if she feels like the unluckiest business owner in Britain, she said: 'Well, yes and no. My cup's always half full... but I feel like I've definitely had my share of bad luck and it has been horrible.\n'Throughout all of the frauds and the robberies, nobody really knew that I was dealing with Jack.' \nShe added: 'Don't get me wrong, I think any one of those things could topple someone completely, and just have them thinking, I don't need this. But then also they're not going to knock me over. Absolutely no chance.\n'Why would I allow these horrible individuals of all different categories [to] try and topple me? But don't get me wrong, I have felt like a massive target.\n'We're a small business, we're not a big multi-million pound business. I've lost my own personal money here and people don't see that.\n'I'm a Northern girl. I don't come from a wealthy family. I just come from Northern grit. You just pick yourself up, dust yourself down and crack on. That's what my parents told me to do and that's what I've done.'\n\nThis 'Holy Grail' Hermes Birkin was selling for £15,495 at Dress Cheshire \n\nMrs Colbert with a purse selling for £5,995 at her Dress Cheshire shop in Prestbury\nIn between the major heists and sickening fraud from a 'friend', Ms Colbert has also faced a terrifying credit scam from fraudsters posing as customers in her shop.\nExplaining how it works, she told the Mail: 'We've had people in trying to intercept our payment gateways. They literally try and keep us preoccupied whilst they make fraudulent payments in our card terminals.\n'They blatantly walk in, they say they're going to buy a £5,000 bag, and then they try and use the machine for their own gain, and so not only steal the bag, but steal my money and empty my bank account at the same time.'\nShe explained how they usually operate in pairs, with one talking to her and the other 'punching in' numbers to the card machine.\nThe cunning plot sees the payment go through as a 'customer not present' transaction, allowing them to walk out with the bag before ringing their bank to say their card has been compromised in order to get a refund. \n\nChristine Colbert fell victim to fraudster Jack Watkin, 26, who posed as a millionaire but scammed people out of thousands of pounds\n\nMs Colbert has suffered a series of setbacks including being defrauded by Jack Watkin (pictured) who described himself as Cheshire's own Kardashian\n\nWatkin posed as a millionaire on social media to persuade people - including his own father - to invest in his fake designer handbag business\n\nWatkin enjoyed the trappings of wealth and splurged cash on a lavish lifestyle\n\nBut this is a fraction of the fraud carried out by Watkin, a man who Ms Colbert thought was a friend before he rinsed her bank account. \nThe 26-year-old former public schoolboy promised his victims - including Ms Colbert - a share of the profits if they loaned him cash to buy and sell expensive Hermes bags.\nBut neither the handbags or any profit ever materialised and instead Watkin used the cash to fund his extravagant lifestyle.\nAt one stage he spent weeks living at the five-star Dorchester Hotel, in London's Mayfair, where rooms cost up to £3,000-a-night. Police said his bill topped £136,000 in just six months.\nHe also paid more than £22,000 to travel around the capital in a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce and regularly visited Harrods, where he 'scouted' for victims and spent almost £68,000.\nMs Colbert spent three years trying to get back almost £44,000 she had loaned Watkin when she decided to take matters into her own hands in March 2024.\nWith the help of Watkin's close friend, Hannah Jakes, 34, who was also defrauded of almost £100,000, she lured the fake millionaire, who was on the run from police, to a local pub with the promise of more cash.\nMs Colbert revealed how she wore a 'large hat' as a disguise and hid in someone else's car in the car park of The Merlin public house, in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, so he would not recognise her.\nBut as soon as the unsuspecting Watkin arrived Mrs Colbert swung into action and dialled 999. Minutes later detectives from Cheshire police swooped to arrest him.\nWatkin was convicted in June after Ms Colbert helped bring him down and and will be sentenced in September. \n\nChristine Colbert, owner of Dress Cheshire, who was defrauded of £43,800, and Cheshire Constabulary Detective Constable Gareth Yates at court during Watkins' trial\n\nMs Colbert carried a Hermes handbag to court with her as Watkin dramatically changed his pleas to guilty\nBut to her utter disbelief, while most of Watkin's victims have all been paid back, Ms Colbert remains more than £44,000 down.\nAs of October last year, the Government made it a law that banking institutions had to repay customers who have been a victim of fraud where the bank could have stopped it.\n'All the main banking institutions had signed up to this and as a result of Jack being actually convicted, they have repaid the victims - except the one bank that I sent money to Jack from wasn't signed up to the scheme, and they won't pay me back.\n'So I brought everything to justice, everyone gets their money back and I have had a £300 cheque of a \"thanks very much for your hard work\".' \nMs Colbert opened her business up in Prestbury in November 2018 before going online during the pandemic. \nAlong with Wilmslow and Alderley Edge, Prestbury makes up the so-called Golden Triangle of towns favoured by Cheshire celebrities and sports stars.\nEx-Manchester United star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen used to live there until they moved to a £20million home they designed nearby.\nHowever, the area has been frequently targeted by burglars including a gang who snatched more than 100 rare handbags worth over £1million when they raided a home in Alderley Edge in March.\nDaily Mail has contacted Cheshire Police for comment. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritain's most targeted shop: Robbed, set on fire, ripped off and forced to tackle thieves herself.

US antagonism","text":"India and China are slowly rebuilding ties with US President Donald Trump's tariff policies playing a role in bringing the nuclear-armed rivals closer on some issues, experts say.\n\nDirect flights between the neighbouring nations are set to resume for the first time in five years, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to meet China's President Xi Jinping later this month on Chinese soil for the first time since 2018.\n\nThe announcements were made after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Mr Modi and senior Indian defence officials this week in New Delhi.\n\nTies between the world's most populous countries plummeted in 2020 after a deadly border clash killed at least 20 Indian troops and an unknown number of Chinese soldiers in Ladakh, a disputed border area between the two countries in the Himalayas.\n\nChinese state media reported that the two sides agreed to \"explore the possibility of advancing boundary demarcation negotiations\" and vowed to reopen three border trade markets.\n\nBeijing and New Delhi also agreed to issue tourist visas again and boost trade ties, and to meet again in 2026.\n\n\"Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted on X after meeting Mr Wang.\n\nMr Modi is scheduled to travel to China at the end of August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, which will be his first visit to the country in more than seven years.\n\nTrump's impact on India-China relations\n\nThe latest thawing of relations comes after Mr Trump threatened India with 50 per cent tariffs for importing Russian oil, and the ongoing negotiations with Beijing over levies on a vast range of goods.\n\nDirector of the SOAS University of London's China Institute, Professor Steve Tsang, said that the latest agreements were the culmination of a longer process, rather than being triggered by US policy.\n\nHowever, he said both countries had made \"smart, tactical moves\" while under pressure from the US.\n\n\"There is incentive on the part of both the Indian leader and the Chinese leader to try to work together, in whichever ways they can, since it will strengthen their hands when dealing with the Trump administration,\" Professor Tsang told the ABC.\n\nHe said India had expected to benefit from Mr Trump's so-called reciprocal tariff regime by picking up extra investment that had previously gone through China.\n\nBut it was then \"whacked with an enormous tariff\" and needed to respond.\n\nNew Delhi strengthening ties with Beijing would make the US less comfortable, he said.\n\nResearch fellow for South and Central Asia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies Viraj Solanki agreed.\n\n\"As India seeks to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027, it [Trump's tariffs] have highlighted the importance of diversification of major trade partners,\" Mr Solanki said.\n\n\"This has provided a realisation and an opportunity to strengthen their bilateral relationship, which has been strong but has faced many impediments since their border clash in 2020.\"\n\nUS–India relationship under serious strain\n\nDespite India being a close ally of the US early in Mr Trump's second presidency, the country faces sky-high tariffs for importing Russian oil and has not yet signed a new trade deal.\n\nSenior Research Fellow for South Asia at think-tank Chatham House Chietigj Bajpaee said \"the shine has clearly come off the relationship\".\n\nHe said there were several factors at play, including India not giving Mr Trump the praise he believes he deserves for apparently brokering a ceasefire with Pakistan earlier this year.\n\nThe second issue was New Delhi playing hardball on trade deal negotiations and refusing to budge on agricultural sector tariffs.\n\nThe other major problem was the 25 per cent tariff applied on Indian goods for New Delhi importing Russian oil as Mr Trump pushed for peace in Ukraine.\n\n\"India is not the only major buyer — the Chinese are as well, Türkiye is as well, but I suppose from the Trump administration's perspective, it is easier to target India,\" Dr Bajpaee said.\n\nThe deteriorating relationship between Washington and New Delhi has raised questions about the future of the Quad alliance, which sees India join Australia, Japan and the US to counter China's influence in the region.\n\nA meeting is scheduled to be held later this year in India but Mr Solanki said the current state of the relationship put the meeting in doubt.\n\n\"India would have to welcome President Trump to New Delhi, so there needs to be movement on the bilateral relationship, for example, a bilateral trade deal between the two countries,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Tsang went further, saying all US allies would be questioning deals previously struck with America.\n\n\"It's not just about India — which American ally can still rely on the Trump administration?\" he said.\n\nLatest agreements are not strategic shift\n\nWhile all experts agreed the resumption of flights, renewed economic discussions and the meeting between the Indian and Chinese leaders were significant, none believed a major strategic shift was taking place.\n\nIndia on Wednesday announced it had successfully tested a domestically produced Agni 5 medium-range ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear-warhead deep into Chinese territory.\n\n\"The launch validated all operational and technical parameters,\" India's defence ministry said in a statement.\n\nDr Bajpaee said that there were still far too many issues in the relationship between India and China.\n\n\"None of the fundamental grievances in the bilateral agreements [on the border] have been resolved … we've not seen a demilitarisation of the border,\" he said.\n\n\"There are still several other fault lines in the relationship, whether it be China's so-called 'all-weather friendship' with Pakistan, the water disputes — China is building the world's biggest hydro-electric power project across a river that traverses both countries.\n\n\"Even the Tibet question — the Dalai Lama has just turned 90 and there are questions about the succession process, that could be another thorn in the bilateral relationship.\"","summary":"Nuclear-armed rivals India and China have agreed to resume direct flights for the first time in five years, ahead of a

Republicans With Trump-trolling Posts","text":"All-caps hyperbole, wild accusations and idiosyncratic spelling: not just an average Wednesday on Donald Trump's Truth Social feed, but a new digital media strategy for California Governor Gavin Newsom that is delighting Democrats -- and riling Republicans.Newsom -- hotly-tipped for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination -- has been parodying Trump with a series of posts written in the Republican leader's distinct style that he hopes will show his party how to beat the social media master at his own game.In recent weeks the governor has posted all manner of manipulated images depicting him in the kind of over-the-top vignettes popular among Trump's \"MAGA\" movement -- superimposing his face on Mount Rushmore and appearing to pray with MAGA favorites Tucker Carlson, Kid Rock and Hulk Hogan.When Trump's one-word weekend post -- saying simply \"Bela\" -- left the president's supporters scratching their heads, Newsom posted a screenshot alongside his own caption: \"DONALD (TINY HANDS), HAS WRITTEN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THIS MORNING -- UNFORTUNATELY (LOW IQ) HE SPELLED IT WRONG -- 'BETA.'\"The 57-year-old Democrat mocked Trump's salesman-like rhetorical style in a post about redistricting plans that he said had led \"MANY\" people to call him \"GAVIN CHRISTOPHER 'COLUMBUS' NEWSOM (BECAUSE OF THE MAPS!).\"And he has taken to ending his posts with the much-mocked sign-off that Trump, 79, made famous: \"THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!\"The tweets have quickly gained currency among Newsom's supporters, who have shared their own \"Trumpian\" memes of a shirtless Newsom with bulging muscles, brandishing pistols or riding into battle on a velociraptor.The governor called Trump's late-night social media tirades \"pathetic,\" telling historian and podcast host Heather Cox Richardson that people who normally \"can't stand\" politicians had been reaching out to compliment his new approach.\"And they're maybe paying attention to the childishness that is Donald Trump, that we've allowed him to normalize -- the way he communicates, talking down to us, looking past us,\" Newsom said. \"I've got kids, and I've got a whole generation of people who thinks this is normal. It is not, and it can't be normalized, and that's big part of what we're also pushing back against.\"The posts are garnering the attention of X's algorithm while sparking the ire of Republicans, conservative-leaning political commentators and the right-wing media. Dana Perino, an anchor on Fox News, slammed Newsom's new strategy, telling viewers: \"If I were his wife, I would say you are making a fool of yourself, stop it.\" \"NDS - Newsom Derangement Syndrome is a real thing,\" Republican political consultant Mike Madrid posted on X, retooling the Republican accusation of \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" levied to dismiss criticism of the president.The snark appears to be working. The number of followers of Newsom's official press office account on X -- where the cheeky announcement are being posted -- has soared by 450 percent since mid-June, according to CNN, with huge strides also seen on Instagram and TikTok.Daily Google searches for Newsom are up 500 percent since August 1, the network reported.Newsom says the MAGA-coded posts are not only annoying Republicans, but redefining how Democrats can provide an effective opposition to one of the most media-savvy leaders ever to occupy the White House. Asked for comment, the White House shared with AFP an image it had initially sent US publication Politico repurposing a scene from the show \"Mad Men\" to demonstrate that Trump is not just unfazed, but doesn't think about Newsom at all. Politico had called it the first official White House press statement delivered exclusively in meme form.Jeff Le, a deputy cabinet secretary for previous California governor Jerry Brown, said Newsom was responding to widespread discontent at the Democratic Party's perceived lack of fight when it comes to Trump -- and the yawning leadership vacuum.\"His messaging has helped introduce him in a tongue-and-cheek manner that reflects the inside joke that many digital native Democrats understand,\" Le told AFP.But he added that the strategy was \"not without risk.\" \"If there is a terrible natural disaster -- a catastrophic fire or mudslide -- it's fair to say that the White House keeps score,\" he said, \"and the president may be less inclined to provide timely federal government support and funding for the response.\"","summary":"All-caps hyperbole, wild accusations and idiosyncratic spelling: not just an average Wednesday on Donald Trump's Truth Social feed, but a new digital media strategy for California Governor Gavin Newsom that is delighting Democrats -- and riling Republicans.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/meme-lord-newsom-riles-republicans-trump-trolling-posts-3781325","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4617131/california-governor-gavin-newsom-slammed-president-donald-trumps-social-media-posts-childishness.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=59180705b7b494734169b4a80bbbc7fd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 00:12:13","author":"Frankie Taggart","authors":["Frankie Taggart"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.091},{"id":352724590,"title":"Intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard announces cuts to office","text":"Aug. 20 (UPI) -- Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced Wednesday a plan to cut 40% of her office's staff by October in an effort to save taxpayers about $700 million per year.\n\nShe said the overhaul of the Office of the Director National Intelligence will reduce \"bloat\" and refocus the agency's mission \"in the most agile, effective and efficient way.\" Gabbard dubbed the plan ODNI 2.0.\n\n\"Over the last 20 years, ODNI has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence and politicized weaponization of intelligence,\" she said.\n\n\"Under President [Donald] Trump's leadership, ODNI 2.0 is the start of a new era focused on serving our country, fulfilling our core national security mission with excellence, always grounded in the U.S. Constitution, and ensuring the safety, security and freedom of the American people.\"\n\nCongress created the ODNI to oversee all 18 intelligence community agencies within the U.S. government in 2004 as a response to to the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. Since its founding, the staff of the ODNI grew to about 1,850, 500 of whom the Trump administration has already cut since the start of the president's second term.\n\nIn addition to cutting staff, the ODNI won't rehire vacant positions.\n\nThe cuts will see the duties of the Foreign Malign Influence Center, National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center and Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center absorbed into the ODNI's Mission Integration directorate and the National Intelligence Council. Additionally the work of the National Intelligence University will now fall under the Defense Department's National Defense University.\n\nThe External Research Council will be shuttered and the ODNI's facilities in Reston, Va., will be closed and moved to headquarters.","summary":"Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced Wednesday a plan to cut 40% of her office's staff by October in an effort to save taxpayers about $700 million per year.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/20/ODNI-cuts/5911755728941/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5911755728941/2025/1/757ab45c34af0d9a81e27d038413ba18/v1.5/Intelligence-chief-Tulsi-Gabbard-announces-cuts-to-office.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 00:06:03","author":"Danielle Haynes","authors":["Danielle Haynes"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":352728772,"title":"Baby Reindeer actor Richard Gadd undergoes beefed up transformation for new role - see the Netflix star now","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Aug 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Connolly to walk FREE: Tory councillor's wife who was jailed last year for 'racist' Tweet during the Southport riots is being released from prison in a matter of hours\n\nBritain's most targeted shop: Robbed, set on fire, ripped off and forced to tackle thieves herself.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JUSTIN ENRIQUEZ, US ASSISTANT SHOWBIZ EDITOR \n Published:23:15 BST, 20 August 2025 |Updated:01:00 BST, 21 August 2025 \n\nRichard Gadd has seriously bulked up after the smashing success of his Netflix series Baby Reindeer.\nThe 36-year-old Scottish multi-hyphenate showed off his bulkier and more muscular figure in new promotional images released from his latest project Half Man.\nRichard has cultivated some serious mass as his arms and torso were noticeably bigger in the upcoming HBO-BBC drama.\nThe Primetime Emmy winner was joined by co-star, Billy Elliot and Rocketman actor Jamie Bell, in one of the images.\nRichard revealed earlier this year that he wants the new series to be a departure from the intensely personal and autobiographical Baby Reindeer. \nAfter first joking that his next project would be a 'musical,' Richard called Half Man a 'departure from the kind of autobiographical, semi-biographical stuff that I've done before, but it's still dark. \n\nRichard Gadd has seriously bulked up after the smashing success of his Netflix series Baby Reindeer (pictured)\n\nThe 36-year-old Scottish multi-hyphenate showed off his bulkier and more muscular figure in new promotional images released from his latest project Half Man\n'It still explores the contradictions of the human condition, but it feels nice not to be turning in it all the time while I'm doing it,' he explained. 'So this one I wouldn't say is a full departure.'\nHowever, he suggested it was 'still probably totally what you'd expect from me,' though its 'subject matter' might surprise Baby Reindeer fans. \n\n The mysterious episode that was cut from Netflix's Baby Reindeer revealed for the first time \nHe added that he hoped that working on something that wasn't based on his own life would 'be a healthy thing to do.'\nHis upcoming series charts 40 tumultuous years in the lives of brothers who are now estranged. \nThe action begins in the present, when Gadd's character Ruben crashes Bell's character Niall's wedding, setting off an exploration of their traumatic relationship from decades earlier.\nSpeaking of a beefed up transformation, earlier this year Richard talked about the surprising actor he would like to team up with.\nSpeaking with the Daily Mail at the SAG Awards back in January, he sounded excited about the possibility of teaming up with a major wrestler-turned-film star: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson.\n'I love The Rock. I'm waiting for his call currently,' Gadd joked when asked if he'd consider working with the Jumanji star.\n\nThe Primetime Emmy winner was joined by co-star Jamie Bell in one of the images\n\nRichard remarked that Half Man's subject matter might surprise Baby Reindeer fans\n'No, he hasn't been in touch,' Gadd clarified, but he wouldn't mind a call, as he is a 'big wrestling fan.'\nEven though that fact seems to surprise people, he admitted that one of his dreams would be a 'road trip with me, The Rock, John Cena, and let's just say Bret Hart.\n\n Jessica Gunning looks bemused as she leaves BAFTA TV Awards after scooping Best Supporting Actress \n'I don't know what we'll talk about, but we'll do it,' he continued. 'They'll be talking and I'll just be there... '\nRichard created, wrote and played the lead role in Baby Reindeer, the hit dark dramedy thriller that was adapted from his autobiographical one-man show. \nIn the series, he plays a version of himself named Donny Dunn who works as a bartender and moonlights as an aspiring comedian.\nOne of his customers, Martha (fellow Indie Spirit winner Jessica Gunning), develops an unhealthy obsession with him that escalates to stalking. \nThe series also delves into his conflicted feelings about his relationship with his girlfriend Teri, a transgender American therapist (played by Nava Mau, who won the best supporting performance gong at the Independent Spirit Awards), and an abusive collaboration with a TV writer who takes him under his wing.\nThe series, which was released on Netflix, has been a hit with critics and fans alike.\n\nSpeaking with the Daily Mail at the SAG Awards back in January, Richard sounded excited about the possibility of teaming up with a major wrestler-turned-film star: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (pictured January 5 in Beverly Hills)\n\n'I love The Rock. I'm waiting for his call currently,' Gadd joked, admitting he's a huge wrestling fan. One of his dreams would be a 'road trip with me, The Rock, John Cena, and let's just say Bret Hart'\n\nGadd stars in Baby Reindeer as a version of himself who is stalked by Martha (Jessica Gunning), who meets him in a bar\n\nRichard went on to share his advice to other stars who may be dealing with stalkers, including Piers Morgan, who recently revealed he was dealing with a situation that seemed to be straight out of the hit series.\nHe urged anyone tormented by similar circumstances to 'keep going' and to not let it get in their way. \n'I think there's times in my life where I felt like the pressure was so intolerable,' he admitted. 'I almost didn't think there would be any sort of way out, but I think it's almost cliché, the sort of time-is-the-greatest-healer type of thing, but it really is.\n'Every now and again in the darkness, there will be a crack of light, and then as the days go by, those cracks get bigger and ultimately suddenly you're standing in sunlight,' Richard continued.\n'It is strange, but I never thought it would end, but I think just the belief that one day it will was enough for me,' he said on a hopeful note. 'I think, no, nothing bad sustains forever. I do believe that, and I think that the simple two words would be, \"Keep going...\"'\nRichard GaddNetflixJamie BellHBO\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBaby Reindeer actor Richard Gadd undergoes beefed up transformation for new role - see the Netflix star now\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Foreign Minister Cho Hyun has previously said that US Forces Korea’s (USFK) possible involvement in a Taiwan conflict would not be on the summit agenda.\nAsked on Monday if Washington was pressing Seoul for a response, Cho replied: “It is true that some voices in the US have raised the issue. But the US government has neither formally conveyed such a request nor engaged us in negotiations on it.”\nBuilding rapport\nAnalysts say the personal relationship between the two leaders will be crucial.\n“First impressions can frame high-level relationships,” said political scientist Patrick M. Cronin, Asia-Pacific Security chair at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, adding that it would be important for Lee “to prepare carefully for this inaugural visit to the White House”.\nThe Trump administration would likely push for greater South Korean contributions on defence and regional security, Cronin said. “Washington is pressing for Seoul to shoulder greater responsibilities and costs, while acknowledging the need for US forces on the peninsula to be available for other regional contingencies.”\nNorth Korea, for its part, has been dismissive of Seoul’s outreach under Lee. Kim Yo-jong, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, on Wednesday characterised the South’s president as “not a great man”, saying in a statement that the “confrontational ambitions” of its neighbour “have been passed down without the slightest change” from the previous administration.\n\nFormer US officials say the summit will involve some delicate diplomatic choreography.\n“One can imagine President Trump saying publicly that he expects further cooperation from and with South Korea on the China issue,” said Sydney A. Seiler, a former intelligence officer at the US National Intelligence Council, though he described this as a so-called black swan scenario – unlikely, but potentially with severe consequences.\nSeiler said Trump had recently been more “restrained” in his remarks on China and would benefit little from putting “Lee in an uncomfortable position” during their first summit.\nHe further predicted that “all of the debate on Taiwan scenarios, South Korea’s potential contributions, USFK strategic flexibility and mission reorientation” would be handled in working-level discussions.\nDoo agreed that discussions on increased cost-sharing for the 28,500 USKF troops deployed to South Korea and its growing defence budget “are more likely to be deferred to working-level negotiations”.\nMeanwhile, trade policy expert William Alan Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the Trump administration would likely seek “more specificity on the shipbuilding, what the money means, [and] what’s actually going to happen.”","summary":"South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is set to meet US President Donald Trump for the first time next week, seeking to dispel doubts in Washington about his progressive government’s commitment to strengthening their military alliance.\nThe meeting, scheduled for Monday in Washington, comes with President Lee under pressure to demonstrate unwavering support for the US-South Korea alliance, even as his administration faces scepticism in Washington about its long-term strategic intentions.\n“The...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3322504/trump-lee-summit-what-can-turtle-ship-do-us-south-korea-alliance","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/20/a7d27986-d50f-4f73-9fe2-84117a443d1d_336d62be.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 00:00:11","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.258},{"id":352729234,"title":"Almost all Fed officials preferred to maintain rates","text":"AgenciesFed policymakers assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in some goods prices but that the overall effect on the economy and inflation remained to be seen, the minutes showed.\n\nWashington: The two Federal Reserve policymakers who dissented against the US central bank decision's to leave interest rates unchanged last month appear not to have been joined by other policymakers in voicing support for lowering rates at that meeting, a readout of the gathering released on Wednesday showed.\"Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.50% at this meeting,\" the minutes of the July 29-30 meeting said.Fed vice chair for supervision Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller both voted against the decision to leave the benchmark interest rate unchanged, favouring instead a quarter-percentage-point reduction to guard against further weakening of the job market. It was the first time since 1993 that more than one Fed governor dissented against a rate decision.Not even 48 hours after the conclusion of last month's meeting, data from the Labor Department appeared to validate the concerns of Bowman and Waller when it showed far fewer jobs than expected were created in July, a rise in the unemployment rate and a drop in the labor force participation rate to the lowest level since late 2022.More unsettling, though, was an historic downward revision for estimates of employment in the previous two months. That revision erased more than a quarter of a million jobs thought to have been created in May and June and put a hefty dent in the prevailing narrative of a still-strong-job market. The event was so angering to President Donald Trump that he fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Live EventsData since then, however, has provided some fodder for the camp more concerned that Trump's aggressive tariffs risk rekindling inflation to hold their ground against moving quickly to lower rates. The annual rate of underlying consumer inflation accelerated more than expected in July and was followed by an unexpectedly large jump in prices at the producer level.The minutes showed officials continued an active debate on the effects of tariffs on inflation and the degree of restrictiveness in their policy stance. Several policymakers commented that the current level of the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level, where economic activity is neither stimulated nor constrained.Fed policymakers assessed that the effects of higher tariffs had become more apparent in some goods prices but that the overall effect on the economy and inflation remained to be seen, the minutes showed.Looking ahead, participants noted they may face difficult tradeoffs ahead if elevated inflation proved more persistent while the job market outlook weakened.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onFederal Reserveinterest ratesrate decisionjob marketinflationBureau of Labor Statistics\n\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

The TPS designations and legal status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire Sept. 8, at which point they will become eligible for removal.\n\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco granted the emergency stay pending an appeal as immigrants rights advocates allege that the administration acted unlawfully in ending Temporary Protected Status designations for people from Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal.\n\n“The district court’s order granting plaintiffs’ motion to postpone, entered July 31, 2025, is stayed pending further order of this court,” wrote the judges, who are appointees of Democrat Bill Clinton and Republicans George W. Bush and Donald Trump.\n\nTemporary Protected Status is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary, preventing migrants from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively sought to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.\n\nSecretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.\n\nImmigrants rights advocates say TPS holders from Nepal have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade while people from Honduras and Nicaragua have lived in the country for 26 years, after Hurricane Mitch in 1998 devastated both countries.\n\n“The Trump administration is systematically de-documenting immigrants who have lived lawfully in this country for decades, raising U.S.-citizen children, starting businesses, and contributing to their communities,” said Jessica Bansal, attorney at the National Day Laborer Organization, in a statement.\n\nNoem ended the programs after determining that conditions no longer warranted protections.\n\nIn a sharply written July 31 order, U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco kept the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.\n\nShe said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions,” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.\n\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary at DHS, said, “TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades.”\n\nThe Trump administration has already terminated TPS designations for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits in federal courts.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs argued that Noem’s decisions are unlawful because they were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.\n\nBut Drew Ensign, a U.S. deputy assistant attorney general, said at a hearing Tuesday that the government suffers an ongoing irreparable harm from its “inability to carry out the programs that it has determined are warranted.”\n\nIn May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to end TPS designations for Venezuelans. The justices provided no rationale, which is common in emergency appeals, and did not rule on the underlying claims.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Pitman said an expert in political data brokerage could testify what that information was worth for voters in battleground states.\nThe lawsuit was filed on election day, November 5, 2024.\nA day earlier, a Philadelphia judge refused to end Musk’s giveaway, saying that city’s top prosecutor failed to show it was an illegal lottery.\nMusk is a Texas resident and his electric car company Tesla is based in Austin.","summary":"Elon Musk was ordered on Wednesday by a federal judge to face a lawsuit by voters accusing the world’s richest person of defrauding them into signing a petition to support the US Constitution for a chance to win his US$1 million-a-day giveaway.\nUS District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas said Jacqueline McAferty plausibly alleged in her proposed class action that Musk and his political action committee America PAC wrongly induced her to provide personal identifying information as part of...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3322583/elon-musk-must-face-lawsuit-claiming-he-ran-illegal-us1-million-election-lottery","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/21/236c0acc-110c-4389-8641-74a3ae5edc12_7d50808f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:56:29","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.429},{"id":352728024,"title":"US orders amphibious squadron to deploy to southern Caribbean -sources","text":"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) – The United States has ordered an amphibious squadron to the southern Caribbean as part of President Donald Trump’s effort to address threats from Latin American drug cartels, two sources briefed on the deployment said today.\n\nThe sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the USS San Antonio, USS Iowa Jima and USS Fort Lauderdale could arrive off the coast of Venezuela as early as Sunday.

It seems like Gov. Newsom is hitting them exactly where it bugs them most.\"What Does Newsom Think About This?Another asked: \"Gee, why wasn’t this applied to Trump? Total hypocrite.\" and a user reacted, \"Zero self-awareness.\" \n\nNewsom's office has also trolled Vice President Vance, calling out his eyeliner use, and they've also borrowed Trump's signature sign-off, \"Thank you for attention to this matter!\" with his initials.\n\nThe California governor doesn't show any signs of stopping either, as he previously told reporters: \"If you have issues with what I'm putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns with what [Trump's] putting out as president.\"\n\nAnd he doubled down on Wednesday, August 20, when Newsom joined other Democratic officials at a virtual news conference hosted by the Democratic National Committee, and went off again.'We Will Push Back!'Newsom said: \"We’re not going to act as if anything is normal any longer. Yes, we’ll fight fire with fire. Yes, we will push back. \n\n\"It’s not about whether we play hardball anymore. It's about how we play hardball. And California has your back.\"\n\nMany conservative pundits have hit back at Newsom, including Lahren, who recently cried on X: \"Gavin and his team of beta males who sit down to pee actually think they’re trolling the president and actually think this is making Gavin look like a bada--...\"\n\nThe 57-year-old's team had a response, of course, as they joked: \"Tomi’s account is basically Yelp for toilets now.\"Trump and Newsom have never seen eye-to-eye, with the former reality star thinking up the nickname \"Newscum\" during their feud. For his part, Newsom has called Trump by the tag \"TACO,\" or \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"","summary":"Fox News host Dana Perino has no problem with Donald Trump losing his mind on social media, but has a problem with Gavin Newsom doing it.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/fox-news-dana-perino-gavin-newsom-trump-trolling/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/zJ_bFkBWP/0x0/dana-perino-newsom-trump3-1755731590500.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:55:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.539},{"id":352728766,"title":"Ozzy Osbourne 'knew his farewell concert at Villa Park would be his final gig' as his close pal Tom Morello admits the Black Sabbath star had been 'frail for a while'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Aug 21st 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLucy Connolly to walk FREE: Tory councillor's wife who was jailed last year for 'racist' Tweet during the Southport riots is being released from prison in a matter of hours\n\nBritain's most targeted shop: Robbed, set on fire, ripped off and forced to tackle thieves herself.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA FOX, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:00:38 BST, 21 August 2025 |Updated:00:52 BST, 21 August 2025 \n\nOzzy Osbourne 'knew' that his farewell concert at Villa Park would be his last ever gig, his close friend Tom Morello has revealed.\nThe Black Sabbath hitmaker had reunited with the band for one last show at the beloved venue, before he passed away three weeks later at the age of 76.\nMusical director Tom, a close friend of Ozzy's who helped organise the concert, admitted he felt the rocker knew his days were numbered, after battling Parkinson's disease for many years.\nSpeaking on US radio station Q101, he said: 'Ozzy Osbourne had lived on the edge for such a long time, the fact he lived as long as he did was a miracle. \n'The fact he lived to play and feel that love one more time, to do Paranoid, to do Crazy Train. If you have got to go – and I wish Ozzy lived another 30 years – if you've got to go out... it felt like he knew.'\nTom, a guitarist for Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, added that he got the chance to thank Ozzy after spending two years with him and his wife Sharon organising the reunion gig.\n\nOzzy Osbourne 'knew' that his farewell concert at Villa Park would be his last ever gig, his close friend Tom Morello has revealed\n\nMusical director Tom, a close friend of Ozzy's who helped organise the concert, admitted he felt the rocker knew his days were numbered as he'd been 'frail for a while'\nBut when asked whether he was surprised to learn the news of Ozzy's death, Tom added that he had been 'frail for a while.'\nHe added: 'Friends of mine saw him a week later at another event in Birmingham. He wasn't on his death bed. He was just sort of living his life. It was a terrible and tragic surprise.'\nTom said when Ozzy and Sharon approached him to organise the farewell concert, he vowed to make it 'the greatest day in the history of heavy metal.'\nHe said: 'Black Sabbath invented heavy metal. Ozzy and Sabbath could not be more important to me as a fan. I laid out to make it a great show for fans and for them. \n'It is so unusual that those guys headlined. They got to see all the work they had done and the great artists their music had created perform for them. \n'They got to play and feel the love not just from the bands, the people in the stadium but from all over the world.'\nNews of Ozzy's death last month sparked an outpouring of tributes from fans in the music world and showbiz industry alike.\nThe Black Sabbath frontman, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2019, passed away at the age of 76 on July 22 surrounded by his family. He was buried a week later on July 30.\n\nIt comes after a BBC documentary about Ozzy was pulled from schedules at the last minute, with sources claiming it was due to concerns from his family that the project was 'rushed'\n\n Jack Osbourne is seen for the first time since father Ozzy's funeral as downcast star runs errands \nIt later emerged that both the BBC and Paramount+ were producing documentaries on the rocker after filmmakers were given access to him for the final three years of his life, with the channels said to be a 'race' to air unseen footage.\nHowever, while the BBC had planned to air their documentary on Monday, it was pulled at the last minute due to reported concerns from Ozzy's family that the project was being 'rushed.'\nA source told The Sun: 'There have been conversations behind the scenes that maybe the BBC were rushing their show on Ozzy out - especially because Paramount+ also had a film in the offing.'\nThey told how the BBC’s production had originally set out to make a 10-part series called called Home To Roost charting Ozzy and wife Sharon's move back to the UK, however upon his death, it was later decided it would be a one-off film.\nThe insider continued: 'What mattered the most to the family was the overall tone and theme of the programme, which features Ozzy and Sharon in one of their last interviews together. \n'It started to feel like the goal being pursued was that the BBC and the makers of the film were to get the show on air faster than the Paramount+ doc. Naturally that has caused some concerns with the family.'\nOzzy was laid to rest on the grounds of his own mansion in Buckinghamshire last month during a private funeral attended by his family and a host of rock royalty.\nHis widow Sharon, 72, and their children were joined by stars including Marilyn Manson and Ozzy's lead guitarist Zakk Wylde during the event at the family's 250-acre estate near Gerrards Cross.\nOfficial documents listed three causes of death for the rock legend. This included an out of hospital cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease and Parkinson's disease with autonomic dysfunction.\nIn a statement shared last month, Ozzy's family said he died 'surrounded by love', adding: 'It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning.\nOzzy OsbourneBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOzzy Osbourne 'knew his farewell concert at Villa Park would be his final gig' as his close pal Tom Morello admits the Black Sabbath star had been 'frail for a while'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Sebastian Gorka, the deputy assistant to the president , revealed a fresh image of Trump, which is now displayed in the Oval Office. The artwork shows Trump striding through rows of American flags with an orange glow behind him - compared to flames by critics - and was teased as just \"one of the new\" Trump-themed artworks decorating the White House. The new portrait comes amid reports of how Trump's Ukraine plans has prompted a Pentagon peace summit with UK military chiefs. The new portrait was created by Vanessa Horabuena, a self-described Christian worship painter. The reveal comes alongside news of Trump's afterlife concerns, reports the Express . Not everyone was impressed with the portrait, with some branding it as \"too accurate\" and others as \"too orange.\" Project Liberal questioned, \"Why is the country on fire behind him?\". This feeling resonated with many, as another user remarked, \"fits. America is on fire in the background and Trump walks away.\" Others pointed to Trump's collection of self-portraits in the White House, especially after reports last week that portraits of Obama and Bush have been moved to a rarely-used stairwell, reports the Mirror US. \"The man can't get enough of himself,\" one user slammed. Another added: \"As per usual, it's all about his ego.\" Another person slated the portrait's poor resemblance to Trump's real appearance. \"Did you request the portrait to appear 60 lbs lighter than reality?\" an X user questioned. The Mirror reached out to both the White House and the artist for a response, but none was immediately available. Trump's portraits and paintings displayed around the White House have previously sparked controversy, and a recent attempt to showcase them to other world leaders didn't go as smoothly as Trump had hoped. His iconic photo from the Butler assassination attempt, featuring him with his fist raised in the air, is also a source of pride for the president, who often shows it off to visitors. Before a meeting in the East Room yesterday, the seven European heads of state gathered for a photograph with Trump and Zelensky in the Grand Foyer of the White House. As they stood together, the president gestured towards a painting depicting his bloodied ear following an assassination attempt during his 2024 campaign in Pennsylvania. \"That was not a good day. Not a great day. See the picture?\" Trump said, pointing to a wall on the group's right where the large painting is hung. However, not all the leaders shared Trump's enthusiasm for the image. Some of the leaders briefly glanced over, appearing to show minimal interest, while others, like French President Emmanuel Macron, continued to look straight ahead. The Republican leader has been giving the White House a makeover, including refurbishing the Rose Garden and adding numerous gold accents throughout the Oval Office. A substantial portion of these changes includes swapping out portraits of his predecessors. In a recent snap shared on X, Trump's patriotic portrait is proudly showcased between former First Lady Laura Bush and another first lady, nabbing the spot previously held by his long-standing adversary, Hillary Clinton. This comes after Joe Rogan revealed a startling new conspiracy theory about a potential assassination attempt on Trump in 2024.","summary":"A fresh image of Donald Trump has been unveiled in the Oval Office - but it's already causing a stir online, with many branding it as &quot;too accurate&quot;","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-new-white-house-35767173","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35767171.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Trumps-newest-Oval-Office-portrait.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:50:26","author":"Kyle O'sullivan,Michael D.

During a \"CBS Mornings\" segment, Dokoupil defended Trump’s directive for Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C., to stop focusing on the sins of America’s past and portray the country’s history in a more positive light. \"American history shouldn’t be a thing of reverence. The country is not above critique,\" Dokoupil said. \"But we shouldn’t look at our history with contempt, either. And there is some room for correction back toward the middle.\" AMERICAN HISTORY WON'T BE DISPLAYED 'IN A WOKE MANNER' AT SMITHSONIAN, TRUMP SAYS Trump criticized how the Smithsonian has presented American history across its various museums in recent years in a Truth Social post Tuesday, accusing the institute of pushing a \"woke\" agenda that fixates on the darker parts of America’s past. \"The Museums throughout Washington, but all over the Country are, essentially, the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE.’ The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been — Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future,\" he said. Trump added, \"We are not going to allow this to happen, and I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.\" The White House issued a letter to the Smithsonian on Aug. 12 ordering it to conduct an internal review of its exhibits to ensure that they align with the \"President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions\" ahead of the country’s 250th birthday celebrations next year. SMITHSONIAN TEMPORARILY REMOVES TRUMP IMPEACHMENT REFERENCES FROM HISTORY MUSEUM, DRAWING LIBERAL IRE Dokoupil argued that the words in the letter to the Smithsonian were similar to the current mission statement of the institution itself. \"The mission of the Smithsonian is to forge a shared history, a shared future, not just context, but hope to lead the country and communities together. That’s essentially what Donald Trump is offering here,\" the morning show host continued. He added that Americans deserve to feel proud of their country's history, and that their museums should foster that feeling for all visitors. \"If you ask someone, is the world and its people better off because of the existence of America and its people? To me, the answer is unquestionably yes.

Greg Abbott called a second special session to move forward with the redistricting vote.Democratic responseDemocrats in the Texas chamber said the redistricting plan is part of a push by President Donald Trump to manufacture an advantage in Washington.“This is Donald Trump’s map,” said Texas State Rep. John Bucy, who left with other Democrats earlier this month in protest. “It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows that the voters are rejecting his agenda.”“You may not understand gerrymandering. You may not understand redistricting,” House Democratic leader Gene Wu said. “But I hope you understand lying, cheating and stealing. Because this is what people do — people like Donald Trump. People like the Republican Party of Texas. When they can’t win, they cheat.”The standoff also gave other Democrats time to move forward with their own efforts to balance Texas' redistricting plans.In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a special election for Nov. 4 that would ask voters whether to approve a new congressional map that favored Democratic representation in the U.S. House.Democrats have supermajorities in both chambers of the California legislature. Lawmakers are expected to vote on the first steps of the redistricting plan on Thursday.\"Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,\" Gov.

Joe Biden defeated the incumbent president in both the popular vote and the Electoral College.\n\nProsecutors in a Florida federal corruption case against Smartmatic co-founder Roger Alejandro Piñate Martinez and two other company officials allege that bribery was part of the company’s business model.\n\nWhile the recipients of the alleged misuse of county taxpayer money have not been identified, Dean Logan, the county’s top voting official, has reported having regular meetings with Piñate, The Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe allegations also extend internationally with prosecutors claiming similar schemes occurred in the Philippines and Venezuela.\n\nLast year, Piñate was charged with bribery and money laundering in the Philippines, where executives are accused of inflating voting machine prices to secure $182 million (£135 million) in contracts for its 2016 election to bribe a top election official.\n\nIn Venezuela, Smartmatic employees are said to have used a similar fund to buy a home with a pool for a long-time elections official in 2019. This detail surfaced in an August 1 court filing in the Philippines corruption case.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, where Smartmatic won a $209 million contract for the 2020 election — considered the largest election technology deal in U.S. history — the company allegedly used county money to create a similar type of slush fund.\n\nProsecutors plan to present financial and business records, witness testimony, and electronic communications to strengthen their case, which they claim reveals a broader pattern of bribery.\n\nAccording to the August 1 filing, the company is accused of regularly adding a surplus fee of $10 to $50 per machine sent to the three jurisdictions, with these funds designated for bribes. Federal prosecutors declined to comment on the ongoing criminal case when contacted by the LA Times.\n\nLogan, the county’s registrar-recorder, stated: “The county has no knowledge or visibility into how Smartmatic USA used proceeds from that contract. The contract between Los Angeles County and Smartmatic USA was competitively bid, evaluated, and awarded in compliance with the county’s open competitive public procurement processes.”\n\nA spokesperson for the registrar-recorder’s office added that no evidence was found of the surplus charges alleged by federal prosecutors and that the price of machines always remained the same. No federal prosecutors have contacted the department.\n\nSmartmatic spokesperson Samira Saba accused the Department of Justice of filing the motion with misrepresentations that were “untethered from reality.”\n\nIn a statement, the company asserted: “Let us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we’re the best at what we do. We operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.”\n\nAs the federal corruption case against the Smartmatic employees gets underway, L.A. County’s Logan faces separate civil allegations that he benefited from a close relationship with company management. This included upscale dinners, a trip to Taiwan and the Maldives, as well as other outings, according to reported county emails and text messages.\n\nLogan later stated in a civil case deposition that these were exempt from disclosure because he attended in a “personal capacity.”\n\nThe emails and depositions emerged in an unusual 1,000-page public records lawsuit filed this month by Fox News, whose representatives say they need county records to defend themselves against the multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit brought by Smartmatic.\n\nSmartmatic gained widespread recognition in 2020 after Fox News falsely reported that the company, along with Dominion Voting Systems, helped rig the 2020 election against President Trump. This conspiracy was widely pushed by Trump surrogates both on-air and in legal filings that ultimately failed.\n\nAt the time, Dominion voting machines were used in about two dozen states, while Smartmatic was only used in L.A. County — it’s first business in North America.\n\nDominion filed a defamation suit against Fox which was settled for $787.5 million. Smartmatic filed a similar lawsuit in 2021 seeking $2.7 billion. Smartmatic also launched defamation lawsuits against some of its accusers. In addition to Fox News, the company sued Mike Lindell, Newsmax, One America News Network, Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nAs part of its defense, Fox News lawyers have focused on the relationship between Logan and Smartmatic, arguing that the county is withholding crucial records. The network declined to elaborate on the allegations made in the lawsuit when contacted by the LA Times.\n\nLogan said in a statement that the county is being used as a pawn in both the civil lawsuit and federal corruption case and said the “voluminous records” the county released “refute the salacious allegations.”\n\nThe federal criminal case against Smartmatic executives started during the Biden administration with charges filed in August 2024. The Trump administration paused most foreign bribery cases after he took office for a second term, but allowed the charges against Smartmatic executives to proceed.\n\nRecords released to Fox News by L.A. County, which the media company included as exhibits in the civil public records lawsuit, show no evidence of the voter fraud espoused on air by the network’s guests in 2020 that led to the whirlwind of conspiracy theories and the subsequent defamation case.","summary":"Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems were both falsely accused of being part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election and have settled lawsuits against media networks for propagating such stories","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/la-voting-machines-funding-bribing-trump-election-b2811341.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/20/21/57/GettyImages-1229424078.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6esu3XPA-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:43:12","author":"Oliver O'connell","authors":["Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":352723868,"title":"Texas House Passes New Gerrymandered Map—Likely Giving Republicans 5 More Congressional Seats","text":"Texas House lawmakers approved a new gerrymandered map Wednesday that would likely give Republicans five additional congressional seats, at President Donald Trump’s urging, overcoming a protest by Democrats and teeing up a battle with Democratic-led states to even the scales ahead of next year’s midterms.\n\nAmerican and Texas state flags flying on the dome of the Texas State Capitol building in Austin.\n\nThe Texas House voted along party lines in an 88-52 vote to approve a new map drawn by Republicans to flip five Democrat-held districts, sending the bill to the GOP-controlled state Senate, where a vote is scheduled for Thursday, then on to Republican Gov.

Democratic Rep. Nicole Collier refused to sign the permission slip, however, and spent Monday night sleeping on the House floor.

Trump told CNBC earlier this month Republicans were “entitled to five seats” in Texas given his 2024 election victory there.\n\nKey Background\n\nTexas Republicans openly said they were reworking the map for political reasons, with State Rep. Todd Hunter telling The New York Times the effort was to “improve political performance,” while some Democrats alleged it illegally discriminated against minorities by dividing and diminishing their votes. The move sparked a national battle between Republican- and Democratic-led states to gerrymander their maps and gain an advantage ahead of next year’s midterms. Republican state lawmakers in Indiana, Missouri and Florida have also said they’re considering retooling district lines to give the GOP an advantage next year, while Democrats in New York, New Jersey and Illinois have floated their own counter initiatives.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTexas Battle Triggers National Gerrymandering War—These States Could Redistrict Next (Forbes)\n\nWill Redistricting Fight Spread After Texas And California?

Trump has vowed to carry out the largest deportation campaign in history, and his administration is pushing for 1 million deportations per year, according to multiple outlets. ICE deported nearly 150,000 people in the first half of this year, CBS News reported, citing internal government figures that suggest the agency could reach 300,000 deportations by the end of the year.\n\n$30 billion. That is how much money was allocated for ICE’s removal operations, transportation costs, hiring programs and more in Trump’s megabill.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe Trump administration began a wave of deportation flights on Jan. 23, shortly after the president signed executive orders directing the military to the southern border, canceling migrants’ advance appointments with border officials and suspending parole programs. A series of the flights were directed to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, a law last enacted during World War II to make deportations without court orders. The legality of the El Salvador flights is still being challenged in court after a federal judge accused Trump’s administration of contempt by carrying them out. As the administration has attempted to ramp up deportation flights, it has also increased the infrastructure needed to support the president’s deportation push, creating new immigration detention centers or expanding dozens of pre-existing facilities to house migrants awaiting deportation. The “Big Beautiful Bill” allocated $45 billion to expand ICE’s detention facilities.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nContempt Proceedings Paused Against Trump Administration Over El Salvador Immigration Flights (Forbes)\n\nEverything To Know About Trump’s ‘Mass Deportation’ Plans—ICE Chief Removed Amid Push For More Arrests (Forbes)\n\nGot a tip?

Officials said it has become “redundant” and that its core functions would be integrated into other parts of the government.The reorganization is part of a broader administration effort to rethink how it tracks foreign threats to American elections, a topic that has become politically loaded given Trump's long-running resistance to the intelligence community's assessment that Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 election.In February, for instance, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded an FBI task force focused on investigating foreign influence operations, including those that target U.S. elections. The Trump administration also has made sweeping cuts at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which oversees the nation’s critical infrastructure, including election systems. And the State Department in April said it shut down its office that sought to deal with misinformation and disinformation that Russia, China and Iran have been accused of spreading.Reaction to the news broke along partisan lines in Congress, where Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised the decision as “an important step towards returning ODNI to that original size, scope, and mission. And it will help make it a stronger and more effective national security tool for President Trump.”The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner, pledged to carefully review Gabbard's proposals and \"conduct rigorous oversight to ensure any reforms strengthen, not weaken, our national security.” He said he was not confident that would be the case “given Director Gabbard’s track record of politicizing intelligence.”Gabbard’s efforts to downsize the agency she leads is in keeping with the cost-cutting mandate the administration has employed since its earliest days, when Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency oversaw mass layoffs of the federal workforce.It’s the latest headline-making move by an official who just a few month ago had seemed out of favor with Trump over her analysis of Iran’s nuclear capabilities but who in recent weeks has emerged as a key loyalist with her latest actions.The Foreign Malign Influence Center was created by the Biden administration in 2022 to respond to what the U.S. intelligence community had assessed as attempts by Russia and other adversaries to interfere with American elections.Its role, ODNI said when it announced the center’s creation, was to coordinate and integrate intelligence pertaining to malign influence. The office in the past has joined forces with other federal agencies to debunk and alert the public to foreign disinformation intended to influence U.S. voters.For example, it was involved in an effort to raise awareness about a Russian video that falsely depicted mail-in ballots being destroyed in Pennsylvania that circulated widely on social media in the weeks before the 2024 presidential election.Gabbard said Wednesday she would be refocusing the center's priorities, asserting it had a “hyper-focus” on work tied to elections and that it was “used by the previous administration to justify the suppression of free speech and to censor political opposition.” Its core functions, she said, will be merged into other operations.The center is set to sunset at the end of 2028, but Gabbard is terminating it “in all but name,” said Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which tracks foreign disinformation.Though Gabbard said in a fact sheet that the center's job was redundant because other agencies already monitor foreign influence efforts targeting Americans, Brooking refuted that characterization and said the task of parsing intelligence assessments across the government and notifying decision-makers was “both important and extremely boring.”“It wasn’t redundant, it was supposed to solve for redundancy,” he said.","summary":"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence will dramatically reduce its workforce and cut its budget by more than $700 million annually, the Trump administration announced Wednesday.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/gabbard-slashing-intelligence-office-workforce-and-cutting-budget-by-over-700-million","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94e57fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2Ffc%2F322a6db94768987d5c05a56e8557%2Fap25084564040820.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:32:08","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":352719320,"title":"Letters: Republican duplicity inspires Newsom’s redistricting plan","text":"GOP duplicity inspires\nNewsom mapping ploy\n\nCalifornia’s redistricting plan (“Newsom reveals mapping gambit,” Page A1, Aug. 15) is debatable.

Rather than continuing to be reactive to all the chaos and criminality coming out of the federal government, let’s channel our outrage over Donald Trump’s transgressions and be proactive in what we can do to improve the lives of people we can reach.\n\nThe other piece was the editorial supporting Gov. Newsom‘s plan to embark on our own redistricting in California if Texas follows through with its devious plan. California’s plan would only go into effect if California voters allow it and Texas continues its gerrymandering.\n\nI agree that it’s time for such extreme actions when Trump’s administration is running roughshod over our laws, our rights and our democracy.\n\nUnseemly redistricting\nneeded to counter Texas\n\nPresident Trump and Texas Republicans believe the Republicans cannot hold the House in the midterm elections, so they are cheating to win by redrawing Texas congressional districts outside of a census year.\n\nThere is no umpire who can prevent the cheating in this political game because the Supreme Court has given Trump immunity for the cheating. When there is no umpire in a game, the team that is being defeated through cheating has no option but to cheat themselves or concede defeat. However, the running of our country is no game, and to concede defeat is to concede that this is no longer a democracy but a place where a minority can rule through cheating.\n\nUnseemly as it is, California Democrats have no choice but to counter Texas Republicans’ cheating and thereafter try to enact a national law requiring fair Congressional districts everywhere.\n\nJay Chafetz\nWalnut Creek\n\nTrump’s appeasement\nbased on bad precedent\n\nRe: “European leaders to join Zelenskyy at meeting in D.C.” (Page A1, Aug. 18).\n\nAs I listen to Donald Trump prattle on about Ukraine, I am reminded of 1938 when Neville Chamberlain of Great Britain met with another dictator and decided on the fate of a free nation under threat. After surrendering the Sudetenland to Hitler’s demands, Chamberlain blandly announced he “brought peace in our time.” World War II started the next year.\n\nChurchill’s prescient comment, “You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour and you will have war,” was borne out tragically. I hope Zelenskyy will resist Trump’s calls for concessions to a naked invasion of his country, and I hope Europe and concerned Americans will oppose Trump’s appeasement and the dismembering of Ukraine.\n\nRussia can and must be prevented from this conquest of a free nation. Failure to do so will only increase the likelihood of future aggressions and endanger world peace.\n\nPreconditions would\nhave doomed talks\n\nRe: “Trump bows to Putin’s approach: No ceasefire, deadlines or sanctions” (Page A4, Aug. 17).\n\nThat no ceasefire, deadlines or sanctions emerged from the Putin-Trump peace talks does not indicate Donald Trump was duped or failed in the talks.\n\nIf all sides insist on non-negotiable positions and nothing shifts, what’s the point of holding talks? Russia, which now holds the power in this proxy war, is defeating Ukraine on the battlefield. Ukraine can fight on, suffering more devastation and certain battlefield defeat, or as two-thirds of Ukrainians now want, it can seek a negotiated settlement. Vladimir Putin was smart enough to realize that an unconditional ceasefire is not tenable but that other terms are. Trump is also smart enough to know neither economic sanctions nor deadlines have been effective.\n\nThus, Putin and Trump talked. It is the first step toward peace. It is going to take time, effort and patience to come to a settlement. That’s how war-ending talks function.\n\nEleanor Levine","summary":"Also: Fighting back &#124; Redistricting needed &#124; Bad precedent &#124; No preconditions.

Whereas US Democrats, British Conservatives, and German Social Democrats embraced austerity in recent decades in a misguided bid to contain public debt, the Republicans never truly sought fiscal retrenchment.\nAlthough Republicans from Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan and George W Bush campaigned against “big government,” once in power they inflated deficits with tax cuts for the wealthy and massive new military expenditures.\nAnd yet the Republicans’ goal remained austerian at its moral core. Government spending cuts targeted support for the working class within budgets that intentionally ballooned the deficit on behalf of the rich. To “starve the beast” meant cutting America’s social-welfare programmes – while borrowing more on behalf of the wealthy.\nIn this light, Donald Trump is the quintessential postwar Republican. Leveraging Big Tech’s allure, stablecoins, low corporate taxes, the threat of tariffs, and, like every one of his predecessors, the dollar’s unrivaled power to attract foreign capital, he bet that supercharging the deficit would accomplish a time-honoured Republican objective: whip up enough austerian frenzy in Congress to gut social security and Medicaid.\nEven by the no-holds-barred standards of Republican class politics, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill is extraordinary. Once again, the old pretexts for austerity (“fiscal responsibility,” “debt reduction”) were sacrificed on the altar of the true aim: dismantling state support for the many while enriching the few.\nBut that is where the comparison between Trump and previous Republican presidents must end. So-called Reagan Democrats – who, like Margaret Thatcher’s working-class supporters in the UK, kept the right in power throughout the 1980s and beyond – benefitted from higher average earnings for workers lucky enough to retain their jobs in the midst of massive job losses. But they couldn’t escape demotion to the precariat indefinitely.\nFollowing the 2008 financial collapse, US capitalism changed forever. While the banks were bailed out, more and more workers with secure, high-quality employment found themselves among the “untouchables” scrounging for a living in short-term, low-paid, dead-end jobs.\nWhereas Reagan and the Bushes won elections because secure proletarians voted for them and untouchables were too disheartened to vote at all, Trump won by rallying the untouchables, who now included a growing number of hitherto secure proletarians.\nAgainst the backdrop of Bill (and Hillary) Clinton’s open romancing of Wall Street, Barack Obama’s banker bailouts, and Joe Biden’s suicidal strategy of telling struggling people that the Democrats had delivered an “excellent” economy, Trump tapped into working-class rage.\nAll it took to attract voters the Democrats had long since abandoned were some incoherent musings about a “broken” country and the “carnage” that feckless, self-interested elites had inflicted on people like them.\nDemocrats hope and pray that when the pain from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill begins to bite, workers will desert him. Trump’s budget has been, unquestionably, the nastiest instrument of class war since the Reagan-Thatcher-Bush years.\nLike a Robin Hood for the rich, Trump weaponised the mandate he received from poorer Americans to slash the social and medical services they rely on while delivering vast handouts to the wealthiest Americans.\nI, too, hope and pray that Trump’s working-class base will rebel against a president who so readily betrayed them. But I suspect they might not. The American working class did not rebel against Reagan when their collective prospects tanked while the rich got richer courtesy of federal borrowing.\nThe reason? They were sold two interlocking dreams: capital gains on their homes, driven by the debt-fuelled bubble of Reaganomics, which ultimately burst with devastating effects in 2008; and a resurgent, globally dominant America that had shed the albatross of the Vietnam War.\nToday, Trump is also peddling two interlocking dreams. One is the dream of crypto riches, reflecting a novel assault on the common good – a campaign to privatise the dollar – that previous Republican presidents lacked the technology even to imagine. Coupled with the AI frenzy, this has triggered not only a bonanza for Wall Street and Silicon Valley, but also fresh optimism among Trump’s working-class base.\nA significant segment of his Maga (“Make America Great Again”) movement, blind to the enormous risks of this new variant of the something-for-nothing mentality that led to the subprime mortgage debacle, dreams of future non-wage sources of income. Trump may be robbing them of food stamps and Medicaid, but he is the conjuror of magical forms of wealth with an “anti-system” aura.\nThe second dream is the Trumpian equivalent of America’s triumph in the Cold War. On Fox News, US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent was interviewed about the recent trade deal with the European Union, which, among other one-sided concessions to Trump, included an absurd EU commitment to invest US$600 billion in the US by 2029.\nAsked whether this amounted to “offshore appropriation,” Bessent diplomatically agreed: “I think a good framing of that is (that) other countries in essence are providing us with a sovereign wealth fund.”\nTaken together, the promise of a crypto money tree and the belief that the world is paying for America’s rebirth may be enough to shield Trump from the fury of his betrayed working-class base. If so, who will harvest the grapes of wrath after Trump’s con job is, eventually, found out, and the accumulated rage calls forth a new populist narrative?\n\nYanis Varoufakis, a former finance minister of Greece, is leader of the MeRA25 party and professor of economics at the University of Athens.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"Like a Robin Hood for the rich, US president Donald Trump weaponised the mandate he received from poorer Americans to slash the social and medical services they rely on while delivering vast handouts to the wealthy.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/08/21/will-trumps-working-class-base-turn-on-him","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/38333738-8369278_1600x1000_1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:30:04","author":"Yanis Varoufakis","authors":["Yanis Varoufakis"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":352721184,"title":"Fighters will undergo screening to determine sex before women’s World Boxing Championships | World News","text":"Boxers who want to compete in the women’s division at next month’s World Boxing Championships in Liverpool will need to undergo tests to determine their sex.\n\nThe international body, World Boxing, had already announced its plan to require competitors to undergo a polymerase chain reaction test or an equivalent genetic screening test to determine their sex at birth.\n\nThe rules will be implemented ahead of the World Boxing Championships in Liverpool in early September, the organisation announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe organisation’s tests identify the presence or absence of Y chromosome genetic material to indicate biological sex.\n\nAll boxers, including Algeria’s Imane Khelif, 26, who won Olympic welterweight gold in Paris 2024 in the female category, will be unable to compete in their events until they undergo the test.\n\nKhelif’s disputed failed gender eligibility test – conducted by a different boxing body – was a major issue at the Olympics before she won gold.\n\nShe has repeatedly said she was born a woman, and she has competed at all levels of women’s amateur boxing for nearly a decade.\n\n“World Boxing respects the dignity of all individuals and is keen to ensure it is as inclusive as possible,” World Boxing president Boris Van Der Vorst said.\n\n“Yet in a combat sport like boxing, we have a duty of care to deliver safety and competitiveness fairness, which are the key principles that have guided the development and creation of this policy.”\n\nKhelif declined to enter a World Boxing tournament in the Netherlands in June, shortly after the governing body initially announced its plans to introduce sex testing.\n\nThe debate over the boxers has seen renewed discussion over athletes who may have differences in sexual development (DSD), which covers a group of conditions involving genes, hormones and reproductive organs developing differently than expected.\n\nWorld Boxing said athletes with DSD in which male androgenisation occurs will be eligible to compete only in the men’s category.\n\nRead more from Sky News:Analysis: Gender boxing rowWorld Boxing apologises to KhelifUK court rules on definition of a woman\n\nBut the governing body also plans to offer extra analysis and evaluation for athletes with Y chromosome genetic material who wish to compete in the women’s categories, as well as an appeals process.\n\nNational federations are responsible for conducting the tests and submitting the results, World Boxing said.\n\nChromosome testing was previously common in Olympic sports but was largely abandoned in the 1990s because of numerous ambiguities.\n\nMany sports switched to hormone testing, but it requires governing bodies to make difficult decisions on the eligibility of women with naturally high testosterone levels.\n\nEarlier this year, World Athletics – the governing body for track and field – became the first Olympic sport to reintroduce chromosome testing.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, US President Donald Trump said there are only two sexes – male and female – while calling on sports to ban transgender women from women’s events.","summary":"Boxers who want to compete in the women&#8217;s division at next month&#8217;s World Boxing Championships in Liverpool will need to undergo tests to determine their sex.

The map passed the Republican-controlled House in a 88-52 vote, setting up a new look for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections with the addition of five Republican-leaning congressional districts in the Lone Star State. Still, the map must make its way through the Texas State Senate before it lands on Gov. Greg Abbott's desk. TEXAS DEMS END WEEKSLONG QUORUM STANDOFF IN REDISTRICTING FIGHT Abbott pushed for the creation of a new map to adhere to President Donald Trump’s desire to not see a repeat of the 2018 election cycle, when Democrats handily regained the majority in the House and acted as a foil to the president’s legislative desires toward the end of his first term. While Republicans control a supermajority in deep-red Texas and already passed the map through the state Senate, Democrats still needed to create a quorum in the House to actually move the process along. ABBOTT, TEXAS REPUBLICANS LAUNCH NEW TRUMP-BACKED REDISTRICTING PUSH AS FLEEING DEMOCRATS PLAN TO END WALKOUT Dozens of Texas Democrats fled the state to stall the process, creating a national media frenzy and generating support from Democratic donors, including groups linked to George Soros and Beto O’Rourke, to help pay for their fines, travel and lodging. It generated pushes to have them arrested by Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as a request from Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to have the FBI track them down and the DOJ to launch an investigation into the political action committees funding their escape. O'ROURKE, SOROS-LINKED GROUPS FACE CALL FOR DOJ PROBE OVER ALLEGED FUNDING OF TEXAS DEM WALKOUT Democratic leaders announced Monday they would return for the second special session following California's plan to redraw its maps to soften the blow from the Lone Star State, ending the blockade and allowing Republicans to charge ahead. Texas House Democrats accused the GOP of crafting a map that was illegal and racially discriminatory, and they tried and failed on the House floor to add amendments to the bill that would have halted the process. Despite Democrats' best efforts, Texas House Republicans shot down a dozen amendments to the bill. \"Members, it breaks my heart to see how this illegal and rigged, mid-decade redistricting scheme is dividing our state and our country,\" Rep. Chris Turner, a Democrat, said. \"This is Texas, it's not Washington D.C. The impulses of outside politicians and their billionaire backers shouldn't dictate what we do in this chamber, in this House.\" Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who wrote the bill for the new map, countered that four of the five new districts were \"majority-minority Hispanic,\" noting that each of the new districts now trended Republican. Still, he had no qualms as to why Republicans were pursuing changes to the congressional maps. \"The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward, [to] improve Republican political performance,\" he said.

Some say the move lacks ‘pop.’","text":"Fiddelke, a 20-year veteran at the retailer, will take the new job and join Target’s board on Feb. 1. Cornell, who has been in charge of the big-box chain for the past 11 years, will move to the board’s executive chair position on that date.\n\nThe news overshadowed fiscal second-quarter results that beat profit and sales expectations amid a meaningful improvement in Target’s store traffic. \n\n“It is clear that Michael is the right leader to return Target to growth, refocus and accelerate the company’s strategy, and re-establish Target’s position as a leader in the highly dynamic and fast-moving retail environment,” Christine Leahy, lead independent director of Target’s board, said in a statement.\n\nStill, Sarah Henry, managing director and portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management, told MarketWatch over email that the decision to select an insider to helm the company “suggests minimal strategic changes, at least in the near future.” \n\n“Getting the Target magic back in a way that inspires customers will likely take time and possibly greater rates of company spending, especially as new leadership takes over,” she added. \n\nThe company’s leadership change and its quarterly results landed as consumers deal with higher costs for basic priorities and shy away from things like clothing, furniture and electronics, which make up a higher portion of Target’s sales. As the United States increases tariffs on imports, adding to the uncertainty, some analysts believe that Target could have to raise its prices more than rival Walmart Inc. \n\nIn a note, D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Baker said Wednesday’s stock reaction reflected slow progress in Target’s turnaround, as well as some hope that an external CEO hire “would be a catalyst for significant change” at the company.\n\n“Instead, [Target] went with an internal promotion as Brian Cornell officially announced long-expected retirement,” Baker wrote. “That is not a knock on new CEO Michael Fiddelke, who deserves a chance to prove himself. But, that announcement lacks the pop that a significant external hire would provide.”\n\nSpeaking during the conference call to discuss Target’s results, Cornell described Fiddelke as “Day 1 ready to move into this role.”\n\nDuring the call, Fiddelke said that, while encouraged by the momentum in Target’s business, “we’re far from satisfied with our current performance.”\n\nThe incoming CEO said that Target needs to fully recapture its “merchandizing authority and signature style,” as well as consistently “elevate the guest experience,” both in stores and online. The company also needs to “more fully leverage technology” to help it move faster, he added.\n\nFor the quarter to Aug. 3, adjusted earnings per share, which excludes nonrecurring items, fell to $2.05 from $2.57 in the same period a year ago but topped the average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet of $2.04.\n\nTarget’s net sales declined 0.9% to $25.21 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $24.94 billion. Comparable sales, or sales in stores open at least 13 months, were down 1.9%. That beat expectations of a 2.9% decline.\n\nThe company said that its earnings reflected strong gains in expense management and efficiency, helping offset tariff-related and other cost pressures. The results marked a contrast with last quarter, when Target missed earnings expectations and cut its full-year profit outlook, citing a highly challenging retail environment.\n\nTarget’s results come as retail-sector earnings are being closely monitored for the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. On Tuesday, Home Depot Inc. \n\nSpeaking during a conference call, Cornell noted that Target is one of the largest importers in the country. “The prospect of higher tariffs meant we were facing some major financial and operational hurdles as we entered the year,” he said, according to a FactSet transcript. “This was further complicated by the multiple changes in tariff policy that had been announced and implemented.”\n\nHowever, Target is making progress in limiting the impact of tariffs, he said, adding that the company was focused on “limiting the impact on our pricing.” \n\n“And while we expect this year’s P&L will reflect some short-term pressure from tariffs, we expect to end the year in a healthy position and move beyond this period of uncertainty,” he said.\n\nTarget’s chief commercial officer, Rick Gomez, said the company is well-positioned relative to other retailers to handle the impact from tariffs thanks to its size and scale. “What we’ve said and continues to be our position is that we’ll take price as a last resort,” he added.\n\nFood and beverage net sales were $5.59 billion, up from $5.54 billion in the prior year’s quarter, while beauty sales rose to $3.40 billion from $3.38 billion. Hardlines revenue, which includes durable goods, was $3.52 billion, up from $3.32 billion.\n\nHowever, apparel and accessories sales declined to $4.09 billion from $4.26 billion, and home-furnishings and decor revenue fell to $3.66 billion from $3.91 billion. Sales of household essentials were $4.42 billion, down from $4.56 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, Target maintained its guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $7 to $9, after cutting it in May. The company also maintained its expectation of a low-single-digit decline in sales. \n\nIn a note, Roth analyst Bill Kirk described the challenges facing Target. “We continue to believe Target is poorly positioned,” he said, citing an unfavorable macroeconomic backdrop for discretionary spending. The analyst also pointed to “years of underinvestment behind price/technology” and the company’s ability to handle cost pressures associated with tariffs.\n\nFiddelke “will have to consider a [fiscal 2026] earnings rebase to try to ignite growth,” Kirk added.\n\nTarget shares are down 27.8% in 2025 through Tuesday, compared with the S&P 500 index’s \n\n“The CEO transition, while signaling change, has done little to restore investor confidence for now,” Ethan Feller, stock strategist at Zacks, said in an email. “We remain cautious on Target’s outlook.” \n\n“However,” Feller continued, “if the stock can hold above its April lows, it may signal that investors are willing to give the new CEO a chance and that valuation has become appealing enough on a risk-reward basis.”","summary":"Analysts say incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke “deserves a chance to prove himself,” though it could take time and more money for Target to get its charm back","url":"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/targets-stock-drops-as-long-time-ceo-brian-cornells-planned-departure-overshadows-an-earnings-beat-e42dc63c?mod=mw_rss_topstories","image":"https://images.mktw.net/im-39955121/social","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:21:00","author":"James Rogers","authors":["James Rogers"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.12},{"id":352718182,"title":"US backs Aust-led copper project despite tribe concerns","text":"Two of Australia's biggest mining companies have got the backing of US President Donald Trump for their planned joint development of an American copper project.\n\nBHP and Rio Tinto want to mine one of the largest copper deposits in North America, if they can get a hoped-for transfer of federal forest land in Arizona.\n\nThe transfer was scheduled for Tuesday local time.\n\nBut a panel of judges with the 9th US District Court of Appeals issued a temporary injunction on Monday following a last-minute appeal by a Native American tribe and environmentalists, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe land includes Oak Flat, an area used for centuries for religious ceremonies, prayer and gathering of medicinal plants by the San Carlos Apache people and other Native American tribes.\n\nAs the tribe celebrated the success of their appeal, US President Donald Trump said delaying the transfer by months would hurt people depending on new jobs and the nation's ability to access copper domestically, and blamed \"radical left activists\".\n\nMr Trump's post came after he met with the chief executives of BHP and Rio Tinto at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nRio boss Jakob Stausholm confirmed the meeting on his LinkedIn profile, saying the project was \"crucial\".\n\n\"It was great to be joined by BHP's CEO Mike Henry as we outlined the enormous potential of this project to provide domestic copper and other critical minerals for decades to come,\" he wrote.\n\nThe fight over Oak Flat has spanned two decades, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe latest legal battle centres on a required environmental review released by the US Forest Service earlier in 2025 and an appraisal of the land to be mined by Resolution Copper, which lies 96 kilometres east of Phoenix.\n\nBefore the land exchange can happen, the plaintiffs argued the federal government must prepare a comprehensive review that covers \"every aspect of the planned mine and all related infrastructure\".\n\nThey said the government had failed to consider the potential for a dam breach, pipeline failure and whether there was an emergency plan for a tailings storage area.\n\nThey also said the appraisal doesn't account for the value of the copper deposits that are at least 1.5km below the surface.\n\nThe court will hear arguments on the merits of the case later in 2025.\n\n\"This injunction comes in a desperate time of asking for miracles, all over the country and all over the world,\" Wendsler Nosie Sr, from the group Apache Stronghold, said in a statement posted on social media.\n\nMr Nosie, a former tribal chairman, described the land and water at Oak Flat as precious.\n\nResolution Copper -

It clearly and deliberately manufactures five more Republican seats in Congress because Trump himself knows the voters are rejecting his agenda.”\n\nRepublicans argued the map was created to improve political performance and would increase majority-Hispanic districts.\n\nThe approval by the Texas House of Representatives came at the urging of President Trump, who pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade revision of congressional maps to give his party a better chance at holding on to the US House of Representatives in next year’s election. The maps need to be approved by the state Senate and signed by Governor Greg Abbott before they become official.\n\nTexas state legislative Democrats delayed the vote by two weeks by fleeing the state earlier this month in protest, and were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday’s session.\n\nThe walkout ended when Democrats voluntarily returned on Monday, saying they had accomplished their goals of blocking a vote during a first special legislative session and persuading Democrats in other states to take retaliatory steps.\n\nThe approval of the Texas maps is likely to prompt California’s Democratic-controlled state Legislature to approve its own new House map aimed at creating five Democratic-leaning districts. Unlike in Texas, the California map would require approval by voters in November before it becomes official.\n\nThe California Legislature is scheduled to vote Thursday morning on three measures – to establish new congressional districts, authorise the redrawn map to replace the existing one and declare a November special election to seek voters’ approval.\n\nDemocrats have also pledged to sue to challenge the new Texas map and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\n\nOther Republican states – including Ohio, Florida, Indiana and Missouri – are moving forward with or considering their own redistricting efforts, as are Democratic states such as Maryland and Illinois.\n\nNationally, Republicans captured the 435-seat US House in 2024 by only three seats.

Missouri has a total of eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. For more than a decade, the makeup has been six Republican districts and two Democrat districts–Kansas City and St. Louis. “Our goal, if we move forward and there's no decision to move forward … is to make sure Missouri's values are reflected in Washington, D.C.,” Kehoe said at a press conference Tuesday announcing Catherine Hanaway as the next Missouri attorney general. “And I've said many times that I think our current speaker (Mike Johnson) does a very good job of matching the values of Missourians.” The move to redraw Missouri’s districts comes after calls from President Trump to have legislatures redistrict in order to give Republicans extra seats in the House. Texas has led the charge to remap its congressional districts, with as many as five Democrat districts redrawn to give Republicans a chance to win against incumbent Democrats. “I anticipate that as soon as Texas gets a map passed our governor is going to call an extraordinary session,” said State Rep. Ashley Aune, the leader of the Democrats in the Missouri House. Without committing either way, Kehoe said he believes it’s important to keep Johnson as speaker. Aune said she is hopeful Governor Kehoe won’t call one, but she believes he’s likely to call a special session to redraw congressional districts. “If we look at how Missourians voted in 2024, 58 percent of Missourians voted for Donald Trump,” said Aune, a state representative from Platte County. “But a 7-to-1 map proposes that 87% of our state would be represented by Republicans.”","summary":"Despite a flurry of speculation from both sides of the political aisle, Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe hasn’t signaled whether or not he’ll call a special session of the legislature to redraw congressional maps.","url":"https://fox2now.com/news/missouri/if-texas-passes-new-maps-democrat-leader-says-missouri-is-next/","image":"https://fox2now.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/05/AP25127702109909.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:10:58","author":"Mark Zinn","authors":["Mark Zinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":352715998,"title":"Ukraine's 'Iron General' refutes rumours he is 'quietly preparing to run for president' to replace Zelensky","text":"Ukraine's ambassador to the UK on Wednesday denied rumours he 'is quietly preparing a run for President' from his London HQ should peace break out.\n\nGeneral Valerii Zaluzhnyi's team were forced to play down the claims stating that 'there is no talk of any campaign headquarters'.\n\nIt followed posts by a journalist that 'his HQ is already active in London and recruitment is underway'.\n\nThey claimed sources had told them his campaign had 'effectively begun' after Volodymyr Zelensky told Donald Trump that elections may be coming soon.\n\nZaluzhnyi, known affectionately as the Iron General, would be a front-runner to defeat Mr Zelensky as he is remembered fondly for marshalling the heroic defence of Kyiv in 2022.\n\nHe was then replaced by Oleksandr Syrskyi as Commander-in-Chief and sidelined as Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK in July last year.\n\nFreelance journalist Katie Livingstone said sources had told her the Ukrainian opposition MP Viktoria Siumar would run any campaign with former BBC Ukraine reporter Oksana Torop handling his press.\n\nKyiv Post Correspondent Jason Jay Smart said he had confirmed the claims, adding: 'Sources indicate that he gave the go-ahead to his team, over a month ago, to start planning his campaign.'\n\nBut Ms Torop last night denied the rumours.

Angie Craig (D-Minn.)\n\n“It’s no secret that my side of the aisle would prefer not to see any sitting President — I won’t name one — participating in this market while a sitting president unless those assets are in a sealed trust,” Craig said on stage at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole on Wednesday.\n\nTrump, as well as his family, particularly Eric Trump, who was present at the venue during Craig’s appearance, have both built businesses in the industry, particularly since Trump retook office this past January.\n\nTrump has issued several meme coins tied to his name and his social media platform, Truth Social, has applied for several exchange-traded funds. Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, a mining company owned by Hut 8.\n\nCraig, who was joined by Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Wi.), spoke on the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act which the House passed with a massive bipartisan vote last month. The Senate Banking Committee is working on its own version of crypto market structure legislation.\n\nWhile the majority of Republicans are in favor of the bill, many Democrats remain skeptical, and a big reason for that is the Trump family’s involvement in the industry, Craig said.\n\n“The elephant in the room here is the President’s family’s participation in this marketplace and that’s a stumbling block to get more Democrats to support the legislation,” she said.\n\nCraig said that while there is some language in the legislation that limits this conflict of interest, a stronger tone is needed to convince some lawmakers.\n\n“If we could find some language that would allow or prevent conflicts of interest to occur, from our perspective, I think you would see a whole lot more Democrats support it,” she said.\n\nCraig is the ranking member on the House Agriculture Committee, meaning she is the leading Democrat on that committee. This isn't the first time she's referenced the Trump family's crypto tie-ups — during a committee hearing in June on the Clarity Act, she said his crypto actions were \"making this debate more difficult\" and suggested that Congress should add restrictions on how the U.S. president can trade in markets overseen by the CFTC, including crypto.Despite her comments, Craig still voted to advance the Clarity Act without any such language being added.\n\nJoin the crypto policy conversation Sept. 10 in D.C. — Register now for CoinDesk: Policy & Regulation.","summary":"A provision addressing conflicts of interest would likely bolster Dem support for crypto market structure legislation, Angie Craig said.","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/20/trump-s-crypto-conflicts-of-interest-are-blocking-dem-legislation-support-top-lawmaker-says","image":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a47153b115d6325103a66bbbb11e5a20db430c3a-2237x1678.jpg?auto=format","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-20 23:03:47","author":"Helene Braun","authors":["Helene Braun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":352716002,"title":"Ukraine peace talks are in disarray as Russia and China demand a say on security guarantees","text":"Ukraine peace talks were in disarray on Wednesday after Russia effectively demanded Moscow and Beijing get a veto on any security guarantees.\n\nUS Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said Vladimir Putin had agreed to 'game-changing Article 5-like protections' for Kyiv when they met in Alaska last Friday.\n\nEuropean leaders raced to build on the momentum and hammer out the details – with Britain and France considering putting boots on the ground while America would protect the skies.\n\nBut yesterday serious questions arose over what exactly Mr Witkoff had secured as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow must be part of the security guarantees.\n\nPutin's man also said these 'should be provided on an equal basis with the participation of countries such as China, the United States, the UK and France'.\n\nLavrov added: 'I'm sure in the West they understand that seriously discussing security issues without Russia is a utopia, it's a road to nowhere.'\n\nHe claimed the terms are based on those Moscow tried to force Kyiv into signing in Istanbul in April 2022, two months after their invasion. Those terms effectively meant none of the guarantors would be allowed to defend Ukraine from Russia unless they all agreed, including China and Russia.\n\nLavrov took aim at what he called Europe's 'clumsy attempts to change the position of the US President' in recent days.\n\nHe said: 'We cannot agree with the fact that it is now proposed to resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation.

Washingtonians are in agreement: they’re officially sick of it.\n\nWednesday dawned in the nation’s capital with news of more chaos in the District of Columbia, this time indisputably caused by Trump’s executive order — which the administration is increasingly finding it hard to prove is not a publicity stunt. More and more National Guard troops pour into the city from around the country, though arrests aren’t going up, and most of the troops appear to be standing around snapping photos with tourists.\n\nIn the early morning hours, an armored, mine-resistant tactical vehicle slammed into the side of a civilian vehicle, sending one person to the hospital. The crash occurred downtown, where federal agents and National Guard troops are increasingly piling up in high-traffic tourist areas.\n\nA morning report from Fox 5 quoted residents in the higher-crime area of Anacostia, in the city’s southeast, saying that law enforcement resources weren’t reaching them. Meanwhile, video after video shows bored federal agents patrolling luxury shopping and dining areas, or tourist destinations like the Washington Monument.\n\nAs Vice President J.D. Vance and Trump adviser Stephen Miller arrived at a Shake Shack at Union Station — one of those low-crime areas where Guard troops have milled around aimlessly — for a meet-and-greet with a few visiting troops on Wednesday, the pair were loudly heckled by locals.\n\nThen they bizarrely accused the hecklers of having come from out of town to mock them.\n\nAround the city, graffiti appeared honoring a resident arrested after angrily tossing a Subway sandwich at federal law enforcement agents, a since-fired DOJ employee who has become a folk hero around town.\n\n“I’ll tell you, a couple of years ago, when I brought my kids here, they were being screamed at by violent vagrants, and it was scaring the hell out of my kids,” Vance said. He denied the validity of a comment from a reporter referring to the area as low crime, and again cited those “vagrants” as evidence during his Q&A.\n\nUnion Station is a major arrival point for many tourists in the capital and for many years has struggled with the attraction that the spacious transit center and shopping mall’s public facilities provided for homeless D.C. residents. An encampment once existed a few steps from the station’s front doors, and inside the station benches and other public amenities were removed in order to dissuade loitering. \n\nThe Covid pandemic, which accelerated housing insecurity, also led to closures of Union Station businesses which traded reasons for their misfortune including a rise in homeless activity around the station.\n\nBut vagrancy by itself is not a crime, and Vance’s comments, combined with the increase in encampment sweeps around the city the past few days, suggest that Trump’s crime-fighting campaign is actually a beautification campaign meant to push an aesthetic that isn’t necessarily felt by D.C. residents with roots in the city.\n\nPolling shows that Americans who call the city home agree. A resounding eight in 10 D.C. residents told Washington Post pollsters in a survey released Wednesday that they opposed the federal takeover of the city, which is now being fought in the courts as city leaders try to retain control of the Metropolitan Police Department. \n\nA similar share, 78 percent, said that they felt extremely or somewhat safe in their own neighborhoods.\n\nWhile arrests aren’t surging and city residents don’t say they feel safer, it’s very clear which community is being impacted the most. U.S. Park Police officials told the New York Post on Wednesday that the agency has cleared 75 homeless encampments around the city in just the short period since Trump announced his takeover.\n\nWashington social media channels remain alight with reports of activity from ICE and other federal agencies. Checkpoints have repeatedly been swarmed by hundreds of residents, shouting angrily, until law enforcement agencies pack up and leave. Week two of the takeover also coincided with DC’s annual summer Restaurant Week, though dining spots around the city report that the presence of the Guard and federal agents are hurting business as reservations plunged year-over-year.\n\nWhile city leaders are largely paralyzed as they await decisions in the courts, there are already clear signs that this episode could backfire for the president.\n\nNews channels and social media platforms continue to spread images and video depicting an occupied American city clearly in conflict with its new guests. \n\nThe unpopularity of Trump’s takeover could quickly become an issue in the Virginia governor’s race, where a conservative diehard is running against a centrist Democrat with strong DC ties.\n\nIt’s also energized the progressive left, long dormant in city politics thanks to the populations of federal workers and transplants who have elected center-left leadership for years. On Tuesday evening, several hundred people attended the campaign launch of a democratic socialist candidate running for city council, Aparna Raj.\n\nIn the end, Donald Trump may accomplish little more than juicing up the American left’s will to fight back.","summary":"Trump has utterly failed to win over D.C. residents, who aren’t convinced his takeover is anything but a series of photo ops, writes

in More Efficient Intelligence Community","text":"McLean, VIRGINIA — Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Tulsi Gabbard is slashing her department’s staff and streamlining “redundant” projects in order to save money, “restore trust” in the U.S. intelligence community, and to continue rooting out the “weaponization” of intelligence.\n\nSenior ODNI officials told Breitbart News of the transformation, dubbed “ODNI 2.0,” explaining that a wave of downsizing began Wednesday afternoon, with an emphasis on shutting down the Foreign Malign Influence Center (FMIC). \n\nThe FMIC, which houses the Election Threats Executive (ETE), coordinated with Big Tech companies including Twitter (now X) and Facebook shortly before the former removed the New York Post’s October 2020 Hunter Biden laptop story from its platform, officials said. \n\nThe center was “turned against the American people,” and former President Joe Biden “used it against conservatives and gun owners,” one senior ODNI adviser explained. \n\nThe FMIC was also found to be “redundant” because the National Intelligence Council and National Counterintelligence and Security Center already monitor efforts by foreign entities to influence the American public, officials added.\n\nThere were around 2,000 ODNI personnel when President Donald Trump re-entered office and tapped Gabbard to head the agency, and there has already been a 30 percent slash in staffers. \n\nAfter Wednesday, the ends of entire “redundant” centers like the FMIC, the National Intelligence University (NIU), National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center (NCBC), Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), and others will result in a nearly 50 percent decrease in staffing since Gabbard became director. \n\n“If everything’s on fire and everything’s a priority, then nothing is,” an official said, explaining that ODNI will cut “a lot of red tape” that “stops us from being elite and agile.”\n\nThe latest round of ODNI layoffs will save taxpayers $700 million, officials added. \n\nWhile some personnel will be out of a job, others will return back to their “home agencies,” including the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nIn closing the NIU, which officials said is “narrow in scope” and does not require its own university, Gabbard has coordinated with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to integrate students into his department’s National Defense University (NDU).\n\nA joint letter to students from Gabbard and Hegseth obtained by Breitbart News reads, “This effort aligns with President Trump’s focus on increasing efficiencies across the government and will enhance the quality of our educational programs.”\n\n“You will be in good hands under DOD NDU leadership,” the letter added.\n\nWhile the prospect of shutting down the ODNI, established in response to September 11 attacks, was discussed during Gabbard’s Senate confirmation hearings, it was ultimately decided to let her run the agency and make revisions as she saw fit. \n\n“Departments and agencies left to their own devices will create things like the Russia hoax,” one official said, referring to Gabbard’s recent declassification of documents revealing that the Obama administration orchestrated the narrative that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. \n\nGabbard briefed Trump in the Oval Office on ODNI 2.0 about two weeks ago, coming out of the meeting with his “green light.”\n\n“All of [Trump’s] priorities reflected in this,” an official said of the ODNI’s transformative plans. \n\nOther than eliminating centers that had been weaponized and wrapped in red tape, the ODNI is also set to make “investments” in “prioritizing artificial intelligence (AI), quantum, and technological capabilities,” officials stated. \n\nThe intelligence community should “ebb and flow” with the country’s needs, one adviser pointed out. \n\nGabbard’s recent declassifications and revocation of security clearances of “current and former intelligence professionals who have abused the public trust by politicizing and manipulating intelligence” have all been aimed at “restoring trust in the intelligence community.”\n\nThe DNI informed her workforce of the changes being made in a letter that began with “Aloha.”\n\n“To those transitioning to new opportunities, thank you for your service and dedication,” an excerpt of the letter obtained by Breitbart News states. “We deeply empathize with the disruption this may cause and are committed to supporting you through this process with options and resources to aid your next steps.”\n\nIn announcing the beginning of ODNI 2.0, Gabbard wants all other intelligence agencies to follow in similar fashion. \n\n“We’re holding those other agencies accountable,” an official said, noting that Gabbard “wanted to lead by example.”\n\nGabbard re-emphasized the purpose of ODNI 2.0 in a press release.\n\n“Over the last 20 years, ODNI has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power, unauthorized leaks of classified intelligence, and politicized weaponization of intelligence,” the DNI said. “ODNI and the IC must make serious changes to fulfill its responsibility to the American people and the US Constitution by focusing on our core mission: find the truth and provide objective, unbiased, timely intelligence to the

It can't just be the heads of state being in lockstep for a few days at a time,\" she said.\"Instead, they have to be ready to actually move and to show to Trump, 'We have everything ready; we just need x from you to make this work.'\"Trump, however, could also authorize a much smaller air deployment, such as one focused on reconnaissance that would see limited numbers of US planes in the Ukrainian skies.\"President Trump said some things in his meetings with the European leaders and Zelensky and I am betting a huge sum of money that there are people around Trump who are going to spend a lot of time walking that back,\" said Debra Cagan, a former senior US policymaker now at the Atlantic Council.\"What I mean by that is that they're going to try a very de minimis approach to security guarantees, to do as little as possible to carry that out,\" she said.She said that any successful strategy needed to have components on land and air as well as sea, including keeping the crucial Black Sea ports open for Ukraine.Trump retains a strong hold on the Republican Party, but has already seen some dissent within his hard-right base, which backed him in part for his dismissive attitude to foreign involvement.Outspoken Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who earlier criticized Trump for bombing Iran, said she believed voters would be \"appalled\" by more support for Ukraine as they struggle with day-to-day concerns.\"America is broke,\" she told conservative host Megyn Kelly. \"At some point we have to start saying no to the rest of the world.\"Trump-aligned Senator Tommy Tuberville said it would be an \"impossible sell\" to voters still shaken by the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to start another long-term US military commitment, according to The Hill newspaper.Trump, however, has tried hard to portray the war as belonging to Biden and has spoken openly of his desire for the Nobel Peace Prize.\"He could probably sell to his base that this is about America keeping peace and not about America making war,\" Berzina said.","summary":"Donald Trump's newfound if vague willingness to entertain security guarantees for Ukraine could be a game-changer,

capital needs a bigger fix","text":"Last week President Donald Trump declared war on crime in Washington, DC, when he sent in the National Guard and federalized the district’s police force for the 30-day period allowable under the DC Home Rule Act.\n\nTrump’s motives were good: He’s right that it’s shameful our national capital has become one of our most dangerous cities.\n\nHe’s also right that DC’s crime epidemic hurts America’s competitiveness and prestige.\n\nBut the president’s month-long law enforcement takeover won’t fix that problem — because the problem is not, at its core, bad law enforcement.\n\nIt’s the fact that DC’s government has for decades now shown itself incapable of even the most basic level of public administration.\n\nBlame it, too, on Congress, which transferred control over the district to the city’s own elected government in the Home Rule Act of 1973 — but has refused to admit its mistake and reverse course.\n\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives remain aloof from the problems they created, even as federal staffers, visitors and on occasion their own members are routinely harassed and attacked by criminals on the streets and in their homes.\n\nBut the US Constitution stipulates that DC is a national public resource, not a self-governing city like any other.\n\nUnder the Constitution, it is Congress’s responsibility to competently administrate it — and Congress has abdicated that responsibility.\n\nWhen the 30-day takeover period is up (assuming Congress does not renew his privileges), Trump will turn the keys back over to a capital city government that can’t staff a police force, can’t keep young violent offenders off the streets and can’t run a functioning crime lab.\n\nDistrict officials can’t claim to have reduced crime without cooking the books, and can’t protect visiting diplomats from being shot\n\nAnd they’re not just failing at law enforcement: DC can’t keep its public schools out of the basement of national performance rankings, and can’t prevent huge homeless encampments from forming while thousands of district-owned public housing units go unoccupied.\n\nThe only possible solution to such a crisis of mismanagement is to overturn the law that gave home rule to DC and start over from scratch.\n\nAnd if President Trump is serious about tackling the district’s dysfunction, he should do just that.\n\nFirst, the president should build up some goodwill by ending his police federalization and troop occupation, preferably earlier than planned.\n\nNo need to make excuses; he can simply explain that he’s come to realize DC’s dysfunction runs far deeper than anything a few extra officers on the streets can solve.\n\nThen he and Republican leadership should begin meeting with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to generate support for Home Rule repeal.\n\nWhile Trump seems to think the entire district is dead set against him, this is incorrect: Many residents, while no fans of the president, are fed up with not being able to safely walk their dogs at night.\n\nLongtime Democratic members of Congress have personally experienced the city’s dangers for many years, and they all know the ordeal of their colleague Angie Craig (D-Minn.), who was assaulted in her apartment building’s elevator just two years ago.\n\nIf Trump were to approach this issue firmly but collaboratively, he would find the water warmer than he thinks.\n\nLegally, the argument is not a hard sell.\n\nArticle 1, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress shall have “exclusive legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the federal district.\n\nCongress has given a 50-year trial to the notion of delegating its power to the people of DC, and that trial has unequivocally failed to produce a district that serves the interests of the federal government, the American people, or the residents themselves.\n\nTherefore, we should return to rule by Congress, as the Constitution mandates.\n\nDoing so would require a simple act of Congress, passed by both parties, that overturns the 1973 law and dismisses DC’s elected representatives.\n\nA third section of the new law should establish a congressional committee to appoint exemplary city managers from cities around United States to reconstitute a competent DC government.\n\nIn many American cities, like Madison, Wis., Phoenix, Ariz., and Wichita, Kan., elected officials appoint professional administrators to oversee day-to-day municipal operations.\n\nWashington, DC, should do the same — with Congress taking ultimate responsibility.\n\nSome on the left will bemoan the reversal of Home Rule as yet another federal assault on our democracy.\n\nBut the District of Columbia was never intended by the Founders to be a self-governing state.\n\nIt was intended to serve the interests of the country as a whole, by providing a safe and orderly place for public administration.\n\nReturning DC’s governing prerogative to the people of America, not the district itself, will take us one step closer to being the republic the Founders envisioned.\n\nJohn Masko is a journalist specializing in business and
