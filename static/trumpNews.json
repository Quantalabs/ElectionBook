The first concerned his efforts to overturn the result of the previous election, which he lost to Joe Biden. The second focused on his retention of sensitive government documents after leaving office.\n\nBoth teams were led by special counsel Jack Smith, who resigned before Mr Trump took office earlier this month. About 40 lawyers, in total, took part; it is unclear precisely how many of them are now unemployed.\n\nThe fired staff learned of their fate via a letter from Mr McHenry.\n\n“The proper functioning of government critically depends on the trust superior officials place in their subordinates,” he noted.\n\n“I do not believe that the leadership of the department can trust you to assist in implementing the President’s agenda faithfully.”\n\nTop prosecutor still ‘stands behind’ Trump cases\n\nOn his way out the door, Mr Smith delivered his team’s final report into Mr Trump’s conduct, significant parts of which have been released after attempts, from the President’s legal team, to keep the whole thing out of public view.\n\nThe report is divided into two volumes, each dealing with one of the cases.\n\nMr Smith stressed his belief that the evidence in both cases was sufficiently strong to convict Mr Trump, if either of them had gone to trial. However, Mr Trump’s return to office made it impossible for prosecutors to move forward.\n\n“While I relied greatly on the counsel, judgment, and advice of our team, I want it to be\n\nclear that the ultimate decision to bring charges against Mr Trump was mine,” Mr Smith wrote in the report’s initial pages.\n\n“It is a decision I stand behind fully. To have done otherwise on the facts developed during our work would have been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor and a public servant.\n\n“It is equally important for me to make clear that nobody within the Department of Justice\n\never sought to interfere with, or improperly influence, my prosecutorial decision making.\n\n“To all who know me well, the claim from Mr Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable.\n\n“While we were not able to bring the cases we charged to trial, I believe the fact that our team stood up for the rule of law matters. I believe the example our team set for others to fight for justice without regard for the personal costs matters.”\n\nThe election interference case\n\nVolume one of the report concerns Mr Trump’s alleged “efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power” after he lost in 2020.\n\nMr Biden won that election in early November, but was not inaugurated until mid-January. During the intervening months Mr Trump tried, in various ways, to engineer a way to remain in power.\n\nHe launched more than 60 lawsuits in both state and federal court, alleging widespread voter fraud and seeking to change or nullify the results.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, for example, the outgoing president’s legal team sought to throw out large swathes of votes from populous, and heavily Democratic, Philadelphia. A similar pattern was repeated across the other key swing states where Mr Trump had lost.\n\nNone of these cases went anywhere. Judges (including, we should note, several conservative judges appointed by Mr Trump himself) overwhelmingly found them to be baseless or, at best, based on extraordinarily thin evidence.\n\nIn some instances, to Mr Trump’s immense chagrin, his lawyers failed to establish that they had standing – that they had a right, under the law, to even bring the case in question before the court. If a plaintiff doesn’t have that right, the case fails without clearing even the first hurdle, and everything else becomes irrelevant.\n\nThat happened repeatedly to Mr Trump, leading to his favoured excuse for the cases being thrown out en masse: that the evidence was on his side but all these judges, for presumably corrupt or biased reasons, had refused to even listen to it.\n\nIn truth, the Trump legal team received a great many opportunities to put forward its evidence, and couldn’t offer anything substantive.\n\nStill, that’s all legal. Mr Smith’s team was not going after Mr Trump for filing spurious lawsuits, but for his other actions in the post-election period, which it felt were illegal.\n\n“When it became clear that Mr Trump had lost the election and that lawful means of challenging the election results had failed, he resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power,” the special counsel alleged in his report.\n\n“This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and his own vice president, to act in contravention of their oaths and to instead advance Mr Trump’s personal interests; and on January 6, 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters’ violence to further delay it.”\n\nThe final iteration of Mr Trump’s scheme, which culminated in the Capitol riot, involved convincing his vice president Mike Pence, who in his role as president of the Senate presided over the certification of Mr Biden’s win, to unilaterally reject the results from certain states.\n\nMr Pence did not have the power to do this, as he himself noted at the time. Consider: if that power did exist, then this time around Kamala Harris could have thrown out the results from a few key states she had lost, stopping Congress from certifying her own defeat to Mr Trump.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Trump insisted Mr Pence was wrong and didn’t have the necessary “courage” to act, which is why you heard rioters chanting about hanging him. They believed he had betrayed the president.\n\nThe next stage of the plan, once some states’ results were tossed, would have seen to send an alternative slate of electors for each, giving their electoral votes to Mr Trump instead.\n\nThe Smith team alleged this whole scheme was illegal, including Mr Trump’s part in it.\n\nThe government documents case\n\nVolume two of the report is not publicly available; its release has been blocked by a federal judge on the basis that it could prejudice multiple defendants.\n\nWe do, however, know the basic facts at issue.\n\nWhen he left office after his first term, Mr Trump took batches of government documents, some of them highly classified, and stored them at his personal residences in Florida and New Jersey. Prosecutors alleged he had initially rebuffed the government’s attempts to retrieve these documents, then that he’d lied, claiming he had returned all of them when he actually hadn’t.\n\nThe saga exploded into controversy when the FBI raided Mr Trump’s Florida residence, the Mar-a-Lago resort, in search of the remaining documents.\n\nIn his response to the case, Mr Trump repeatedly insisted the documents were his personal property, meaning he had every right to keep them. He also claimed to have used his power as president to declassify them before taking them from the White House, though no evidence existed that such an order had ever been issued.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, maintained that the documents were government property, and that as a private citizen Mr Trump was in possession of them illegally.\n\nTheir indictment alleged Mr Trump failed to return the documents when repeatedly asked, showed some of them to people who lacked the necessary security clearances, defied a subpoena and lied to investigators.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case last year, ruling that Mr Smith’s appointment as special counsel had violated a clause of the US Constitution, and therefore the whole prosecution was invalid.\n\nThe government was in the process of appealing when Mr Trump won the election. Obviously the case against him will now go nowhere.","summary":"More than a dozen people have been fired abruptly in a moment of sweet vengeance Donald Trump had been craving for years.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/justice-department-fires-lawyers-who-worked-on-investigations-into-donald-trump/news-story/6e5b48c9f989826a6faee7fb3ac9559f?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/158b57f96a4094ec3a5c8f808cb9c237","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 01:00:21","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":284553044,"title":"Taiwanese premier calls to roll back ‘absolutely irrational’ military costs freeze","text":"Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai has called for a rollback of “irrational” freezes on the 2025 defence budget, warning of a serious impact on the island’s security.\nHe also accused the opposition of “prioritising partisan interests”.\nTaiwan’s opposition-dominated legislature last week approved a total government budget of NT$2.9 trillion (US$88.2 billion) for the year ahead – a record NT$207.5 billion or nearly 7 per cent less than the originally proposed amount.\nA coalition of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People’s Party also froze a record NT$160.7 billion in government expenditure.\nIn the defence budget, the coalition cut NT$8.4 billion from the proposed NT$647 billion. They also froze NT$90 billion in military expenses, including NT$74.4 billion in operational costs.\nCho, who belongs to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said the operational expenses freeze was “absolutely irrational”.\nOpposition lawmakers were putting partisan matters over Taiwan’s security, he alleged on an online talk show that aired on Sunday night. The frozen funds are crucial for fuel replenishment, logistical supplies, overseas travel and training, he added.\n\n“We need to send our pilots and personnel abroad to acquire advanced military knowledge, receive specialised training, and attend international forums,” Cho said, emphasising that withholding such funds would harm Taiwan’s defence preparedness.\nCho also said that his cabinet would request the legislature to reconsider the overall budget cuts and freezes on February 3 – the first working day after the Lunar New Year holiday.\n“Resolving the NT$74.4 billion in frozen [operational] funds is a top priority,” he said.\nCho’s comments on Sunday echoed those he made at a press conference last week, when he warned that the budget moves would severely impact Taiwan’s combat readiness and military modernisation.\nThe defence budget cut and NT$90 billion freeze, particularly relating to operational expenses, could “delay modernisation efforts, compromise the safety of service members, and weaken operational readiness”, he had warned last Wednesday.\nThe cuts are viewed as particularly alarming in the face of growing military pressure from Beijing. DPP lawmakers have also pointed to potential challenges posed by US President Donald Trump, who said on the campaign trail that Taiwan was not doing enough for its defence and needed to allocate 10 per cent of its GDP to the military budget.\n\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary. The United States, like most countries, does not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but it is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and committed to arming it for defence.\nKMT legislators defending the NT$8.4 billion cut argued that it targeted “excessive and wasteful” military spending. They also downplayed concerns over the frozen funds.\n“Freezing funds is not equivalent to cutting them. As long as the defence ministry submits concrete reports and plans to the legislature, the funds can be unfrozen and utilised without any impact,” KMT legislator Lee Yen-hsiu said.\nLee also voiced support for Taiwan’s procurement of advanced defensive weapons from the US, emphasising that such purchases were funded through “special budgets” that were largely separate from the annual budget.","summary":"Premier Cho Jung-tai criticises Taiwan’s opposition-led legislature over defence budget cuts and NT$90 billion military costs freeze.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3296486/taiwanese-premier-calls-roll-back-absolutely-irrational-military-costs-freeze","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/27/2d9b1cb6-1435-4152-adb2-0135e482b0f0_5e1c4b4c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 01:00:12","author":"Lawrence Chung","authors":["Lawrence Chung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":284552204,"title":"Donald Trump announces US Iron Dome, transgender military change at GOP Members of Congress retreat in Florida","text":"The West Australian\n\nCamera IconPresident Donald Trump has announced a US Iron Dome and the removal of ‘transgender ideology’ from the US armed forces.

Reshaping America: Seven Key Changes in One Week”","text":"In his first week in the Oval Office, Donald Trump wasted no time before taking action, swiftly issuing a series of executive orders shortly after being inaugurated.\n\nDuring the initial seven days of his renewed presidency, Trump made significant changes to the United States by implementing strict measures on immigration, repealing laws instituted by Joe Biden, and eliminating obstacles to the advancement of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe president commenced his second term with a flurry of executive orders, rescinding approximately 80 of Biden’s prominent laws during his celebratory rally in Washington DC on Inauguration Day.\n\nTrump ordered federal workers to return to the office full-time and pardoned the sentences of those convicted in the attack on the Capitol in January 2021.\n\nTo further dismantle the Biden regime, Trump signed an executive order helping states get lethal injection drugs for executions.\n\nBiden temporarily paused federal executions in 2021 and commuted 37 death row sentences to life in prison just before Christmas.\n\nGENDER LAWS\n\nTrump also repealed several Biden-era rules regarding equity and LGBTQ rights, including laws preventing government discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.\n\nHe signed an order declaring the US government would only acknowledge a person’s sex assigned at birth.\n\nThe move forces the government to only recognize male or female on official documents, meaning Americans can’t mark “other” or “X” on federal forms anymore.\n\nKILLING DEI\n\nTrump also signed an executive order gutting all diversity, equality, and inclusion government programs within 60 days.\n\nDEI initiatives set out to promote fair treatment of underrepresented groups\n\nHe also removed protections for transgender troops as he’s expected to ban them from serving in the military.\n\nINTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS\n\nHours after being sworn in, Trump made major changes to America’s international agreements by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.\n\nHe also pulled out of the World Health Organization in a move condemned by scientists and health experts.\n\nIt’s the second time in less than five years that Trump has taken the US out of the organization, which he blasted as “misleading” in 2020.\n\nIMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN\n\nTrump ramped up his crackdown on undocumented immigrants by declaring a national emergency on the US-Mexico border as soon as he took office.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement carried out raids in at least 12 cities across the US on Sunday and said officers made 956 arrests, marking the largest number of single-day arrests.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan vowed arrests and deportations will “steadily increase.”\n\n“Right now, it’s concentrating on public safety threats, national security threats,” Homan told ABC News’ This Week.\n\n“That’s a smaller population.”\n\nTHREATENING COLOMBIA\n\nTrump showed immigration as a major priority for his administration by also threatening tariffs and sanctions on Colombia to punish the nation for refusing to accept military jets carrying deportees.\n\nHe revealed his plan to impose a 25% tariff on Colombian imports and immediately revoke the visas of government officials if they didn’t accept migrants.\n\nThe threat worked, forcing Colombia to accept the migrants after Colombian President Gustavo Petro previously stopped two US military aircraft from landing in the country on Sunday.\n\nAfter Colombia caved, Trump posted a defiant AI picture on Truth Social to celebrate.\n\nAI DOMINANCE\n\nFollowing his inauguration, Trump quickly moved to peel back a 2023 executive order that put limits on artificial intelligence.\n\nOn Thursday, he issued an executive order mandating his staff to find a policy plan to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance.”\n\nHe’s now championing a $500 billion project called StarGate with AI leaders OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle with hopes of curing cancer and creating thousands of jobs.\n\n“These world-leading technology giants are announcing the formation of Stargate,” Trump said.\n\n“So put that name down in your books, because I think you’re going to hear a lot about it in the future — a new American company that will invest $500 billion at least in AI infrastructure in the United States.”\n\nSoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said the order marked “the beginning of the Golden Age of America.”\n\n“Artificial superintelligence will come to solve the issues that mankind never, ever have thought that we could solve,” he added.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Trump’s executive orders were just beginning as he’s set to sign off on a nationwide missile defense system.\n\nThe plan would create an American version of Israel’s Iron Dome shield, which shoots down incoming threats like drones.\n\n“Today, there are more executive orders coming that we fully support,” Hegseth told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday.\n\n“On removing DEI inside the Pentagon, reinstating troops who were pushed out because of COVID mandates, Iron Dome for America,” he said.\n\n“This is happening quickly.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn his first week in the Oval Office, Donald Trump wasted no&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;How Trump&#8217;s Actions Are

stock market value drop","text":"Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17% on Monday, erasing approximately $589 billion from its market capitalization and marking the largest single-day loss in US corporate history. The sharp decline follows concerns over mounting competition from the Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek.\n\nThe selloff was part of a broader tech downturn that saw the Nasdaq Composite fall 3.1%, its worst day since December. Nvidia shares closed at $118.58, marking their most significant drop since March 2020 during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Monday’s plunge also dethroned Nvidia as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, at $2.9 trillion, pushing it back to third place behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nThe downturn was triggered by DeepSeek’s launch of an open-source R1 model, which the company claims was trained in just two months at a fraction of the cost required by US-based firms like OpenAI. This development has raised questions about the sustainability of high AI-related spending, particularly on Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) that dominate the AI chip market.\n\nNvidia itself described DeepSeek’s innovation as “an excellent AI advancement,” but argued that it expects demand for its chips to increase rather than diminish. “Inference requires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networking,” a company spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBeyond Nvidia, the selloff extended to other tech and semiconductor companies. Broadcom saw its stock drop 17%, wiping out $200 billion in market value. Data center companies heavily reliant on Nvidia’s chips, such as Oracle, Dell, and Super Micro Computer, also experienced sharp declines of at least 8.7%.\n\nOracle’s chairman, Larry Ellison, saw his net worth fall by $27.6 billion, the most among affected billionaires, according to Forbes. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s personal fortune dropped by $21 billion, ranking as the second-largest personal loss.\n\nThe AI-fueled stock surge of the past two years has made companies like Nvidia central to market confidence. Nvidia’s shares soared 239% in 2023 alone, driven by demand from tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon.\n\nThe latest development comes amid growing tensions in the AI race between the US and China. Despite US export restrictions on high-end chips, DeepSeek has managed to deliver competitive performance compared to OpenAI’s o1, relying on lower-spec GPUs.\n\nUS policymakers have taken note of the competition. Venture capitalist David Sacks, who was appointed as the White House’s AI and crypto advisor under President Donald Trump, called for renewed focus on innovation to counteract China’s advancements.\n\n“DeepSeek’s success shows that the AI race will be very competitive,” Sacks wrote on X, urging the US to avoid complacency. Another billionaire venture capitalist, Marc Andreessen, has described DeepSeek’s emergence as a “Sputnik moment” for American tech.","summary":"Nvidia’s stock plummeted 17% on Monday, erasing approximately $589 billion from its market capitalization \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/business/611743-nvidia-ai-stock-market-drop/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/67982afd20302754f401ff6e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:55:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":284550474,"title":"Google Renames the Gulf of Mexico After Trump’s Executive Order","text":"Google is saying goodbye to the Gulf of Mexico.

Others involved in the ERGs said they pre-emptively shut down their groups themselves or removed the email distribution lists out of fear that any potential noncompliance with the directive could threaten their jobs. \n\nThe impact, workers say, has been devastating and it’s already begun to change the work environment for the worse. \n\n“I’ve been here for four years, and in that time, we’ve made progress to help employees just have a better lived work experience,” said one Treasury Department employee who belongs to an LGBTQ-related ERG but requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “Four years later in the snap of fingers, our work is being completely undone. … It’s one step forward, two steps back. I feel despair at the moment.” \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the move was an example of “promises made, promises kept.”\n\n“President Trump campaigned on ending the scourge of DEI from our federal government and returning America to a merit based society where people are hired based on their skills, not for the color of their skin,” she said. “This is another win for Americans of all races, religions, and creeds.”\n\nChanges to the ERGs began shortly after Trump’s first day in office last week, during which he signed the executive order taking aim at DEI programs, which he has labeled as an example of “immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” While the administration has begun to put on leave federal employees whose work is classified under “DEI,” those who spoke to NBC News said they were shocked that the directive has also extended to their voluntary groups, many of which operate socially and offer a space for people to connect, make friendships and network. \n\nA federal employee who works at a science and technology-related organization, who also requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, said the resource group activities at her agency were paused last week, and a happy hour and meeting were removed from her calendar. Additionally, she said a volunteer musical group that was part of the Hispanic ERG was told by group leadership that it could no longer perform at any official company events. \n\nIn the past, the group made appearances at company parties, retirement celebrations and more. Now, its ability to even practice on federal property is up in the air, she said. It stings, she said, as the ERGs were much more than just a collection of people with common backgrounds, and many members of the groups devoted some of their personal time to attend events, organize celebrations and more. \n\n“They were a really strong signal to the workforce that they believed that belonging was an important part of your job satisfaction and your ability to bring your full self to work,” she said of the groups. “You felt like you belonged there.” \n\nAnother worker at a different federal agency who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation and led an LGBTQ-related resource group said that he has “never been more scared at work.” He mentioned that he had been instructed last week to take down his ERG’s internal website immediately. But upon attempting to do so, he said, he discovered that the page had already been scrubbed, and it now populates an “access denied” message. \n\nThe instructions have been alarming as his ERG has never been used to “promote or push any sort of policy,” the worker said. He explained that the group typically convenes for outings like baseball games, or monthly Zoom calls to catch up. \n\n“There are affinity groups for parents of mentally disabled or physically disabled children. It provides the ability for people to meet like people, to share positions in life and to identify struggles and ways to get over the struggles,” he said. \n\nThe experience has left him anxious for what’s to come, the worker said. He explained that he and his fellow group members have decided to disband the ERG and get rid of the distribution lists, which they fear could be used to target employees in the future. The move was also in light of a recent memo from the Office of Personnel Management that in part instructed agency and department heads to provide lists of DEI offices in their divisions and employees. \n\n“We went ahead and deleted everything else, because we don’t want people to be swept up in becoming part of a list,” the worker said. “That was a really sad step — having to pull the trigger ourselves and just end up deleting our entire existence.” \n\nThe Treasury Department employee said that members the LGBTQ-related ERG have so far not been given official guidance on the group. But the employee, who uses they/them pronouns, said they have been “highly encouraged” by some at the department to move the group’s activities to private, friend-to-friend communications. They said they have also taken down their email distribution lists out of an abundance of caution.\n\nThe worker, who mentioned they witnessed the removal of a poster entitled, “Employment Discrimination is Illegal,” said that many have likened the recent changes to DEI-related programs and the ERGs to a potential new Lavender Scare, in which thousands of gay employees were fired or pushed to resign from the federal workforce from the 1940s through the 1960s because of their sexuality. \n\n“Everyone is very nervous that even being out at work will result in being perceived as a ‘DEI hire’ and being targeted for removal and not knowing if they were let go because of the nature of their work or because they are LGBT,” they said. \n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to NBC News’ request for comment. \n\nThe changes across ERGs are among a deluge of new directives affecting the federal government under the Trump administration. Not only has the president ordered DEI offices and programs to shut down, but he also issued a separate order directing the Federal Aviation Administration to end DEI efforts, claiming that these initiatives led to those with “‘severe intellectual’ disabilities, psychiatric issues, and complete paralysis” to be hired over other individuals. And in an email obtained by NBC News, mentors at a State Department internship program were ordered to report any DEI-related projects and separate any interns working on those projects.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFrom cultural musicians being banned from performing to diversity-related posters being taken&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Federal Workers Share Concerns Over Executive Orders Impacting Employee Resource Groups first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/federal-workers-share-concerns-over-executive-orders-impacting-employee-resource-groups/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2025-01/250124-office-workers-stock-aa-444-d5fdcd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:39:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":284549302,"title":"America dominated AI. Then a cheap Chinese contender entered the chat","text":"From market darling to the biggest value destructor in history\n\nInvestors in computer chip company Nvidia have seen nearly a trillion US dollars of value wiped out in a day — the worst-ever result for a single company in absolute terms.\n\nIn recent years, Nvidia saw its shares reach atmospheric heights as investors bet that its advanced chips would form the engine of the artificial intelligence revolution.\n\nThen, little-known Chinese company DeepSeek entered the chat — with its own AI chatbot.\n\nWhen it launched last week, its capabilities shocked the technology sector.\n\nIt appears to have similar functionality to market leader ChatGPT and it rocketed to the top of app stores around the world.\n\nThis wasn't supposed to happen.\n\nUnder former president Joe Biden, America implemented strict export controls on these advanced chips to try to hobble its strategic rival in the field.\n\nIt means American companies cannot produce them in China, nor sell them to the country.\n\nThe controls were supposed to ensure American pre-eminence in artificial intelligence. Ensure that America would be at the forefront of a technology that is likely to reshape the way we work and live.\n\nThe collective wisdom of investors seemed to be that America had a major lead over China in this area. And that with China cut off from American chips, that lead should be maintained, at least in the short-term.\n\nAnd yet, here is a Chinese company, founded in 2023, seemingly without access to America's best chips, creating a new product that rivals the best artificial intelligence technology in America.\n\nDeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng, says his company has developed ways to build advanced AI models much more cheaply than its American competitors.\n\nHe says they've also figured out how to do it with fewer, and less-advanced, chips.\n\nThe company has made its model open source, allowing it to be downloaded by anyone.\n\nIt seems to undercut the need for the super-advanced chips that Nvidia makes. And it suggests that, compared to the chipmaker and other companies, you don't need to make a huge investment to profit from artificial intelligence.\n\nPerhaps AI can be done on the cheap.\n\nThat's why we saw such widespread falls in US technology stocks on Monday, local time, as well as those companies whose future profits were tied to AI in different ways, like building or powering those large data centres thought necessary.\n\nAmerica is betting big on AI\n\nOne of the first major announcements of a freshly reinaugurated Donald Trump was a massive private investment in artificial intelligence in the US.\n\nHe brought together two tech CEOs and the head of a Japanese investment firm, Softbank, to detail their investment in AI in America of up to $US500 billion.\n\nA project they dubbed \"Stargate.\"\n\nIt's a massive dollar figure and there was some scepticism that the number was realistic, including from one of Trump's closest allies, tech mogul Elon Musk, who questioned whether Softbank had enough cash to stump up.\n\nBut the announcement was indicative of the priority given to investment in AI as part of America's economic future proofing, and a recognition of its potentially terrifying military applications.\n\nTrump also promised to clear regulatory hurdles to fast-track the venture.\n\nThis is an issue where Trump and his predecessor were of one mind. \n\nOne of Biden's legacy legislative achievements was the so-called CHIPs act (or \"Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors\" for America Act). \n\nIt provided $US39 billion in subsidies for manufacturing computer chips in America and a further $US13 billion for research and training.\n\nBiden was explicit that its purpose was to support American preeminence in the space. Like his export bans, it was also to designed counter Chinese efforts.\n\nOn Monday evening, Trump said the development of DeepSeek \"should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win\". But he also said it \"could be very much a positive development\". \n\n\"So instead of spending billions and billions, you'll spend less, and you'll come up with, hopefully, the same solution under the Trump administration,\" he said.\n\nChina has long had its own industrial policy to support local chip manufacturing and AI technology.\n\nIn 2015 the Chinese government launched its \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, which aimed to achieve 70 per cent \"self-sufficiency\" in chip production by this year.\n\nThe US House Committee on the Chinese Communist Party has been advocating for stronger sanctions against China and warning of \"dangerous loopholes\" in US export controls.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIt's been a painful day for those invested in Nvidia, but it remains to be seen whether today's sell-off was warranted or an overreaction.\n\nNvidia's explosion in value in recent years has been the most powerful symbol of how seriously investors are taking the potential of AI. But the company has also seen multiple days of extraordinary falls in recent months, when new pieces of information have been digested, before again rising. This may prove to be a blip.\n\nThere are also still big questions about how advanced DeepSeek's technology truly is and whether people outside China will want to use an AI tool that must still adhere to Chinese state censorship.\n\nDon't try asking what happened in Tiananmen Square in 1989 or Chinese treatment of the Uighur minority.\n\nA subplot to Monday's action was DeepSeek saying it had been hit with a large-scale cyber attack and had limited user registrations in response.\n\nIt's unclear exactly who's behind the attack and the motivation.\n\nWhat is clear is that the battle for AI supremacy is by no means over, with neither China nor America like to cede the field any time soon.","summary":"The US was seen to have a major lead in the field of AI, and export bans in place were meant to keep it that way.

All government documents must “accurately reflect the holder’s sex” as either male or female, according to the order.\n\nThe order also directs the Bureau of Prisons to move trans women into men’s prisons, and cuts inmates’ access to gender-affirming healthcare.\n\nThe plaintiff in the new lawsuit, identified anonymously as Maria Moe, is diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began transitioning in middle school. She has been taking feminizing hormones since she was 15 years old, and “during her term of incarceration, she has always been treated as a woman by federal correctional officials and her peers,” according to the complaint.\n\nBut on January 21, she was segregated from the general population at a women’s facility, moved into a “special housing unit,” and told that she would be transferred to a men’s prison, the lawsuit states.\n\nOn January 25, prison records suddenly classified her as “male,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe remains in the special housing unit, pending transfer.\n\n“If Maria Moe is transferred to a men’s facility, she will not be safe,” the lawsuit states. \n\n“She will be at an extremely high risk of harassment, abuse, violence, and sexual assault. She may be subject to strip searches by male correctional officers. She may be forced to shower in full view of men who are incarcerated. And she will predictably experience worsening gender dysphoria, which can lead to serious harm, including dramatically increased rates of suicidality and depression,” the suit added.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses Trump and administration officials of discriminating against Moe on the basis of sex in violation of her due process rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Her transfer to a men’s prison also would violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, the lawsuit states.\n\nThe president’s “blanket ban” that denies her affirming healthcare “regardless of medical necessity” will “deprive Maria Moe of essential medication she has taken continuously since she was a teenager, putting her at high risk of serious harm,” the lawsuit states.\n\nDepartment of Justice policies established in 2012 instructs prison officials to perform individual assessments to determine an inmate’s risk of sexual victimization, including whether they are transgender, to determine where they are housed.\n\nLGBT+ advocates have also warned that eliminating protections for trans women who are at risk of violence conflicts with protections under the Prison Rape Elimination Act.\n\n“This puts them at a severely heightened risk of sexual assault and abuse by other incarcerated persons and prison staff,” the ACLU said in a statement.\n\nAmong the more than 140,000 people in federal prisons and jails, about 2,000 — roughly 1 percent — identify as transgender, according to Bureau of Prisons data reviewed by the Marshall Project. In 2022, the bureau spent $153,000 — or less than .01 percent of its overall healthcare budget — on gender-affirming care.\n\nOnly 10 trans women in federal prisons were housed in female prisons in 2023, the Marshall Project found.\n\nA lack of gender-accurate housing, compounded by difficulties accessing gender-affirming care, have subjected trans inmates to extreme abuse, The Independent previously reported. Incarcerated trans people are 10 times as likely to report being sexually victimized as other prisoners, according to federal data.\n\nTrump’s executive order “is a direct attack on transgender Americans, deliberately making it harder for people to live their everyday lives. It is cruel, and it is wrong,” according to GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders executive director Ricardo Martinez.\n\n“The administration is trying to create fear and sow chaos by its statements and orders, but no executive action can change the fundamental truth that transgender people are vital members of our families and communities,” Martinez said in a statement. “Like all people, transgender people deserve dignity, respect, and the freedom to live without fear of government-sanctioned harm.”","summary":"Incarcerated trans woman takes aim at president’s order rolling back protections for LGBT+ Americans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gender-executive-order-prison-b2687341.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/27/23/2194444069.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FgXtRvx5-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:35:48","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":284551602,"title":"Hamas Says 300,000 Displaced Palestinians Return To North Gaza","text":"Masses of displaced Palestinians streamed into the north of war-ravaged Gaza on Monday after Israel and Hamas reached a deal for the release of another six hostages.Also on Monday, the Israeli government said eight of the hostages held in Gaza who were due for release in the truce's first phase are dead.The fragile ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas is intended to bring an end to more than 15 months of war that began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.Israel had prevented Palestinians from returning to northern Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the truce, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late Sunday they would be allowed to pass after a new agreement was reached.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");Hamas had said blocking the returns amounted to a truce violation.A sea of humanity moved through the now-open Netzarim Corridor into the north, watched over by Israeli tanks. Some pulled carts weighed down with mattresses and other essentials. Others carried what belongings they could.Late Monday the Hamas government in Gaza said \"more than 300,000 displaced\" had returned during the day \"to the governorates of the north\", an area of Gaza severely battered by the war.After reaching the area, men embraced each other.\"Welcome to Gaza,\" read a newly-erected banner hanging above a dirt road in front of a collapsed building in Gaza City.\"This is the happiest day of my life,\" said Lamees al-Iwady, a 22-year-old who returned to Gaza City after being displaced several times.\"I feel as though my soul and life have returned to me,\" she said. \"We will rebuild our homes, even if it's with mud and sand.\"With the joy of return came shock at the extent of destruction wrought by more than a year of war.According to the Hamas-run government's media office, 135,000 tents and caravans are needed in Gaza City and the north to shelter returning families.Still, Hamas called the return \"a victory\" for Palestinians that \"signals the failure and defeat of the plans for occupation and displacement\".The comments came after US President Donald Trump floated an idea to \"clean out\" Gaza and resettle Palestinians in Jordan and Egypt, drawing condemnation from regional leaders.President Mahmud Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a \"strong rejection and condemnation of any projects\" aimed at displacing Palestinians from Gaza, his office said.- Dark memories -For Palestinians, any attempt to move them from Gaza would evoke dark memories of what the Arab world calls the \"Nakba\", or catastrophe -- the mass displacement of Palestinians during Israel's creation in 1948.\"We say to Trump and the whole world: we will not leave Palestine or Gaza, no matter what happens,\" said displaced Gaza resident Rashad al-Naji.Moving Gaza's inhabitants -- who number 2.4 million -- could be done \"temporarily or could be long term\", Trump said on Saturday.Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called Trump's suggestion \"a great idea\".The Arab League warned against \"attempts to uproot the Palestinian people from their land\", and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi issued a \"firm\" rejection of Palestinian displacement.\"Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,\" Safadi said.Egypt's foreign ministry said it rejected any infringement of Palestinians' \"inalienable rights\".- Visibly distraught -Israel had said it would prevent Palestinians' passage to the north until the release of Arbel Yehud, a civilian woman hostage who it maintained should have been freed on Saturday.But Netanyahu's office later said a deal had been reached for the release of three hostages on Thursday, including Yehud, as well as another three on Saturday.Hamas confirmed the agreement in its own statement Monday.Later, another Gaza militant group, Islamic Jihad, released video footage of a visibly distressed Yehud.She called on Netanyahu to do everything in his power to secure the release of the remaining hostages.In southern Gaza, the European Union agreed on Monday to restart a monitoring mission at the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. Italy said the main aim \"is to coordinate and facilitate the daily transit of up to 300 wounded and sick\".During the first phase of the truce which began on January 19, 33 hostages are supposed to be freed in staggered releases over six weeks in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners held by the Israelis.The second such swap, on Saturday, saw four Israeli women hostages, all soldiers, exchanged for 200 prisoners, all Palestinians except for one Jordanian.On Monday, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said eight of the hostages due for release in the first phase are dead.\"The families have been informed of the situation of their relatives,\" he said, without disclosing their names.Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 87 remain in Gaza, including 34 Israel says are dead.Hamas's October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 47,317 people in Gaza, the majority civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Masses of displaced Palestinians streamed into the north of war-ravaged Gaza on Monday after Israel and Hamas reached a deal for the release of another six hostages.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/hamas-says-300-000-displaced-palestinians-return-to-north-gaza-7575139","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-01/t2522e0k_palestinians-return-to-north-gaza_625x300_28_January_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:35:36","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.587},{"id":284550466,"title":"Trump wants ‘transgender ideology’ out of military","text":"The president said he’ll sign a series of executive orders which could dramatically reshape the U.S. military, potentially ending the careers of thousands of active duty troops while reinstating thousands of others removed for failing to follow orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, while addressing a House GOP Conference meeting held at Trump National Doral Miami on Monday, said he would direct his newly installed Secretary of Defense to develop a policy regarding service members who identify as transgender and to end any sort of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policy employed by the Department.\n\n“To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It’s gonna be gone,” Trump said Monday.\n\n“In addition, we will stop our service members from being indoctrinated with radical left ideologies such as critical race theories,” he continued.\n\nTrump did not indicate whether his order would include an outright ban on transgendered people serving in the military. It is also unclear precisely how many troops identify as transgender, though the Associated Press has estimated it may be upwards of 14,000 service members, or less than 1% of the U.S. military.\n\nAt the same time, the recently re-inaugurated second-term U.S. president said he would order reinstatement — with full back pay — for thousands of troops separated from the service after they were ordered to take the COVID-19 vaccine but refused. That order could impact upwards of 8,000 former U.S. service members separated between August 2021 through January 2023.\n\n“I think we’re going to have a lot of people that join,” Trump said.\n\nTrump also said he would direct the DoD to “immediately begin the construction of a state-of-the-art Iron Dome missile defense shield” much like the one used by Israel.\n\n“We protect other countries, but we don’t protect ourselves,” Trump said.\n\nIf some of these orders cause some measure of déjà vu, that’s because Trump took aim at transgendered troops during his first term and again last week after swearing the oath of office. He also issued an DEI order last week.\n\nTrump’s original first-term plan to remove transgendered troops was stopped by legal challenges, and then overturned by former President Joe Biden with an executive order of his own. The order Trump issued shortly after taking office rescinded Biden’s order allowing transgender people to join the military and serve openly as the gender of their choosing.\n\nPart of the reasoning behind one of Monday’s orders was further clarify what the president meant in his original directives, which had the apparently unattended consequence of seeing information concerning the Tuskegee Airman and the Women’s Airforce Service Pilots, or WASPs, removed from military training courses as Department of Defense personnel rushed to comply with the president’s earlier order.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Sunday via social media that information was taken out of training courses by mistake and its removal “immediately reversed.”\n\nHerald wire services contributed.","summary":"“To ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military.

Whatever “corruption” Griggs refers to with respect to Biden and his family is never explained, because there wasn’t any, despite four years of the Republican Party trying to find some.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump became a convicted felon and sex offender, and pardon-giver to actual criminals.

They will also face severe backlash from voters, including those who elected him, as he ignores the key issue that put him in office: his promise to bring down high prices.\n\nNext up on his Project 2025 agenda: cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWard Kanowsky\n\nDEI training helps keep\ngroups competitive\n\nAs a director of an engineering software development team at a large company, I found DEI training to be compelling and useful. These modern management practices allow organizations to become more productive, creative and efficient. This is good for business.\n\nDiversity feeds creativity. A basketball team with five identical players, even Steph Curry clones, is unlikely to win. Product development teams also benefit from a range of talent, skills and experience. Equity means people are compensated fairly for their contributions. Inclusion means understanding that people are not cookie-cutter replicas of each other. People have different communication styles and life experiences. They may look different. When people feel accepted, they are more able to solve difficult problems together.\n\nSo don’t be fooled by the anti-DEI hype.

The contrast in style between the two portraits highlights the changes in both the First Lady’s role and her public image.\nMelania Trump's Second Term as First Lady\nIn an interview with Fox & Friends, Melania Trump opened up about her preparations for her return to the White House. According to CNN, she has been “preparing intensively” by studying foreign affairs, a step she believes is important as she takes on her role once again. She also shared that she plans to split her time between Washington, D.C., and Palm Beach, Florida, but will also spend time in New York City, where her 18-year-old son, Barron Trump, is attending New York University.\nMelania Trump also reflected on her first term in the White House, noting that the experience will be different the second time around. “The difference is I know where I will be going, I know the rooms where we will be living. I know the process,” she explained. “The first time was challenging, we didn’t have much of the information.”\nAlso Read: Melania Trump's Hat: Blocking Kisses Of Donald Trump, Sparking Memes, Owning The Inauguration Day","summary":"First Lady Melania Trump’s second official White House portrait has been unveiled, drawing widespread reactions across social media.

Indiana Man Pardoned for January 6 Capitol Riot Shot and Killed During Traffic Stop","text":"An Indiana man, who had recently received a pardon for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, was fatally shot during a traffic stop on Sunday afternoon. Authorities have confirmed that the incident took place at approximately 4:15 p.m. when a Jasper County sheriff’s deputy attempted to stop Matthew Huttle, 42, on a traffic violation.\nDetails of the Incident\nAccording to a statement released by local authorities, Huttle resisted arrest and was found to be in possession of a firearm. A struggle ensued between Huttle and the officer, which resulted in the officer firing his weapon, fatally wounding Huttle. The sheriff’s office emphasized that the altercation was the catalyst for the officer’s use of force.\n\"An altercation took place between the suspect and the officer, which resulted in the officer firing his weapon and fatally wounding the suspect,\" the release stated.\nSheriff Patrick Williamson requested an investigation by the Indiana State Police to look into the circumstances surrounding the incident. As per department policy, the deputy involved was placed on paid administrative leave. \"Our condolences go out to the family of the deceased, as any loss of life is traumatic to those that were close to Mr. Huttle,\" Sheriff Williamson said in his statement. He also mentioned that the name of the deputy would be released once approval was granted by State Police Detectives.\nMatthew Huttle Involved in the Capitol Riot\nThe Jasper County coroner confirmed Huttle's identity and conducted an autopsy, which was completed on Monday morning. Further details on the case have not yet been disclosed by authorities.\nHuttle was among those identified as participants in the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, where supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\nIn August 2023, Huttle pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, according to court records. He was sentenced to six months in federal prison, followed by 12 months of supervised release. However, this sentence became irrelevant in January 2025 when President Trump pardoned Huttle, along with nearly 1,500 others who were involved in the Capitol attack.\nUncle of Matthew Huttle and Additional Legal Outcomes\nCourt documents also revealed that Huttle had been at the Capitol that day with his uncle. Investigators obtained videos uploaded to Huttle’s Google account, which showed him on the premises. In one of the videos, Huttle could be heard saying, \"A group of people are going to the Capitol, and I’m going to see if we can get inside.\"\nSecurity footage captured Huttle inside the Capitol, including in the crypt area of the building.\nHuttle’s uncle was also involved in the events of January 6. Court records show he had been seen on video assaulting officers with a flagpole on the steps of the Capitol building. Like Huttle, his uncle entered into a plea agreement and was sentenced to 30 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He, too, was among those pardoned by President Trump.\nAlso Read: First Lady Melania Trump's Official White House Portrait Released, Sets Internet Alight","summary":"Matthew Huttle, a man recently pardoned for his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, was shot and killed during a traffic stop in Indiana on Sunday.

The vote was 68-29 in favor of Bessent's confirmation.\nAs head of the Treasury, 62-year-old Bessent faces significant pressure to address the federal debt limit and work with congressional Republicans to extend Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, he will have to contend with Trump’s plans to enact tariffs on goods coming in from Mexico, Canada, and China, which pose risks for the American economy.\nDuring his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Bessent voiced support for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. He argued that the issue with the federal budget is spending, not revenues. Bessent also claimed that Trump’s economic plans would lower consumer costs and boost wages.\nBessent, who advised Trump on economic policy during his campaign, is the founder of hedge fund Key Square Capital Management. He previously served as the chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management, a hedge fund started by Democratic megadonor George Soros. Bessent is the first openly gay Treasury Secretary and the first LGBTQ Senate-confirmed Cabinet member in a Republican administration.\nWhen Trump named Bessent as his pick for Treasury Secretary in November, he touted him as a “strong advocate of the America First Agenda.” Trump stated that Bessent would “usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy, Center of Innovation and Entrepreneurialism, Destination for Capital, while always, and without question, maintaining the US Dollar as the Reserve Currency of the World.”\nBessent's confirmation marks a significant step in the Trump administration's efforts to implement its economic policies. As Treasury Secretary, Bessent will play a crucial role in shaping the nation's financial landscape and addressing key economic challenges. His experience in the financial sector and his support for Trump's economic agenda position him as a pivotal figure in the administration's plans.\nThe coming months will reveal how Bessent navigates the complexities of his new role and the impact of his policies on the American economy.

US District Judge R. Gary Klausner handed Dong a 41-month sentence. Dong and her husband, Michael Liu, were convicted in September of conspiracy and money laundering through their company, USA Happy Baby.\nDuring the sentencing hearing in federal court in Los Angeles, Dong wiped away tears as she recalled growing up without siblings due to China’s strict “one-child” policy. She told the court that the Chinese government forced her mother to have an abortion. Federal prosecutors argued that Dong and Liu helped more than 100 pregnant Chinese women travel to the United States. Authorities said the pair coached women on how to deceive customs officials by flying into airports believed to be more lenient while wearing loose-fitting clothing to hide their pregnancies.\n“For tens of thousands of dollars each, defendant helped her numerous customers deceive US authorities and buy US citizenship for their children,” prosecutors said in court filings. Federal prosecutors declined to comment after the sentencing.\nDong told the court that moving to the United States had been challenging but that she grew hopeful after having three children of her own. She became an American citizen and said she saw she could help Chinese women seeking to have additional children near her home in California. “I don’t want to lose my kids,” she told the court. “I hope you can give me fair judgment. I will take all my responsibility.”\nIn December, Liu was also sentenced to 41 months in prison. Dong’s lawyer, John McNicholas, asked that she be allowed to serve her term after Liu has completed his sentence because of their children. The youngest is 13. Judge Klausner refused and had her taken into custody immediately. She removed a necklace and gave it to a family member before she was led away. McNicholas said that Dong would appeal.\nBirthright citizenship has been thrust into the spotlight in the United States with the return of Donald Trump to the White House. Trump recently issued an executive order to narrow the definition of birthright citizenship. It was quickly blocked by a federal judge who called it “blatantly unconstitutional.” The order had been opposed by the attorneys general for 22 states.\nDong and Liu were among more than a dozen people charged in an Obama-era crackdown on so-called “birth tourism” schemes that helped Chinese women hide their pregnancies as they traveled to the United States to deliver babies. Such businesses have long operated in California and other states, catering to people from China, Russia, Nigeria, and elsewhere.\nThe key draw for those travelers is that under the 14th Amendment, any child born in the United States is an American citizen. Many parents who engaged in so-called “birth tourism” believe it could help their children secure a US college education and provide hope for their futures – especially since the tourists themselves can apply for permanent residency once their American child turns 21. Pregnant women can travel to the United States, but lying to US consular and immigration officials about the reasons for doing so is not permitted.\nThe USA Happy Baby case was part of a broader investigation into businesses helping Chinese women travel to give birth in California. The operator of another business is believed to have fled to China. A third individual was sentenced in 2019 to 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and visa fraud for running the company known as “You Win USA.”\nAs the legal proceedings continue, the case highlights the complexities and controversies surrounding birthright citizenship and the lengths to which some individuals will go to secure a better future for their children.\nALSO READ: Chinese Firm's AI Chatbot Triggers $1tn Drop In US Stocks, 'Sputnik Moment","summary":"California woman sentenced for aiding Chinese women in birth tourism, raising questions about birthright citizenship and legal implications.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/woman-sentenced-for-helping-chinese-women-to-deliver-babies-in-the-us/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Woman-Sentenced-For-Helping-Chinese-Women-To-Deliver-Babies-In-The-US.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:30:51","author":"Swati Pandey","authors":["Swati Pandey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":284553050,"title":"US sanctions on Hong Kong judges may ‘result in Beijing taking over trials’","text":"A member of Hong Kong’s Basic Law Committee has warned that Beijing could “in theory” take over national security trials in the city if the United States advances a bill to sanction judges, rendering such cases “beyond the capacity” of local courts to try.\nPriscilla Leung Mei-fun, also a lawmaker, on Monday maintained that it was the best option for cases to be handled by the city’s courts although it was difficult to determine how foreign sanctions might change the situation. The Basic Law Committee advises the central government on the city’s mini-constitution.\nBut local observers expressed doubt over Leung’s suggestion, noting that existing sanctions had so far had little impact on Hong Kong officials, and such a drastic move could prompt Western politicians to respond with more sanctions.\nAmerican lawmakers Young Kim and Jim McGovern introduced the bipartisan Hong Kong Sanctions Act in the US Congress on Friday, less than a week after Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second and last term.\nThe bill, largely modelled on a similar legislative proposal introduced in November 2023 that has since expired, would require the US president to assess whether to sanction certain Hong Kong officials who are deemed to have violated human rights.\nAmong the 48 people listed in the bill are 29 judges and magistrates, including Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung and three permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal. Seven Court of First Instance judges, five district judges and five magistrates are listed.\n\nLeung, who is also a law professor at City University, said the bill showed US politicians were “completely ignorant” of the national security law that came into force in June 2020.\n“According to Article 55 of the Hong Kong national security law, particularly complex cases that are beyond the capacity of the Hong Kong courts to try, or those that are subject to extremely exceptional circumstances such as the current situation of a continuously high degree of foreign interference, could be transferred to the mainland courts,” she said.\n“They must know that by constantly putting pressure on the Hong Kong courts, they are actually increasing the possibility of [Beijing] referring these cases to the mainland for trial.”\nAll national security trials under the Beijing-decreed law have been tried in Hong Kong, including that of former media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, who faces two conspiracy charges of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious publications.\nBut the law also states that Beijing’s Office for Safeguarding National Security in the city can take over cases under three circumstances, such as when the “involvement of a foreign country or external elements” makes it “difficult” for Hong Kong authorities to exercise jurisdiction.\nSuch a transfer of jurisdiction to mainland authorities might also occur when “a serious situation” renders the Hong Kong government unable to effectively enforce the law, or a “major and imminent threat to national security has occurred”.\nLeung told the Post a transfer of jurisdiction was “just a theoretical discussion” and “it was currently impossible to determine” how sanctions imposed by a foreign government could develop into circumstances where national security trials had to be taken over by mainland courts.\n“In reality, I believe that the Hong Kong courts will insist on completing the relevant cases. I personally also think that it is the best option for the relevant cases to be completed by the Hong Kong courts,” she said.\nInternational relations expert Wilson Chan Wai-shun said whether and when the Congress could clear the sanction bill would depend on a range of factors, such as developments in Hong Kong that raised eyebrows in the West.\n“If the trial of a national security case is transferred to the mainland due to external political pressure or the intervention of external forces, I think the impact will cause a big trigger in the West [to act further on the city],” he said.\nHe said another key factor would be how prominent the Hong Kong issue stood in potential talks between leaders in Washington and Beijing.\n\nVeteran China watcher Johnny Lau Yui-siu expressed scepticism that sanctions imposed by the US would make any difference to the Hong Kong courts. He noted that it had been business as usual for top officials such as Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu since they were placed under US sanctions more than four years ago.\n“If a judge becomes a designated national security law judge, he should have made all the calculations, such as whether his children and family will be affected, and whether he has any property in the United States, right?” he said.\nLau also noted that sanctions on Hong Kong officials had remained a “side issue” in the bigger Sino-US relationship, and he expected the United States to show some restraint on broadening its targets considering the country’s vast economic and political interests in the city.\nA total of 1,390 US firms have set up regional headquarters or local offices in Hong Kong as of June 2024, compared with 1,273 a year earlier.\nLaw Society president Roden Tong Man-lung, citing a 2023 statement issued in the wake of the previous US Congress bill, maintained that any attempt to exert pressure by sanctioning a judge based on the type of case was an affront to the rule of law.","summary":"Basic Law Committee member Priscilla Leung says US bill shows American politicians are ‘completely ignorant’ of the national security law.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3296507/us-sanctions-hong-kong-judges-may-result-beijing-taking-over-trials","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/27/37218063-cf2d-4d6b-bbc8-88f42759dfbc_38c38147.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:30:12","author":"Kahon Chan","authors":["Kahon Chan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":284549954,"title":"Fox News attacks AOC over Trump tariffs—then admits she may be right","text":"Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany claimed that Democratic Rep.

Tariffs imposed by Trump when he was first president led to increased costs that have been passed on to consumers.

In the case of Colombia, that would be staples like coffee, flowers, and petroleum.\n\nThe factual misfire was just the latest episode Fox and the rest of conservative media lashing out at progressive leaders, like Ocasio-Cortez.

Even before he was sworn in, the Treasury Department was using \"extraordinary measures\" to avoid breaching the cap and triggering a catastrophic default. Bessent told senators in his confirmation hearing that there would be no default on his watch.\n\nBessent will also need to deal with the prospect of rising budget deficits and added government debt estimated to run into the trillions of dollars, if tax cut extensions and other promised tax breaks cannot be offset by revenue increases or spending cuts. If precedent holds, he will be a central actor working with Congress on the size and shape of any tax reforms.\n\nMore than 60% of the federal debt is scheduled to roll over on his watch - and that's before taking into account issuance growth that has been running at more than $2 trillion a year since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWorries about rising budget deficits and stickier inflation have in recent weeks sent long-term bond yields up as investors demand more compensation for risk. That in turn has driven up the average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to more than 7%, a pain point with particular saliency for Americans looking to buy a home.\n\nBessent used his confirmation hearing to talk tough on deficits, declaring that government spending is \"out of control,\" though it is not clear how much he could do to rein it in. He backed Trump's pledge not to touch the Social Security retirement program and Medicare insurance plan for seniors, among the biggest line items in the federal budget, along with interest expense, determined by market rates that the Treasury does not control.\n\nBorn and raised in South Carolina, Bessent says he still listens to farm radio. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Yale University and has spent his career in finance, working for investors George Soros and Jim Chanos, and running his own firm Key Square. Bessent - as fifth in line to the presidency - is also the highest ranking openly gay federal official in history.

The help desk was funded by the Department of Justice with a budget of roughly $400,000, said the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. It helped educate immigrants facing court proceedings about their rights, legal options and how the court operates, which can be confusing for immigrants. The desk was often the only way for immigrants to get help and connect with pro bono attorneys.\n\n\"It really fills a gap because full representation by an attorney for immigrants is very costly ... and takes a long time,\" said Christine Sauvé, a manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. \"Some of our cases are 10 years long or more.\"\n\nTwo days after Trump became president last week, the Justice Department sent a stop work order to the Acacia Center for Justice and other groups telling them to pause their legal service programs that assist immigrants, the Acacia center said. On Thursday, the help desk shut down, Sauvé said.\n\nThe order was sent after the White House issued an executive order on Jan. 20 titled \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion,\" referring to what it called an \"unprecedented flood of illegal immigration.\"\n\nUnder the order's Section 19, which deals with funding, it tells the Attorney General and Department of Homeland Security to immediately review and potentially audit \"all contracts, grants, or other agreements providing Federal funding to non-governmental organizations supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens.\" The order says the two leaders of the federal agencies must ensure that grants and agreements \"conform to applicable law and are free of waste, fraud, and abuse, and that they do not promote or facilitate violations of our immigration laws.\"\n\nDuring this review process, funding must be paused, the order said.\n\n\"Our staff was not permitted to go back to the court (Thursday) and to continue,\" Sauve said. Shutting down the legal assistance \"makes it harder for for individuals to find a lawyer, navigate the system, figure it out,\" she said.\n\nShuttering the programs will makes the lives of some immigrants even more challenging, advocates said.\n\n“The suspension of these longstanding programs could leave hundreds of thousands of vulnerable immigrants — including children and families — without access to basic legal information and representation,\" Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said in a statement. \"This decision undermines due process and puts lives at risk, disproportionately harming those already facing tremendous hardship.\"\n\nAber added that they are \"ready to work with the Department of Justice to review and rapidly restore these essential services so that Acacia and our partners in the legal field can continue to deliver on the promise of justice for all.\"\n\nMayor Mike Duggan:Detroit will continue to work with ICE\n\nThe Detroit Immigration Court is one of several immigration courts across the United States. They're not independent like regular courts, but fall under the jurisdiction of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the Department of Justice. The Executive Office for Immigration Review declined comment, said Kathryn Mattingly, press secretary for the office. Groups that call for reduced immigration have for years been asking presidents to target the courts to make it more difficult for immigrants to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe closing of the help desk is one way in which Trump's executive orders are already impacting immigrant communities. Trump also issued an order ending birthright citizenship for many, but that order was immediately challenged by the ACLU in a lawsuit and a federal judge has temporarily blocked it.\n\nOn Monday, the Arab American Civil Rights League held a press conference in Dearborn to offer legal assistance for immigrants who are concerned about deportations. It was one of several events held locally in recent weeks by immigrant advocacy and civil rights groups offering advice. The Detroit office of two branches of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — Homeland Security Investigations and Enforcement Removal Operations — are working to arrest what they called \"immigration violators\" in a tweet posted Monday by Detroit HSI. ICE said they made 956 arrests nationally on Sunday.\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo:nwarikoo@freepress.com or X @nwarikoo","summary":"DOJ shuts down Detroit legal program helping immigrants in court after Trump order  Detroit Free Press","url":"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/01/27/trumps-justice-department-closes-detroit-program-helping-immigrants/77932565007/","image":"https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/01/27/NSHT/77972976007-trump-signs-executive-orders-sam-greene-pool-goodjpg.jpg?crop=1319,742,x0,y0&width=1319&height=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:23:10","author":"Niraj Warikoo","authors":["Niraj Warikoo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":284548202,"title":"'Don't mess with the US': GOP senator on Trump's message to other countries","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics January 27, 2025 04:57 \n\n 'Don't mess with the US': GOP senator on Trump's message to other countries \n Sen.

If the figure is true, it would be far less than the $100 million to $1 billion an AI chief executive estimated it cost to build a model last year, but experts like Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon seriously doubt the figure, with Rasgon saying it disregards “substantial” additional costs that went into the AI model’s development.\n\nMusk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang have theorized DeepSeek owns over $1 billion in Nvidia equipment needed to develop its AI models. Wang noted without evidence in a CNBC interview Monday that DeepSeek built its product using about 50,000 Nvidia H100 chips, but claimed the company has not made that clear because it would mean it violated a U.S. export policy banning the sale of the chips to Chinese firms.\n\nKey Background\n\nDeepSeek, a company less than two years old and founded by 40-year-old Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, released its R1 advanced reasoning model on Jan. 20 as a direct competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT model. DeepSeek has since climbed app stores and had its R1 model called “AI's Sputnik moment” by billionaire investor Marc Andreessen. The U.S. market reacted negatively Monday to the surge in DeepSeek’s popularity, with companies like Nvidia (-16.8%), Oracle (-13.8%) and Google (-4%) sliding. Several tech billionaires experienced large hits to their net worths, with Oracle chairman Larry Ellison and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang taking the largest losses, losing $27.6 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Trump Calls AI Development ‘Positive’ Despite Tech Stock Plunge (Forbes)\n\nWhat Is DeepSeek?

Trump was accused of seeking to subvert the election results, which he falsely claimed were marred by widespread voter fraud.\n\nBoth investigations resulted in federal criminal indictments: the first in Florida and the second in Washington, DC.\n\nTrump was the first US president, past or present, to face criminal charges. In addition to the federal cases, he was also charged in two state-level indictments.\n\nOne, in Georgia, also pertained to Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The other, in New York, accused Trump of falsifying business documents to conceal a hush-money payment to an adult film actress during his successful 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nIn that case, Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts, though he was sentenced to an “unconditional discharge” — wherein he was released with no penalties.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all four cases and accused the prosecutors of leading a politically motivated “witch hunt”.\n\nWhile the state-level cases were prosecuted by local district attorneys, the federal cases were overseen by the Biden administration’s Department of Justice.\n\nBut to maintain the independence of the investigations, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland named a special counsel who was not a political appointee to lead the probes: Jack Smith, who had previously prosecuted war crimes at The Hague.\n\nNeither of Smith’s cases against Trump made it to trial. After Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Smith dropped both cases, citing longstanding Justice Department policy not to prosecute sitting presidents. He also stepped down as special counsel.\n\nSmith did, however, release a report about one of the two indictments, underscoring the strength of the prosecution’s case.\n\n“But for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial,” the report said.\n\nSince taking office on January 20, Trump has led a purge of federal government offices.\n\nOn January 24, for instance, news reports revealed he had fired a dozen inspectors general: officials charged with serving as watchdogs over key government agencies.\n\nSome experts say their terminations violated federal law requiring advance notice of 30 days for the removal of an inspector general — and a clear rationale for the firing.\n\nOn the day of his inauguration, Trump teased the widespread dismissal of “Biden bureaucrats” at a rally with his supporters at the Capital One Arena in Washington, DC.\n\n“Most of those bureaucrats are being fired. They’re gone. Should be all of them, but some sneak through,” he said.\n\nIn a statement on Monday to The Associated Press, an anonymous Trump official echoed the president’s talking points in discussing the prosecutors’ dismissals: “This action is consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.”","summary":"The move breaks with federal norms against punishing civil servants for actions taken under a different administration.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/28/trump-fires-us-federal-prosecutors-involved-in-probes-of-his-behaviour?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25027818622567-1738018820.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:09:59","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.495},{"id":284545288,"title":"Elon Musk’s mother speaks out against racist attacks on Usha Vance, the new Second Lady","text":"Maye Musk defended America’s new Second Lady Usha Vance as she has faced racist attacks while husband JD Vance is sworn in as vice president.\n\nThe mother of DOGE chairman and ‘First Buddy’ Elon Musk has made her presence known in the American political sphere since her son started tagging along with Donald Trump last July. \n\nUsha has faced racist attacks during the campaign that husband JD has had her back in responding to but now Mother Musk has joined the chorus of those praising her which has included President Trump.\n\nShe quoted a post on son Elon’s social media platform X asking: ‘Why is no one talking about Usha Vance being the first Indian American and the first Hindu to serve as the Second Lady of the United States?!’\n\nMusk commented: ‘Usha is even lovelier in person, smart and charming.’ \n\nWhen President Trump took to the podium on inauguration night after a whirlwind of balls and parades, there were two women he wanted to highlight. \n\nThe first, as expected, was the First Lady, who stood adoringly next to him in a mesmerizing black and white gown. \n\nBut it was his telling compliment about the second that reveals more about America’s future than many would have realized at the time. \n\nTurning to Vice President JD Vance, Trump said comedically of him: ‘The only one smarter [than him] is his wife. \n\n‘I would have chosen her [as my VP] but somehow the line of succession didn’t work that way.’ \n\nWhile many have credited Usha for her elegance and intelligence, some have made racist remarks against the first Indian Second Lady. \n\nFar right commentator Nick Fuentes has levied cruel attacks on Second Lady Vance, wondering if ‘we really expect that [JD Vance] who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity’.\n\nVance tore into Fuentes in an interview last August, saying he ‘disavows’ him but wants to keep focus on the important issues in his and Trump’s campaign against Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said of Fuentes: ‘Of course Donald Trump has criticized this person. Look, I think the guy’s a total loser. Certainly, I disavow him’. \n\nVance told CBS that he thinks the best policy to stop the likes of Fuentes is to ‘ignore’ him.\n\n‘But if you ask me what I care more about, is it a person attacking me personally, or is it government policy that discriminates based on race? That’s what I really worry about, is bad government policy that harms people based on their immutable characteristics,’ he said.\n\nHe acknowledged, however, that ‘a lot of losers are going to attack me and attack my family’.\n\n‘I think the proper response to them is to ignore them. Don’t feed the trolls, and they largely go away,’ he added. \n\nTrump had dinner with Fuentes and Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022, prompting widespread condemnation from both parties. \n\nMany say Usha, who attended Yale and Cambridge before launching a stellar law career, is the secret reason for her husband’s meteoric rise. \n\nLike her husband’s, Usha’s background is one of humble beginnings and hard work. \n\nHer parents immigrated to America from India in the 1970s and both work as professors. \n\nThey raised her in San Diego in a Hindu household where studying was top of the agenda. \n\nIt paid off – Usha went on to study at Yale Law, where she met JD. \n\nHe referred to her in his book Hillbilly Elegy as his ‘Yale spirit guide’ and the ‘supersmart daughter of two immigrants.’ \n\nWhile he was the polished product of years in the Marines, Usha was a beautiful and studious brainiac. \n\nShe was the editor of the Yale Law Journal, managing editor of the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, and the proud recipient of the Gales Scholarship, a ferociously competitive program that requires candidates to demonstrate ‘outstanding intellectual ability.’ \n\nWhile she and JD were falling quickly in love, she took a break from Yale for a brief period to study in England at the equally prestigious University of Cambridge. \n\nShe and Vance married in Kentucky in 2014, one year out of Yale Law School, and moved to San Francisco in 2015. \n\nIt was then that their political careers took off. Vance began working for conservative venture capitalist Peter Thiel at his Mithril Capital investment firm. \n\nMany Republican politicians, strategists and pundits agree that Vance is a clear likely frontrunner for the next Republican President. \n\nOn Monday, President Trump praised the pair by adding: ‘She’s great and he’s great. \n\n‘This is a great, beautiful couple.’ \n\nThe President’s support, not only for Vance but also his strong admiration for Usha, greatly bolsters Vance’s potential for success come 2028. \n\nAnd Usha, who is happier ‘out of the spotlight’ and focusing on motherhood, is expected to continue to be Vance’s political guide whispering words of wisdom over his shoulder.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMaye Musk defended America&#8217;s new Second Lady Usha Vance as she has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Elon Musk&#8217;s mother speaks out against racist attacks on Usha Vance, the new Second Lady first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/elon-musks-mother-speaks-out-against-racist-attacks-on-usha-vance-the-new-second-lady/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Elon-Musks-mom-defends-Usha-Vance-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:08:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":284546166,"title":"Teacher earning $160k wishes Trump voters slow and painful deaths in shocking social media posts","text":"A Long Island teacher has sparked outrage among parents after wishing Trump supporters suffer graphic deaths in a shocking social media rant. \n\nPamila Pahuja, a science teacher at RC Murphy Junior High School in Stony Brook, New York, shared a jarring message on Facebook, discussing Donald Trump's presidency and ICE raids.\n\nAfter claiming that America is 'no longer the land of the free' and warning that it is 'only a matter of time before they come for all women,' Pahuja went on to scold Trump voters.\n\n'To all Trump supporters- hope the next time you take a drink it doesn't swallow right and you go to get help but no one is there and you slowly wither away while struggling to gasp and suffer long,' she said in her scathing post. \n\n'That's what you want for people you deem not worthy right? Don't worry, I'll pray for it to last longer.' \n\nPahuja reportedly made more than $164,000 in 2023 as a Three Village Central School District educator, according to public records. \n\nSince sharing her shocking message, Pahuja has been removed from the school 'until further notice,' according to a letter RC Murphy principal Michael Jantzen sent to parents. \n\nThe message sparked instantaneous backlash, with parents and community members pointing out how unacceptable they felt Pahuja's post was.\n\nOne man wrote on Facebook: 'This teacher has no business being around kids! Half of the parents of the students in her classroom voted for the current President and this is what she wants for them.\n\n'Please be aware of the explicit hatred the left feels toward people like us and our families.'\n\nMary-Kate Robinson of Stony Brook told News12: 'I have a child in the school, people can feel however they want to feel, like or dislike any character who’s running for office – but I read the post, it was too far.'\n\n'In general teachers should be on the safer side about not posting on social media. I think they should keep politics out of the classroom,' another parent, Anthony Petrillo of Setauket, told the outlet.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to RC Murphy and the Three Village Central School District for comment.\n\nIt is unclear how long Pahuja will be removed from the school and what further action will be taken. \n\nJantzen explained in the letter: 'Please be assured that we have taken steps to ensure a smooth transition and continued high-quality instruction in science. A qualified and certified teacher will be assigned to your child's class in her absence.' \n\n'She is a disgrace and Should be fired by Three Village,' someone asserted on X. \n\n'Parents need to stand up against this no matter where you stand politically. This is the type of person teaching our children about violence. No parent should want that in their schools.'\n\nAccording to a teacher's profile posted about Pahuja by the Three Village Teachers Association, she comes from 'a long line of teachers. \n\nShe wrote: 'My maternal grandmother taught for 38 years in India. My dad taught for 43 years (in Pakistan and Ethiopia before coming to America). He retired from the NYC DOE after over 30 years of service.\n\n'My mom and my aunt also taught for many years before coming to the US.

A lo largo de las décadas, nadadores, visitantes de las playas, marineros de la Marina, agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza en el Valle del Río Tijuana y muchos otros se han enfermado como resultado de ello. Según el Instituto Scripps de Oceanografía, al menos 34,000 enfermedades solo en 2017 fueron vinculadas a la contaminación del agua en la zona.\n\nPero abordar el escepticismo de que la amenaza para la salud era grave jugó al menos un pequeño papel el año pasado en una solicitud formal a los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades de EE.UU. (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) para que examinaran detenidamente las condiciones locales. La participación del CDC se hacía esperar, dado que el flujo de aguas residuales ha empeorado en los últimos años. Desde 2019, más de 100 mil millones de galones de desechos tóxicos han fluido hacia el norte desde el Río Tijuana, cerrando playas y negocios durante años.\n\nEste mes, la agencia publicó una encuesta ponderada de los hogares en las comunidades del condado sur que mostró una asombrosa cantidad de residentes reportando problemas de salud que vinculan con la exposición a aguas residuales no tratadas. Según el CDC, los encuestados en el 45% de los hogares dijeron que en el mes anterior a la encuesta, un residente había sufrido dolores de cabeza, náuseas, enfermedades gastrointestinales u otras dolencias que atribuyeron a su entorno contaminado por heces. Así de contundentes son los resultados para los escépticos.\n\nSin embargo, para escuchar a un veterano de la delegación congresional de San Diego, la mayor noticia últimamente es la aprobación final de $250 millones adicionales en fondos federales para reparar y mejorar la Planta de Tratamiento de Aguas Residuales Internacional de South Bay en San Ysidro, que limpia los efluentes de Tijuana. Un comunicado de prensa del representante Scott Peters, D-San Diego, afirmó que el dinero “repararía completamente” la planta de alcantarillado.\n\nNo se dejen engañar por el bombo publicitario. Aplaudimos a Peters, al representante Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, y a otros líderes electos por su arduo trabajo buscando una solución convencional a la pesadilla del alcantarillado. Pero hay que señalar que las reparaciones prometidas hace cinco años se suponía que deberían haber estado terminadas para ahora, y las reparaciones prometidas ahora no se pueden confiar para que estén terminadas dentro de cinco años. También hay que señalar que en un mundo sensato, no estaríamos esperando tal respuesta. Reparar un sistema de alcantarillado no es un desafío tecnológico o de ingeniería. Requiere dinero y liderazgo. Una declaración de emergencia federal — que provea miles de millones en fondos inmediatos y agilice las aprobaciones necesarias — reduciría rápidamente el alcance de esta pesadilla.\n\nEsta posibilidad parecía más cercana que nunca el verano pasado cuando los legisladores estatales pidieron por unanimidad la declaración de tal emergencia. Tal vez los mismos burócratas federales que vieron los puentes rotos y las inundaciones de ríos como desastres finalmente entenderían que, bajo las reglas de la Asociación Federal de Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA, por sus siglas en inglés), se pueden declarar emergencias cuando un desastre es tan grave “que está más allá de las capacidades combinadas de los gobiernos estatales y locales para responder”. Tal vez finalmente entenderían que la catástrofe del alcantarillado en South Bay está mucho más allá de ese punto.\n\nPero la principal respuesta del gobernador inactivo Gavin Newsom fue con una foto de octubre en la frontera. Sin su apoyo, era poco probable que la Legislatura cambiara las mentes en la Casa Blanca de Biden. Ahora Donald Trump ha vuelto a la Casa Blanca, y las esperanzas de una declaración de emergencia federal parecen tan remotas como siempre, dado su afán por despreciar a California.\n\nLos habitantes de San Diego merecen algo infinitamente mejor. En cambio, como diría FEMA, este desafío ha estado “más allá de las capacidades combinadas” de nuestros líderes.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"Al menos 34,000 enfermedades solo en 2017 fueron vinculadas a la contaminación del agua en la zona.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/01/27/editorial-arreglar-la-pesadilla-del-alcantarillado-esta-mas-alla-de-las-capacidades-de-nuestros-lideres/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sut-l-1440565-coronado-sewage-0427-005.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:06:34","author":"San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board","authors":["San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":284549894,"title":"Remote and hybrid working reaches record high in Ireland despite pushback from employers","text":"Research also found that around 2.6% of all searches for Irish job postings contained remote or hybrid keywords as of the end of December, similar to levels prevailing since 2022 and up around tenfold on pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLeading the way on a European level, Ireland’s workforce transitioned to hybrid working at a greater rate than any other country in the European Union.\n\nThat is despite a series of high-profile return-to-office mandates across several large companies. \n\nIn September last year, PwC said that staff in Ireland were expected to be “in the office or at a client site at least three days a week,\" following changes in the firm's UK business mandating its 26,000 employees to spend more time in the office.\n\nSimilarly, Amazon, which is one of the world's largest employers, also announced in September that it would require staff to return to the office five days a week starting in January 2025.\n\nLatest census figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) report that the number of people working mainly from home increased by 173% between 2016 and 2022, from 94,955 workers to 259,467.\n\nIn addition, the CSO also said that nearly a third of Ireland’s workforce, or around 750,000 employees, worked from home at least one day a week.\n\nDespite companies’ best efforts, return-to-office mandates from employers have been met with pushback from employees, with many of those who have become accustomed to flexible working conditions unwilling to forgo new-found benefits.\n\nIn a survey last year conducted by EmployFlex, results indicated that all things being equal, 92% of employees would move from their current role for more flexibility in another position.\n\nHowever, as US President Donald Trump pushes to get federal workers back in the office, he may go further to also put pressure on US multinationals, which could have a knock-on effect on those companies with large Irish operations.\n\nSpeaking on its 2025 report, Indeed said the record level of remote and hybrid job postings suggests that offering job flexibility remains an important part of recruiting talent at a time when unemployment in Ireland remains well below 5%. \n\nThis is especially the case in key high-demand professional and tech categories including media & communications, where the share of remote or hybrid job postings is 43%, insurance, also at 43% and software development at 41%.\n\nThe tight Irish labour market also continues to support robust wage growth, according to the Trends Report as jobseekers retain leverage when it comes to both pay and benefits.\n\nPosted wage growth was 4.6% year-on-year in Ireland in December, having been running at 4% or above since the start of 2024. This is above the euro area average of 3.3%, Indeed added.\n\n“Despite global uncertainty, the Irish labour market continues to be resilient and, for now at least, looks on course to remain so in 2025,\" said Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Indeed. \n\n\"For jobseekers, that means they retain leverage when it comes to pay and benefits, as evidenced by robust wage growth and employers continuing to offer flexibility. \n\n\"Both pay and benefits remain important from an employers’ perspective not only in attracting talent but also for retaining existing staff, who may be difficult to replace given the tightness of the market and long-standing skill shortages in certain occupations.\"","summary":"The share of Irish job postings for remote or hybrid work rose to 17.5% at the end

President Trump, 78, and his wife Melania, 54, previously had respective portraits for his first term in office, which took place from 2017 to 2021.\n\nFollowing his inauguration a week ago for his second term, Melania has unveiled her new portrait. Released on Monday, it's said to have taken by photographer Régine Mahaux in the Yellow Oval Room of the residence in Washington, D.C..\n\nThe black-and-white portrait shows Melania posing in a black suit. Her outfit consists of a black jacket and matching trousers, which were accompanied by a white shirt for the occasion. The former model is seen with her hands on a table in front of her as she looks directly into the camera.\n\nA large glass window is seen behind her, offering views of the capital city, in the portrait released this week following her husband's inauguration last Monday. The Washington Monument appears visible in the background of the photo.\n\nThe portrait being in black-and-white provides a contrast to recent past portraits of the role, which have typically been in colour. Melania posed in a black outfit last time too, unlike predecessor Michelle Obama and successor Jill Biden, who both opted to wear blue for their respective portraits.\n\nThe release of Melania's latest portrait comes after she attracted attention over her choice of outfit for President Trump's inauguration last week. The occasion took place in the capital city and she was among those by her husband's side for it.\n\nAs previously reported, Melania - whose eponymous memoir was released just last year - was seen wearing a lengthy navy coat by designer Adam Lippes at the inauguration. She's said to have worn a skirt and ivory blouse underneath it. The First Lady accessorised with a hat, which was reportedly by designer Eric Javits, and a pair of black gloves, as part of her outfit for the event. The fashion ensemble drew approval from fans at the time.\n\nIt wasn't the only look sported by Melania last week that has made headlines though, as she later opted to wear a strapless white silk gown, which had black silk bands running down the front to create a monochrome effect, to the Commander-in-Chief Ball as part of the festivities. As reported at the time, Melania added a black ribbon choker with a diamond flower brooch to finish off that particular look for the event.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.","summary":"First Lady Melania Trump has unveiled her new official White House portrait following her husband President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington, D.C. last week","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/melania-trumps-new-first-lady-34563543","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34563696.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:02:59","author":"Joel Leaver","authors":["Joel Leaver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.245},{"id":284545280,"title":"Video does not display a U.S. military convoy traveling in Texas en route to the border.","text":"Since President Donald Trump took office on Monday, Jan. 20, his administration has issued multiple executive orders and proclamations aimed at overhauling U.S. immigration policies. \n\nThe Pentagon is deploying as many as 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border in the coming days, U.S. officials said on Wednesday, Jan. 22. VERIFY partner station KHOU reported on Jan. 24 that U.S. troops had already arrived in El Paso, Texas. \n\nAmid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, people on social media recently claimed a video shows a U.S. military convoy in Texas that’s headed to the southern border. One version of the video shared on TikTok has garnered over 700,000 likes and more than 200,000 shares.\n\nDoes this viral video show a U.S. military convoy in Texas heading to the southern border?\n\nNo, this video doesn’t show a U.S. military convoy in Texas heading to the southern border. The video shows Polish tanks and military vehicles during a military parade in Warsaw, Poland, and it predates President Trump’s second term. \n\nThe viral video does not show a U.S. military convoy in Texas heading to the southern border in the days after Donald Trump took office for his second term. The video shows Polish tanks and other military vehicles parading through Warsaw.\n\nSome of the earliest versions of this video that we found online were shared in August 2024 and identified the location as Warsaw, Poland.\n\nUsing footage forensics tools InVid and RevEye, VERIFY was able to find an early version of the video shared on X by Visegrád 24, an international news aggregator, on Aug. 18, 2024. The same landmarks and people wearing the same clothing are visible in both the viral video and the footage shared by Visegrád 24.\n\n“Poland bringing out their [sic] some of their tanks, IFVs and howitzers for the world to see during the annual military parade in Warsaw,” the Visegrád 24 post says.\n\nAnother X account shared the same video one day earlier, but miscaptioned it as the Polish army “preparing for war with Russia.” Misbar, an Arab fact-checking platform, debunked the claim on Aug. 20, 2024, and confirmed the video showed a military parade to celebrate Poland’s Armed Forces Day. \n\nPoland’s Armed Forces Day is held annually on Aug. 15 and commemorates Poland’s victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920, according to the U.S. Army website. \n\nPoland held a parade in its capital of Warsaw on Armed Forces Day in 2024, where more than 2,500 Polish troops joined dozens of U.S. and other allied soldiers to ride in military vehicles or tanks and fly fighter jets, the Associated Press reported. \n\nUsing Google Maps street view, we were also able to match structures and signs in the viral video to a street in Warsaw, Poland. \n\nAt the beginning of the video shared on social media, there’s a high-rise building in the distance. That same building is visible on Google Maps’ street view of the road in Warsaw.\n\nThree identical billboards and the same green bridge are also seen in both the viral video and Google Maps street view.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe viral video shows Polish tanks during a military parade in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Video does not display a U.S. military convoy traveling in Texas en route to the border. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/video-does-not-display-a-u-s-military-convoy-traveling-in-texas-en-route-to-the-border/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Video-doesnt-show-US-military-convoy-in.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-28 00:02:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":284546162,"title":"Trans runner brags about obliterating female rivals at race while wearing faulty shoes","text":"A transgender athlete has bragged about beating a group of biologically female athletes, despite wearing running shoes with the spikes about to come off. \n\nSadie Schreiner, formerly known as Camden, stormed to victory at a college track and field meet over the weekend, leaving the closest female runner in her wake. \n\nFollowing her win, Schreiner took to her Instagram where she boasted about the win.\n\n'Not the race I was looking for at all this week, my spikes nearly fell off on the turn and with a poor start my time wasn't nearly what I wanted The good news is that the season just started, and I'm going to leave everything on the track at nationals.'\n\nSchreiner's win is only the latest incidence of a growing number of transgender athletes finding success in women's sports, as experts warn they hold an unfair physical advantage due to the effects of male puberty. \n\nHer win drew backlash from Czech tennis legend Martina Navratilova who has been vocal about her views on transgender people participating in sports.\n\nNavratilova, a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights has consistently supported transgender individuals in their fight for equality and inclusion but has also stated how she only wants biological women to participate in women's sports.\n\n'So stunning and brave…' Navratilova tweeted with embarrassment and clown emojis.\n\nIn 2023, she sided with World Athletics for pushing for a policy omitting transgender female athletes from internationally-recognized women's competitions, calling it a 'step in the right direction.'\n\n'In the wake of World Athletics' announcement, I think the best idea would be to have ''biological female'' and ''biological girls'' categories and then an ''open'' category,' she wrote. \n\nOther users online were also quick to criticize Schreiner's gloating.\n\n'Imagine being a man flexing about beating female athletes,' wrote margotobrienn.\n\n'To some people sports is their life and these people are ruining it for them,' stated Napukka.\n\n'Congrats, dude. You beat a bunch of women. What an accomplishment,' mocked another poster. \n\n'Proud of you for beating women who are a foot shorter and 60lbs lighter with a 2ft smaller stride and half the muscle mass. You didn't look like you had it in you still. Shocked you had the balls to show up,' ridiculed a fourth. \n\nSchreiner, who is from Hillsborough, New Jersey, and specializes in 200 and 400-meter races is currently competing for the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in NCAA Division III track and field events while also pursuing a degree in photography.\n\nIn 2022, Schreiner was competing in the men's category of the 100m and finished in 19th place, but now since entering as a woman has placed far higher.\n\nSchreiner has been an advocate for transgender inclusion in sports. Last November, in an interview with CNN, she addressed the challenges and backlash faced by transgender athletes, emphasizing the importance of understanding and support.\n\nEarlier this month Schreiner shared her experiences in the NCAA transfer portal, highlighting difficulties in transferring to Division I programs because of her transgender identity. \n\nDespite interest from several schools, she noted that concerns about a potential backlash had led to hesitations from schools in extending offers to her.\n\nBut she may have to lower her expectations particularly with President Donald Trump now in charge who has stated how he will take action to 'keep men out of women's sports.'\n\nMany have blamed Democrats' support for transgender inclusion for Kamala Harris' election loss to Trump. \n\nTransgender rights have become a political hot button in recent years. Republicans at all levels campaigned on the issue in November's election, with particular focus on transgender women participating in school sports.\n\nTrump pledged during his campaign to restrict gender-affirming care and transgender sports participation.\n\nMillions were spent on advertising that turned something that in reality affects a tiny minority of competitors into a wedge issue.\n\nThe NCAA, for example, does not track data on transgender athletes among the 544,000 currently competing on 19,000 teams at various levels across the country, though NCAA president Charlie Baker testified in Congress last month that he was aware of less than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender. \n\nTrump ramped up the rhetoric as election day approached, telling the crowd at a Madison Square Garden rally in October: 'We will get ... transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women's sports.'\n\nTrump has also said he would cut federal funding to 'any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.' \n\nUnder the first Trump administration, the government interpreted 'sex' as the gender someone was assigned at birth and it appears the same is true under Trump 2.0.\n\nThe Biden administration chose to interpret sex as 'gender identity' under Title IX, which could be interpreted to protect trans athletes from being discriminated against if they wanted to participate in a sport that aligned with their gender identity, not their sex assigned at birth. \n\nThe NCAA established a policy in 2010 that requires trans athletes who were assigned male at birth to complete at least one year of testosterone suppression therapy before being eligible to compete on a women’s team. \n\nTrans athletes who were assigned female at birth and transitioned to male can compete on a men’s team but if they have received testosterone treatment are ineligible to compete on a women’s team.\n\nIn 2022, the NCAA revised the policy in what the organization called an attempt to be aligned with national sports governing bodies.","summary":"Transgender athlete Sadie Schreiner, who competes for the Rochester Institute of Technology, sparked controversy after winning a college track meet and boasting about her

comply with the UK’s online safety laws, once in force.\n\n“Under the Online Safety Act, tech firms must assess the risks they pose, including to children, and take significant steps to protect them.\n\n“That involves acting swiftly to take down illegal content – including illegal suicide and self-harm material – and ensuring harmful posts and videos are filtered out from children’s feeds.\n\n“We’ll soon put forward additional measures for consultation on the use of automated content moderation systems to proactively detect this kind of egregious content.\n\n“We are in contact with social media companies, including Meta, about the safety measures they have in place now, and what more they will have to do to comply once the duties are fully in force.\n\n“No one should be in any doubt about Ofcom’s resolve to hold tech firms to account, using the full force of our enforcement powers where necessary.”","summary":"The Molly Rose Foundation has warned social media risks

sector. If they are deported, it is going to affect all of us in terms of productivity and the prices of our food.\n\nDeportations will have negative effects in separating families and are considered cruel in every culture. It will affect our local economies by disrupting food supply chains, causing higher prices.\n\nDonald Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions will force many of the food system workers underground leading to wage and safety violations, sexual harassment and violence, and much more.\n\nLack of supply drives\nthe housing crisis\n\nRe: “Investors have created state’s housing crisis” (Page A6, Jan. 24).\n\nLetter-writer T.A. Barbella blames the housing crisis on investors scooping up all available homes.\n\nThe crisis is that housing, be it owner-occupied or rented, is unaffordably high. This stems from the lack of supply of all housing — basic economics.\n\nIt matters not whether the housing is owned or rented. Both prices and rents are unaffordable.\n\nIf we could dramatically increase the supply of housing relative to demand, prices and rents will necessarily fall.\n\nConversely, if suddenly 5 million or 10 million people depart California, prices and rents will plummet.\n\nCurrently, people want to live here and demand outstrips supply, driving the cost of housing up dramatically. That is the crisis in a nutshell.\n\nGary Miller\n\nBiden’s feckless policy\nlengthened Gaza war\n\nRe: “Trump as peacemaker is wishful thinking” (Page A6, Jan.24).\n\nAlan Price makes one accurate statement in his letter. The best thing that President Biden did was to include Donald Trump on his administration’s negotiating team. After months of futile negotiation, it was Trump’s threat of “all hell to pay” after Israeli neutralization of Hezbollah’s incursion threat that facilitated the truce, fragile as it is.\n\nBiden waffled between support and criticism of Israel almost daily since the October atrocity.\n\nBiden told Benjamin Netanyahu not to retaliate to the Hezbollah provocation. If that advice had been followed, Hamas would still be fighting with the expectation of Hezbollah support.\n\nBiden’s pivot to Asia policy followed by expressions of empathy with Gaza’s populace, along with ICC prosecution and student protests, constitute a propaganda victory emboldening Hamas.\n\nPermanent peace is not in the foreseeable future. Peace-through-strength policy might extend the ceasefire. Biden’s feckless empathy-based policy would only continue the bloodshed.\n\nFred Gutmann\n\nCeasefire offers chance\nto restart aid program\n\nRe: “Israel’s ceasefire deal with Hamas to take effect today” (Page A10, Jan. 19).\n\nAt last, there is a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

For decades UNRWA has provided food, health care, education and shelter to millions of Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, providing a lifeline to communities suffering the consequences of war and contributing to regional stability.\n\nAfter more than 15 months of war, Gaza lies in ruin and the people’s suffering continues. The need is great. Let’s join the global community and do our part. \n\nConnie Hunter","summary":"Also: Housing crisis &#124; Feckless policy &#124; Restart aid.

signal’ to Trump about dialogue – via a missile test","text":"North Korea’s latest missile test, its first since US President Donald Trump’s inauguration, appears to be an attempt to gauge Washington’s willingness to resume dialogue while taking aim at the recent US-South Korea joint military drills, according to analysts.\nThe launch was conducted under the supervision of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, whom Trump had earlier said he would reach out to, calling him and the hermit kingdom he leads a “nuclear power”.\nOn Saturday, North Korea reportedly carried out a “strategic” sea-to-surface cruise missile test, displaying the weapon’s capability to deliver nuclear weapons.\nYang Moo-jin, head of the University of North Korean Studies, called the move a “low-key provocative act” aimed at enhancing Pyongyang’s precision-strike capabilities, in contrast to testing long-range ballistic missiles designed for mass destruction.\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, North Korea’s foreign ministry accused the United States of provoking tensions through a series of military exercises with Seoul this month.\n“The reality stresses that the DPRK [North Korea] should counter the US with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK and this is the best option for dealing with the US,” the ministry said.\nIt also slammed a four-day joint air force exercise with the US in South Korea’s eastern city of Wonju and a recent trilateral joint air drill, also involving Japan, calling them a “grave challenge” to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe ministry warned that North Korea “will not permit the imbalance of strength … and will take the toughest counteraction to defend the sovereign right and security interests of the state and thoroughly ensure peace and stability in the region”.\nYang noted that the statement was issued by a senior foreign ministry official, rather than high-ranking figures such as Kim Yo-jong, the leader’s sister, as a way to “float a trial balloon”.\n“North Korea is sending a subtle signal to Washington that it should stop the joint drills with the South if it is really interested in resuming dialogue,” Yang told This Week in Asia.\nHong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said the missile test and the foreign ministry’s statement were aimed at retaliating against joint military drills while gauging the new US administration’s response.\nThe test also intended to further the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles as part of North Korea’s five-year military build-up plan, set to be completed this year, he said.\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that Pyongyang launched “several” cruise missiles towards its western waters from an inland location at about 4pm on Saturday.\nPyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency cited supreme leader Kim as saying that the country’s deterrence capabilities were being “perfected more thoroughly”.\nNorth Korea would make “strenuous efforts” to defend stability with “more powerfully developed military muscle”, Kim reportedly said.\n\nNorth Korea routinely condemns US military exercises with the South as invasion rehearsals, though Washington and Seoul maintain that the drills are defensive in nature.\nThe joint exercises have intensified as the US and South Korea seek to address North Korea’s advancing nuclear programme and its growing military cooperation with Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nTrump’s assumption of office for a non-consecutive second term raises the possibility of renewed diplomacy.\nDuring his first term, the US president met Kim three times in 2018-19, though their summits failed to produce significant results due to disagreements over US-led sanctions on North Korea.\nIn a Fox News interview last Thursday, Trump referred to Kim as “a smart guy”, saying he would reach out to him again.\n\nTrump’s recent remarks about North Korea being “a nuclear power” during an impromptu press conference at the Oval Office have also raised eyebrows in Seoul.\nThe US, South Korea and Western nations have historically avoided labelling Pyongyang a nuclear state to underscore efforts to curb its nuclear ambitions.\nBut Kim’s expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening ties with Russia could bolster his negotiating leverage in potential talks with Trump, observers say.\nLim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the missile test reflected North Korea’s confrontational approach despite Trump’s remarks suggesting openness to dialogue.\n“But Kim Jong-un is likely to perceive Trump’s comments as insincere as long as the US, South Korea and Japan continue their joint military exercises,” Lim said.\n“The ongoing war in Ukraine is likely to play a key role in shaping the conditions for a possible reopening of talks.”\nAt a year-end party plenum last month, North Korea announced what it described as the “most hardline” policy against the US, accusing the trilateral alliance involving South Korea and Japan of forming “an aggressive nuclear military bloc”.","summary":"The missile launch came on the heels of the newly inaugurated US president acknowledging Kim Jong-un’s hermit state as a nuclear

He rattled off concerns about inflation, tariffs, a higher deficit, and the potential for geopolitical unrest. It reminded me of two friends from the past who made similar mistakes.\n\nBack in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected, one friend was convinced that Obama’s policies would be too left-leaning and disastrous for the economy. Sure that disaster was imminent, he restructured his portfolio, shifting heavily into bonds, foreign stocks, cash, and gold. He even nicknamed it his “Obama Portfolio” and advised the rest of us to follow his lead. But as it turned out, his Obama Portfolio was a costly misstep. During Obama’s eight years in office, the S&P 500 gained an astonishing 235%, far outperforming the alternatives my friend had chosen.\n\nFast forward to 2016, and a similar story unfolded. Another friend, much like my hockey buddy, grew anxious about what Trump’s presidency might mean for the markets (I have friends on both sides of the political spectrum). She decided to play it safe, reducing her exposure to U.S. stocks sure that Trump’s unpredictable ways would tank stock returns. Yet, during Trump’s first term, the S&P 500 rose 83%.\n\nBoth friends let political fears dictate their investment strategies, and it hurt them in the long run.\n\nThese examples aren’t isolated. Since Jimmy Carter’s presidency in the 1970s, the S&P 500 has delivered double-digit annualized total returns in every presidential term except one—regardless of which party was in power. See below chart.\n\nThe stock market typically posts strong returns, regardless of who is in the White House\nSt. Louis Trust & Family Office. Data from The Financial Times\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSudden Fed ‘Financial Crisis’ Fear Sparks Huge Bitcoin And Crypto Price Crash Prediction\n\nSuper Bowl 2025: The Internet Is Furious\n\nAnother Ukrainian Brigade Is Disintegrating As It Deploys To Pokrovsk\n\nEven Carter’s inflation-heavy years saw the S&P 500 achieve an annualized return of nearly 13%. The lone exception? George W. Bush’s presidency, which delivered a -4.5% annualized return. But even that result largely reflects unfortunate timing: Bush’s presidency began at the peak of the dot-com bubble and ended during the depths of the Great Financial Crisis. While some might argue that Bush’s policies contributed to the crisis, he certainly wasn’t responsible for the dot-com bubble’s burst.\n\nThe conception that the stock market’s long-term performance hinges on who occupies the Oval Office simply isn’t true. The reality is far less dramatic. While elections can spark short-term market reactions, long-term equity returns are rarely reflective of a presidency. Consider this: despite their vastly different policies, the S&P 500’s annualized returns under Barack Obama and Donald Trump were identical at 16.3%.\n\nYes, presidential policies can influence the economy, which in turn impacts the stock market. But many other factors play a role, such as the normal ups and downs of the economic cycle, technological advancements, wars, and even pandemics. Market returns defy the fears and narratives stoked during election seasons.\n\nThe bottom line? Politics matter, but basing your investment decisions on who’s in the White House is not a winning strategy. History shows that markets tend to rise over time, regardless of political dynamics. Instead of reacting emotionally to elections, it’s far wiser to stick to a well-diversified, long-term investment plan. Politics may grab headlines, but when it comes to investing, the best approach is to keep calm and stay the course.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
