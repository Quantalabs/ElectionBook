It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, saying it hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024.\n\n“This means Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nHarvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, accounting for more than a quarter of its student body. Most are graduate students, coming from more than 100 countries.\n\nHarvard called the action unlawful and said it’s working to provide guidance to students.\n\n“This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission,” the university said in a statement.\n\nThe Trump administration’s clash with Harvard, the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university, has intensified since it became the first to openly defy White House demands for changes at elite schools it has criticized as hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism. The federal government has cut $2.6 billion in federal grants to Harvard, forcing it to self-fund much of its sprawling research operation. President Donald Trump has said he wants to strip the university of its tax-exempt status.\n\nThe administration has demanded records of campus protests\n\nThe threat to Harvard’s international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who demanded that it provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation.\n\nIn a letter to Harvard on Thursday, Noem said the school’s sanction is “the unfortunate result of Harvard’s failure to comply with simple reporting requirements.” It bars Harvard from hosting international students for the upcoming 2025-26 school year.\n\nNoem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus.\n\n“This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,” Noem said in a statement.\n\nThe action revoked Harvard’s certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which gives the school the ability to sponsor international students to get their visas and attend school in the United States.\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism, but warned it would not budge on its “its core, legally-protected principles” over fears of retaliation. He said he wasn’t aware of evidence to support the administration’s allegation that its international students were “more prone to disruption, violence, or other misconduct than any other students.”\n\nStudents in Harvard College Democrats said the Trump administration is playing with students’ lives to push a radical agenda and to quiet dissent. “Trump’s attack on international students is text book authoritarianism — Harvard must continue to hold the line,” the group said in a statement.\n\nThe administration drew condemnation from free speech groups, including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which said Noem is demanding a “surveillance state.”\n\n“This sweeping fishing expedition reaches protected expression and must be flatly rejected,” the group said in a statement.\n\nThe revocation opens a new front in a closely watched battle\n\nMany of Harvard’s punishments have come through a federal antisemitism task force that says the university failed to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence amid a nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nHomeland Security officials echoed those concerns in their Thursday announcement. It offered examples, including a recent internal report at Harvard, finding that many Jewish students reported facing discrimination or bias on campus.\n\nIt also tapped into concerns that congressional Republicans have raised about ties between U.S. universities and China. Homeland Security officials said Harvard provided training to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps as recently as 2024. As evidence, it provided a link to a Fox News article, which in turn cited a letter from House Republicans.\n\nAsked for comment on the alleged coordination with the Chinese Communist Party, a Harvard spokesperson said the university will be responding to the House Republicans’ letter.\n\nTed Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, called the latest action an “illegal, small-minded” overreach.\n\n“I worry that this is sending a very chilling effect to international students looking to come to America for education,” he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has leveraged the system for tracking international students’ legal status as part of its broader attempts to crack down on higher education. What was once a largely administrative database has become a tool of enforcement, as immigration officials revoked students’ legal status directly in the system.\n\nThose efforts were challenged in court, leading to restorations of status and a nationwide injunction blocking the administration from pursuing further terminations.\n\nGOP ‘big beautiful bill’ passes House: What’s in it, what it means for youLongtime foe of Donald Trump touts Justice Department investigation in political adTrump’s press secretary answers question from young girl: ‘How many people has he fired?’","summary":"The move would mean thousands of current students must transfer to other schools or leave the country.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/05/trump-takes-more-action-against-harvard-latest-move-could-affect-6800-students.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/5MQM2VNFMFGHDCMBG75XU5MHAA.jpg?auth=365282f379d43ca5af259d5cdccaa388b16dce9d46cdabe5a317a74ff2c8a76b&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 01:06:12","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":323898758,"title":"Oil falls on stronger US dollar, possibility of higher OPEC+ output","text":"Oil prices slipped on Friday, weighed down by a stronger U.S. dollar and the possibility that OPEC+ will further increase its crude oil output. \n\nBrent futures fell 37 cents to $64.07 a barrel by 0015 GMT.

Currently pegged at about £1,849 for a typical household after three consecutive hikes, the price cap is poised to drop, partly influenced by the market’s reaction to US President Donald Trump's tariff strategies, causing a significant decline in gas and oil prices. Initially, analysts predicted a 9 per cent dip in the Ofgem cap; however, a slight easing in trade tensions has tempered those expectations to around a 7 per cent decrease. Cornwall Insight forecasts that following this adjustment, consumers can anticipate a \"modest drop\" in October, with yet another similar fall in January of the following year. This forthcoming cut in energy tariffs will be welcomed by families who endured an \"awful April\" with rising costs all around, including Ofgem's last upward revision of the price cap by 6.4 per cent. Additionally, struggling households have faced the heftiest hike in water rates since at least February 1988, plus marked increases across council tax, mobile and broadband charges, and vehicle excise duties. Such increases in bills are reflected in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rocketing to 3.5 per cent in April, a jump from 3.2 per cent in March and marking the highest rate since January 2024. On Monday, Cornwall Insight's principal consultant Craig Lowrey stated: \"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs. \"It's a step in the right direction, but it should be taken in context. \"Prices are falling, but not by enough for the numerous households struggling under the weight of a cost-of-living crisis, and bills remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade. \"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many.\" Ofgem adjusts the price cap every quarter, predominantly reflecting fluctuations in wholesale market energy costs. The Government initiated the energy price cap in January 2019, designed to establish a ceiling on the rate energy suppliers can bill customers across England, Scotland, and Wales per kilowatt hour (kWh) of usage. Whilst the cap doesn't restrict overall bills, customers continue to pay based upon their actual energy consumption.","summary":"The price cap is currently set at around £1,849 for a typical household after three consecutive increases in bills.","url":"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/ofgem-set-lower-energy-price-31705587","image":"https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/article31705586.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Senior-woman-organizing-her-home-finances-and-looking-at-some-utility-bills.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:51:16","author":"Josie Clarke,William Morgan","authors":["Josie Clarke","William Morgan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.039},{"id":323900480,"title":"South Africans react to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s meeting with Trump (Video)","text":"South Africans expressed their support on Thursday for their President Cyril Ramaphosa after his confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Last week saw a development that future historians would probably describe as the beginning of the end of American hegemony of the world: the dollar fell after a rating downgrade by Moody’s. What is so special about a currency weakening after the issuing government’s credit rating goes down a notch, you might ask. After all, this routinely happens to countries and currencies that are unfortunate enough to suffer a rating downgrade. But this is the first time that has happened with the US. When S&P lowered the credit rating of US government bonds a notch in 2011, and when Fitch did the same in 2023, the dollar actually strengthened. The 10-year US government bond is the anchor of the global financial system; it tethers the value of the dollar vis-à-vis all other currencies. The bulk of world trade is invoiced and settled in dollars, whether the US is a buyer or a seller in the transaction. Of the world’s foreign exchange reserves of $12,750 billion, 53% is held in dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund’s COFER (Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves) database. The euro comes in as a distant second, at 18.6%. When the primary monetary instrument that determines the value of the world’s anchor currency undergoes a rating downgrade, it creates considerable nervousness in the world’s financial markets and triggers a fight-or-flight response. Fight in this context is rather nebulous. Flight is the easy option. And where to flee in times of financial uncertainty, other than to the safety of US Treasuries? That is the safe haven financial asset, apart from gold. So, when the US government paper was downgraded, capital rushed into the US government bond market from the rest of the world, strengthening the dollar. But this time has proved different. Changing Perception Of America The biggest difference is that the world sees the US being bent on self-harm, even as another major power, China, begins to outclass it in some sectors. The US is raising the costs of all industrial inputs with tariffs that are, on average, at least four times as high as they were before Trump assumed office, and could be significantly higher if Trump sticks to his plan to impose reciprocal tariffs. The US is defunding its universities, deporting immigrants, restricting the immigration of even the most qualified researchers, cutting off allies and sowing the seeds of lasting division in its society. In the short term, there could be higher prices and slower growth. The Budget that the US president Donald Trump administration has prepared and is currently making its way through Congress would present the rich with deep tax cuts and the less well-off with reduced Medicaid, and emaciated state capacity to deliver whatever welfare remains funded. Trump seeks to undo the industrial policy of his predecessor, through which he had sought to build new manufacturing capacity in the US in areas of advanced technology, whether semiconductors or decarbonisation. Even as Trump wants to cut the overall size of the Budget, he wants to increase military spending, including for a new ‘golden dome’, a missile defence system that could cover all of the US. The poor, a sizable section of whom voted for Trump, believing his promise to make America great again, are being asked to sacrifice welfare payments, so that America’s super-rich can get a permanent reduction in their tax burden. Trump and his family are winning new business orders and creating new businesses in different parts of the world, from Vietnam to Saudi Arabia. Trump has accepted an expensive gift from the Qatari regime, a presidential plane. The gift goes to the US department of defence as of now, but whether it would be handed over to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office is open to speculation. The economic fragility that Trumpian policies threaten, combined with the prospect of a huge fiscal deficit and steady rise in the national debt, has made capital flee the traditional safe haven of choice, when the rating downgrade struck. Back In India… Capital flowed into Indian stock markets, too. India’s reserves have risen, almost to the $700 billion mark. The rupee has strengthened. The forecast of a good monsoon, in terms of both total rain and likely spatial and temporal distribution of the rains, has raised hopes in India. The Purchasing Managers’ Index is on the rise, and the expectation of growth would surpass 6% this year and the next is taking root. Consumer price inflation is below 4%, the midpoint of the Reserve Bank of India’s target range. Wholesale price inflation is negligible.

The court’s three liberal justices dissented. \"Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency,\" Justice Elena Kagan wrote, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Kagan wrote that her colleagues were telegraphing what would happen. \"The impatience to get on with things—to now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also the most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover (and maybe ever)—must reveal how that eventual decision will go,\" she wrote. Lawyers for the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to either keep Wilcox and Harris off the job while the case moves through the lower courts, or to resolve the issue directly. They asked the justices to grant certiorari before judgment – a fast-track procedure the court uses occasionally to bypass the appeals process in cases of significant national importance. They urged that Wilcox and Harris not be reinstated to their positions, arguing in their reply brief that the \"costs of such reinstatements are immense.\" They argued that keeping both Wilcox and Harris in place would \"entrust\" the president's powers \"for the months or years that it could take the courts to resolve this litigation,\" something they said \"would manifestly cause irreparable harm to the President and to the separation of powers.\" \"The President would lose control of critical parts of the Executive Branch for a significant portion of his term, and he would likely have to spend further months voiding actions taken by improperly reinstated agency leaders.\" Earlier this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit voted 7–4 to restore Wilcox and Harris to their respective boards, citing Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States and Wiener v. United States – landmark rulings that upheld limits on the president’s power to remove members of independent federal agencies. The majority noted that the Supreme Court has never overturned the decades-old precedent upholding removal protections for members of independent, multimember adjudicatory boards – such as the NLRB and MSPB – and said that precedent supported reinstating Wilcox and Harris. It also rejected the Trump administration's request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed their removals to remain in place while the challenge proceeds in court. \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,\" judges noted in their opinion. The ruling would have temporarily returned Harris and Wilcox to their posts – but the victory was short-lived. The Trump administration quickly appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted an emergency administrative stay blocking their reinstatement. In their own Supreme Court filings, lawyers for Wilcox and Harris argued that the court should reinstate them to their roles on their respective boards until a federal appeals court can consider the matter. APPEALS COURT BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN'S DEPORTATION FLIGHTS IN ALIEN ENEMIES ACT IMMIGRATION SUIT Both Wilcox and Harris opposed the administration’s effort to fast-track the case, warning against skipping the normal appeals process and rushing arguments. \"Rushing such important matters risks making mistakes and destabilizing other areas of the law,\" Harris’s lawyers told the Supreme Court this week. Wilcox, the NLRB member, echoed this argument in her own brief to the high court. Counsel for Wilcox cited the potential harm in removing her from the three-member NLRB panel – which they argued in their filing could bring \"an immediate and indefinite halt to the NLRB’s critical work of adjudicating labor-relations disputes.\" \"The President’s choice to instead remove Ms. Wilcox does not bring the Board closer in line with his preferred policies; it prevents the agency from carrying out its congressionally mandated duties at all,\" they said. Harris and Wilcox's cases are among several legal challenges attempting to clearly define the executive's power. Hampton Dellinger, a Biden appointee previously tapped to head the Office of Special Counsel, sued the Trump administration over his termination. Dellinger filed suit in D.C. district court after his Feb. 7 firing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He had maintained the argument that, by law, he could only be dismissed from his position for job performance problems, which were not cited in an email dismissing him from his post. Dellinger dropped his suit against the administration after the D.C. appellate court issued an unsigned order siding with the Trump administration. The Justice Department, for its part, said in February a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that it was seeking to overturn Humphrey's Executor.

It also requires the government to provide children in its custody with adequate food, water and clean clothes.\n\nThe administration’s move to terminate the Flores agreement was long anticipated. In a court motion filed Thursday, the justice department argued that the Flores agreement should be “completely” terminated, claiming it has incentivized unauthorized border crossings and “prevented the federal government from effectively detaining and removing families”.\n\nDonald Trump also tried to end these protections during his first term, making very similar arguments.\n\nRelated: Ice arrests at immigration courts across the US stirring panic: ‘It’s terrifying’\n\nThe move to end protections follows a slew of actions by the Trump administration that target children, including restarting the practice of locking up children along with their parents in family detention. Immigration advocacy groups have alleged in a class-action lawsuit filed earlier this month that unaccompanied children are languishing in government facilities after the administration unveiled policies making it exceedingly difficult for family members in the US to take custody of them. The president and lawmakers have also sought to cut off unaccompanied children’s access to legal services and make it harder for families in detention to seek legal aid.\n\n“Eviscerating the rudimentary protections that these children have is unconscionable,” said Mishan Wroe, senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law. “At this very moment, babies and toddlers are being detained in family detention, and children all over the country are being detained and separated from their families unnecessarily.”\n\nThe effort to suspend the Flores agreement “bears the Trump administration’s hallmark disregard for the rule of law – and for the wellbeing of toddlers who have done no wrong”, said Faisal al-Juburi of the Texas-based legal non-profit Raices. “This administration would rather enrich private prison contractors with the $45bn earmarked for immigrant detention facilities in the House’s depraved spending bill than to uphold basic humanitarian protections for babies.”\n\nThe Trump administration in 2019 asked a judge to dissolve the Flores Settlement Agreement, but its motion was struck down. During the Biden administration, a federal judge agreed to partially lift oversight protections at the Department of Health and Human Services, but the agreement is still in place at the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencies.\n\n“Children who seek refuge in our country should be met with open arms – not imprisonment, deprivation and abuse,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law.\n\nThe settlement is named for Jenny Flores, a 15-year-old girl who fled civil war in El Salvador and was part of a class-action lawsuit alleging widespread mistreatment of children in custody in the 1980s.\n\nSince the settlement agreement was reached in 1997, lawyers and advocates have successfully sued the government several times to end the mistreatment of immigrant children. In 2018, attorneys sued after discovering unaccompanied children had been administered psychotropic medication without informed consent.\n\nIn 2024, a court found that CBP had breached the agreement when it detained children and families at open-air detention sites at the US southern border without adequate access to sanitation, medical care, food, water or blankets. In some cases, children were forced to seek refuge in portable toilets from the searing heat and bitter cold.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-seeks-end-basic-003749050.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a1fd9fd9cca82f18af0de18760be16e1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:37:49","author":"Maanvi Singh","authors":["Maanvi Singh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":323898052,"title":"US Court Allows Trump To Fire Independent Board Members -- But Not At Fed","text":"The US Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to fire leaders of two independent agencies, but signalled that such dismissals would not be permitted for the Federal Reserve.The 6-3 decision puts on hold a lower court's order that the two leaders be reinstated and marks a major win for Trump in his bid to greatly expand presidential power over historically independent government agencies.The case has been closely watched over what it could entail for the Fed, another independent agency whose rate-setting committee holds immense power in the world's biggest economy and whose chairman Trump has fiercely criticized.A decision permitting Trump to fire Federal Reserve board members could send shock waves rippling through the global economy, with the US central bank's independence thrown into question.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");But the court's six-member conservative majority appeared to carve out a special exemption for the central bank.The two agency heads who had sued Trump, alleging that their firings were illegal, had claimed that any decision to the contrary would also implicate the Federal Reserve.\"We disagree,\" said the majority.\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices added.The court nonetheless permitted Trump's firing of Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, both Democratic members of independent quasi-judicial labor boards, despite federal laws saying that they can only be dismissed for \"cause.\"Wilcox was a member of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which oversees unionization and other labor disputes from around the country.Harris was a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which protects federal workers from political discrimination and other unlawful employment practices.The conservative majority said that the Constitution allows Trump to \"remove without cause\" officials exercising executive authority on his behalf, \"subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.\"The Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented from the ruling, saying the two agency board members should be protected at this stage under a landmark 1935 decision.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"The US Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Donald Trump to fire leaders of two independent agencies, but signalled that such dismissals would not be permitted for the Federal Reserve.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-court-allows-donald-trump-to-fire-independent-board-members-but-not-at-fed-8484574","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/opaif3e_us-supreme-court-1200_625x300_21_June_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:33:06","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.02},{"id":323896350,"title":"Actor Zachary Levi Says Some In Hollywood Won't Work With Him Because Of Trump Support; So He's Leaving","text":"Zachary Levi works in the entertainment industry, known for its far-left politics, intolerance for different opinions and willingness to blackball or cancel people for speaking out. Levi, knowing the risk of doing so, made the brave decision in 2024 to openly support a politician who is openly hated by Hollywood: President Donald Trump. Trump is effectively the industry's biggest enemy; someone who actors like Robert De Niro, musicians like Bruce Springsteen, and corporate executives like Bob Iger or Jeffrey Katzenberg have either disparaged or publicly fought against. He spoke to Variety about what's happened to him in the aftermath of the election, while trying to keep working in a business that doesn't tolerate dissent. \"I know that there are people that would prefer not to work with me now because of my opinions. My team has let me know,\" Levi said about his representatives at United Talent Agency in Beverly Hills. \"They haven’t given me any specific names, but there are people who prefer not to work with me at this time. And it’s unfortunate. I knew that was probably going to happen. I didn’t make this decision blindly or casually.\" And the best part is? He doesn't even care. Zachary Levi Trying To Fix Entertainment Himself Levi told Variety that the entertainment business is in serious trouble, particularly Hollywood, after years of producing politically-motivated lectures that flopped at the box office. \"AI is about to be the nail in the coffin,\" he said. \"And we wonder why L.A. has become the Detroit of the entertainment industry.\" To combat this, Levi's in the midst of fundraising to complete an envisioned $100 million studio in Austin, Texas, with several 20,000 square-foot soundstages, along with some performance venues, hospitality options and a restaurant. If Hollywood won't work with you because of their shortsighted political extremism, leave Hollywood. \"Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks and all those O.G.s knew it over 100 years ago. Hollywood was broken then, and we needed a better system,\" he said about the entertainment industry. \"This industry is crumbling around us. In order for us to survive, we need to have a space for artists that will foster certified organic human-made content.\" Levi, in comparison to those on the political left in Hollywood like De Niro, or say, \"Snow White\" star Rachel Zegler, doesn't criticize others for having different beliefs. When Zegler said she hopes Trump supports \"never know peace,\" Levi didn't blame her. \"I am one of those people, obviously,\" he explained. \"But I think that we have got to recognize that a lot of times people’s decisions are predicated upon the bad information that they’re being fed on a regular basis. So should I hate her because she’s downstream of all of these voices that are telling her that he’s Hitler and the people who vote for him are Nazis? She’s a really talented girl, and I do think that she wants the best for the world deep down.\" Levi even wants his studio to promote a healthier work-life balance than traditional filmmaking, which is prone to absurd 16-18-hour work schedules. \"8- to 10-hour days,\" Levi said. \"And if we need to shoot two more weeks in order to make up those hours, then we’ll shoot two more weeks and figure it out in the budget.\" The fact that supporting Donald Trump is considered dangerous to keep working is inexcusable and out of step with how the vast majority of the country feels. But is it any surprise that an industry incapable of making content that the vast majority of the country wants to see would enforce such regressive discrimination? While the left rewards itself for its \"bravery\" in telling progressive stories, the real bravery is standing up to the bullies within Hollywood. That's exactly what Levi did. Hopefully he continues doing it, by showing them up from Texas.","summary":"Celebrity and actor Zachary Levi said that some individuals in Hollywood and the entertainment industry will no longer work with him because of his political views.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/zachary-levi-says-some-hollywood-wont-work-him-because-trump-support","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/10/gettyimages-2162323471.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:31:13","author":"Ian Miller","authors":["Ian Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.137},{"id":323896634,"title":"ET Explainer: What is Trump's Take it Down Act to tackle ‘revenge porn’","text":"US president Donald Trump on Monday signed the Take it Down Act, aimed at tackling non-consensual sexually explicit images, or “revenge porn”—whether real or AI-generated deepfakes—being published online. This comes as the internet has seen several high-profile cases of non-consensual deepfakes of popular celebrities being circulated online, while social media platforms like X and Meta have rolled back content moderation initiatives in countries like the US. ET’s Annapurna Roy explains what the new law does and what it means for these platforms.What does the law say?The law, officially called the Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilising Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks Act, makes it a federal crime in the US to knowingly publish intimate images – either authentic or computer-generated – of adults without their consent, as well as of minors.Those who publish such content of minors under the age of 18 can be fined and face up to three years in prison. Where the victims are adults, offenders face up to two years in prison.The Act also imposes penalties on those who threaten to publish such content.What did Trump say?“With the rise of AI image generation, countless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will. This is…wrong… Just so horribly wrong,” Trump said at the signing ceremony. The law will address this “abusive situation”, he said.First lady Melania Trump, who is said to have championed the bill, said AI and social media are addictive for the younger generation and that new technologies can be “weaponised”. With the law, vulnerable people can be “better protected from their image or identity being abused through non-consensual intimate imagery,” she said.What does it mean for online platforms?Platforms will have to remove such illegal content within 48 hours after a victim’s request. They will also have to make efforts to delete duplicates of this content.Critics, however, have argued that measures such as the takedown provision may be misused.Further, given the short window to take content down, platforms, especially smaller ones, may not be able to verify claims adequately, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Platforms may be forced to weaken encryption to be able to monitor and flag such content better and use flawed technology to crack down on duplicates.","summary":"President Trump has signed the Take it Down Act, a federal law criminalising the publication of non-consensual intimate images, including deepfakes.

US President Donald Trump has reviewed relations with Russia, realizing that Washington's foreign policy has reached an impasse due to numerous attempts to impose democracy by military means, said Andrey Sushentsov, Dean of the MGIMO School of International Relations.\n\n\"Trump accuses the NATO allies of dragging the United States into the Ukrainian crisis, which has nothing to do with American national interests. In his opinion, the strategy of liberal democratization is false. It was based on the experience of the post-war occupation of Germany, Japan, and South Korea, when the countries abandoned foreign policy subjectivity for the sake of American capital, but achieved economic prosperity. They tried to apply this experience mechanically to other regions, including the Middle East. But last week in Saudi Arabia, Trump said that this idea was not working, the United States had lost trillions of dollars and decades on a dead-end strategy of the early 2000s - the invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria,\" Sushentsov, who is also member of the Expert Council at the Russian Security Council, told TASS.\n\n\"The American leader actually recognizes the existence of a multipolar world. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar have become centers of influence not because of democratization, but in spite of it. This criticism is knocking the ground out from under the Europeans. Their strategy is based on the idea that Russia allegedly cannot be a democracy and therefore must be isolated. While Trump believes that not everyone is obligated to copy Western democracy. This is a blow for Europe. With their inability to pursue an independent foreign policy, they view this as a betrayal by the United States.\"\n\nAccording to Sushentsov, \"the American leader understands that if the United States follows the path of sanctions and confrontation with Russia imposed by the Europeans, it will inevitably be defeated in the Ukrainian crisis. Trump rightly calls the conflict [former President Joe] Biden's war and emphasizes that he inherited it and did not start this conflict. This is why Trump ignores the Europeans, does not allow them to impose their point of view on him.\n\n\"Trump is also aware that the actions of the United States have made a strategic partnership between Russia and China inevitable. But at the same time, he sees Russia not as an object of pressure, but as a rival to be reckoned with. In the big politics of the 21st century, according to Trump and his voters, those who are able to act independently will compete. These are the US, China and Russia. He does not consider Europe to be such a player. Trump is ready to meddle with the Europeans, trip them, split them, threaten to withdraw from the participants in the Ukrainian conflict,\" the expert concluded.","summary":"According to Sushentsov, \"the American leader actually recognizes the existence of a multipolar world\"","url":"https://tass.com/world/1962237","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_eng.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:27:01","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":323894596,"title":"‘Distressing for Australian students’: Trump blocks Harvard’s international enrolments","text":"Boston: US President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students and is forcing existing students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status, while also threatening to expand the crackdown to other schools.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered the termination of Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, the department said in a statement.

Sonya Sharp said she doesn’t believe it was entirely a result from the ongoing work at the city, pointing to the low survey numbers from last year.\n\n“In the fall, we were pretty close to rock bottom on some of those numbers so you can only go up from there,” she said. “There are some fantastic numbers in there around safety and trust and confidence, but we can always do better.”\n\nSeventy per cent of Calgarians said they felt satisfied with how city administration is running the city, but those numbers narrow when focused solely on city council.\n\nThe survey showed 52 per cent of Calgarians are satisfied with city council’s performance, up six per cent from the fall, while dissatisfaction with council fell six per cent to 48 per cent.\n\nIn response, the mayor said improving those figures comes down to communication.\n\n“Could I have been doing more in the first three years that I was mayor? Absolutely, I could have been,” Gondek said. “It’s important to be honest, and to make sure that you’re delivering that message that we are leading the city towards stability.”\n\nAccording to pollster Janet Brown, the numbers in the survey appear quite favourable for the City of Calgary, but notes the context of when the survey was conducted.\n\nThe report itself shows the survey was in the field when U.S president Donald Trump announced intentions to introduce tariffs on Canadian goods, as well as when Mark Carney was sworn in as Prime Minister.\n\n“Calgarians have a lot of reasons to be cranky, but right now their anger is focused at the federal government and they’re worried about U.S.-Canada relations,” Brown said.\n\n“Maybe in an environment like this, it’s a good thing for the city because Calgarians are directing their ire elsewhere.”\n\nIpsos Public Affairs interviewed 2,500 Calgarians over the phone from Feb. 27, 2025 to March 24, 2025, and the survey has a margin of error of ± 2.0 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.","summary":"The majority of Calgarians feel satisfied quality of city services but less than half, or 46 per cent, of Calgarians feel they get good value for their property taxes. ","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11192799/calgarians-quality-of-life-council-taxes/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/satisfaction00000001.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:16:21","author":"Adam MacVicar","authors":["Adam MacVicar"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":323894686,"title":"Ofgem to confirm new energy price cap for UK households with bills falling 7 per cent","text":"Ofgem is set to announce an anticipated decrease in household energy bills by about 7 per cent from July, with its latest price cap update due later today. The typical bill is likely to drop by £129 to £1,720 annually as the regulator introduces a new price cap on energy companies' per-unit charges. Presently, the energy price cap stands at approximately £1,849 for a typical household after three successive rises in energy bills. Triggered by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies, a marked decline in global gas and oil prices is expected to drive the price cap down. Despite this, the anticipated reduction is somewhat lower than the initially predicted 9 per cent decrease, tempered by recent relaxations in trade tensions. Cornwall Insight anticipates that after the forthcoming reduced price cap, there will be a \"modest drop\" come October and another comparable fall in January next year. The news of potential cuts in energy expenditures will offer some solace to households that have endured an \"awful April\" of increased charges, inclusive of Ofgem's last 6.4 per cent price cap hike. Struggling households are also contending with the largest surge in water bills since at least February 1988, not to mention significant hikes in council tax, mobile and broadband fees, as well as road tax. Such inflation of bills has contributed to Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation soaring to 3.5 per cent in April, a significant leap from the 2.6 per cent seen in March, marking the highest level since January 2024. Craig Lowrey, a principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, welcomed the recent drop in the energy price cap on Monday, stating: \"The fall in the price cap is a welcome development and will bring much-needed breathing space for households after a prolonged period of high energy costs.\" He cautioned, \"It's a step in the right direction, but it should be taken in context.\" Lowrey highlighted that despite falling prices, the relief might not be sufficient, saying, \"Prices are falling, but not by enough for the numerous households struggling under the weight of a cost-of-living crisis, and bills remain well above the levels seen at the start of the decade. \"As such, there remains a risk that energy will remain unaffordable for many.\" The energy price cap, which Ofgem adjusts every three months, is influenced mainly by the wholesale market costs of energy. Introduced by the Government in January 2019, the energy price cap sets a limit on the rate energy suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland, and Wales per kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy used. However, it does not cap total bills outright, as consumers still pay based on their energy usage.","summary":"The energy price cap is expected to be cut by around £129 when the new limit comes into force in July","url":"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/ofgem-confirm-new-energy-price-31705585","image":"https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/article31705584.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Teenage-girl-looking-at-energy-bill-standing-by-radiator-heater.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:12:38","author":"Josie Clarke,William Morgan","authors":["Josie Clarke","William Morgan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":323889442,"title":"Capistrano Unified school board majority votes for resolution opposing trans athletes in girls’ sports","text":"After several hours of impassioned testimony, board member clashes and tense public outbursts, the Capistrano Unified School District board approved a resolution calling for “fairness in girls’ sports” by opposing the participation of transgender athletes in women’s athletic competitions.\n\nThe 4-2-1 vote on Wednesday, May 21, comes amid a broader debate that has increasingly played out in school board chambers across the region and country. Capistrano Unified, the largest district in Orange County, is believed to be the first OC district to adopt such a resolution.\n\nIt calls on governing bodies, including the California Interscholastic Federation, or CIF, to ensure fairness in girls’ sports. Specifically, it:\n\n• Asserts that biological differences between male and female athletes can create inherent advantages in competitive sports.\n\n• Expresses concern that allowing transgender girls to compete in cisgender girls’ categories may compromise fairness, safety and equal opportunity.\n\n• Directs district staff to send copies to Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state legislature, the California Department of Education and CIF to “demonstrate CUSD’s commitment to protecting female student athletes.”\n\nSupporters of the resolution, including several student athletes in the district, argued the resolution was about preserving opportunities, safety and fairness for girls in sports.\n\n“As a high school athlete, I would never have been able to compete against my male friends in any sport I participated in. We’re simply made different. We should not expect our girls to compete against biological boys,” said Trustee Lisa Davis, who backed the resolution. “This isn’t fairness. This is favoritism toward ideology over biology.”\n\nTrustee Lisa Zollinger said every child, regardless of their gender identity, deserves to feel safe and valued at school, yet at the same time, she recognizes the importance of fairness and protecting Title IX, a federal civil rights law passed in 1972 that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education.\n\n“I wish as a district we could come up with some type of a solution for these kids that want to play sports. I would love to have a league for trans kids, or have something that we could do,” Zollinger said. “I want to support and love all these kids, but we have to get back to fairness and safety.”\n\nOpponents said the resolution was unnecessary, divisive and harmful, especially in a district where, according to trustees and confirmed by a district spokesperson, no transgender students are currently participating in athletics and no formal complaints have been filed.\n\n“This harms connectedness for some kids,” Trustee Gila Jones said, urging her colleagues to delay the vote and instead workshop the topic in a more collaborative setting. “Contentiousness on the board doesn’t move the needle for kids.”\n\nThe resolution, officially titled “Supporting Title IX and Fairness in Girls’ Interscholastic Sports,” reflects a national flashpoint fueled by President Donald Trump, who repeatedly made the issue a talking point in his bid to return to the White House, framing transgender athletes’ participation in women’s sports as a matter of fairness and safety.\n\nIn February, he signed an executive order against transgender athletes competing in women’s sports.\n\nNewsom, to an extent, has also raised concerns about transgender athletes competing against biological women, which has drawn criticism from the LGBTQ community and within his own party. In the first episode of his new podcast, “This Is Gavin Newsom,” he said the issue is one of “fairness.”\n\nWhen asked by right-wing activist Charlie Kirk whether he would speak out against transgender athlete AB Hernandez, a Jurupa Valley High School senior who had just won a girls’ triple jump event at the Ontario Relays invitational in February, Newsom said he believes “it’s deeply unfair.”\n\n“I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness,” he told Kirk.\n\nEarlier this month, Hernandez won the girls’ triple jump at a track meet held at Yorba Linda High School, and also placed third in the long jump and eighth in the high jump. Protesters showed up at the meet over her participation, including Chino Valley Unified board president Sonja Shaw, who’s also running for the California schools chief post.\n\nAhead of the meet, JSerra Catholic High School, Orange Lutheran and Crean Lutheran sent a letter to CIF challenging state policy that allows students to compete in sports based on their gender identity.\n\n“If leaders as different as Trump and Newsom can agree that fairness is at stake, we should be able to as well,” Capo Unifieid Trustee Davis said.\n\nSuperintendent Chris Brown said the resolution “does not change our policies in any shape or form.” District spokesperson Ryan Burris added that the resolution “does not relieve us of our responsibility to follow applicable state and federal laws.”\n\nBut the symbolism was enough to ignite fierce debate.\n\n“The consequences, of course, will be division in the community as you’re seeing in the public right now and in the media,” Brown said when asked about the consequences of passing the resolution.\n\nDavis argued that the resolution is “not about exclusion,” but about fairness, and that it’s “not anti-anyone.”\n\nBut several speakers, including longtime residents of the district and a local law professor, disagreed.\n\nSusan Keller, a professor at Western State College of Law in Irvine, argued that while the resolution isn’t enforceable, it sends a message that transgender, nonbinary and intersex students don’t exist or that their identities aren’t valid.\n\nSherine Smith, a former Capistrano teacher and former Laguna Beach Unified School District superintendent, said the meeting’s tone left her heartbroken.\n\n“What we saw tonight was really divisive. You have the opportunity to build bridges. You have the opportunity to build trust, to expand feelings of inclusion, to help people feel that they belong in this district,” she said.\n\nCapistrano is not alone in wading into this debate.\n\nIn Santa Ana Unified, the school board voted this week to censure Trustee Brenda Lebsack, accusing her of making anti-trans public comments.\n\nDuring an April 22 meeting — while the board was honoring Arab American Heritage Month — Lebsack thanked a local Muslim resident for organizing an interfaith clergy gathering, saying the group discussed issues that “impact their families, cultural and religious values,” including opposition to transgender athletes competing in women’s sports.\n\nLebsack began her comments by noting, “Since 93% of Arabs are Muslim,” which the rest of the trustees said effectively conflated an entire faith with opposition to transgender inclusion in athletics.\n\nBoard President Hector Bustos said the censure was about making clear that Lebsack’s views “are not a reflection of our school district.”\n\nBut Lebsack said she’s being accused of transphobia for advocating her personal belief that female athletes have a right to fair and safe competition.\n\n“I was very shocked that this would have such a strong outcry, and I believe a lot of people believe that way, that they want to protect girls’ spaces,” she said.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, a resolution supporting “policies that restrict participation in women’s sports to athletes who are biological females” failed in a recent 3-2 vote. Supporters there said it was about common sense and standing up for girls, while opponents warned it would violate California law.\n\nCIF spokesperson Rebecca Brutlag said the agency “does not collect data” on transgender athletes, but pointed to California law, which allows students to participate in school activities in accordance with their gender identity.\n\n“The CIF provides students with the opportunity to belong, connect and compete in education-based experiences in compliance with California law,” Brutlag said, “consistent with the student’s gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the student’s records.”\n\nSimilar measures aimed at keeping transgender athletes out of women’s sports have been passed by several other school boards in California, including those in Chino Valley, Temecula Valley and Redlands.","summary":"The resolution does not change district policy.

Mr Lischinsky had reportedly bought an engagement ring and was planning to propose to Ms Milgrim during a trip to Jerusalem next week. \n\nThe targeted event was an annual reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for young Jewish professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.\n\nThe suspect, Chicago man Elias Rodriguez, was arrested at the scene – shouting “Free, free Palestine” as he was handcuffed. The 31-year-old has been charged with murder of foreign officials and other crimes. \n\nRodriguez told police after his arrest: “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza.” \n\nIn a video statement overnight, Mr Netanyahu described Rodriguez as a “terrorist who cruelly gunned them down … for one reason and one reason alone – he wanted to kill Jews”.\n\n“(‘Free Palestine’) is exactly the same chant we heard on October 7th,” the Israeli Prime Minister continued, referring to the 2023 date when Palestinian militant group Hamas raided the nation, killing 1200 people and taking 240 hostage. \n\nIsrael’s aggressive and relentless retaliatory campaign in Gaza has led to the deaths of at least 53,655 Palestinians and wounded 121,950, according to the latest figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry. \n\nIn the wake of October 7, Mr Netanyahu said, then-Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz compared Hamas to the Nazis. \n\n“He was right. And if they could get away with it, these Hamas terrorists would have slaughtered every last Jew on earth,” the Prime Minister claimed. \n\n“For these neo-Nazis, ‘Free Palestine’ is just today’s version of ‘Heil Hitler’. \n\n“They don’t want a Palestinian state. They want to destroy the Jewish state. They want to annihilate the Jewish people, who have been in the Land of Israel for 3500 years.” \n\nAccording to The Times of Israel, Mr Lischinsky was Christian. He also held a German passport. \n\nIsrael blames Europe after embassy staff shot dead\n\nMr Netanyahu also accused the leaders of countries that support a two-state solution – specifically Britain, Canada and France – of “reward(ing) these murderers with the ultimate prize”. \n\n“When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you’re on the wrong side of justice,” he continued. \n\n“You’re on the wrong side of humanity and you’re on the wrong side of history.” \n\nIsrael’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also blamed European criticism of his country’s stepped-up Gaza offensive, claiming “a direct line connecting anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli incitement to this murder”. \n\n“This incitement is also done by leaders and officials of many countries and international organisations, especially from Europe,” he said.\n\nThe accusation, French Foreign Ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine said, was “completely outrageous and completely unjustified”. \n\nTensions have risen in the United States and many other countries over the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza, with pro-Palestinian activists decrying what they say is the intolerable human cost of the military offensive.\n\nBritain and France – who have stepped up their criticism of Israel’s actions – were among those condemning the shooting, as well as Germany and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIsrael’s consul in New York City also sought to draw a link between the shooting and US student protests against the war in Gaza, which he painted as “unprecedented riots organised by terrorists”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said that the shooting was “based obviously on antisemitism” in a post on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!,” the President wrote. \n\nThe shooting came just days after 23 countries, including Australia, condemned Israel’s pledge to “take control” of Gaza, urging the nation to allow aid to flow in via IDF-controlled checkpoints after blocking humanitarian assistance into the war zone for months. \n\nIsrael allowed five aid trucks into Gaza on Monday – the first since it started blocking shipments on March 2. Mr Netanyahu said his government was committed to preventing starvation conditions in Gaza, but wanted to ensure aid could not be “looted” by Hamas. \n\nThe new “method is distribution points that are secured by the IDF, preventing Hamas’ access and allowing American companies to distribute the food and medicine aid to the population”. \n\nIn a joint statement signed alongside her counterparts in major democratic nations, including the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she could not support the “new model” and that humanitarian aid should not be subject to political or military conditions. \n\nThe ministers warned food, medicine and essential supplies are now “exhausted” and Gazans face starvation.\n\n“As humanitarian donors, we have two straightforward messages for the Government of Israel: allow a full resumption of aid into Gaza immediately and enable the UN and humanitarian organisations to work independently and impartially to save lives, reduce suffering and maintain dignity,” the statement read. \n\n“We remain committed to meeting the acute needs we see in Gaza.\n\n“We also reiterate our firm message that Hamas must immediately release all remaining hostages and allow humanitarian assistance to be distributed without interference.” \n\nThe statement ended with a call for an immediate return to a ceasefire and the implementation of a two-state solution.","summary":"Benjamin Netanyahu has erupted after two Israeli embassy staffers were killed in Washington DC.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/benjamin-netanyahu-compares-shooters-cry-of-free-palestine-to-yelling-heil-hitler/news-story/c13f6245a9572e5a0ffc93e023e3c66a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/02596a55dd837b20009608251bb02260","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:09:20","author":"Natalie Brown","authors":["Natalie Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.042},{"id":323882400,"title":"Crypto industry leaders fear Trump’s putting personal profits first","text":"It seems like a triumph for a cryptocurrency industry that has long sought mainstream acceptance: Top investors in one of President Donald Trump ‘s crypto projects invited to dine with him at his luxury golf club in Northern Virginia on the heels of the Senate advancing key pro-crypto legislation and while bitcoin prices soar.\n\nBut Thursday night’s dinner [this morning, Macau time] for the 220 biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin has raised uncomfortable questions about potentially shadowy buyers using the anonymity of the internet to buy access to the president.\n\nWhile Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president’s push into meme coins isn’t helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses.\n\nAfter feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry has quickly become a dominant political force, donating huge sums to help Trump and crypto-friendly lawmakers.

It’s around half of the almost 200 trucks that have entered the enclave since Israel ended its nearly three-month blockade of the Strip, which have yet to reach Palestinians.“The shipments from yesterday is limited in quantity and nowhere near sufficient to meet the scale and scope of Gaza’s 2.1 million people,\" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.During the latest ceasefire, 600 trucks were crossing into Gaza daily carrying food, fuel, crucial aid and medical supplies.The Israeli military agency in charge of transferring aid to Gaza, COGAT, said on Thursday however that there are no food shortages in Gaza.“According to our current assessment, there is no food shortage in Gaza at this time,” COGAT said in a statement on X.International humanitarian organisations reject this statement, with many calling the aid arriving in Gaza at the moment as a “drop in the ocean” of what’s needed to satisfy the needs of residents.This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu allowed the flow of aid at “minimal” levels in order to preserve US and allies’ support as international criticism on his government’s conduct of war mounted.In a televised press conference on Wednesday, the Israeli leader noted that his government’s war on the enclave will not end until Israel achieves all of its military objectives.The Israeli premier said he was open to another temporary truce to release the remaining hostages, but stressed the ultimately, the war will resume.Netanyahu emphasised that fighting will only cease after Hamas releases all the remaining hostages, steps down from power, dismantles, disarms and leaves Gaza.He also announced that long-term plans include the implementation of US President Donald Trump’s controversial post-war plan to relocate the territory's 2.1 million population to neighbouring countries. Trump also said that the US would then “take ownership” of Gaza.The Palestinians, along with nearly all of the international community, have rejected Trump’s proposal to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population and place the territory under Washington’s control.The war began when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people, most of them civilians. Hamas took 251 people as hostages, and is currently holding 58, of whom 20 are believed to be alive.A subsequent Israeli offensive has to date killed more than 53,762 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry whose figure does not distinguish between fighters and civilians.","summary":"Palestinians say one of the two remaining hospitals in northern Gaza was struck on Thursday, causing extensive damage.

Levi and Zegler co-starred in \"Shazam! Fury of The Gods\" in 2023. \"But I think that we have got to recognize that a lot of times people’s decisions are predicated upon the bad information that they’re being fed on a regular basis,\" Levi said. ACTOR ZACHARY LEVI ENCOURAGES 'CLOSETED CONSERVATIVES' IN HOLLYWOOD TO SPEAK OUT: 'IT'S NOW OR NEVER' Zegler has been at the center of a public firestorm over the past few years, after making several political and controversial statements throughout the production of Disney's recent live-action \"Snow White\" remake. In one instance, Zegler criticized the original animated \"Snow White\" for its more traditional values. She called to \"Free Palestine\" while promoting the film’s trailer, which ignited backlash for her and Disney. After Donald Trump won the 2024 election, she condemned his voters. \"May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace,\" she posted on social media shortly after the Trump's victory, adding \"F--- Donald Trump.\" She later apologized for her comment. Zegler’s outspokenness was seen as a major factor that contributed to the remake of \"Snow White\"’s dismal box office performance earlier this year. ‘SNOW WHITE' REBOOT STAR RESPONDS TO BACKLASH OVER HER COMMENTS CRITICIZING ORIGINAL 1937 FILM: ‘MADE ME SAD’ Despite Zegler’s comments about Trump voters, Levi told Variety he didn’t hold them against her. \"So should I hate her because she’s downstream of all of these voices that are telling her that he’s Hitler and the people who vote for him are Nazis? She’s a really talented girl, and I do think that she wants the best for the world deep down,\" he said. Variety also detailed how Levi’s political coming out was hard for many of his Hollywood friends to accept. He created controversy in Hollywood with his public skepticism of the COVID-19 vaccine, and generated further outrage by becoming an RFK Jr. supporter, and ultimately a Trump supporter, after Kennedy threw his support behind the GOP nominee.

He sometimes can be more of a bleeding-heart liberal than I am, which shocks me. Zach walks the walk in a lot of ways better than me.\" On the other hand, Levi’s Broadway co-star Laura Bananti wants nothing to do with him after he suggested the death of a fellow castmate was exacerbated by the COVID vaccine. Variety recalled how after Levi made the suggestion, she said on a podcast, \"I never liked him. Everyone was like, ‘He’s so great!’ And I was like, ‘No, he’s not. He’s sucking up all the f---ing energy in this room.

They regularly cooperate in joint training exercises, strategic dialogues and bilateral agreements aimed at strengthening maritime security and promoting a rules-based maritime order.\nHowever, Huang pointed to the uncertainty of further defence and security alignments between the United States and New Zealand “given the change of administration in Washington”.\nLast month, New Zealand signed a Status of Visiting Forces Agreement with the Philippines – a US ally – regulating the deployment of troops for joint military exercises.\nThe agreement marked a milestone in relations between Wellington and Manila after New Zealand join the Philippines and other countries last year for multilateral maritime drills in the South China Sea.\n\nUnder the Defence Capability Plan released last month, New Zealand committed NZ$12 billion (US$7.1 billion) of funding over the next four years, including NZ$9 billion of new spending.\nThe plan will raise the country’s defence spending from just over 1 per cent of its gross domestic product to over 2 per cent in the next eight years.\n“Global tensions are increasing rapidly, and New Zealand has stepped up on the world stage, but our current defence spending is simply too low,” Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said in early April.\nGlobal tensions are increasing rapidly, and New Zealand has stepped up on the world stage, but our current defence spending is simply too low\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon\nOn whether Wellington’s defence policy had turned muscular, Alexander Tan, principal research fellow and founder of the Institute for Indo-Pacific Affairs in Christchurch, said that defence had “atrophied” since 2001 when then-prime minister Helen Clark’s government abolished the fighter wing of New Zealand’s air force.\nClark’s government estimated that disbanding the combat force would free up NZ$870 million over 10 years, to be reallocated to other areas of the country’s military.\n“Subsequent governments have not kept up defence spending to the basic maintenance level,” Tan said. “If muscular means to grow some muscle after years of malnutrition and being ‘bedridden’ then I guess it is becoming more muscular.”\nThe Defence Capability Plan built upon the previous 2019 version, most notably by increasing the overall investment in defence capabilities and prioritising the development of new and enhanced capabilities.\nSo while recent events such as China’s live-firing may not have a bearing on Wellington’s defence plans, they have, according to Tan, “certainly helped in pushing some of these plans along”.\n“And certainly public opinion, though still divided, has slowly been more in favour of increasing defence spending.”","summary":"New Zealand has committed to US$7.1 billion in defence spending over the next four years in response to rising global tensions.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3311335/us-warships-new-zealand-visit-sign-deep-ties-amid-trump-era-uncertainty","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/05/22/22d51a86-85c1-4fa3-97c2-bb847885c154_41730e9a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-23 00:00:13","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.385},{"id":323884656,"title":"World News | Senate Votes to Block California's Rule Banning the Sale of New Gas-powered Cars by 2035","text":"Washington, May 23 (AP) The Senate voted on Thursday to block California's first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration has doubled down on fossil fuels. The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month. Also Read | Indian Government's Hiring of Lobbying Firms in US Not a New Practice, Says MEA. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place. “This is not about electric vehicles,” Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. “This is about polluters being able to pollute more.” Also Read | US: Tennessee Inmate Oscar Smith Executed by Lethal Injection for Killing Estranged Wife, Her 2 Sons in 1989. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes. The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California's longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11 per cent of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends — especially because about a dozen states have already followed California's lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions. Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.\" “What we have at stake is a state's ability, it's right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said. Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation's energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate. “America cannot meet these impossible standards –- not next year, and not in 10 years,” said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican. Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold. The Biden administration approved the state's waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles. Biden's EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act. Republicans have long criticized California's waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California's policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent. Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort. Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California's laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.” Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.” John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles. “The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,\" Bozzella said.

A Reuters/Ipsos survey places him even lower, with just 42% approving and 52% disapproving of his performance. Despite a tough-on-immigration strategy that once helped him retake the White House, economic worries are now eclipsing his border security agenda.“When you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner,” said political analyst Daron Shaw, who noted that immigration is fading from the list of top concerns—particularly for independents and Democrats.Border bump, economic dragTrump still enjoys relatively strong support for his handling of immigration (50%) and border security (56%), per the Marquette poll. But his April announcement of sweeping tariffs triggered a stock market sell-off, heightened recession fears, and hurt his standing on the economy—just as inflation remains a top issue for voters.Only 37% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of tariffs and 34% of his efforts on inflation and cost of living. A mere 39% back his overall economic policy, according to recent surveys.“The main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven’t lowered, and polls are reflecting that,” said Republican strategist Doug Heye.Even among conservatives, frustration is growing. “Prices haven’t come down, and it’s not clear that people will say the absence of inflation is an economic victory,” added Shaw.Fixated on Biden, deflecting blameDespite his return to power, Trump has not stopped targeting his predecessor. In just over three months, he has mentioned Biden an average of six times a day, blaming him for everything from high grocery prices to America’s role in the Russia-Ukraine war.During a cabinet meeting, Trump insisted that a first-quarter GDP dip was “Biden’s fault,” denying that his own tariffs played a role. Conservative influencer Dave Portnoy, typically a Trump ally, pushed back:\"The stock market is a direct reflection of Trump’s first 100 days... This is his market, not Biden’s.\"Still, Trump remains defiant. On Truth Social, he dismissed polls showing his approval under water as \"fake,\" accusing the media and mainstream pollsters of suffering from \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"Approval flashbackTrump’s current numbers are eerily similar to his early days in 2017. Then, as now, he held underwater ratings after 100 days in office. But unlike his first term, Trump now governs with fewer internal dissenters and a more loyal cabinet, allowing him to focus on a narrative he controls.\"Biden bashing has worked for him before,\" said Duke University political scientist Joseph Grieco. \"But it only works for so long.\"Whether Trump’s base will remain patient through economic discomfort is unclear. But as his signature policies struggle to deliver relief, even diehard supporters may begin demanding more than rhetoric.

That is how much money the 220 guests spent on the president’s meme coin, according to NBC News, which cited blockchain analytics company Nansen. The average attendee spent $1.78 million on the cryptocurrency.\n\nWho Is Attending Trump’s Meme Coin Dinner?\n\nNot much is known about the event’s anonymous guest list, which can be seen through an investor leaderboard, but some attendees have publicly shared their selection for the dinner. Billionaire crypto investor Justin Sun, who has an estimated net worth of $8.5 billion, said in a post on X that he was the top holder of $TRUMP. Sun previously invested $75 million in Trump’s cryptocurrency company, World Liberty Financial. Nick Pinto, a 25-year-old market director for his family’s law firm, told CNBC he spent $500,000 on the Trump meme coin to secure a spot at the dinner.\n\nHow Has $trump Performed Since Launching?\n\nNot well. The cryptocurrency has proven volatile, launching at $6.29 in January, rocketing to the $74 mark a day later and falling to a low of $7.57 in April, before shooting back up again after the announcement of the dinner was made on April 23. The coin traded at $14.38 as of 6 p.m. EDT, making for a $2.8 billion market cap.\n\nWhat Have Lawmakers Said About Trump’s Meme Coin?\n\nDemocrats have blasted Trump for the cryptocurrency and denounced the dinner, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., equating the event to “putting a ‘for sale’ sign on the White House” and saying it is “auctioning off access” to the president. Blumenthal has floated a lawsuit against the president over foreign gifts or payments that he suggested could potentially be given through the event. Some Republicans have also voiced concern, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said early this month the dinner “gives her pause, adding that though meme coins are legal, “what we need to do is have a regulatory framework that makes this more clear, so we don’t have this Wild West scenario.”\n\nKey Background\n\nOnce a crypto critic, Trump campaigned as a cryptocurrency advocate last year and has since moved to ease restrictions on it.

The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S. Also Read | Indian Government's Hiring of Lobbying Firms in US Not a New Practice, Says MEA. The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps. The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist diversity, equity and inclusion' policies.'” Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school's research mission.

Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step. Does the government have authority over a private college's enrollment? The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States. Will Harvard's current international students be allowed to graduate? Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week. However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S. Will admitted students be able to enroll at Harvard in the fall? No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity. Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students. How else has the Trump administration targeted Harvard? Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze. The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.

He can hang art wherever he wants!' \n\nTrump also ordered his mugshot hung up outside the Oval Office. \n\nInside the Oval Office, the president has hung a variety of portraits and added gold all over. \n\nMost recently the decorative ceiling medallion in the Oval Office was painted with gold. \n\nFor decades as a developer the Trump aesthetic included a lot of gold and marble.\n\nDuring last week's trip the Middle East, where the president was feted in grand palaces and government buildings in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, he repeatedly complimented the glitzy style.","summary":"President Donald Trump has added another piece of untraditional art to the walls of the White House.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14741145/donald-trump-new-painting-reagan-lincoln.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/00/98671073-0-image-m-15_1747957459927.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:49:55","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.244},{"id":323880030,"title":"Reeves hasn't 'fixed the economic foundations' - she's presiding over a looming disaster that could be as bad as Greece, writes ALEX BRUMMER","text":"As the Chancellor lives it up with her fellow G7 finance ministers at the £350-a-night Rimrock Resort Hotel in Canada's Rocky Mountains, her credibility at home is draining away.\n\nRachel Reeves's claims to have fixed the public finances are sounding increasingly delusional as the economic outlook becomes more grim with every passing day.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics announced a shock rise in inflation to 3.5 per cent. Yesterday, it followed this with news of higher-than-expected government borrowing in April of £20.2 billion, the fourth-highest figure for April since monthly records began in 1993.\n\nThen the Government announced it was offering a range of public-sector workers inflation-busting pay rises of up to 4.5 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the economy is growing at a derisory rate following last year's Budget, which clobbered consumers and businesses alike with £40 billion of tax increases.\n\nWith his Chancellor 4,400 miles away, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer took the opportunity to undermine her credibility still further by announcing a U-turn on her first major budgetary decision: the axing of the winter fuel allowance.\n\nCatastrophic\n\nIt was a move that left many pensioners shivering in their homes last winter – and had a catastrophic effect on Labour's performance in local elections earlier this month.\n\nBut reinstating this benefit will cost the Government £1.4 billion – which it can ill afford at a time when it's spending billions more than it raises in taxes every month.\n\nThis is despite collecting an extra £1.7 billion last month alone from the rise in employer's National Insurance, a move which has had a devastating impact on business confidence and led to an increase in unemployment.\n\nThe economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year after flatlining in the second half of 2024, but Donald Trump's tariff mayhem – coupled with that inflationary surge – point to the recovery being shortlived.\n\nThe Chancellor frequently boasts that on her watch the Bank of England has lowered interest rates four times to the current 4.25 per cent, but the prospects of further cuts are vanishing before our eyes.\n\nThe Bank's chief economist Huw Pill warned this week that the process of getting price increases under control, was far from over, and argued that interest rate cuts had come too speedily.\n\nWe may not yet be the new Greece, which saw rioting in the streets when it came close to bankruptcy in 2011, but the auguries are not good.\n\nThere has been a surge in gilt yields in recent months, for example, a sure sign that the bond markets are losing confidence in the British economy as, in uncertain times, investors sell government bonds, sending the prices down and the yield up.\n\nThis is what happened during the 'Truss tantrum' in the autumn of 2022, which drove the then prime minister from office. In three short weeks, the return on the ten-year bond soared from 3.03 per cent to 4.42 per cent, a shift that was so sudden and shocking it endangered UK's pension funds and the Bank of England was forced to stage a lifeboat operation.\n\nRemarkably, under Reeves' stewardship, bond rates have moved even higher than they were under Liz Truss. The cost of ten-year borrowing currently stands at 4.78 per cent up from 4.62 per cent a month ago. The long-term 30-year-bond price has jumped to 5.56 per cent.\n\nThe Chancellor's response has been to suggest this is due to international conditions.\n\nBut much of the pain now faced by the Government is self-made. It brought industrial peace with the public-sector trade unions soon after taking office by offering pay settlements that totalled £9.4 billion – none of them linked to improvements in productivity.\n\nA year later it is repeating the error. The Institute for Fiscal Studies cautioned last night that the 3.6 per cent award for NHS staff and a 4 per cent increase for teachers and other workers announced yesterday will require 'further savings to be found elsewhere'.\n\nThe truth is that the Government is digging a fiscal grave for itself with these unaffordable pay deals.\n\nIf Reeves is to keep her promise to keep taxes and current spending in balance and only borrow for investment, she has no choice but to increase taxes or to cut spending.\n\nGiven that the Government now appears to be in the business of reversing previous cuts rather than making any more, the former approach would appear to be the preferred option.\n\nLower than forecast economic growth and the rocketing cost of servicing the national debt – which stands at 100 per cent of national output and commands interest payments of more than £100 billion a year – speedily wiped out the £10 billion 'headroom' Reeves had left herself in her October Budget.\n\nAs a result, we should brace ourselves for a tax-raising budget in November.\n\nThe Chancellor's vows to not come back for more, after the £40 billion shocker last year, are now looking exceedingly threadbare.\n\nSo, far from 'fixing the foundations' and restoring stability to public finances, Reeves is presiding over a looming economic disaster.\n\nFor anaemic growth and the spiralling cost of borrowing are not her only problems, the Government has also entered into a series of unfunded commitments.\n\nThe cost of its new deal with Europe, which will require Britain to pay into Brussels coffers, has not been disclosed but one estimate puts the bill at £16 billion for the first year alone.\n\nThe urgent need to boost defence spending is another headache. The Government engineered a short-term fix by slashing overseas aid and putting the savings into the Armed Forces budget, but billions will have to be found to fund our growing defence requirements in the medium term.\n\nAnd then there's the deal which surrenders the Chagos islands to Mauritius. It also comes with a price tag – be it the Government's own estimate of £3.4 billion or as much as £30 billion, as the Opposition claims.\n\nAgain, where the money will come from is left unsaid.\n\nMeanwhile, Reeves's plan to turbo-charge UK output by sweeping away planning laws and building new infrastructure and housing have so far failed to deliver.\n\nWorse still, poor industrial decision-making means that fast-growth sectors such as life sciences are being driven overseas. A refusal to support a new vaccine plant on the Wirral was a signal moment for the nation's biggest listed company AstraZeneca. It is now pouring money into Cambridge, Massachusetts, instead!\n\nWhen she took office, Reeves was confident that her strong bond with Keir Starmer and his apparent preference for foreign policy over domestic economics put her in an unassailable position.\n\nNow, however, following the publication of a leaked memo from the Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner calling for eight new taxes on the wealthy, the threat from the Left is very real.\n\nA hostile backdrop of rising inflation, a sustained period of higher interest rates and a black hole in the public finances means the odds on Reeves staying in post for the duration of this Parliament have narrowed sharply.\n\nLabour governments have a long record of tax-and-spend Budgets, which leave a poisonous legacy to their successors. And history looks to be repeating itself with a vengeance.","summary":"ALEX BRUMMER: As the Chancellor lives it up with her fellow G7 finance ministers at the £350-a-night Rimrock Resort Hotel in Canada 's Rocky Mountains, her credibility at home is draining away.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14741409/Reeves-fixed-economic-foundations-shes-presiding-looming-disaster-bad-Greece-writes-ALEX-BRUMMER.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/23/00/98672035-0-image-m-71_1747957322585.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:43:58","author":"Alex Brummer,Editor","authors":["Alex Brummer","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.242},{"id":323881520,"title":"The Senate just voted to block California’s gas car ban","text":"For nearly 60 years, California has enjoyed the ability to set its own standards governing air pollution from automobiles, as long as they’re more stringent than the federal government’s. This rule, written into the Clean Air Act, was meant to recognize the state’s longstanding leadership in regulating air emissions.\n\nThe U.S. Senate undermined that authority on Thursday when it voted 51 to 44 to revoke a waiver the Environmental Protection Agency approved allowing the Golden State to implement and enforce a de facto ban on the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. The Senate also rescinded waivers allowing California to set stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks, and mandating the adoption of zero-emission trucks.\n\nEnvironmental groups quickly decried the votes, saying that California’s standards are essential to protecting public health and achieving nationwide emissions reduction targets. The rules are seen as a sort of national benchmark since automakers don’t create separate product lines: one for California and another for everyone else. A provision in the Clean Air Act also allows other states to adopt the Golden State’s standards; 16 states and the District of Columbia have adopted many of the rules established by the California Air Resources Board.\n\n“These standards are vital in protecting people from the vehicle pollution which causes asthma attacks and other serious health problems,” said Dan Lashof, a senior fellow at the nonprofit World Resources Institute, in a statement.\n\nOn a wonkier level, however, legal and policy experts objected to the way Senators rescinded California’s waiver: They used the 1996 Congressional Review Act, or CRA, a law enacted to allow Congress to overturn some federal actions with a simple majority, rather than the usual 60 votes. Two government watchdogs said the act did not apply to the state’s waiver.\n\n“Republicans twisted the Senate’s own rules,” Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement. UCLA Law professor Ann Carlson warned in a blog post ahead of the vote that Congress “may be opening up a Pandora’s box it can’t close,” and that “there will be no limit on using the CRA to overturn all kinds of actions that the act doesn’t cover.”\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is whether the air pollution waiver that the EPA granted to California last year qualifies as a “rule” under the CRA. Both the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan oversight agency, and the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan appointee tasked with interpreting Congressional rules and procedures, issued advisory opinions earlier this year saying that it doesn’t. Republican Senator MIke Lee of Utah appeared to agree with this interpretation: A one-pager on a bill he proposed to repeal California’s waiver said that the exemptions “cannot be reviewed under the Congressional Review Act because the waiver granted by EPA is not a rule as that term is defined in the CRA.” \n\nParty leaders don’t usually contravene the parliamentarian’s guidance. If they do, they run the risk of their opponents doing the same when they are in power. “Republicans should tread carefully today,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, told NPR on Thursday. California Senator Alex Padilla said in a statement that “radical Republicans” had “gone nuclear on the Senate rulebook.”\n\n“It won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again,” Padilla added. “When that happens, all bets will be off. Every agency action that Democrats don’t like — whether it’s a rule or not — will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.” \n\nDan Farber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, told Grist that the Senate’s capricious interpretation of the CRA means it could be used to rescind waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services allowing states to modify Medicaid requirements, or broadcasting licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission. The act could also be used to revoke pollution permits that the EPA grants to states.\n\nHe clarified, however, that the Senate only nullified specific waivers in California affecting the sale of gasoline-powered cars. It did not repeal provisions in the Clean Air Act that allow the EPA to issue new waivers, as long as they’re not “substantially the same” as the rescinded ones. “I think that California still has the power to put forward, and EPA has the power to approve, different emissions regulations in the future,” Farber said. “Changing the deadlines by a few years could be enough.” \n\nCalifornia’s current standards require 35 percent of new cars sold within the state to be zero-emissions by 2026, ratcheting up to 100 percent of new sales by 2035. President Donald Trump revoked California’s waiver allowing such regulations in 2019, during his first term, but that move was challenged in court and the waiver was restored by the Biden administration.\n\nAlthough automakers have previously backed California’s air pollution standards, industry groups cheered the vote on Thursday. John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group, said in a statement that the Senate deserved “enormous credit.” \n\n“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” he said. “Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher.”\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta objected to the Senate vote and vowed to challenge it in court. “Reducing emissions is essential to the prosperity, health, and well-being of California and its families,” he said in a statement. Governor Gavin Newsom said undoing his state’s air pollution rules risked “ced[ing] American car-industry dominance to China.”","summary":"Legal experts say Congress misused a federal law to do so, potentially “opening up a Pandora’s box it cannot close.”","url":"https://grist.org/regulation/senate-rescinds-californias-ev-rules-congressional-review-act/","image":"https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EV-charging-only.jpg?quality=75&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:43:23","author":"Joseph Winters,Zoya Teirstein","authors":["Joseph Winters","Zoya Teirstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":323872022,"title":"As tariffs loom, Walmart says it will cut 1.5K corporate jobs","text":"May 22 (UPI) -- Walmart has announced plans to lay off 1,500 corporate employees, part of what it calls a restructuring as it weighs plans to raise prices amid Trump administration tariffs.\n\n\"We are reshaping some teams in our Global Tech and Walmart U.S. organizations where we have identified opportunities to remove layers and complexity, speed up decision-making, and help associates innovate rapidly,\" a memo to employees obtained by The Hill Wednesday said.\n\nThe memo said the retail giant is eliminating some jobs and creating new ones aimed at building on business priorities and growth strategy.\n\nWhile Walmart said the corporate restructure is not directly related to the looming tariffs, it has said it is weighing the options of price increases and trying to absorb the tariffs when they are imposed, as it has done with past levies.\n\nDuring a corporate earnings call last week, Walmart CEO Doug McMillion said the giant retailer would not be able to absorb all of the tariffs and said it would likely have to pass some costs on to consumers.

The changes to the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or SNAP, were a small part of a much larger, multitrillion-dollar megabill rammed through the House by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Thursday morning that advances president’s agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. Tweaks to SNAP, commonly known as food stamps, would yield roughly $300 billion in savings over the next decade. SNAP is the largest food assistance program in the country with over 40 million Americans receiving benefits. NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) ARE NOW ON THE HOOK FOR $36,214,475,432,210.84 AS OF 5/21/25 The proposed policy changes go a long way as part of the House GOP’s goal of hitting at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts in Republicans’ bid to put a dent in the federal government’s debt of over $36 trillion. The U.S. government has spent $1.05 trillion more than it has collected in fiscal 2025, according to the Treasury Department. House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson, R-Pa., lauded his panel’s contribution to the colossal bill during a victory lap press conference after the bill’s passage as policy changes that would better serve \"the most vulnerable\" in the U.S. \"We’ve achieved something we haven’t been able to do in a very long time, and that is restoring the intent of Congress, not by cutting or taking people off the roll for the nutrition programs, but restoring program integrity,\" Thompson said. HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL NEW FOOD STAMP WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUMP&apos;S &apos;BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL&apos; However, the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., blasted the changes to SNAP, accusing Republicans in a statement of seeking to make \"America hungrier, poorer and sicker.\" \"Parents struggling to afford groceries for their families and seniors living on fixed incomes will have their food taken away if this bill becomes law,\" she said. Some of the reforms under consideration by the Republican-led Congress and White House include altering the age range of work requirements for SNAP benefits for able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years old, booting illegal migrants from the benefit rolls and shifting some of the cost burden of the program from the federal government to the states. The work requirements also apply to parents with children over the age of 7. However, there are a string of exceptions, including pregnant women, people who are homeless, veterans, people who are 24 years old or younger who are aged out of the foster care system and SNAP recipients with children 7 years or older who fall under any of the aforementioned exceptions. But those exceptions will sunset in 2030. Beginning in fiscal 2028, states will start taking on a baseline of 5% of SNAP costs. The federal government currently shoulders 100% of the cost of the program, and states&apos; contributions would increase on a sliding scale based on the error rate in benefit payments per state.

Kennedy Jr. to discuss the revamp of government policy. Reading from a script, the US President announced that the government is set to reduce \"ultra-processed foods, over overmedicarelyization and over prescription and widespread exposure to toxic chemicals\". Despite the health-focused agenda, Trump's invented words, akin to previous blunders like \"bigly and covfefe\", stole the show.

But Trump's brain matter could be dripping out his ear when rambling about fictional genocides and it's 'Next question,'\". President Donald Trump pledged a review within 100 days that would examine the impact of U.S. lifestyle, from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays, on childhood diseases such as obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, spearheaded by the so-called \"MAHA Commission,\" was unveiled on Thursday. The report advocated for increased examination of the childhood vaccination schedule and a review of pesticides used on US crops. In February, Trump enacted an executive order to establish the Commission, which was assigned to investigate the \"threat\" posed by prescription drugs, chemicals, and certain food ingredients to children. The report portrayed American children as \"overmedicated and undernourished.\" It also challenged school mandates requiring children to be vaccinated for admission. The National Institutes of Health were urged by the report to conduct studies on ultra-processed foods. Trump pledged a review within 100 days to examine how medications prescribed for children and school lunches impact childhood diseases such as obesity, depression, and attention deficit disorder. The report condemned the use of glyphosate - a chemical applied to crops - suggesting it may lead to health problems including cancer. Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley expressed concern that farmers had contacted him, frustrated they hadn't been able to contribute to the MAHA report before its publication. \"I hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\" Grassley said.

She called Trump's decision a \"blatant violation\" of federal law, which says NLRB members can only be removed for misconduct or negligence.U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia ruled against Trump, calling his actions a \"power grab\" and that his interpretation of the scope of his constitutional powers was \"flat wrong.\"However, the Supreme Court overruled Howell on appeal, with an unsigned opinion that stated the Constitution \"vests the executive power in the President\" to \"remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.\"\"We do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument,\" the opinion said, indicating that the firing can proceed even as the court cases continue.\"The stay also reflects our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty,\" it added.Ultimately, this means that the removal of Gwynne of the NLRB and Cathy Harris of the MSPB remains in effect despite their cases remaining under review in appeals court.Kagan disagreed with the other justices who voted in favor of Trump, citing 90 years of precedent with Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which she said \"undergirds a significant feature of American governance: Bipartisan administrative bodies carrying out expertise-based functions with a measure of independence from presidential control.\"Humphry's established that the Constitution never gave \"illimitable power of removal\" to the president, saying that Congress, in creating quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial agencies, has the authority to discharge its duties \"independently of executive control,\" which \"cannot well be doubted.\"Kagan wrote that Congress created certain agencies to \"make decisions likely to advance the long-term public good,\" and she stressed the president's need for cause to override congressional authority on the matter.\"Our emergency docket, while fit for some things, should not be used to overrule or revise existing law,\" Kagan wrote, adding, \"It is one thing to grant relief in that way when doing so vindicates established legal rights, which somehow the courts below have disregarded. It is a wholly different thing to skip the usual appellate process when issuing an order that itself changes the law.\"\"Today's order, however, favors the President over our precedent; and it does so unrestrained by the rules of briefing and argument—and the passage of time—needed to discipline our decision-making,\" Kagan wrote.\"I would deny the President's application,\" she added. \"I would do so based on the will of Congress, this Court's seminal decision approving independent agencies' for-cause protections, and the ensuing 90 years of this Nation's history.\"What Happens NextGwynne and Harris continue to pursue a return to their previous positions, with their case playing out in appeals court.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"The Supreme Court analyzed if the president could remove members of independent agencies without cause.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/justice-kagan-warns-supreme-court-went-90-years-history-2076125","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2650395/supreme-court-justice-elena-kagan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:31:35","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.47},{"id":323881108,"title":"Harvard Blocked from Enrolling International Students by Trump Administration","text":"The Trump administration has prohibited Harvard University from admitting international students, marking a significant intensification in its actions against one of America’s revered Ivy League institutions.\n\nKristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, dispatched a letter to Harvard on Thursday, informing the administration that the university’s certification for the student and exchange visitor program had been rescinded, “effective immediately”.\n\nThis move is part of a broader crackdown in recent months by US President Donald Trump on elite institutions accused of advancing “woke” ideologies and not adequately addressing antisemitism. \n\nIn a post on X that published her letter, Noem wrote: “It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enrol foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments.\n\n“Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.” \n\nThe move would affect the admission of students for the coming academic year, but Noem also said the ban meant Harvard’s almost 6,800 existing international students, representing more than 27 per cent of this year’s intake, must switch their enrolment to other universities.\n\nHarvard said the administration’s move was “unlawful” and that it was “fully committed” to maintaining its ability to host international students.\n\n“We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community.

Michael Guetlein, currently vice chief of space operations for the US Space Force, to lead the “Golden Dome” effort.\n\nThat’s a smart decision: Gutlein has significant experience in acquiring space and missile-defense capabilities and has served in key positions at the National Reconnaissance Office and the Missile Defense Agency.\n\nTrump also signaled that Canada could partner in the effort — news that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed Wednesday.\n\nThat’s smart, too. Canada already plays a vital role in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, and dozens of radars in Canada help provide Americans early warning of incoming missiles. \n\nThe “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that passed the House early Thursday morning includes $25 billion in “Golden Dome” funding — but that would be just a down payment.\n\nTrump’s Tuesday statement was aspirational.\n\n“The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they’re launched from space,” he promised.\n\nBut while the effort is vital to Americans’ security, neither Trump’s three-year timeline nor his $175 billion cost estimate is at all realistic.\n\nTo be sure, some initial, valuable capabilities can be fielded in that time frame — but “Golden Dome” has both a short-term and a long-term component, and “full operational” capability by 2029 for the system Trump described Tuesday is not going to happen.\n\nConsider the cost just to deploy and operate a constellation of space-based interceptors over the next 20 years.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated this month that the lowest-cost version of such a system would ring in at $161 billion — and the priciest alternative would cost at least $542 billion.\n\nAnd SBIs will be an important part of “Golden Dome” — but only one part.\n\nInnovative efforts, including dirigibles and unmanned aircraft, could mitigate the significant costs of the large network, but the overall cost of “Golden Dome” will far surpass $175 billion.\n\nHegseth said Tuesday that the Defense Department is working to develop a complete funding plan and will do so before the budget for fiscal year 2026 is finalized.\n\nThat is important: If past is prologue, the failure to provide sufficient funding will guarantee that “Golden Dome” falls short.\n\nUnfortunately, the base defense budget that Trump requested for next fiscal year is the same as the current year’s amount — and does not even keep up with inflation.\n\nThe result, in effect, is a declining defense budget even as threats to the United States grow.\n\nPresident Trump won’t be able to achieve a “peace through strength” foreign policy, or a successful “Golden Dome,” on a Biden defense budget.\n\nAs Trump’s Tuesday display made clear, his “Golden Dome” vision is a major defense priority for this administration.\n\nThe focus on homeland missile defense is long overdue. \n\nNow we need a detailed plan that can be accomplished at the speed of relevance — and at a cost Americans will support. \n\nBradley Bowman and Rear Adm.

Mark Montgomery are senior directors at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, where they lead the Air and Missile Defense Program.","summary":"Our margin of safety has badly eroded in the face of Chinese and Russian weapons advances — but Trump's $25 billion down payment for missile defense isn't nearly enough.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/opinion/trumps-golden-dome-costly-ambitious-and-necessary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/DJTGD.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:24:27","author":"Bradley Bowman,Mark Montgomery","authors":["Bradley Bowman","Mark Montgomery"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":323886972,"title":"Republican trolled for MISSING vote on Trump's 'big beautiful' bill because he was sleeping","text":"A New York Republican is getting heat from his allies and enemies alike after missing a vote on the House budget package - due to falling asleep.\n\nAfter a drawn out session of Congress lasted through Wednesday night into Thursday morning, GOP Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) who represents part of Long Island missed the vote on the House reconciliation package.\n\nThe legislation - referred to colloquially as President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' - is a key trillion-dollar funding package through which the administration's agenda can be enacted.\n\nThe bill narrowly passed the House on 215-214 vote.\n\nAfter the vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) noted that he should have had at least two more colleagues in favor of the package, including one from Garbarino who 'fell asleep in the back, no kidding.'\n\n'I'm going to just strangle him,' Johnson jokingly told reporters after the vote, 'but he's my dear friend.' \n\nAs a Republican representing part of a high-tax blue state, Garbarino played a key part in the bill's negotiations as a member of the SALT Caucus.\n\nIn a statement issued by his office after missing the key vote, Garbarino said he would have voted for the bill. \n\n'I am proud to have been the leading voice on Long Island during negotiations on this key reconciliation bill'\n\n'I fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation.'\n\n'I was moments away from the House floor, to vote 'yes,' when the vote was closed. While I am frustrated that the vote was closed before I was able to cast my vote, I am proud of the work we accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island,' he concluded.\n\nStill, those words were not enough to fend off the flurry of memes and jokes generated by the incident, shared on social media by both Democrats and Garbarino's GOP colleagues, as well as some internet rabblerousers.\n\nRep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) was one to call out his colleague, writing 'One Big Beautiful Snooze…After all that posturing on SALT, Garbarino couldn't even manage to wake himself up to vote for the bill,' on a post on X.\n\nKevin Smith, a New York conservative activist from Long Island and founder of the Loud Majority, wrote 'Long Island Rep Andrew Garbarino. FELL ASLEEP and missed the vote. On behalf of all of Long Island I apologize for this idiot.'\n\nX user Amuse, who boasts over 600k followers, shared a photoshopped image of Garbarino in pajamas with a disheveled bed behind him. \n\n Juju_marie1, another X user, posted an illustration of Garbarino in a bed with a night cap and a steaming warm drink in his hands.","summary":"A New York Republican is getting heat from his allies and enemies alike after missing a vote on the House budget package - due to falling asleep.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14741027/republican-trolled-missing-vote-trump-bill-sleeping.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/22/23/98669649-0-image-a-8_1747953277509.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:24:07","author":"Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":323870410,"title":"Two cheers on passing the tax bill — too bad spending’s still out of control","text":"Congratulations to President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson for getting the Big Beautiful Bill through the House; this was a vital win for Trump’s agenda.\n\nThat said, we can’t help but mourn the missed opportunity to truly cut federal spending, which remains on an unsustainable trajectory that guarantees future fiscal disaster.\n\nNo, we’re not whining that the BBB “increases the deficit”: Virtually the bill’s entire impact in that sense comes from fending off massive preprogramed tax hikes that would derail the economy.\n\nKeeping tax rates constant — along with enhanced border security and other core parts of Trump’s agenda — is a heavy lift in its own right, given Republicans’ narrow majorities in the House and Senate and Democrats’ still-lockstep opposition to anything and everything Trump.\n\nNor is success yet certain: The Senate must have its say, and then the two chambers will need to split their differences and vote again.\n\nStill, eventually the president and his allies need to level with the American people about the hard but simple truth that spending has shot up too far, too fast — and with no good justification.\n\nFederal outlays are up more than $2 trillion a year over the prepandemic level, from $4.4 trillion in 2019 to $6.8 trillion in 2024.\n\nThat’s a rise of over 50%, massively above inflation — and for what?\n\nMainly, for what Dems consider “investment”: More subsidies for favored companies, more giveaways to “nonprofit” special interests, more payments to states like New York and California to support their big-government initiatives.\n\nYet the Republicans blinked at rolling back practically any of it, let alone all.\n\nEven though next to no average American can point to anything Uncle Sam is doing for him that he wasn’t before the pandemic; how would a rollback hurt that much?\n\nWe get it: Even the minimal trims in the bill have Democrats screaming about millions of people losing their health insurance, etc.; House members in swing seats fear giving the opposition even more to grandstand about — and the bill only passed with a vote or two to spare.\n\nNearly everyone in Washington thinks the voters don’t want to hear the truth, but sooner or later they’ll need to, because this literally can’t go on.\n\nAnd the later the course-correction begins, the deeper the hole the country will be in, and the greater the pain to get out of it.\n\nSo the sooner our leaders start taking some truth-telling risks, the better.","summary":"We can’t help but mourn the missed opportunity to truly cut federal spending, which remains on an unsustainable trajectory that guarantees future fiscal disaster.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/opinion/two-cheers-on-passing-the-tax-bill-too-bad-spendings-still-out-of-control/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-dmdj29m9b-1747955125887.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1747940869&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 23:21:32","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.018},{"id":323872548,"title":"Boy Meets World star Will Friedle shocks fans announcing he's going to be a grandfather","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, May 23rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamous drummer was killed in private jet crash after posting photo of himself at CONTROLS\n\nGemma Collins's drug dealer ex boyfriend who TOWIE star says beat her 'within an inch' of her life is cleared of assaulting another woman\n\nGrieving family of mother whose heart was removed after she died in Turkey pay tribute to her - as they reveal there are 'a lot of unanswered questions'\n\nUltimate battle of the fat jabs: One of these women picked Mounjaro to lose weight, the other Wegovy.

I'm 'bout to be a poppy!' \nDanielle said, 'It's going to be fun, I can't wait,' while Will added, 'It's gonna be great. I can't either.' \n\nWill Friedle from Boy Meets World has a bundle of joy on the way. Seen here March 28, 2025\nFans reacted with shock that will is old enough to be a grandfather.\nOne fan wrote, 'Excuse me. GRANDPA? omg am I that old already, while another said, 'didn't know he had kids.\n\n Boy Meets World alumni open up on their experiences with actor Brian Peck ... who would go on to be convicted of sexually abusing child \n'Gah he's going to be a hot paw paw,' a third person wrote, while another summed up what everyone is thinking, 'Oh so thanks for making me feel old.' \nFinally, someone wrote, 'We are \n Friedle and his wife Susan got married in September 2016. Lexi was 21 when the couple began dating. \nOn a recent episode of the podcast, Will admitted he doesn't acknowledge Mother's Day with his wife.\n'Wait, did I have to get stuff for every month? I don't get stuff for Sue on Mother's Day, am I supposed to?' he said, after Fishel and Strong told him he should honor his wife on the holiday.\n'Do you say Happy Mother's Day?' Rider asked, with Friedle responding, 'Probably not. I don't know!'\n\nBut it's not a baby for him and his wife Susan Marten. Rather its her daughter and his step-daughter, Lexi's baby. Seen here in 1998\n\nHe revealed the happy news on his podcast Pod Meets World with co-podcast hosts Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong and, on that day, former Boy Meets World director and stage manager Lynn McCracken. Strong, Fishel and Friedle seen here in September 2023\n\n'I'm about to be a grandfather, actually,' Will said during the episode. 'Yeah, my stepdaughter's about to have my first grandchild, so I'm very happy. I'm 'bout to be a poppy!'\n\nDanielle said, 'It's going to be fun, I can't wait, ' while Will added, 'It's gonna be great. I can't either.' Seen here in 2024\n\nFans commented about how hard it was to to believe Will was old enough to be a grandpa\n\nOther fans seemed to have been launched into a full-blown identity crisis\n\nMostly, the comments were shocked in believing their own age\n'Wow,' Strong replied, and Fishel said, 'Will! Did you not say Happy Mother's Day today? Do you celebrate the holiday for her at all?'\n'I say it to my mom,' Friedle repeated, and Strong told him that he 'should acknowledge' his wife on the day.\nAfter witnessing his co-hosts shock, the podcaster tried to redeem himself, by pointing out that Martens' daughter is older, which caused Fishel to exclaim. 'It doesn't matter, she's still a mother.'\nFriedle then just admitted, 'I know, I never think about it, I guess.'\nIn February, the former Boy Meets World stars chatted with one of their own: Matiland Ward, who played Rachel McGuire on the sitcom.\nMaitland has since made a career for herself as a pornographic actress.\nDuring the episode, which dropped February 23, Danielle, 43, bluntly asked 48-year-old Maitland, who now pursues a career as an adult film star, 'So jumping ahead to around the time, let's say 2022, and we start our podcast, Pod Meets World. Maybe a more broad general question for you is, Do you hate us?'\n'No, I do not hate you. I think that you hate me, because you wouldn't speak to me on Girl Meets World and that's hurtful,' Maitland said.\n\nFriedle and his wife Susan got married in September 2016. Lexi was 21 when the couple began dating. Seen here in 1998\n\nOn a recent episode of the podcast, Will admitted he doesn't acknowledge Mother's Day with his wife. Seen here on March 28, 2025\n\nThe former co-stars also began discussing why their relationship fell out, due to a Facebook miscommunication and also their lack of a friendship during their time on set.\nThey also argued over Maitland talking badly about them in public.\nMaitland brought up a visit she made to the Girl Meets World set and accused Danielle of ignoring her - after she thought they were friends.\n'You had an attitude about it. There was some beef between us, and I didn't get it. I didn't know if you thought I was trying to steal attention... I was genuinely confused why we wouldn't be good,' Maitland said.\nDanielle apologized to her, explaining that she didn't have an issue with her and was overwhelmed with a lot of feelings while on set.\nHowever, Maitland disagreed, saying, 'You didn't like the fact that I was getting a lot of attention at that time and going off in my own space and taking away that attention.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBoy Meets World star Will Friedle shocks fans announcing he's going to be a grandfather\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
