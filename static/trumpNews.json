The US President, 79, had said designs for the lavish function suite \"won’t interfere with the current building\" - yet machinery was pictured on Monday tearing down part of the historic building . It appeared to complete Mr Trump's erratic U-turn as, last week, he told ballroom donors at a dinner in the East Room: \"It will be demolished\". And the latest comment seems, finally, the truth as the White House spoke out today to confirm \"the existing structure\" must indeed go. Speaking today, Mr Trump said: \"In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure. The way it was shown, it looked like we were touching the White House. We don't touch the White House. \"That's the bridge, the last bridge, going from the White House to the ballroom. Then, you get into the lobby of the ballroom and then you get into the magnificent, the main room and it's something that has gotten incredible reviews.\" The work has caused quite the stir globally and, indeed, in Washington DC, where a man rammed a car into the security barricade of the White House estate on Tuesday night. The Security Service said a suspect was arrested at the scene, a stone's throw from Mr Trump's residency. Some $250million (£187million) to build the ballroom will be privately funded, it is understood. However, it is thought this deal is cheaper than alternatives, in part, because the entire wing is being destroyed. Earlier this year, Mr Trump told reporters: \"It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.\" But then last week, the world leader said: \"It will be demolished. Everything out there is coming down and it will be replaced by the most beautiful ballroom.\" The latest address was delivered to donors, including Silicon Valley titans, Apple and Google , defense behemoth Lockheed Martin, and telecom provider, T-Mobile, who gathered for a dinner in the East Room. They wait in anticipation for the work to be finished, which it is thought could be as soon as the weekend. Former East Wing staffers, though, have expressed concern at the work, with some even writing to the National Capital Planning Commission to try and get the project stopped. In response to this last week, the White House issued a press release, in which they described the criticism as \"manufactured outrage\".

The military strike that destroyed the boat and killed two on board is the first to be conducted outside the Caribbean Sea area of operations.\n\nIn a social media post on X, Hegseth indicated the strike occurred on Tuesday in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of Colombia. Hegseth said the strike that marks a broadening of President Donald Trump’s military campaign against narco-terrorist cartels at sea, saying, “Yesterday, at the direction of President Trump, the Department of War conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization and conducting narco-trafficking in the Eastern Pacific.”\n\nAccording to Hegseth, the eighth kinetic military strike targeted a vessel that was known to military intelligence as being involved in illicit narcotics smuggling and was transiting a known narco-trafficking maritime transit route. Hegseth added, “There were two narco-terrorists aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters. Both terrorists were killed, and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.”\n\nHegseth’s announcement contained an ominous warning to narco-terrorists that the kinetic military strikes will continue.\n\n“Narco-terrorists intending to bring poison to our shores, will find no safe harbor anywhere in our hemisphere,” the secretary stated. “Just as Al Qaeda waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people. There will be no refuge or forgiveness—only justice.”\n\nAccording to a report in the U.S. Naval Institute News (USIN), at least 34 people have been killed in the kinetic military strikes against narco-terrorists thus far. Eleven narco-terrorist smugglers were killed during the first strike conducted in the Caribbean Sea on September 2, Breitbart Texas’s Bob Price reported. In that military action, Trump administration officials reported the vessel carrying the 11 narco-terrorist smugglers was of Venezuelan origin and was being operated by members of the notorious Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nBreitbart reported that President Trump designated the gang and several drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations in an executive order on his first day in office. The executive order is entitled, “Designating Cartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists.”\n\nThe unprecedented military kinetic strikes at sea are drawing criticism from some Democrats questioning the president’s authority to carry out the strikes on narco-terrorist smugglers. Last week, Congressman Adam Smith (D-Wash), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called for a congressional hearing on the use of military assets to conduct the kinetic strikes.\n\nIn mid-October, the Center for Constitutional Rights and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized the military campaign against the narco-terrorists. They filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking the Office of Legal Counsel’s guidance and other related documentation regarding the targeting of narco-terrorist smugglers.\n\nIn an ACLU announcement regarding the filing of the request. the organization did not make mention of the more than 80,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2024. Staff attorney Jeffrey Stein with the ACLU’s National Security Project issued a statement on the military narc0-terrorist strikes, saying, “All available evidence suggests that President Trump’s lethal strikes in the Caribbean constitute murder, pure and simple.” He added, “The public deserves to know how our government is justifying these attacks as lawful, and given the stakes, immediate public scrutiny of its apparently radical theories is imperative.”\n\nRandy Clark is a 32-year veteran of the United States Border Patrol.

It described the system as strategic, implying that they were designed to be armed with nuclear warheads.\n\nKCNA didn’t specify the name of the new missile system it tested. The tests came after a massive military parade in Pyongyang earlier this month, where Kim unveiled some of his military’s newest weapons, including what appeared to be a short-range ballistic system fitted with hypersonic glide vehicles. \n\nNorth Korea in recent years has been testing various missile systems tipped with hypersonic weapons, which are designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons are meant to help them evade regional missile defense systems, but experts have questioned whether they have consistently flown at the speeds the North claims during tests.\n\nPak Jong Chon, one of Kim’s top military officials who attended Wednesday’s tests, lauded the performance of the “new cutting-edge weapon system” and said the North would continue efforts to bolster its war deterrent and defense capabilities. \n\nDuring the Oct. 10 parade, Kim also unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile that state media described as the country’s most powerful nuclear asset, adding to his growing collection of weapons with potential range to reach the U.S. mainland. Experts say the North could be preparing to test the missile in the coming weeks, ahead of a major ruling party conference in early 2026, when Kim is expected to announce key policy directions — potentially including his approach toward the United States.\n\nKim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the U.S.-led economic sanctions.\n\nWednesday’s launches marked North Korea’s first ballistic missile tests since liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, pledging to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula. But Kim has so far rejected Lee’s offer for talks and has said he won’t resume diplomacy with the United States unless Washington abandons its goal of denuclearizing the North.\n\nSome experts had predicted that North Korea could conduct provocative missile tests before or during the APEC summit to underscore its commitment to gaining international recognition as a nuclear weapons state.","summary":"North Korea said Thursday that its latest missile tests involved new hypersonic systems aimed at strengthening its nuclear war deterrent, as leader Kim Jong Un continues to build up weapons designed to overwhelm South Korea’s missile defenses","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-says-latest-missile-tests-demonstrate-new-hypersonic-systems/article70192061.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/equbv7/article70192073.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-10-22T220247Z_1398735720_RC29HHAEQPUF_RTRMADP_3_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:48:24","author":"North Korea","authors":["North Korea"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":371711804,"title":"The White House should be a 'symbol of excellence,' says Sen.

But residents in Little Village spotted agents staging in city Water Department parking lot at 3148 S. Sacramento Avenue around 3 p.m. Sunday, said Baltazar Enriquez, president of the Little Village Community Council. \n\nIn a letter sent to Johnson’s office, Enriquez said he witnessed agents “putting on uniforms, face masks, and preparing for deployment into the Little Village community.”\n\n“This incident is alarming and unacceptable,” Enriquez wrote. “It directly violates your executive order, which was meant to protect our immigrant residents from fear, harassment, and unlawful detention. What good is an executive order if it is not enforced? Our community deserves accountability and visible action.”\n\nMayoral press secretary Cassio Mendoza said Johnson’s Oct. 6 executive order cannot be enforced unless there are signs clearly posted in advance of a raid carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \n\nThat was not the case at the Water Department parking lot cited by Little Village residents, Mendoza said.\n\n“There are 4,000 lots in the city and many more parking lots. We can’t install signs at all of them tomorrow,” Mendoza told the Sun-Times. “We can’t do anything about an incident that has already happened. What we can do is put up signs going forward.”\n\nEnriquez said the signs should have been posted already, noting that Johnson “signed the executive order weeks ago.”\n\nAt a cost of roughly $100 per sign, Mendoza said the city is “trying to be strategic” about where it chooses to post signs. Priority is being given to lots near schools, hospitals and homeless shelters. The city has also provided “24/7 security” at the O’Hare Airport lot where ride-share drivers stage before picking up airport passengers, he said.\n\n“It’s not like they use every vacant lot in the city,” Mendoza said.\n\nMendoza also pointed to a few instances in which Chicago police officers have “responded to ICE staging at city-owned lots” in recent days and asked federal agents to leave — and those agents left. That happened last Friday at Grand and Central, and similar voluntary departures occurred recently at Harrison and Kedzie and on city-owned property on 111th Street, Mendoza said.\n\n“Where we’ve been proactive in putting up signs, it’s forced ICE to change their tactics,” the press secretary said.\n\nCommunity members also urged city officials to release surveillance footage from the Water Department building to determine how long agents have been using that parking lot in Little Village to stage raids.\n\nOn the day he signed the executive order, Johnson was asked what would happen if ICE ignored the mandate and staged immigration raids on city-owned properties, which can include Chicago public schools, libraries, parks and city buildings like the Water Department facility.\n\n“If the federal government violates this executive order, we will take them to court,” Johnson said Oct. 6.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/22/little-village-mayor-johnson-executive-order-ice-agents-ban-city-property","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc2d601/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F66%2F5e83541344f989a30f169fdbbc29%2Ficeci","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:38:08","author":"Cindy Hernandez,Fran Spielman","authors":["Cindy Hernandez","Fran Spielman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":371708530,"title":"Maine Dem Senate hopeful backed by Bernie Sanders apologizes for Nazi-style tattoo, vows to stay in race","text":"Maine Democrat Graham Platner, a first-time Senate candidate backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., says he has covered up a tattoo widely recognized as a Nazi symbol after critics unearthed old social media posts and demanded he quit the race. Platner’s campaign is facing intense scrutiny after it was revealed he once had a skull-and-crossbones tattoo resembling the Totenkopf used by Hitler’s SS paramilitary forces. Platner said he got the tattoo in 2007 during a \"night of drinking\" while on leave in Croatia in the Marine Corps and claimed he did not know its historical associations at the time. He has since covered the image with another tattoo. DELETED POSTS URGING VIOLENCE HAUNT DEMOCRATIC SENATE HOPEFUL IN MAINE RACE In a video posted to Instagram Wednesday afternoon, Platner elaborated that the design was chosen from a flash tattoo wall while \"carousing\" with fellow Marines in Split, Croatia. \"We thought it looked cool,\" he said. He claimed he had \"lived a life dedicated to anti-fascism, anti-racism and anti-Nazism\" and was \"appalled\" to learn it resembled a hate symbol. Platner said he had never been questioned about the tattoo during his service and passed Army background checks. He told The Associated Press he chose to cover rather than remove the tattoo due to a lack of removal services near his home in rural Maine. \"Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,\" Platner said. \"I wanted this thing off my body.\" In the video, Platner said he had the symbol inked over with a Celtic knot and imagery of dogs, a tribute to his family pets. \"This far more represents who I am now than even the skull and crossbones did,\" he said, lifting his shirt to reveal the new tattoo. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER DIRECTS INVESTIGATION AFTER SWASTIKA VANDALISM DISCOVERED IN DC OFFICE The controversy comes on the heels of deleted Reddit posts in which Platner appeared to mock military sexual assault victims, criticize police and make racially-charged comments about tipping. Platner since apologized and blamed the posts on depression and PTSD after his military service in Afghanistan. He has vowed to stay in the race and has the backing of Sanders. Jordan Wood, a Democratic rival in the primary and former chief of staff to Rep. Katie Porter, is calling on Platner to drop out. \"Graham Platner’s Reddit comments and Nazi SS Totenkopf tattoo are disqualifying and not who we are as Mainers or as Democrats,\" Wood said in a statement. \"With Donald Trump and his sycophants demonizing Americans, spewing hate and running roughshod over the Constitution, Democrats need to be able to condemn Trump’s actions with moral clarity. Graham Platner no longer can.\" Platner said he believes the controversy is part of his life story, not disqualifying. \"I don’t look at this as a liability. I look at this as a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today,\" Platner told the AP. \"And I’m very proud of who I am.\" He blamed \"establishment\" forces for amplifying the backlash to derail his campaign. \"Every second we spend talking about a tattoo I got in the Marine Corps is a second we don’t talk about Medicare for all,\" Platner said in the video. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He is running in a packed Democratic primary against Wood and two-term Gov. Janet Mills. GOP Sen. Susan Collins, who has held the seat for three decades, has not yet commented on the controversy. Sanders and Collins did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The federal agency’s actions drew protesters to city streets – and condemnation from local leaders.

How can you not be jealous? Imagine a country defending its own people.”\n\nNeither Ms Takaichi nor her Cabinet members have announced any plans to deport foreigners en masse, and there is no mention of a deportation ministry on the Prime Minister’s official website.\n\n“Takaichi has not promised mass deportations,” Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, wrote on X. “As with previous PMs, if a foreigner in Japan gets caught without legal status, they will most likely face deportation. That’s how it’s been for many years.”\n\nHowever Kimi Onoda, the newly appointed Minister of State for Economic Security — the woman featured in the viral video — does have “Minister in Charge of a Society of Well-Ordered and Harmonious Coexistence with Foreign Nationals” among her portfolio responsibilities.\n\nThe Cabinet position was actually established under the prior administration of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who resigned last month after less than a year in the role.\n\nJapan’s government has been forced to respond to public concern at record tourism numbers — up 48 per cent in 2024, according to the Japan National Tourism Organisation — and the growing foreign-born population, which reached a record 3 per cent last year, or nearly 3.8 million.\n\nFacing a plummeting birthrate and ageing population, Japan has recently sought to loosen visa requirements for workers in key industries facing severe labour shortages such as manufacturing and transport, per Newsweek.\n\nDuring her campaign for leadership of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Ms Takaichi devoted much of her speech time to issues including illegal immigration, visa overstayers, foreign tourism and social tensions, calling for a “crackdown on illegal immigration” and emphasising that “foreigners must strictly obey our laws”, according to the Sankei Shimbun newspaper.\n\nShe highlighted claims of foreigners allegedly abusing and kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara, describing the conduct as “outrageous”.\n\nMs Takaichi also said tourists had played on shrine torii gates as if they were gymnastic bars — a reference to a video posted by a Chilean fitness influencer that sparked outrage last October.\n\n“If they come all the way from overseas to intentionally harm things that Japanese people cherish, something has gone too far,” she said in a September 22 speech, per Asahi Shimbun.\n\nThe portfolio now held by Ms Onoda is tasked with co-ordinating language support, administrative services, stricter identity verification and enforcement mechanisms across ministries.\n\n“I want to work closely with relevant agencies and advance comprehensive discussions as a unified government on various issues, including strict measures against those who do not follow the rules and the revision of systems and policies that are currently inadequate for the present circumstances,” Ms Onoda said during her first press conference on Wednesday, according to Asahi Shimbun.\n\nA list of policy priorities on the Prime Minister’s website talks of “safeguarding people’s daily lives”.\n\n“We will enhance policy co-ordinating functions on foreign nationals in Japan and promote relevant and broad-ranging measures,” it says. “We will undertake initiatives to tackle organised crime and related efforts in order to maintain and improve public law and order.”\n\nMs Takaichi, Japan’s fifth Prime Minister in as many years, leads a minority government and faces a bulging to-do list — not least the scheduled arrival of Donald Trump next week.\n\nShe said she wanted “candid discussions” with the US President, days ahead of his visit to Tokyo.\n\nIn her first remarks in office, Ms Takaichi said her priority was to tackle inflation, a major source of anger among voters, and would soon draft an “economic package” to deal with rising prices.\n\nThe former heavy metal drummer and Margaret Thatcher admirer became head of the LDP on October 4, but its coalition collapsed days later.\n\nThis forced Ms Takaichi to form an alliance with the reformist, right-leaning Japan Innovation Party (JIP), which was signed on Monday.\n\nShe was approved by parliament as Prime Minister on Tuesday and formally took office.\n\nHer first challenge will be Mr Trump’s visit, during which she plans to discuss bilateral issues as well as the broader Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\n“I want to build relationships of trust,” she told journalists. Being in a minority in both houses of parliament, the new coalition will need support from other parties to push through legislation.\n\nMs Takaichi’s many other headaches include Japan’s declining population as well as the flatlining economy.\n\nWith Mr Trump’s visit on the horizon, Ms Takaichi handed the Foreign Minister role to Toshimitsu Motegi who was credited with handling trade ties with the President’s first administration.\n\nThe US leader wants Tokyo to stop Russian energy imports and boost defence spending.\n\nDetails of Japan’s mooted $US550 billion ($850 billion) in investments in the US, as part of its latest trade deal with Washington, remain unclear.\n\nMs Takaichi previously said that “Japan is completely looked down on by China”, and that Tokyo must “address the security threat” posed by Beijing.\n\nBut she has since toned down her rhetoric, and last week stayed away from the Yasukuni shrine that honours Japan’s war dead, long a flashpoint in Tokyo’s regional ties.\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Tokyo to “honour its political commitments on major issues including history and Taiwan”.\n\nChina and Japan are key trading partners, but friction over territorial rivalries and military spending has frayed ties in recent years.\n\nJapan hosts around 54,000 US military personnel and the close ally of Washington is part of the Quad group, along with Australia and India, which is seen as a counter to Beijing.\n\nEuropean Union chief Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Ms Takaichi for “making history” as Japan’s first woman premier.\n\nMs Takaichi had promised a cabinet with “Nordic” levels of women, up from two under her predecessor. The record for Japan is five.\n\nBut she named only two other women in her 19-strong cabinet, with Satsuki Katayama in charge of finances alongside Ms Onoda.\n\nMs Takaichi will also be under pressure to restore the fortunes of the LDP after a string of poor election results that cost Mr Ishiba his job.\n\nSmaller parties gaining support include the populist Sanseito, which calls immigration a “silent invasion”.\n\n — with AFP","summary":"Japan on Tuesday elected its first ever female Prime Minister — and immediately a wild claim began circulating online about the far-right politician’s first move.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/internet-users-falsely-claim-japans-new-pm-has-created-a-ministry-for-mass-deportations/news-story/9ce911201a9b57851114dc58318b1e4f?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3e103171216d54972332edc18f013c97","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:32:55","author":"Frank Chung","authors":["Frank Chung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":371710160,"title":"'Frantic': US ramps up pressure on Gaza ceasefire deal amid Israeli frustration","text":"The increasingly intense U.S. involvement in the implementation of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas is \"frantic,\" one senior Israeli official described on Wednesday. “They're going full bore,” the official said, reflecting growing frustration in Jerusalem as Washington tightens its supervision of the deal, particularly regarding the airlift of high-level envoys to Israel. Israeli officials acknowledge they have limited ability to slow what one described as the “American locomotive,” and are instead focused on “damage control.” Despite tensions within Israel’s diplomatic ranks, officials admit the reality is clear: U.S. engagement in the region is expected to grow even more intensive. Washington, they say, is determined not to let the agreement unravel. Its top priority remains the return of all hostages to Israel. U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance addressed the issue, noting that some deceased hostages are buried deep underground and will take time to locate. “We need to be patient,” he said, adding that Western media are covering each incident in a hysterical manner aimed at portraying the deal as a failure. Still, Vance struck an optimistic tone, pointing to a major effort underway to uphold the ceasefire. At the same time, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) chief Adm. Brad Cooper is pushing forward with plans to establish an international stabilization force for Gaza. The force will include a multinational task unit deployed to search for the bodies of hostages. According to the plan, the stabilization force will oversee Hamas' disarmament and the demilitarization of Gaza, while also ensuring Israel does not violate the ceasefire through military operations. Sources involved say the force is intended to counterbalance Hamas and provide the Palestinian population with a basic sense of security. The heightened American oversight continues. Following Vance’s visit, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to arrive in Israel Thursday at 5 p.m. for a 48-hour visit, during which he will tour the American base in Kiryat Gat and meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “During his visit, the Secretary will reaffirm America’s unwavering commitment to Israel’s security and engage with partners to build on the historic momentum towards durable peace and integration in the Middle East,” the U.S. State Department said. The back-to-back visits underscore how closely the U.S. is monitoring the situation. Only three hours will separate Vance’s departure at 2 p.m. and Rubio’s landing, marking a near-constant American diplomatic presence in Israel aimed at keeping the agreement on track. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner traveled from Israel to the United Arab Emirates, where they met with UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed. According to UAE state media, the meeting focused on recent developments in the Gaza ceasefire and U.S. efforts to solidify the agreement, part of Trump’s broader regional peace plan. Bin Zayed praised Trump’s efforts to end the war and promote Middle East stability, and thanked Witkoff and Kushner for their roles. The meeting also explored ways to improve regional stability and economic development amid the ongoing escalation. During his visit to Israel, Vance met with hostage families and captives released as part of the deal, reiterating that Washington is committed to doing everything possible to secure the return of the remains of all hostages still held by Hamas. “I cannot guarantee everyone will come home, but we are working on it with our partners to make it happen as quickly as possible,” Vance said. In a meeting with the families, Vance expressed support for their solidarity and mutual commitment, which he said had clearly grown since the war began. Family members urged the U.S. not to proceed with Phase 2 of the ceasefire agreement—likely involving additional diplomatic or territorial steps—until Hamas fulfills its obligation to return all the remains of fallen hostages. “Every family needs a proper burial and closure,” one representative said. Also attending the meeting was Yehoshua Shani, head of the Forum of Valor and father of Capt. Ori Mordechai, who was killed on the first day of the war near Kissufim. Shani recounted his son’s last battle and spoke on behalf of hundreds of bereaved families. He called on the vice president to ensure that Israel is permitted to carry out the second phase of the agreement: eliminating the security threat from Gaza and dismantling Hamas. “We urge the United States to allow Israel to finish the job of destroying the enemy,” Shani said. Vance responded, “We are working on this with the Israeli government.” Earlier in the day, Netanyahu told Vance that Israel opposes the entry of Turkish troops into Gaza as part of Trump’s plan. “That is a red line,” the prime minister said, according to sources familiar with the discussion.","summary":"As Washington tightens oversight and dispatches top envoys to Israel, Jerusalem concedes limited ability to rein in American momentum; Vance, Rubio and CENTCOM lead a coordinated push to secure hostages, disarm Hamas and stabilize Gaza","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqqmjvrge","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/09/15/SyjhPOSolx/SyjhPOSolx_0_0_3000_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:32:52","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.087},{"id":371710300,"title":"US won’t fire Tomahawks on Ukraine’s behalf – Trump","text":"The US will not help Ukraine fire long-range Tomahawk missiles at Russian forces, President Donald Trump has said, adding that training Kiev’s troops to operate the weapon would take many months.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House on Wednesday, Trump did not say whether the US might eventually provide the missiles – which have a maximum range of around 2,500km (1,550 miles) – to Kiev but stressed that the weapon required long and intensive training.\n\n“The problem with the Tomahawk [is] that… it’ll take a minimum of six months, usually a year, to learn how to use them. They’re highly complex,” Trump said. “So the only way a Tomahawk is going to be shot is if we shot it, and we’re not going to do that.”\n\n“We know how to use it, and we’re not going to be teaching other people,” the US president added. Trump earlier cautioned that allowing Ukraine to conduct strikes deep into Russia with long-range missiles could lead to “an escalation.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has warned against supplying the long-range weapon to Ukraine, saying that it would be “impossible to use Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel.” He also warned such deliveries would “severely undermine the prospects of a peaceful settlement” and damage relations between Moscow and Washington.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed US officials, that the Trump administration had lifted restrictions on Ukraine’s use of certain long-range missiles supplied by the West.\n\nThe US leader, however, quickly dismissed the report as “FAKE NEWS,” adding that Washington “has nothing to do with those missiles, wherever they may come from, or what Ukraine does with them!”\n\nUkraine has long requested Tomahawk missiles, with the topic discussed during the Trump-Zelensky meeting at the White House last week.

You know, it takes two to tango, as they say.”\n\nThe U.S. administration announced the sanctions as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the new sanctions were a direct response to Moscow’s refusal to end its “senseless war” and an attempt to choke off “the Kremlin’s war machine.”\n\nBessent added that the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump’s effort to end the war. “We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”\n\nThe announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.\n\nThe attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.\n\nAt least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.\n\nRussian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.\n\nRutte, in his Oval Office appearance, went out of his way to underscore that the weaponry the U.S. is selling Europe to provide to Ukraine has been essential to helping stop many attacks like the one that ravaged the kindergarten.\n\n“We need to make sure that the air defense systems are in place, and we need the U.S. systems to do that, and the Europeans are paying for that,” Rutte said. “It is exactly the type of actions we needed, and the President is doing that and trying everything to get this work done.”\n\nZelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.","summary":"President Donald Trump&#39;s administration announced on Wednesday new &ldquo;massive sanctions&rdquo; against Russia&#39;s oil industry that are aimed at moving Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table and bringing an end to Moscow&#39;s brutal war on Ukraine.\n\nThe sanctions agai...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/579529/Trump-levies-new-sanctions-on-Russian-oil-giants-in-a-push-on-Putin-to-end-Ukraine-war","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/10/337f7dd08d307e5fd019d4e2a46b2d20cada02f2f42ed0d823acb61cb5ea247c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:29:00","author":"Aamer Madhani","authors":["Aamer Madhani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":371704786,"title":"Trump says tariffs ‘vital’ as U.S. Supreme Court set to test his authority","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday he wants to attend next month’s Supreme Court hearing on his “vital” tariff policy, calling it “one of the most important cases we’ve ever had.”\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Nov. 5 on whether the president can unilaterally impose tariffs under emergency powers, bypassing Congress.\n\nThe case involves Trump’s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China over allegations of fentanyl trafficking, as well as his “reciprocal tariffs” on dozens of other countries.\n\nTrump has argued he has the right to use tariffs as a negotiating tool to reach trade deals and, in the case of the fentanyl-related tariffs, force countries to take actions on issues related to U.S. national security.\n\n“Tariffs are vital to this country,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n“If this country is not allowed to have tariffs, if this country is not allowed to have the president of the United States negotiate on behalf of it with tariffs, we are put in a position where we’re going to be a third-world country. We can’t let that happen.”\n\nMultiple courts have ruled that Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs by declaring national emergencies was unlawful and violated the U.S. Constitution, which affords tariffing and tax powers to the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe rulings say the IEEPA makes no specific mention of tariffs as a response to such emergencies, siding with dozens of state attorneys general and small businesses who brought the case.\n\nThe tariffs remain in place, however, as the Trump administration appeals the case.\n\nThe courts have said Trump has other powers to impose tariffs without Congress, including Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act, which has been used to tariff foreign steel, aluminum, autos and other specific sectors.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that the U.S. is bringing in record tariff revenues that are making up for decades of trade unfairness, which he said was why the country’s national debt has exploded to nearly US$38 trillion.\n\n“With tariffs we’re a strong, sound country. We’re a nationally secure, internationally secure country. We’re a very rich country,” he said.\n\n“Without tariffs it’s a slog for this country, big slog … We’re taking in money like we never have before. Without tariffs, that would not be happening.”\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department has warned in legal filings in the case that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin” for the United States.\n\nTrump also argued he’s solved global conflicts by threatening steep tariffs on those nations, including India and Pakistan.\n\n“If you want to fight, that’s OK, but you’re going to pay tariffs and they’re going to be very substantial,” he said he told both countries. “Two days later, they call up and they’re not going to fight anymore.”\n\nTrump has not lifted his IEEPA tariffs on Canada despite Ottawa taking several steps to increase border security and crack down on fentanyl trafficking and production.\n\nA presidential memo last month said Canada still needs to do more to address the issue.\n\nTrump has exempted goods compliant with the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on free trade (CUSMA) from those tariffs, meaning less than 15 per cent of Canadian exports face the 35 per cent duty. Potash and energy exports not compliant with CUSMA face a lower 10 per cent tariff under Trump’s order.\n\nTrade negotiations between Canada and the Trump administration are currently focused on securing sector-specific deals that Ottawa hopes will lower Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as on energy, with future deals on autos and other sectors to come.\n\nCanada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told a Senate committee last month that Canada still maintains the position that the fentanyl-related tariffs should be removed.","summary":"Trump said Wednesday he may attend next month's Supreme Court hearing on his tariff policy, calling it 'one of the most important cases we've ever had.'","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11490271/donald-trump-tariffs-supreme-court-case-vital/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/4a1fc49cc8a159ae59630be47a9c42b1317a832bd1c4262b4a189c4b6a0d03c4_46e08b.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:25:30","author":"Sean Boynton","authors":["Sean Boynton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.344},{"id":371709016,"title":"Trump says U.S. has not approved Ukraine's use of long-range missiles","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday (October 22, 2025) that a news report on the United States giving approval to Ukraine to use long-range missiles deep into Russia was false, adding the U.S. “has nothing to do with those missiles.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported earlier on Wednesday that the Trump administration had lifted a restriction on Ukraine’s use of some long-range missiles provided by Western allies.\n\nMr. Trump said on Truth Social that the Journal story on “the U.S.A.’s approval of Ukraine being allowed to use long range missiles deep into Russia” was false.\n\n“The U.S. has nothing to do with those missiles, wherever they may come from, or what Ukraine does with them!,” Mr. Trump added.","summary":"The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported earlier on Wednesday that the Trump administration had lifted a restriction on Ukraine’s use of some long-range missiles","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-us-has-not-approved-ukraines-use-of-long-range-missiles/article70191448.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/11esl6/article70191456.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_57150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:24:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":371701086,"title":"Perez Hilton claims commuting Diddy's sentence would be \"the literal worst decision\" of Trump amid reports of POTUS considering a pardon","text":"Podcaster Perez Hilton weighed in on reports claiming that Trump was considering commuting Sean “Diddy” Combs’ prison sentence. In an October 22 article on his website, Hilton described the move as “the literal worst decision” POTUS could make, given the severity of the charges against the rapper.In his website article, Perez Hilton recounted how POTUS was first asked about the possibility of “pardoning his old pal” Diddy on May 30, inside the Oval Office, before the rapper’s verdict was announced.He noted that the two had been friends and that POTUS had “infamously defended the rapper on TV” in the past. At the time, Trump was also on what Hilton described as a “pardoning spree,” having then freed “the Chrisleys, all the January 6 insurrectionists, and more.”Hilton detailed how, when asked the question, the president “gave a really non-committal answer” instead of issuing a direct “no” or dismissing it as a “nasty question,” as he often did.“I know people are thinking about it. First of all, I’d look at what’s happening… I haven’t spoken to him in years. He really liked me a lot,” Trump had said (as cited by Hilton)Moving to the details of Diddy’s case, the podcaster also reminded readers that the rapper had already avoided the most serious charges. He was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering but found guilty on prostitution-related counts. This reduced his potential sentence from life in prison to just four years.He then referenced an October 20 TMZ report claiming that a “high-ranking White House official” had tipped the outlet, revealing that POTUS was “actually considering commuting Diddy’s sentence” altogether. This would mean that Diddy could “walk, free and clear,” without serving the rest of his prison term.The insider further claimed that the president was “vacillating” on the decision, essentially “on the fence” and “going back and forth” before making the final call. There was, reportedly, a “50/50” chance of him “freeing Diddy.”Underscoring the gravity of the situation, Hilton noted:“Diddy… has not only been convicted on these counts...but has also been accused by multiple plaintiffs of sexually abusing MINORS! For someone who is already annoyed whenever his connection with notorious billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein is brought up, freeing Diddy would be the literal worst decision the POTUS could make.”What else did Perez Hilton say about reports claiming Trump may pardon Diddy?From L to R: Sean Diddy Combs and TrumpIn his article, Perez Hilton shared several details from the TMZ report, which claimed that Trump was allegedly considering commuting Sean “Diddy” Combs’ prison sentence.While expressing disbelief at the report, Hilton remarked that under POTUS's current administration, such a move “doesn’t exactly beggar belief anymore.”“This is one of the craziest Donald Trump insider reports we’ve heard yet. But at this point, with this administration? Not exactly beggaring belief anymore, huh?” he wrote.Hilton noted that, according to TMZ, POTUS's advisers had reportedly warned him against granting clemency to the rapper.A high-level White House source told the outlet that though POTUS's team had strongly advised him not to proceed with the commutation, it was unclear whether he would actually heed that advice. According to the source, POTUS would “do what he wants.”Hilton further argued that the president's track record of controversial decisions only made this possibility more plausible.He pointed to Trump’s recent commutation of George Santos’s sentence, describing Santos as “the fraudster who tricked a constituency into electing him to Congress.” Hilton highlighted how Trump justified the move by saying Santos “ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN.” So, according to him, there was a chance that Trump would still “do what he wants for sure,” with Diddy.Referencing the TMZ report about Diddy’s potential pardon, Hilton also noted that the White House had forcefully denied the claims. In a statement to NBC News, an official insisted there was “zero truth” to the story and criticized TMZ for failing to verify the information before publishing it.“There is zero truth to the TMZ report, which we would’ve gladly explained had they reached out before running their fake news. The President, not anonymous sources, is the final decider on pardons and commutations,” the official stated (as per NBC News).Hilton also quipped that the official’s phrasing “kinda sounds like they’re saying the same thing” TMZ had claimed, that Trump would ultimately “do what he wants” since he’s “the final decider.”Hilton added that, according to the October 21 NBC report, TMZ had responded to the White House’s denial and stood by its story.Commenting on the standoff between TMZ and the White House, Hilton concluded that the issue ultimately came down to public trust.“We guess it comes down to this question… Who do you trust more at this point? TMZ or the White House? Not the easiest question, huh? Especially when journalists ask who made some diplomatic decision, and you have Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt answering, ‘Your mom did.’ Yeah, next to that, TMZ looks like Cronkite,” Hilton explained.Sean Diddy Combs was convicted in July on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. On October 3, a federal judge sentenced him to 50 months in prison, imposed a $500,000 fine, and ordered five years of supervised release.His prison placement has yet to be finalized, and he is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York. The rapper has requested to serve his sentence at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey.On October 20, Combs had also filed an appeal challenging both his conviction and sentencing on the prostitution-related charges stemming from his sex crimes trial.Earlier this month, Trump stated that Combs had reached out to request a pardon following his conviction (As per ABC News). While the latest TMZ report suggested that POTUS was considering commuting the rapper’s sentence, the President himself has not released any official statement regarding the matter.","summary":"Podcaster Perez Hilton weighed in on reports claiming that Trump was considering commuting Sean “Diddy” Combs’ prison

air-traffic controllers — and risks our safety","text":"Democrats on Capitol Hill continue to hold the federal government hostage, bowing to the demands of their leftist base.\n\nSince Oct. 1, Senate Democrats have voted 12 times to thwart a budget extension that would reopen the government, demanding a $1.5 trillion ransom for their pet projects.\n\nTo keep their allies in line, George Soros-backed radicals staged a nationwide block party Saturday, protesting against a supposed “king.”\n\nTheir Hate America rallies had everything — a teacher mocking Charlie Kirk’s assassination, overt references to murdering President Donald Trump, demands for ICE agents to be “shot and wiped out,” even a topless purple-haired woman brandishing a “Free Luigi, Jail Trump” sign.\n\nWhile Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries scramble to placate their base, our air traffic controllers are now in their fourth week of paycheck anxiety.\n\nIf the Schumer-Jefferies shakedown continues past Tuesday, controllers will miss their full paychecks next week, after getting partial ones on Oct. 14.\n\nAs Transportation secretary, nothing is more abhorrent to me than messing with the livelihoods of these patriotic men and women — all for the sake of health care for illegal immigrants.\n\nI’ve visited with controllers over the last few weeks at Newark Liberty and Baltimore International, and the stress this shakedown is putting on them is real.\n\nThey’re already working overtime, managing the most complex airspace in America with outdated, dilapidated equipment — and now Democrats are forcing them to worry whether they can pay their bills on time.\n\nMany are furious: Why are legislators putting illegal immigrants’ needs before their own?\n\nOthers tell me they’re on the brink of taking on odd jobs — driving for Uber, delivering for DoorDash — just to make sure they can put food on the table.\n\nLet me be clear: American air travel is safe, even as the government remains shut down.\n\nThe vast majority of our dedicated air traffic controllers continue to come to work six days a week, despite the uncertainty of their next paycheck.\n\nWhile we’ve recently seen a slight increase in the number of controllers calling out sick, the Federal Aviation Administration will not permit planes to fly if the airspace is unsafe. \n\nBut the position Democrats are putting them is wrong, and it will exacerbate the challenges facing our airspace today.\n\nMore controller shortages will mean long airport lines, delayed flights, cancelled trips and increasing disruptions for the flying public.\n\nWorse yet, the shakedown isn’t just hurting staffing today in our towers — it discourages the next generation of controllers from pursuing this critical but demanding career.\n\nAt our FAA Academy, I’m hearing of candidates who are hesitant to attend, worried that future government shutdowns will threaten pay stability once they begin their careers.\n\nAdditionally, some current students are reluctant to complete their training, knowing that if they’re assigned to a facility, they’ll have to begin work without pay.\n\nThe longer this limbo drags on, the less attractive this career path and compensation will appear to future recruits.\n\nThis threatens to destroy months of hard-fought progress we’ve made to erase a nationwide shortage of controllers.\n\nThe FAA was previously on track to hire 8,900 new controllers through 2028, and my agency exceeded its goal of 2,000 new recruits for the 2025 fiscal year, bringing 2,026 into the Academy.\n\nThat’s 20% higher than Pete Buttigieg’s total for the same period in 2024 — but every day the shakedown continues is another day of discouragement for the American patriots who we’ll need to keep our skies safe.\n\nSchumer and Jefferies see no problem with any of this. \n\n“Every day gets better for us,” the senator said weeks ago, as top Democrats pledged to keep the government closed until there are “planes falling out of the sky.” \n\nDemocratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Gavin Newsom of California even had the audacity to blame the president and me for the budget impasse — ignoring that their own party is the one rejecting the clean funding bill Republicans have already approved. \n\nHere’s the bottom line: Our runway to fixing our skies and launching a golden age of air travel is being blocked by Congressional Democrats’ refusal to fund the government.\n\nAnd more planes will be grounded as Democrats continue their reckless, risky taxpayer shakedown.\n\nSean P.

Trump went on to cancel his planned meeting with Putin next week in Budapest. \n\nThe sanctions will cut the Russian firms’ access to American banks and financial institutions, which effectively blocks them from accessing and using US dollars.\n\nTrump is deploying stronger action against Russia to pressure them to the negotiating table as his efforts to end the war in Ukraine continue.\n\n‘Hopefully he’ll become reasonable and hopefully Zelensky will be reasonable too,’ he said. \n\nTrump signaled he was frustrated with the lack of progress in his communications with Putin. \n\n‘Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations. And then they don’t go anywhere,’ he said. \n\nTrump said he was optimistic that the end of the war in Ukraine could be reached, but for now any meeting with Putin would be postponed.\n\n‘It didn’t feel right to me but we’ll do it in the future,’ he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the president indicated he might be willing to send Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine and invited President Volodymyr Zelensky to meet with him at the White House on Monday. \n\nBut on Wednesday he indicated that he would not move forward to send the long-range missiles to Zelensky. \n\n‘They’re highly complex. So the only way a Tomahawk is going to be shot is if we shot it and we’re not going to do that,’ he said. \n\nHe urged both Zelensky and Putin to work for peace and promised to make it a priority for his administration.\n\n‘A lot of people are dying, you know, they’re not Americans, but they’re people. They’re souls and they’re dying by the thousands. Worst since World War II. And we really should stop it,’ he said.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the president also denounced a story from The Wall Street Journal reporting that the United States had approved the use of long range missiles into Russia as ‘fake news’. \n\n‘The U.S. has nothing to do with those missiles, wherever they may come from, or what Ukraine does with them!’ he wrote on social media. \n\nBut the White House appears to be readying more pressure on Russia. \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed to reporters in the White House driveway that they were readying increased sanctions on Russia to be announced late Wednesday evening or on Thursday morning. \n\n‘We are going to either announce after the close this afternoon or first thing tomorrow morning a substantial pickup in Russia sanctions,’ Bessent told reporters in the White House driveway on Wednesday. \n\nThe president first confirmed Tuesday that the planned meeting with Putin was canceled.\n\n‘I don’t want to have a wasted meeting. I don’t want to have a waste of time,’ he told reporters in the Oval Office.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a decisive move reflecting growing frustration over ongoing hostilities, President Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Breaking: Trump Imposes Tough Sanctions on Russia Following Canceled Putin Summit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/breaking-trump-imposes-tough-sanctions-on-russia-following-canceled-putin-summit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump-announces-sanctions-on-Russia-after-canceling-Putin-meeting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:18:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":371709030,"title":"U.S. announces new sanctions against Russia’s two biggest oil companies","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new sanctions Wednesday (October 22, 2025) against Russia’s two biggest oil companies and blasted Moscow’s refusal to end its “senseless war” as U.S.-led efforts to end the war floundered and the Ukrainian president sought more foreign military help.\n\nThe sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as dozens of subsidiaries, followed months of bipartisan pressure on President Donald Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry.\n\n“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Mr. Bessent said in a statement. Given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.” Mr. Bessent said the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Mr. Trump’s effort to end the war. “We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.” Mr. Bessent made the comments as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.\n\nThe announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.\n\nThe attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.\n\nAt least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.\n\nRussian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.\n\nRussia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine’s air force said.\n\nPeace efforts stall \n\nMr. Trump’s efforts to end the war that started with Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.\n\nMr. Trump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Mr. Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” European leaders accused Mr. Putin of stalling.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s proposal to freeze the conflict where it stands on the front line “was a good compromise” — a step that could pave the way for negotiations.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned summit requires careful preparation, suggesting that laying the groundwork could be protracted. “No one wants to waste time: neither President Trump nor President Putin,” he said.\n\nIn what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Mr. Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country’s strategic nuclear forces.\n\nMr. Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow “only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,” he said.\n\nMore international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London.\n\n Mr. Zelenskyy credited Mr. Trump’s remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin’s willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks.\n\nRussia has not made significant progress on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has taken a high toll on Russian infantry and Ukraine is short of manpower, military analysts say. Both sides have invested in long-range strike capabilities to hit rear areas.\n\nUkraine says it hit key Russian chemical plant\n\nThe Ukrainian army’s general staff said its forces struck a chemical plant Tuesday night in Russia’s Bryansk region using British-made air-launched Storm Shadow missiles. The plant is an important part of the Russian military and industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, missile fuel and ammunition, it said.\n\nRussian officials in the region confirmed an attack but did not mention the plant.\n\nUkraine also claimed overnight strikes on the Saransk mechanical plant in Mordovia, Russia, which produces components for ammunition and mines, and the Makhachkala oil refinery in the Dagestan republic of Russia. The Russian Defense Ministry said its air defenses downed 33 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, including the area around St. Petersburg. Eight airports temporarily suspended flights because of the attacks.\n\nIn other developments, Mr. Zelenskyy arrived Wednesday in Oslo, Norway, and after that flew to Stockholm, where he and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson signed an agreement exploring the possibility of Ukraine buying up to 150 Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets over the next decade or more. Ukraine has already received American-made F-16s and French Mirages.\n\nRussia’s long barrage\n\nMoscow’s overnight attack also targeted energy infrastructure and caused rolling blackouts, officials said. Russia has been trying to cripple the country’s power grid before winter sets in.\n\n“We heard a loud explosion and then the glass started to shatter, and then everything was caught up in a burst of fire. The embers were everywhere,” Olena Biriukova, who lives in a Kyiv apartment building, told The Associated Press.\n\n“It was very scary for kids,” she said.\n\nTwo people were found dead in the Dnipro district of the Ukrainian capital, where emergency services rescued 10 people after a fire caused by drone debris hit the sixth floor of a 16-story residential building, local authorities said.\n\nAnd in Kyiv’s Darnytskyi district, emergency services responded after drone debris hit a 17-story apartment block, causing a fire on five floors. Fifteen people were rescued, including two children.","summary":"The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as dozens of subsidiaries, followed months of bipartisan pressure on President Donald Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-announces-new-sanctions-against-russias-two-biggest-oil-companies/article70191424.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/nkmezv/article70191455.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-10-22T194702Z_1281197154_RC26HHAQXTRC_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:17:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":371712512,"title":"Trump will boost Russia sanctions after putting off Putin summit","text":"The U.S. will announce a 'substantial” new round of sanctions against Russia, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said, signaling U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to ratchet up pressure on Moscow a day after backing off plans for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the near future.'We are going to either announce, after the close this afternoon or first thing tomorrow morning, a substantial pickup in Russia sanctions,” Bessent told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.

who has said he 'is contemplating writing a book' about Epstein using hours of interviews he conducted with the disgraced financier - is suing the First Lady for damages under New York's anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) laws which silence critics of powerful people. \n\nHis attorneys argue that the First Lady sent him what he calls a 'threat letter' on October 15 saying if he didn't stop making what Trump's attorneys called defaming statements in six days, she would sue him for $1billion.\n\nShe had accused Wolff of making 'false, defamatory and lewd statements' in a letter from her attorney Alejandro Brito, and said the journalist made 'extremely salacious' allegations that reached tens of millions of people worldwide.\n\nThe claims Wolff made about Melania's alleged connection with Epstein were even repeated by Hunter Biden in an interview, and Melania threatened to sue him as well, with her attorney Alejandro Brito calling Wolff 'a serial fabulist.' \n\nThe First Lady's lawyer demanded that Biden 'immediately retract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements made about Mrs. Trump.' \n\nIn his lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of New York County on Tuesday, Wolff argued that the Trumps 'have made a practice of threatening those who speak against them with costly SLAPP actions in order to silence their speech, to intimidate their critics generally and to extract unjustified payments and North Korean-style confessions and apologies.'\n\nHe added that the Trumps try to use legal threats 'designed to create a climate of fear in the nation so that people cannot freely or confidently exercise their First Amendment rights.\n\n'The threats are also intended to shut down legitimate inquiry into the Epstein matter, which the Trumps and their collaborators have at every turn sought to impede and suppress,' the lawsuit claims.\n\nIt then goes onto allege that Melania's threat of legal action is intended to 'impede and chill future reporting and writing that Mr. Wolff has committed to doing regarding Epstein, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Trump.\n\n'In many respects, that is the primary purpose of these claims,' the suit says. \n\nWolff told the Daily Beast that bringing the case against Melania was a 'difficult decision,' as he said he 'did not want to be in a lawsuit, but I also am a journalist and have been one for 40 years.\n\n'I've written four books about Donald Trump and have never been sued,' he continued, arguing that the First Lady's threatened legal action is designed to 'intimidate and silence me, as Donald Trump has done to so many news organizations and reporters.'\n\n'Fortunately, New York has an Anti-SLAPP law. This law protects people sued for making statements involving matters of public concern.\n\n'In order to avail myself of this protection, I choose to begin an action against her, rather than have her threats hanging over my head indefinitely,' Wolff explained. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the White House for comment about Wolff's claims.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Wednesday, Melania's spokesperson told the Daily Mail: 'First Lady Melania Trump is proud to continue standing up to those who spread malicious and defamatory falsehoods as they desperately try to get undeserved attention and money from their unlawful conduct.'\n\nThe Daily Beast had published Wolff's claims about Melania's alleged connection with Epstein in a story in July - but later retracted the article after the First Lady complained.\n\nIn a statement at the time, editors for the online publication said they found the story did 'not meet our standards and has therefore been removed from our platforms.\n\n'In response to a letter from the First Lady's attorneys, The Daily Beast has also removed a portion of an episode of The Daily Beast Podcast titled \"Trump's Epstein Scandal Can't Stop, Won't Stop\" referencing the First Lady,' the statement continued.\n\nIt noted that Melania 'points to her best-selling book \"Melania\" as the definitive account of her life story.\n\n'We apologize to the First Lady and our readers,' the editors said.\n\nThe First Lady had written in her memoir that she first met Trump at New York's Kit Kat Klub during 1998 Fashion Week after being 'drawn to his magnetic energy.'\n\nThe two got engaged six years later and were married in 2005.","summary":"Michael Wolff is reportedly planning to ask Melania and Donald Trump about their connection to Jeffrey Epstein under oath.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15217801/Michael-Wolff-lawsuit-Melania-Trump-Epstein.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/22/23/103231459-0-image-m-17_1761172051495.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:12:07","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":371701640,"title":"'Very frustrated': MAGA pastor suggests this Trump official is actually in charge","text":"The Rev.

Here's What NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell Said","text":"The NFL has no plans to replace Bad Bunny as the headliner for Super Bowl LX’s halftime show, despite a wave of online backlash from some conservative circles calling the Puerto Rican megastar “anti-American.” Addressing the controversy on Tuesday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell firmly defended the league’s decision, emphasizing that the choice was deliberate and based on global appeal. “He’s one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,” Goodell said. “That’s what we try to achieve... It’s carefully thought through. I don’t think we’ve ever selected an artist without some blowback or criticism.” Why Bad Bunny Was Chosen Bad Bunny, 31, remains one of the most successful and influential artists of the decade. He’s the most streamed musician globally, a three-time Grammy winner, and a cultural icon whose reach extends beyond music. His ventures into WWE, film, and fashion have earned him praise for bridging mainstream and Latino entertainment. The selection aligns with the NFL’s recent efforts to spotlight international artists and appeal to a younger, more diverse audience, even if that comes with controversy. Political Backlash and Fan Reactions Among critics was President Donald Trump, who dismissed the choice during a Newsmax interview. “I don’t know who he is. I don’t know why they’re doing it—it’s crazy,” Trump said, adding that the league “blamed it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment.” Despite the criticism, the NFL has stood by its decision, noting that every halftime performer, from Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake to Kendrick Lamar, has faced scrutiny in the past. What to Expect in 2026 Super Bowl LX will take place on February 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers. The halftime show will air on NBC, with guest performers yet to be announced. For Goodell, the message was clear: the NFL isn’t backing down. “No selection will please everyone,” he said. “But our goal is always to put the biggest and best talent on the biggest stage in the world.”","summary":"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that Bad Bunny will still headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show despite backlash labeling the artist “anti-American.” Goodell defended the decision, calling Bad Bunny one of the world’s top entertainers.","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/nfl/is-super-bowl-replacing-bad-bunnys-halftime-show-heres-what-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-said-article-153038606","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153038607,thumbsize-1081606,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/153038607.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:10:01","author":"Naman Trivedi","authors":["Naman Trivedi"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.467},{"id":371705208,"title":"Top Dem's staggeringly out-of-touch comment about families struggling through government shutdown","text":"A high-ranking Democrat appears to have admitted an inconvenient truth about the government shutdown that has officially entered its fourth week.\n\nMassachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, who is the Minority Whip of the United States House of Representatives, admitted that she views families struggling during the shutdown as 'leverage' for her party to use in political games.\n\n'Shutdowns are terrible.

Millions of Americans are suffering, also adding, \"Democrats don't care.\"'\n\nIowa Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who represents one of the most competitive House seats, called Clark's comments 'disgraceful', also stating that the 'Democrat leaders are perfectly okay with American families suffering.'\n\nClark's comments come as nearly half of Americans say that the shutdown has had no impact on their lives.\n\nAn Economist/YouGov poll conducted from October 17th to 20th that garnered 1,621 responses showed that 49 percent of Americans say the shutdown is 'not at all' affecting them personally. \n\nLast week, Donald Trump ordered members of the military to receive pay during the government shutdown.\n\nThe president has ruled that they will be paid using any available funds from the Fiscal Year 2026 budget that Congress has already appropriated.\n\nRepublicans have supported a short-term measure to fund the government generally at current levels through November 21 but Democrats blocked it, insisting the measure address their concerns on health care.\n\nOn October 1, the first day of the shutdown, the President said he would with meet with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought 'to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.'\n\nVought told House Republicans that many of those workers would be targeted for permanent layoffs to be announced in the next day or two, echoing Trump spokesman Karoline Leavitt's threat that firings were 'imminent.'\n\nTrump has emphasized that he views cutbacks as a way of increasing pain on Democrats, arguing that 'we can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them. Like cutting vast numbers of people out.'\n\nBut the messaging on layoffs has been mixed, with Vice-President JD Vance saying that workforce reductions are a necessary evil that the administration would rather avoid.\n\nVance told reporters federal agencies were not being targeted based on politics, but added: 'Let's be honest - if this thing drags on for another few days or, God forbid, another few weeks, we are going to have to lay people off.'\n\nSenate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his House of Representatives counterpart Hakeem Jeffries have dismissed the threats of layoffs as an attempt at intimidation and said mass firings would not stand up in court.\n\nThree Senate Democrats have broke with their colleagues to fund the government, but the rest have been voting against a House-passed resolution to keep the government funded.\n\nFor now, Democrats are dug in on their demands for extending healthcare subsidies before they will agree to a funding deal.\n\nFive additional Democratic votes would be needed to reach the 60-vote threshold in the 100-member Senate to green-light the House-passed bill.\n\nHouse Republican Speaker Mike Johnson noted Tuesday that 'Democrats in Congress have voted 12 times to keep the government closed down.","summary":"A high-ranking Democrat appears to have admitted an inconvenient truth about the government shutdown that has officially entered its fourth week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15216457/Top-Dem-admits-shutdown-leverage.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/22/23/103232051-0-Rep_Katherine_Clark_D_Mass_the_House_minority_whip_is_joined_at_-a-8_1761173453871.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:09:32","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor,Victoria Churchill","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor","Victoria Churchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":371708482,"title":"Australia to send ADF liaison officer to join US-led Gaza peace taskforce","text":"The ADF officer will be based at the Civil Military Coordination Centre to contribute to planning and coordination, along with officials from other nations.

Trump said that the wing he described as a separate building “was never thought of as being much; it was a very small building”.\n\n“Rather than allowing that to hurt a very expensive, beautiful building,” he continued. “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.”\n\nThen, pointing at a model of the new ballroom on a table in front of him, and a new structure leading to the ballroom in the location where the East Wing used to be, Trump added: “The way it was shown, it looked like we were touching the White House. We don’t touch the White House.”\n\n“That’s a bridge, a glass bridge going from the White House to the ballroom,” Trump said, of the new structure that will replace the East Wing.\n\nTrump said the result is “going to be probably the finest ballroom ever built” and that the ballroom is “being paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a senior administration official, that the ballroom plans will mean the demolition of the entire East Wing. The official also said the demolition should be finished by this weekend.\n\nTwo Trump officials told NBC News similar information, noting the entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished “within days”.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House told Reuters it intended to send plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, an agency that typically approves and monitors construction on federal buildings. Demolition began earlier this week, with reporters taking video of a backhoe ripping out chunks of the White House’s exterior.\n\nPlans for Trump’s 90,000 sq ft ballroom were made public in the late summer, with Trump saying he would personally fund the $200m construction. “Just another way to spend my money for this construction,” he said at the time.\n\nWhite House officials insist demolition is allowed without the commission’s approval. Will Scharf, the Trump-appointed head of the commission, who is also a White House staff secretary, said in September there was a difference between demolition and rebuilding work, and only the commission can approve new construction.\n\nIn a statement to the Guardian, a White House official said: “The National Planning Commission does not require permits for demolition, only for vertical construction. Permits will be submitted to the NPC at the appropriate time.”\n\nBut in a letter sent to the White House on Tuesday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a leading historic preservation non-profit created by Congress, told the White House that demolition plans were “legally required” to go through public review and urged Trump to pause demolition.\n\n“We are deeply concerned that the massing height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself – it is 55,000 sq ft – and may also permanently disrupt carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,” the group said in the letter.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, the White House went through the commission to install a new fence, a much smaller project than the construction of the new ballroom.\n\nAmid the backlash over the demolition, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told Fox News on Tuesday that “there’s a lot of fake outrage out there right now”.\n\n“While many presidents have dreamt about this, it is actually President Trump who is actually doing something about it. And he is the builder-in-chief. In large part, he was re-elected to this people’s house because he is good at building things,” Leavitt said, noting that many presidents had made changes to the White House.\n\nCritics have pointed out that Trump over the summer said new construction would not affect the existing structure.\n\n“It won’t interfere with the current building. It’ll be near it, but not touching it, and [it] pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of,” Trump said.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the late-night host Stephen Colbert pulled up pictures of the White House exterior with gashes from demolition and noted “so that was a lie”.","summary":"Demolition has drawn fierce backlash, with National Trust for Historic Preservation saying plans are ‘legally required’\n\n\nTrump takes a wrecking ball to White House in on-the-nose metaphor\n\nTrump administration officials confirmed to various outlets on Wednesday that the White House’s East Wing will be demolished “within days”, a revelation given the administration has not submitted plans for the new ballroom to the federal agency that oversees construction of federal buildings.\n\nIn discussion with reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump was asked by Jeff Mason of Reuters to respond to the widespread surprise that the entire East Wing is being torn down.

It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.\n\n\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.\n\nHe performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.\n\n\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.\n\nTrump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.\n\n\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\nGoodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.\n\n\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"\n\nBanning the tush push has been tabled ... for nowEchoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.\n\nVincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.\n\n\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"\n\nMore from Roger Goodell at the NFL owners meetingAsked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.\n\n\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"\n\nGoodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.\n\nThe current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.\n\n\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"\n\nGoodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.","summary":"Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting.","url":"https://abc7.com/post/bad-bunnys-super-bowl-halftime-show-is-not-being-reconsidered-nfl-commissioner-says/18058838/","image":"https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18058815_AP25281043903469.jpg?w=1600","video":"https://vcl.abcotv.net/video/ccg/102225-cc-ABCNL-3p-Bad-Bunny-vid.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-22 23:02:18","author":"Stephen Whyno","authors":["Stephen Whyno"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":371700782,"title":"Trump Once Again Claims India 'Will Stop Buying Oil From Russia'","text":"US President Donald Trump on Wednesday again claimed Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured that India will stop buying oil from Russia.\n“India, as you know, has told me they are going to stop…it’s a process.

They should never have been forced together… They (China-Russia) can’t be friendly… I hope they are friendly, but they can’t be… Biden and Obama forced them together because of energy and oil. They are closer than they would normally be. I’ll probably be talking about it. What I’ll really be talking to him about is how do we end the war with Russia and Ukraine, whether it’s through oil or energy or anything else. I think he’s going to be very receptive,” he added.\nEarlier in the day, the US imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies for funding “Kremlin’s war machine”.\nAccording to a statement by the Treasury Department, the sanctions have been imposed on Russia’s two largest oil companies, Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) and Lukoil OAO (Lukoil).\n“The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is imposing further sanctions as a result of Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine. Today’s actions increase pressure on Russia’s energy sector and degrade the Kremlin’s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy,” it stated.\nIt said: “Rosneft is a vertically integrated energy company specializing in the exploration, extraction, production, refining, transport, and sale of petroleum, natural gas, and petroleum products. Lukoil engages in the exploration, production, refining, marketing, and distribution of oil and gas in Russia and internationally.”\nThe department further stated that the US will continue to advocate for a peaceful resolution to the war, and a permanent peace depends entirely on Russia’s willingness to negotiate in good faith.\nLater, President Trump told reporters: “Today is a very big day. Look, these are tremendous sanctions. These are very big. Those are against their two big oil companies… We hope that the war will be settled. We just answered having to do with the various forms of missiles and everything else that we’re looking at. But we don’t think that’s going to be necessary.”\n“We would like to see them just take the line that has been formed over quite a long period of time and go home.

We think it’s ridiculous and we’d like to have it end… I think they both want peace at this point. it’s almost four years… If I were president, it never would have started,” he added.\nBarely a week ago, US President Donald Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet in Budapest “within two weeks or so.”\nHowever, by Tuesday, the White House confirmed that the meeting would no longer take place.","summary":"Donald Trump claimed Narendra Modi assured India will stop buying oil from Russia.

As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.”\n\nThe reported influx would come amid plans voiced by Trump and Kristi Noem, homeland security chief, to send National Guard troops to the Bay Area — much as they’ve done in a handful of U.S. cities over the last several months, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Ore. As recently as Sunday, Trump reiterated those vows on Fox News by proclaiming: “We’re going to go to San Francisco.”\n\n“The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump said. “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”\n\nIn San Francisco, Mayor Daniel Lurie on Wednesday threatened to sue the Trump administration if it sent National Guard troops to the city, and he announced an executive directive ordering city agencies to coordinate in support of immigrant families. At a news conference, he said the influx of federal agents would only undermine efforts to combat crime and the city’s drug crisis.\n\n“Having the military posted in front of our schools, restaurants and office buildings will hinder our progress and let chaos get in the way of our recovery,” Lurie said in a virtual news conference.\n\nThere were no indications that National Guard troops would be among those staging this week on Coast Guard Island, The New York Times reported.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday hit back on social media, describing Trump’s move as one “right out of the dictator’s handbook.” He said the buildup was a repeat of similar tactics employed elsewhere in the nation, usually by flooding a city with masked immigration agents to foment “anxiety and fear,” then following with National Guard troops to stamp out “fictitious” crime.\n\n“This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire,” Newsom said. “We need to call that out and we cannot play his game.”\n\nU.S. Senator Adam Schiff said in a statement that “Donald Trump’s deployment of federal agents to San Francisco will not make the city safer or improve the quality of life for residents. It will only serve to inflame tensions, which is tragically what the president seeks.”\n\nOakland Mayor Barbara Lee added in her own statement that she was “actively monitoring the situation.” While Oakland “remains a proud sanctuary city committed to standing with our immigrant families,” she added that “real public safety comes from Oakland-based solutions, not federal military occupation.”\n\nJust this week, San Jose and Santa Clara County leaders announced plans to institute “ICE-free zones” on county or city-owned property mirrored after a similar initiative in Chicago. Already, the county — where more than 40% of residents are foreign-born and one in five immigrants is undocumented — has invested more than $8 million in community organizations that provide legal services to immigrants. It sued the Trump administration over the legality of his policies around “sanctuary” jurisdictions and birthright citizenship.\n\nThe county has also become the largest funder of the South Bay’s Rapid Response Network, one of many organizations in the Bay Area and statewide that operate hotlines for residents to report ICE sightings and to obtain legal help.\n\nDeputy County Executive David Campos said the Trump administration wants to instill fear in the community.\n\n“What we’re seeing is not only is there no compliance with those rules, but they’re targeting people including American citizens who have been unlawfully detained,” he said. “We have a federal agency that is not following the law.”\n\nUntil this week, Trump’s immigration crackdown in the Bay Area paled in comparison to his campaigns in other cities, where agents have snatched people from worksites, Home Depot parking lots and their neighborhood — at times regardless of their citizenship status.\n\nLocally, agents have detained people during otherwise-routine check-ins at ICE’s Bay Area offices, or during asylum hearings at immigration courthouses in Concord and San Francisco. In August, agents raided a home in East Oakland and removed seven people, including a teenager with Down syndrome. That same month in East Palo Alto, a 47-year-old woman from Mexico was hospitalized after passing out while agents tried to handcuff her.\n\nThe looming swell of federal agents could signal a new phase in that campaign.\n\nAdvocates and nonprofits providing free attorneys to undocumented immigrants scrambled Wednesday to warn their clients of the potential immigration sweeps and to urge them to avoid normal gathering spaces. Rapid response networks “are prepared to respond from a place of power, not panic,” said Milli Atkinson, director of the San Francisco Bar Association’s Immigrant Legal Defense Program.\n\n“We want to do what we can to protect people — if people can stay inside, I think that’s the best thing they can do,” said Ellen Dumesnil, executive director of the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area. “This administration’s goal is to terrorize, and I think they’re doing a good job of it.”\n\nHours after word emerged of the federal buildup, several Oaklanders pulled up to the bridge off Embarcadero and Dennison Street leading to Coast Guard Island, craning their necks to see the buildup for themselves. Earlier that morning, security officials at the island erected barriers to slow traffic on the bridge to and from the installation.\n\nAmong those looking on was Jesus Coba, who arrived with several fellow members of the nonprofit Communities United for Restorative Youth Justice.

Gor is now Trump's ambassador to India.\n\n'It came out of left field. There was no way they were going to give her the Vatican. It wouldn't be a fit, for many reasons. She must have known that,' one diplomatic source close to the conversation told the Daily Mail. \n\nGuilfoyle, a former Fox News host, is Catholic herself, but insiders say her public persona and background would likely have raised eyebrows among Vatican officials.\n\nKnown for her fiery rhetoric and attention–grabbing aesthetic, Guilfoyle is often portrayed in the media as a bold personality rather than a traditional diplomat.\n\nSources familiar with conversations at the White House and State Department say Guilfoyle's appointment was seen by most as 'unconventional, if not controversial,' in such a religiously and culturally sensitive setting. \n\nA source close to Guilfoyle said she never pursued the Vatican ambassadorship and added she is 'very excited to be the first female ambassador to Greece… in great spirits, and even joking about brushing up on her Greek dancing skills.'\n\nGuilfoyle wore a glimmering statement outfit, dazzling in an all–white pant suit, as she was sworn as ambassador to Greece late September, Daily Mail reported exclusively. \n\nThe ambassadorship to the Holy See is considered one of the most prestigious postings, typically reserved for career diplomats or individuals with deep ties to the Catholic Church. The current US ambassador, Brian Burch, was confirmed in 2025. He succeeded Joe Donnelly, who served from 2022 to 2024.\n\nCallista Gingrich, wife of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, served as Trump's ambassador to the Holy See during his first term.\n\nGreece, on the other hand, has emerged as a favored spot among political allies. It's a high–ranking post with significant diplomatic visibility, particularly in the context of US –NATO relations and tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n'She is better off in Athens, not Rome — but it's still a plum assignment,' one former administration official noted.\n\nGor and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nGuilfoyle is expected to arrive in Greece and move into the official Ambassador's residence before the end of October.\n\nShe is succeeding Ambassador George Tsunis.\n\nBefore her relationship with Don Jr., Guilfoyle was married for five years to California Gov. Gavin Newsom while he was mayor of San Francisco.\n\nShe also spent 12 years at Fox News where for seven of those years she was co–host of the evening panel show The Five.\n\nEven though she signed a long–term contract extension in mid–2017, Guilfoyle abruptly left the network a year later and began working for the pro–Trump America First super PAC.\n\nDuring the short confirmation hearing on July 9, Guilfoyle faced just a handful of questions from senators related to Greece's relationship with the US, Israel, Cyprus and the rise in tensions with Turkey. \n\n'This is total fake news from a tabloid publication that has a track record of writing baseless stories,' said Taylor Rogers.

There’s not a lot of awareness about this issue, yet it’s so common that it has almost become normal. Hair loss can take a quiet toll on a man’s confidence, especially when he’s constantly in front of cameras or under public scrutiny.\n\nThere are several reasons this happens, genetics being one of the most common causes, because if baldness runs in your family, there’s a high chance it’ll show up at some point. Other factors include stress, hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, certain health conditions, and even lifestyle habits like tight hairstyles or poor scalp care.\n\nWhile some men choose to embrace the look, shoutout to The Rock, Jason Statham, and Vin Diesel, others decide to explore modern hair restoration solutions. Among the most effective are PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) treatments and hair transplants. These are high-end aesthetic procedures that not everyone has access to, but they can completely transform one’s look.\n\nSeveral male celebrities have undergone hair transplants. Some have shared their journeys openly, while others preferred to keep it quiet. But as always, fans notice everything. Here are some male celebrities who got hair transplants and now look absolutely amazing.\n\n1. Peter “P-Square” Okoye\n\nPeter Okoye, one-half of the legendary Nigerian music duo P-Square, is one of the few male Nigerian celebrities who confidently shared his hair transplant story. In January 2025, Peter revealed that he flew to Istanbul, Turkey, for a hair restoration procedure at the renowned Med Hair Clinic.\n\nBefore the transplant, fans had noticed Peter’s hairline gradually receding, particularly around his temples. He had also shared that it was an insecurity of his. After the procedure, the difference was immediate and impressive as he had a fuller, healthier hairline that made him look younger and even more camera-ready.\n\nPeter’s openness was refreshing because cosmetic procedures are sometimes treated like a hush-hush situation. By sharing his journey, he helped normalise conversations about men’s grooming, self-image, and the pressure to maintain a certain look in the entertainment industry. \n\nREAD ALSO: It’s 2025. Are Braids Still Too Razz for The Club?\n\n2. Bacary Sagna\n\nFormer Arsenal and French national team defender Bacary Sagna is another celebrity who’s been candid about his hair journey. Known for his signature blonde-tipped dreadlocks during his Arsenal days, Sagna was nicknamed “The Locks Warrior” for his hairstyle. However, years of tight braiding led to traction alopecia: a condition caused by tension on the scalp, which left his hairline visibly thinned.\n\nRather than accept defeat, Sagna decided to go for an advanced hair transplant with sapphire implants: a high-end procedure that uses fine sapphire blades to implant hair grafts more precisely. He reportedly had around 2,000 grafts implanted to fill in the thinning areas to give him a smoother, fuller hairline.\n\nSagna’s case shows how hairstyles like dreadlocks or braids, when worn for years, can contribute to hair loss, and how technology is now making it possible to reverse the damage.\n\n3. Wayne Rooney\n\nWayne Rooney’s hair transplant story is easily one of the most famous in football history. The former Manchester United and England striker began losing his hair in his early twenties, something that affected him so much that he decided to do something about it. At just 25, Rooney underwent a hair transplant at a London clinic, and he didn’t shy away from telling fans about it.\n\nIn a tweet, he wrote: “Just to confirm to all my followers, I have had a hair transplant. I was going bald at 25, why not?” That level of honesty was rare at the time and earned him massive respect from fans and even fellow footballers.\n\nHe underwent a second hair transplant in 2015, which he mentioned in his biography “My Decade in the Premier League.” Over a decade later, Rooney continues to maintain a solid hairline.\n\nREAD ALSO: The Early 2010s Hairstyle Everyone’s Bringing Back\n\n5. Mohamed Salah\n\nLiverpool superstar Mohamed Salah has never publicly admitted to getting a hair transplant, but his evolving look over the years has sparked endless discussion among fans. Early in his career, Salah’s temples looked a bit thinner, and his hairline on both sides seemed to be receding. Recently, his hairline looks much better, and fans speculate he has had some work done. \n\nExperts suggest he may have undergone a hair transplant to fill in the areas around his temple that were receding. This subtly brought his hair temples forward to meet his central hairline and maintain his natural appearance. Whatever he’s doing, it’s clearly working. His healthy curls have become part of his trademark image on and off the pitch.\n\n6. David Beckham\n\nDavid Beckham has always been a style icon. From his footballing days to his fashion empire, everything about Beckham is posh and classy. David sported a lot of hairstyles in the late 90s. His looks were often associated with the popular boy band Westlife. He also once rocked a buzz cut, which created quite a frenzy. \n\nAround summer 2018, fans noticed some thinning near his temples, and some months later, his hair looked fuller with no signs of receding. It was speculated that he had quietly undergone a hair transplant.\n\nThough he never confirmed it, experts in hair restoration suggested he likely had a discreet FUE (Follicular Unit Excision) transplant to fill in the thinning areas. \n\nREAD ALSO: I Tried All of Toke Makinwa’s Perfumes - Here’s the Truth\n\n7. Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump’s hair has been a conversation starter for decades. His distinctive blonde combover has inspired endless memes and speculation. According to reports, Trump underwent an early form of hair restoration surgery known as scalp reduction: a procedure that physically pulls areas of hair-bearing skin closer together to cover bald spots.\n\nThough it’s not the modern FUE or FUT transplant we know today, the surgery explains how Trump has maintained his hair for so long. His hairstyle may be unconventional, but it’s become an undeniable part of his personal brand. \n\n8. Lewis Hamilton\n\nFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton is known for many things: his speed, his fashion sense, and of course, his ever-changing hairstyles. Keen observers noticed that Hamilton’s hair began looking noticeably fuller around 2017 after years of sporting shorter cuts and visible thinning. While the Mercedes driver has never confirmed getting a hair transplant, experts and fans alike believe he underwent a hair restoration procedure.\n\nIn an interview, Hamilton once hinted that his hair transformation came from “proper self-care,” but the improvement was too significant to be just shampoo and diet. His once sparse edges are now thick and defined, which allows him to experiment with braids, cornrows, and even dreadlocks.\n\n9. Antonio Conte\n\nItalian football manager Antonio Conte’s hair story is almost legendary in sports circles. In his playing days with Juventus during the 1990s, Conte’s hairline had noticeably receded, leaving a large bald patch at the front. When he transitioned into coaching, fans were surprised to see a completely transformed hairline that was thick, dark, and perfectly shaped.\n\nConte reportedly underwent multiple hair transplant surgeries, including one in Italy and another in Canada, to achieve his current look. His transformation is so well-known that it’s often referenced in football banter and even interviews.\n\nToday, his hair looks natural and full, to the point that younger fans who only know him as a coach would never guess he once struggled with baldness. \n\nHair transplants are no longer a secret or a shameful topic. More male celebrities are embracing hair restoration as a form of self-care and confidence-building. These men are helping to destigmatise hair loss and show that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to look your best.","summary":"8 Male Celebrities Who Quietly Got Hair Transplants and Look Amazing Now","url":"https://www.pulse.ng/articles/entertainment/celebrities/celebrities-with-hair-transplants-2025102209271893245","image":"https://image.api.sportal365.com/process/smp-images-production/pulse.ng/22102025/3b91dcb9-ea6e-49b4-aeba-2b84792a9e9f.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 22:43:00","author":"Odunmorayo Ayobami","authors":["Odunmorayo Ayobami"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.245},{"id":371708752,"title":"Trump Administration Significantly Ups Sanctions on Russia in Push for Ceasefire in Ukraine","text":"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his administration is raising sanctions on Russia in a pressure campaign to bring a close to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nTrump shared a press release from his Treasury Department late Wednesday afternoon announcing additional sanctions on Russia’s top oil companies.

Companies in which Rosneft and Lukoil own over a 50 percent stake are blocked, it specifies.\n\n“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the press release. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.”\n\n“Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war.

We hope that the war will be settled,” he added.\n\nThe release directs that “all property and interests in property of the designated or blocked persons” subject to the sanctions “that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.”\n\n“[A]ll transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked persons” are generally prohibited.\n\nMoreover, “foreign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions or provide any service involving Russia’s military-industrial base, including any persons blocked pursuant to E.O. 14024,” like Open Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil and Lukoil OAO or its subsidiaries, could be sanctioned themselves.\n\nTrump has made it a top priority to bring the war to a close since returning to office, and has used tariffs as one tool and effort to bring Russia to the negotiating table.

However, as peace talks have continued without a secure deal being agreed upon, the Treasury Department released a press statement revealing that the OFAC is “imposing further sanctions as a result of Russia’s lack of serious commitment to a peace process” with Ukraine.\n\n“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.”\n\n“Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war.

Given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine.”\n\nBessent said the Treasury Department was prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump’s effort to end the war. “We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”\n\nBessent made the comments as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte was in Washington for talks with Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.\n\nThe announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.\n\nThe attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.\n\nAt least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.\n\nRussian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock. He said the attack targeted 10 separate regions: Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy.\n\nRussia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine’s air force said.\n\nPeace efforts stall\n\nTrump’s efforts to end the war that started with Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn’t want it to be a “waste of time.” European leaders accused Putin of stalling.\n\nZelenskyy said Wednesday that Trump’s proposal to freeze the conflict where it stands on the front line “was a good compromise” — a step that could pave the way for negotiations.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned summit requires careful preparation, suggesting that laying the groundwork could be protracted. “No one wants to waste time: neither President Trump nor President Putin,” he said.\n\nIn what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country’s strategic nuclear forces.\n\nZelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow “only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,” he said.\n\nMore international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing — a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine — is to take place in London.\n\nZelenskyy credited Trump’s remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin’s willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks.\n\nRussia has not made significant progress on the battlefield, where a war of attrition has taken a high toll on Russian infantry and Ukraine is short of manpower, military analysts say. Both sides have invested in long-range strike capabilities to hit rear areas.\n\nUkraine says it hit key Russian chemical plant\n\nThe Ukrainian army’s general staff said its forces struck a chemical plant Tuesday night in Russia’s Bryansk region using British-made air-launched Storm Shadow missiles.

Federal officials accused Virginia's president of failing to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices that President Donald Trump has labeled as unlawful discrimination.The mounting pressure prompted James Ryan to announce his resignation as university president in June, saying the stakes were too high for others on campus if he opted to “fight the federal government in order to save my job.”IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | University of Virginia president resigns under Trump administration pressure on DEI, AP source saysUnlike some universities' deals with the Trump administration, the Virginia agreement announced Wednesday does not include a fine or monetary payment, said Paul Mahoney, interim president of the university, in a campus email. Instead, the university agreed to follow the government’s anti-discrimination criteria. Every quarter, the university must provide relevant data showing compliance, personally certified by its president.The deal, Mahoney wrote, preserves the university's academic freedom and doesn't hurt its attempts to secure federal research funding. And the university won't have external monitoring by the federal government beyond quarterly communications with the Department of Justice.If Virginia complies, the Justice Department said it would officially end its investigations. If not, possible consequences include a fine or termination of federal funding.Virginia’s settlement follows other agreements signed by Columbia and Brown universities to end federal investigations and restore access to federal funding. Columbia paid $200 million to the government, and Brown paid $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations.Along with omitting a fine, Virginia’s agreement is less prescriptive than those signed by Columbia and Brown. The deal requires Virginia to adhere to four pages of terms, compared to nine at Brown and 22 at Columbia. It includes a clear affirmation of academic freedom, with an acknowledgement that the government “does not aim to dictate the content of academic speech or curricula.”Although the college will adopt new federal definitions of discrimination in hiring, “we will also redouble our commitment to the principles of academic freedom, ideological diversity, free expression, and the unyielding pursuit of ‘truth, wherever it may lead,’” wrote Mahoney, quoting Thomas Jefferson, who founded the University of Virginia.RELATED STORY | Trump asks 9 colleges to commit to his political agenda and get favorable access to federal moneyAs a public university, the University of Virginia was an outlier in the Trump administration’s effort to reform higher education according to the president’s vision. Previously, the administration had devoted most of its scrutiny to elite private colleges, including Harvard and other Ivy League institutions, accused of tolerating antisemitism.Since then, the White House has expanded its campaign to other public campuses, including the University of California, Los Angeles, and George Mason University.The Charlottesville campus became a flashpoint this year after conservative critics accused it of simply renaming its DEI initiatives rather than ending them. Much of the federal scrutiny had centered on complaints that Ryan, the college president who resigned in June, was too slow to implement a March 7 resolution by the university’s governing board demanding the eradication of DEI on campus. The Justice Department expanded the scope of its review several times and announced a separate investigation into alleged antisemitism in May.Among the most prominent critics was America First Legal, a conservative group created by Trump aide Stephen Miller. In a May letter to federal officials, the group said Virginia had only moved to “rename, repackage and redeploy the same unlawful infrastructure under a lexicon of euphemisms.”Similar accusations have embroiled George Mason University, where the governing board came to the defense of the president even as the Education Department cited allegations that he promoted diversity initiatives above credentials in hiring. On Aug. 1, the board unanimously voted to give President Gregory Washington a pay increase of 1.5%. The same day, the board approved a resolution forbidding DEI in favor of a “merit-based approach” in campus policies.IN RELATED NEWS | Tracking Trump's college funding freezesThe University of Virginia deal with the Justice Department did not include one of the investigations the federal government had launched into the college. The Education Department had included the Charlottesville campus in a March 10 list identifying 60 universities that were under investigation for alleged antisemitism.A department spokesperson said she could not confirm whether the investigation is still open because the agency’s Office for Civil Rights is furloughed during the government shutdown. She said the agreement does not resolve any department investigations.Still, Education Secretary Linda McMahon praised the Justice Department for pressing for “a renewed commitment to merit” at universities.“The Trump Administration is not backing down in our efforts to root out DEl and illegal race preferencing on our nation’s campuses,” McMahon said in a post on X.","summary":"The University of Virginia has agreed to abide by White House guidance forbidding discrimination in admissions and hiring, becoming the latest campus to strike a deal with the Trump administration.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/university-of-virginia-strikes-deal-to-pause-trump-administration-investigations","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab1d0b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+51/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2Faa%2F38f5e770473ead7b6381fa52ac84%2Fap25295738530783.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 22:34:52","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":371709296,"title":"Trump Says Xi Jinping Could Have \"Big Influence\" On Putin","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-xi-jinping-could-have-big-influence-on-vladimir-putin-9500492\" on this server.\nReference #18.8ea72917.1761179637.1a7a21cc\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.8ea72917.1761179637.1a7a21cc","summary":"President Donald Trump said Wednesday Xi Jinping could have a \"big influence\" on Russia's Vladimir Putin over efforts to end the war in Ukraine, days ahead of a meeting scheduled between the US and Chinese leaders in South Korea.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-xi-jinping-could-have-big-influence-on-vladimir-putin-9500492","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-22 22:32:57","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":371708766,"title":"James Woods Roasts Hillary Clinton's White House Renovation Screed: 'Your Husband Getting Blow Jobs in the Oval Office Destroyed It'","text":"Actor James Woods roasted failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her outcry at President Donald Trump’s White House renovations, in which the former First Lady accused Trump of “destroying” the building. “What destroyed it was your husband getting blow jobs in the Oval Office,” Woods said.\n\nClinton wrote, “It’s not his house.
