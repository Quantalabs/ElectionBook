The executive order cast a spotlight on a business deal that drew scant attention when it was announced in May 2024 during President Joe Biden's administration. The deal involved aerospace and defense specialist Emcore Corp. selling its computer chips and wafer fabrication operations to HieFo for $2.92 million - a price that included the assumption of about $1 million in liabilities. But Trump is now demanding that HieFo divest that technology within 180 days, citing \"credible evidence\" that the current owner is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. HieFo was founded by Dr. Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore. According to a press release that came out after the deal closed, plans for the technology acquired from Emcore were to be overseen by largely the same team of employees in Alhambra, California. Zhang, who was a vice president of engineering at Emcore before becoming HieFo's CEO, pledged to \"continue the pursuit of the most innovative and disruptive solutions\" with technology designed for purposes that would include artificial intelligence.Live Events HieFo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's order. Emcore was a publicly traded company at the time of the HieFo deal, but was taken private last year by the investment firm Charlesbank Capital Partner.

The order said there was “credible evidence” that the transaction could threaten the national security of the United States.\n\nHieFo, a Delaware-based company controlled by a Chinese national, had acquired assets tied to digital chips as well as wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore. The acquisition was completed on April 30, 2024.\n\nTrump said existing legal authorities, outside Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, did not provide “adequate and appropriate authority” to address the risks posed by the transaction.\n\nUnder the order, the transaction is prohibited, and HieFo is barred from holding any interest or rights in the Emcore assets, either directly or indirectly. HieFo and its affiliates have been directed to divest all such interests within 180 calendar days, unless the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, extends the deadline.\n\nUntil the divestment is completed and verified by CFIUS, HieFo is prohibited from granting access to the Emcore assets. The restriction also applies to non-public technical information, information technology systems, products, parts, components, books, and records. Any access would require written approval from CFIUS.\n\nThe order authorizes CFIUS to impose compliance measures, require certifications, and conduct audits to ensure adherence. HieFo must submit regular written certifications confirming that it is following the order and detailing progress toward divestment.\n\nEmcore had earlier announced the sale of its chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations for $2.92 million. The transaction also involved HieFo's assumption of certain liabilities and covered substantially all assets tied to Emcore’s discontinued chips business, including facilities in Alhambra, California.\n\nCFIUS is an interagency panel chaired by the US Treasury Department that reviews foreign investments for national security risks. Its scrutiny has expanded in recent years, particularly for deals involving advanced technologies.\n\nSemiconductors are viewed as critical to both civilian and defense applications. US administrations have increasingly used executive authority to restrict foreign access to sensitive chip technologies amid heightened strategic competition with China.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Jan 3 (SocialNews.XYZ) US President Donald Trump has blocked a deal involving American semiconductor assets and a Chinese-linked company, citing national security concerns.

Some merchants in the capital's bazaar joined in.\n\nDemonstrations have now affected 20 areas, mostly towns in the west of the country, according to an AFP tally of official and local Iranian media reports.\n\nIn the southern city of Fasa, dozens of people protested outside a government building, lobbing projectiles and seeking to tear down its gate, according to videos posted on Wednesday, whose location AFP verified.\n\nSlogans heard at protests now include \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Woman, Life, Freedom\", the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says, citing verified videos and reports. AFP was not immediately able to authenticate these soundbites.\n\nThe same chants were used in mass demonstrations after the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman arrested for allegedly breaching the country's dress code for women.\n\nBut authorities stamped out the 2022-2023 protests, using mass arrests and executions as part of its levers of repression, rights activists say. The system in charge since the 1979 revolution stayed in place. \n\nWhat's the context? \n\n\"The protesters are very clear in their slogans — they are not looking for reform,\" said US-Iranian human rights lawyer Gissou Nia, of the Atlantic Council.\n\nThey come as \"the Islamic republic is dealing with a range of pressures, not only internally but also externally\", she said.\n\nRegional arch-foe Israel and the United States in June pounded Iranian nuclear sites and killed top military brass during a 12-day war.\n\nOn Monday, US President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida that if Tehran rebuilt its nuclear facilities, the United States would \"knock them down.\"\n\nTrump said on Friday the United States was \"locked and loaded\" to respond if Iran killed protesters.\n\nIran has also been weakened following major blows dealt to its regional allies, including in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nSome Iranians hold long-standing resentment that Tehran has given too much financial or military support to its regional proxies, such as Lebanese movement Hezbollah, during economic hardship at home.\n\nIran International, a television channel based outside Iran that is critical of the authorities, has reported that recent protest slogans included \"Neither Gaza nor Lebanon, my life for Iran.\"\n\nHow have authorities reacted? \n\nProtesters and security forces clashed in several Iranian cities on Thursday, with six reported killed, the first deaths since the unrest escalated.\n\nSchools, banks and public institutions were closed on Wednesday for a public holiday, with officials saying this was due to the cold weather and to save energy.\n\nBut authorities have also recognised the grievances as legitimate, and announced a series of measures, including replacing the central bank governor.\n\nPresident Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, said on Thursday that he and his government would \"end up in hell\", in the religious sense, if they failed to address economic hardship.\n\n\"The government knows that merchants are the lifeblood, the beating heart of Iran's economy, and therefore it is obliged to take measures to address, at least partially, the big issues,\" French-Iranian sociologist Azadeh Kian told AFP.\n\nBut supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, has yet to speak publicly on the matter.\n\n How big is it? \n\nOpposition abroad have welcomed the new protests.\n\nReza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's ousted shah, on X hailed 2026 as \"the definitive moment for change\", while the National Council of Resistance in Iran said Iranians wanted to \"free themselves from the scourge of religious tyranny\".\n\nBut Kian said today's protests were not as large-scale as previous demonstrations sparked by economic grievances, including those of 2019. They were sparked by a petrol hike, spreading to around 100 cities and towns, and left hundreds dead, according to rights groups.\n\n\"I very much doubt the current rallies could bring down or overthrow the regime,\" she said.\n\nArash Azizi, a postdoctoral associate and lecturer at Yale University, said the demonstrations however remained \"the most serious wave of protests since 2023\".\n\n\"It is clear that with ever declining standards of living and growing discontent, [the government] will have to face periodic protests,\" he said.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irans-protests-what-we-know/article70465645.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/5viomj/article70465647.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2026-01-02T151527Z_579463170_RC23TIACNH0P_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 00:36:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":390844188,"title":"George Clooney Responds To Donald Trump's Comments About His French Citizenship | Access","text":"George Clooney is responding to President Donald Trump’s recent comments about his and Amal Clooney’s recent French citizenship.

Y. Olaonipekun, and one of his sons, who is a National Youth Service Corps member, were abducted in the Ile-Ire district of Ifelodun LGA of Kwara State.\n\nGunmen also attacked Kunza community in Ashigye village in Lafia LGA of Nasarawa State, killing three people and injuring nine others on 31 December.\n\nOn 26 December, bandits kidnapped five travellers along the Ogbe-Egbe Road and injured one other person.\n\nISWAP also claimed it fired mortars at a Nigerian military camp in Goniri, Yobe State, although the extent of damage was not disclosed.\n\nOn Wednesday, a security analyst, Brant Phillips, said ISWAP raided a village, killing 11 “hostile” Christians, destroying a church and over 100 houses and capturing their properties.\n\nThis is the first time ISWAP refers to a group of Christians as being “hostile”, following ISCAP using this same wording recently.\n\nA former United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, in a post on X, urged Trump to conduct a follow-up strike to increase the pressure on the terrorists.\n\nHe said, “Nigeria’s Christians deserve the chance to worship our Lord without fear. If President Trump follows up last week’s strikes against ISIS with a sustained pressure campaign, we’ll see important advances for religious freedom in Nigeria and beyond.”\n\nBoko Haram kills 14 in Adamawa\n\nThe Chairman of Hong LGA in Adamawa State, Usman Inuwa, confirmed that Boko Haram killed 14 people in two villages in the local government.\n\nInuwa, who spoke with Saturday PUNCH on Friday, said Boko Haram invaded two villages, Mubang and Zar, at night, killing 14 people and injuring two others.\n\n“Around 9pm on that day, Boko Haram invaded Mubang and Zar villages, which are close to Sambisa forest. They killed 14 people, shot two people and burnt dozens of houses with foodstuffs.\n\n“These villages are located near Sambisa forest, and there are no other villages in between. It is a vast empty land, so Boko Haram took advantage of the ungoverned spaces to attack and kill innocent people”, he said.\n\nInuwa added that a combined team of military and vigilante in the past guarded the area, repelling Boko Haram attacks.\n\nBandits on Thursday night also attacked Yankwada, Babanduhu and other villages in Shanono LGA of Kano State, killing one person and carting away cows.\n\nThe terrorists, who reportedly stormed the areas on 50 motorcycles, engaged the Nigerian military in a heavy gun battle until about 5am on Friday morning.\n\nThe Chairman of Shanono/Bagwai Community Security Forum, Alhaji Yahya Bagobiri, confirmed the incident to Saturday PUNCH, saying that the bandits came on a revenge mission after losing nine of their members last week to the military fire powers.\n\nBagobiri called on the Federal Government to provide more arms and redeploy more personnel to complement those gallant officers on ground.\n\nWhen contacted, the Assistant Director, Army Public Relations 3 Brigade Nigerian Army, Capt. Babatunde Zubairu, confirmed the attack via a WhatsApp message.\n\n“All the details are true except that they didn’t kill anyone and there was no rustling of cows,” he said.\n\nTerrorists move to Niger, Kaduna\n\nMeanwhile, a community leader in the state has hinted that terrorists displaced by the U.S. air strikes in Sokoto may be attempting to infiltrate the state from neighbouring states through multiple routes.\n\nThe community leader, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, said intelligence reports indicated that some fleeing fighters were moving into Niger and Kaduna through parts of Katsina and the Zamfara border, while others were transiting from Kebbi towards Kwara and parts of the South-West.\n\n“Yes, there are movements. Terrorists are infiltrating Niger and Kaduna through parts of Katsina and the Zamfara borders. Some from Kebbi are also running towards Kwara and the South-West,” he said.\n\nHe noted that the development had heightened tension in rural communities and prompted local armed groups to enforce internal discipline following what he described as minor breaches of existing peace arrangements.\n\n“Two days ago, some bandits met at Ungwan Nachibi, where the Kachalla warned that any member found breaching the peace agreement would have his rifle and motorcycle seized,” he said.\n\nThe community leader added that the directive also included driving out unfamiliar persons entering the area without clearance, as a measure to prevent infiltration.\n\nHe further disclosed that aerial surveillance had been intensified, with Nigerian Air Force aircraft hovering daily over parts of Birnin-Gwari, Niger State and areas bordering Kebbi to monitor movements.\n\n“As it is now, people are more vigilant and are reporting any suspicious movement capable of breaching peace,” he said, stressing that no Boko Haram or ISWAP attack has been recorded in Kaduna since the airstrikes, describing current actions as preventive.\n\nSuspected bandits on Wednesday evening invaded Adanla community, a suburb of Igbaja in Ifelodun LGA, abducting eight residents and injuring several others.\n\nCommunity sources told Saturday PUNCH that the attack triggered panic, forcing many residents to flee to neighbouring towns and farms for safety, fearing further assaults.\n\nVillage heads and residents confirmed that some families have temporarily abandoned their homes, especially in Aafin and Adanla, as fear spreads across the area.\n\nNo attack in Sokoto\n\nFindings by Saturday PUNCH revealed that no attacks were reported in Sokoto States since the US air strikes.\n\nOur correspondent in Skoto gathered that unlike in previous times when reports of attacks on communities are persistent, things have now slowed down somehow.\n\nConfirming the development, Alhaji Abdullah Umara, a resident of Rabbah, one of the villages in which insecurity is persistent said the community has not recorded any attack in recent times.\n\nHe said the situation may be connected to the recent airstrike in some part of the state which has now resulted in some of the bandits fleeing their hideouts.\n\n“We have not witnessed any attack here for some time now, I believe it has to do with the recent attack in some of the hideouts of the criminals.\n\n“We learnt that some of them were wiped out while some ran out of their camp. Our prayer is for this peaceful living should continue “ he added.","summary":"Following US airstrikes, terrorist attacks in Nigeria have intensified.

The move follows Trump's initial outrage at the claim, an opinion he appeared to walk back afterthe CIA allegedly revealed to him that it was fabricated.Russia is reportedly hoping to get Trump to reject the clarification by the CIA on the supposed Ukrainian drone attack on Putin's home. At the time the claims first emerged, Trump was allegedly outraged by the information until the CIA told him that it was not true. The Russian defence ministry claimed it intercepted 91 Ukrainian drones that targeted Putin's home, even releasing images of what it claims was a downed drone on Russian territory.Trump's Whiplash ReactionTrump seemed to be convinced of the supposed intercepted attack, following a phone call with Putin. When asked if Washington had any evidence of the attack, Trump seemed to walk back his initial reaction. 'You are saying maybe the attack didn't take place — that is possible too, I guess – but President Putin told me this morning it did' said Trump.Kremlin Presents 'Proof'Despite the claims by Russia being supposedly debunked, the Kremlin also staged a meeting with a US official, presenting them with part of the drone that the Russian defence ministry said was used in the attack on Putin's home. Admiral Igor Kostyukov of Russia's Armed Forces said the drone part was proof of Ukraine's attack and would 'reveal the truth.'The presentation of 'evidence' by the Kremlin follows Trump's reversal of opinion regarding the alleged drone attack, as well as himsharing a piece critical of Putin on social media, after the CIA informed him that the attack never happened.The timing also follows Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the weekend. It was also seen as an effort to win back Trump's support in the negotiations to end the war, which has been going on for years. It seemed to have initially worked, with the Kremlin touting that Trump was 'literally outraged.'Ukraine Rejects Russia's AccusationsUkraine has denied the allegations made by Russia that it has planned a drone attack on Putin's home. Kyiv said this was another attempt by Moscow to sabotage the peace process. Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said Russia has not provided any credible evidence to back up the accusations. 'Because there's none. No such attack happened,' Sybiha said Tuesday in a post on X.Sybiha added that Russia's 'signature tactic' is leveraging 'false claims.' 'They often accuse others of what they themselves plan to do,' said Sybiha. 'Their words should never be taken at face value.'Similarly, Ukrainian military bloggers have also noted that the model of flight controller the Kremlin claimed that the Ukrainian side used–a MATEK H743–is usually used for short-range flights and is not likely capable of flying the distance needed to strike Putin's residence.The CIA's AssessmentThe CIA reportedly further confirmed the findings by Kyiv that the drones did not target Putin's home. But while the drones were not found to target Putin's residence, US intelligence said that Kyiv did attempt a strike on a nearby military target in the same region.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russia-looking-trump-legitimise-claims-vladimir-putins-home-assault-1767793","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779914/donald-trump-vladimir-putin.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=825a730ef57c08fc011dfe4990dd9c1d","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 00:15:05","author":"Denise Nequinto","authors":["Denise Nequinto"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.59},{"id":390844814,"title":"Bombardments Of ISIS’ Hideouts And Need To Equip Amotekun, Others","text":"BOLU – OLU ESHO\n\nAKURE – Nigerians were celebrating Christmas like every other person across the world last week Thursday, and many were dead asleep due to exhaustion from the merriment of the day.\n\nA few ones who were still awake were stunned by the tweet of President Donald Trump of the United States of America (USA) on The White House X (Twitter) handle a couple of minutes to the next day, Friday, in Nigeria time.\n\nHe succinctly wrote: “Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!\n\n “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.

Intelligence gathering and surveillance system must be heightened to frustrate any further plan to hit any target.\n\n A critical analysis of the Pan Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, on the development revealed how many Nigerians had been longing for this intervention.\n\nIt’s no longer news to Nigerians that the lack of political will of previous governments made insurgence festered faster in the country year in year out.\n\nA statement signed by Abagun Kole Omololu, the National Organising Secretary of Afenifere, reads: “Afenifere unequivocally supports this decisive action, which comes after years of relentless insecurity that has held communities hostage and undermined the very fabric of the nation.\n\n “At this critical juncture, the involvement of the United States in the ongoing counter-terrorism operations deserves recognition, not condemnation.\n\n“For far too long, innocent Nigerians have been subjected to relentless attacks, abductions and wanton destruction of property, while insufficient measures were taken to decisively confront these terrorist enclaves.\n\n “The vacuum created by decades of ineffective governance has, regrettably, invited the intervention of capable partners who understand the urgency of the situation.”\n\nGovernment should inform Nigerians on why it eventually decided to seek USA’s support in hitting the hideouts of the insurgents.\n\nIt is important for government to be a step ahead of sponsors of these terrorists who may surreptitiously launch media attacks as reprisal by misinforming Nigerians on the reason for the strikes to create chaos.\n\nThis should be done in all local languages for wider spread of the information as quick as possible.\n\nAfenifere noted this in its statement, saying “The swift and coordinated military response demonstrates the Federal Government’s commitment to restoring safety and stability to affected regions.\n\n“We call upon all citizens, political leaders, and civil society actors to resist any temptation to undermine these efforts with misplaced criticism.\n\n“Now is the time for solidarity, support and constructive collaboration to eradicate terrorism and protect the lives of Nigerians.”\n\n Nevertheless, after the completion of the operations, assessment should be carried out to identify innocent persons and property affected by the bombardments and provisions for resettlement and compensation would be arranged by the Federal Government.","summary":"BOLU &#8211; OLU ESHO AKURE &#8211; Nigerians were celebrating Christmas like every other person across the world last week Thursday, and many were dead asleep due to exhaustion from the&#8230;\n\n\nThe post Bombardments Of ISIS&#8217; Hideouts And Need To Equip Amotekun, Others appeared first on Independent Newspaper Nigeria.","url":"https://independent.ng/bombardments-of-isis-hideouts-and-need-to-equip-amotekun-others/","image":"https://independent.ng//wp-content/uploads/1-443.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 00:02:07","author":"Our Correspondents","authors":["Our Correspondents"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":390857364,"title":"Joe Rogan insists Kamala Harris would've done 'fine' on his 3-hour-show: 'Could've talked for hours'","text":"Joe Rogan defended former Vice President Kamala Harris Wednesday after his guest suggested Harris would have floundered on Rogan’s three-hour podcast had she accepted his invitation during the 2024 presidential campaign. In a clip from his Dec. 31 show picked up by Mediaite, Rogan and Australian comedian James McCann discussed candidate Donald Trump’s viral October 2024 appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" Rogan noted that Trump sat for the full three-hour interview without breaks and without being given questions in advance, which Rogan said he respected. McCann suggested Trump’s opponent, Harris, would not have been able to do the same. \"He was able to talk for three hours. Whereas Kamala wouldn’t do it,\" McCann said. JOE ROGAN CLAIMS TOP SPOT ON APPLE PODCASTS, DETHRONES NEW YORK TIMES' 'THE DAILY' \"Well, she could have — she could have done it. I’m telling you, man,\" Rogan responded. \"It would’ve been fine.\" McCann pointed to Harris’ August appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" as evidence she would not have performed well in a long-form podcast setting. Rogan pushed back, arguing that televised interviews in front of live audiences are not conducive to meaningful conversations. \"If you’re going to have a really important conversation with someone, you don’t want to do it with a f------ audience,\" Rogan said. \"Also, you only have seven minutes before you have to cut for commercial or whatever it is. JOE ROGAN AND ANDREW SCHULZ MOCK HARRIS' CLAIM OF PEOPLE CALLING HER MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE \"You can’t do that,\" he continued. \"It’ll take me seven minutes to ask what she likes to cook.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to Harris' office for comment. Rogan described the kinds of questions he would have asked Harris had she agreed to appear on his podcast. \"I want to know, is there anything that she regrets doing?\" he said. \"Is it more complicated being a vice president than you thought it was going to be? Like, what is the web of trying to fix things and change things versus the people that are influencing you to make decisions? \"’Cause we’re not pretending that people don’t spend a lot of money to influence your decisions,\" Rogan continued. \"So how much of an effect does it have? TIM WALZ SAYS HARRIS CAMPAIGN MEDIA STRATEGY FELL WAY SHORT \"What would be better? Could we take money out of politics? Would you be willing? What would we do if we completely eliminated corporate funding of any politicians? How would that change everything? \"Those are the kind of questions. … We could have talked for hours about that.\" The podcaster has maintained his team was in discussions with Harris’ campaign about a potential interview but she ultimately backed out. \"They just got scared,\" Rogan said on his show in February 2025. \"They could have put her in. I would have held her hand. We would have had a conversation.\" The Harris campaign has disputed that account, arguing that Rogan’s team made several difficult demands regarding scheduling and interview conditions, according to the book \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Rogan has repeatedly rejected those claims, saying the failed interview was the result of Harris’ team, not his. He has also said that while he would not have voted for Harris, he had no intention of conducting a hostile interview. \"I’m not going to be antagonistic, I’m not going to be a s-------, I’m not gonna be … I have no desire to turn this into a viral clip thing. I’m not trying to do that,\" Rogan said earlier this year. \"I never wanted that done to me, so why would I do that to someone else?\" Trump’s relaxed, long-form appearances on top podcasts like Rogan's are widely believed to have helped propel him to victory in the 2024 election.

The country is also pursuing similar agreements with Japan, South Korea and India as part of efforts to diversify its trade and cushion the impact of Trump’s tariffs.\nAnalysts say such reforms could help strengthen sectors like agriculture and vehicle manufacturing, which have long benefited from protectionism and subsidies.\n“The deal has made the government look into its trade policies, potentially levelling the playing field,” said Timothy Wong, a senior analyst at BowerGroupAsia. “Which could help increase competitiveness and innovation for local companies.”","summary":"Janice, a Kuala Lumpur-based food entrepreneur and chef, is in a foul mood as she laments the inferior quality and taste of US-produced chicken and eggs.

Ukrainian media widely shared footage of the aftermath, while Vladimir Zelensky immediately accused Moscow of seeking to disrupt peace talks.\n\nHowever, initial videos from the scene indicated that a building in the area was already smoking heavily before a large detonation, and the entire incident was not accompanied by an air raid siren or the noise of an approaching missile or drone.\n\n\"The Russian Armed Forces did not plan or launch any attacks using missiles or aviation weapons within the city of Kharkiv,\" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement late Friday.\n\n\"Based on eyewitness videos published by Ukrainian information resources, the epicenter of the explosion was located in the Persona shopping center... On the published video footage, heavy smoke of unknown origin was recorded in the building a few seconds before the explosion, which indicates a high probability of detonation of the ammunition stored there by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" it added.\n\nKiev's claims are intended to \"distract the attention of the international community from the brutal terrorist attack committed by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the night of January 1,\" it added.\n\nShortly before midnight on New Year's Eve, Ukrainian UAVs hit a cafe and hotel in the village of Khorly in Russia's Kherson Region where some hundred people were gathered for celebrations. At least 27 civilians, including two minors, were killed and 31 others injured in the strike and the blaze that it caused.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the Russian military announced it has conducted one large-scale and six group strikes inside Ukraine over the past week in response to Kiev's \"terrorist attacks on civilian targets in Russia.\"\n\nHigh-precision munitions, including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, were utilized during the strikes. The targets included production facilities for Ukrainian long-range drones, as well as transportation and port infrastructure used by Kiev's forces, arms and fuel depots, and temporary deployment sites of Ukrainian military units and foreign mercenaries, the ministry said.\n\nOn December 28-29, Kiev launched 91 long-range UAVs at the residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Novgorod Region. Moscow has condemned the attack as an act of \"state terrorism,\" saying that the raid was not only aimed at Putin, but also against US President Donald Trump's \"efforts to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict.\"","url":"https://www.theuknews.com/news/278787476/russian-military-denies-missile-attack-on-kharkov","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/7838f80/c23e06c3-fd96-4170-b031-484335ac2fff/0/ZTYzYjc1ODctMDA-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-03 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":390836872,"title":"'Mullahs Must Leave': Iran BOILS As Protests Seek Khamenei's Ouster, Trump Warns Supreme Leader","text":"1 views | Jan 03, 2026, 12:09:02 AM | TOI.in\n\nIran has been rocked by fresh protests driven by soaring prices, economic stagnation and a collapsing currency, with at least seven people reportedly killed in clashes with security forces.

A panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided 2-1 with a gun owner in ruling that the state’s prohibition against open carry in counties with more than 200,000 people violated U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. About 95% of the population in California, which has had some of the nation’s strictest gun-control laws, live in counties of that size. U.S. Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, who was appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, said the Democratic-led state’s law could not stand under the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 landmark gun rights ruling. That decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, was issued by the court’s 6-3 conservative super-majority and established a new legal test for firearms restrictions. The test said they must be “consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” VanDyke, whose opinion on Friday was joined by another Trump appointee, said the latest case “unquestionably involves a historical practice — open carry — that predates ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791.” He noted that more than 30 states generally allow open carry. California itself allowed citizens to carry handguns openly and holstered for self-defense without penalty until 2012, he said. “The historical record makes unmistakably plain that open carry is part of this Nation’s history and tradition,” VanDyke said. The ruling partially reversed a 2023 decision by a lower-court judge who had rejected a 2019 challenge to the law by gun owner Mark Baird. While the appeals court largely sided with Baird, it rejected his related challenge to California’s licensing requirements in counties with fewer than 200,000 residents, which may issue open-carry permits. Senior U.S. Circuit Judge N. Randy Smith, who was appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush, dissented, saying his colleagues “got this case half right” as all of California‘s restrictions complied with the Supreme Court’s ruling. Baird’s lawyer had no immediate comment. Spokespeople for California Attorney General Rob Bonta, whose office defended the state’s ban, did not respond to a request for comment. The 2022 Supreme Court ruling has prompted court cases nationwide challenging modern firearm restrictions, including in California. A 9th Circuit panel in September 2024 upheld a California law that prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying firearms at several categories of “sensitive places” like bars, parks, zoos, stadiums and museums.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/california-open-carry-ban-unconstitutional-appeals-court-rules-rcna252007","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/250102-open-carry-aa-640-182ab3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:44:27","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":390850894,"title":"Is Trump taking too much aspirin? Here's what experts say","text":"President Donald Trump said he takes a higher dose of daily aspirin than his doctors recommend and he has been doing so for 25 years.\n\nThe comments came in a wide-ranging interview with The Wall Street Journal published Thursday.\n\n\"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart,\" Trump, 79, told The Journal. \"I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?\"\n\nThe president takes 325 milligrams of daily aspirin — one \"adult\" over-the-counter pill. That is four times higher than the recommended 81 milligram low-dose aspirin used for cardiovascular disease prevention.\n\nWhat do doctors and researchers say?\n\nSince 2022, the nation's leading panel of experts in disease prevention, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, has recommended anyone over 60 not start taking a daily dose of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease, if they don't already have an underlying problem. The group said it's reasonable to stop preventive aspirin in people already taking it around age 75 years.\n\nHere's more of what you need to know about aspirin and cardiac health.\n\nWhat is aspirin, and what is it used for?\n\nAspirin — part of the same family of drugs as ibuprofen and naproxen — at low doses reduces the production of a molecule that helps blood clots form.\n\nThe over-the-counter drug is commonly used to relieve headaches and pain in adults. It's also used as a prophylactic medication — as in Trump's case — in about one in seven older Americans.\n\nThe ideal dose\n\nExperts recommend that these patients take 81 milligrams of aspirin every day to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. (The dose used to be described as a \"baby aspirin,\" but aspirin is no longer recommended for regular use in children.) The low dose is often prescribed — rather than Trump's 325 milligram dose — because there's no benefit to taking a higher dose, according to a large study published in 2021.\n\n\"There's some evidence that if you've already tolerated the higher dose of 325 milligrams, there's probably very little additional risk to taking that over the 81 milligram dose,\" says Dr. Eleanor Levin, a preventive cardiologist at Stanford Medicine. \"The higher dose is unnecessary, though.\"\n\nSome patients should take low-dose aspirin for their entire life — regardless of their age. These include adults who have undergone heart bypass surgery to reroute blood around a clogged heart artery and those who have had a heart attack, among others. Levin also recommends that certain patients with asymptomatic coronary disease — buildup or narrowing of the heart's arteries — take the drug regardless of age.\n\nTrump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency in July, and a memo released by the White House in December noted his cardiovascular system is in \"excellent health.\"\n\nCommon side effects of aspirin\n\nThough safer than other blood thinners, patients taking the drug — even at low doses — are at an increased risk of bleeding in the stomach and brain. But these adverse events are unlikely to cause death.\n\nBleeding risk rises with age, and Levin says alcohol use can increase that risk further. Aspirin can also cause less severe bleeding, such as bruising and small cuts. Trump has experienced both and his doctor attributed the symptoms to his use of aspirin, according to a White House memo from July. Levin says these side effects are common and not alarming.\n\n\"This shows it's working,\" Levin says. \"As you get in your late 70s and 80s, you get a lot of thinning of the skin, so it's more delicate. You'll have patients come in, and they don't remember bumping against a table or a chair, and they have bruises all over their arms.\"\n\nDuring The Journal interview, Trump also addressed concerns about his hearing and sleep, which he largely dismissed. While age-related hearing loss is more common, aspirin can also cause hearing difficulties known as tinnitus. Its effect on sleep is not widely understood.\n\nIs more aspirin better — or dangerous?\n\nLevin says Trump's unconventional use of aspirin is likely not life-threatening, though she says she doesn't recommend her patients take higher doses of aspirin if not warranted.\n\nShe added that anything above 2,400 milligrams — a dose historically used to treat arthritis — should be considered high-dose aspirin, and even higher amounts come with serious safety risks.\n\n\"I'm sure his doctors told him the same thing,\" Levin says. \"We don't have to raise alarm bells.\"\n\nBut she gives her patients different directions: \"We have a discussion of the risks versus benefits and an informed discussion. We go by the literature and the studies, and they follow my advice.\"\n\nMichal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow","summary":"Trump takes four times the recommended dose of aspirin for cardiac prevention.

The funding pause was a response to conservative influencer Nick Shirley’s viral video on purportedly fraudulent day care centers in the Twin Cities raised concerns — and disbelief — online. \n\nEven though Shirley’s video claimed fraud only in Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Administration for Children and Families will withhold funding to all 50 states that is used to help families offset the cost of care, HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill announced on X. Freezes could be lifted if states provide “justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before funds are redistributed. \n\nO’Neill also said the department has launched a hotline to field reports of fraud. Vice President JD Vance applauded the move on X, saying: “Many more to come.”\n\n“Turning off payments and forcing verification before taxpayer money flows out the door is one of the most important steps we can take to end the fraud in Minnesota,” Vance wrote.\n\nThe funding freeze follows President Donald Trump’s attacks on Somali Americans living in Minnesota, particularly Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia. Trump has amplified claims of widespread fraud by Somali Americans who operate day care centers and other safety net programs.\n\nBut problems in those programs have been public knowledge for more than a decade and have been the subject of extensive local and national news coverage.\n\nState officials have tried to rein in fraud and abuse, and since 2021, a federal investigation has resulted in charges against at least 92 people. About 60 have been convicted or have pleaded guilty, while most of the rest are awaiting trial. Many of the defendants are Somali Americans.\n\n“This isn’t fraud prevention,” wrote St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, “it’s retaliatory disruption for over 12,000 Minnesota families who rely on these payments, many of whom live far below the state median income. Child care is a lifeline. It is not a bargaining chip.”\n\nFunding delays could have widespread effects\n\nThe nationwide funding pause could raise costs for families as the federal program provides funding to states and territories for low-income families, according to ChildCare.gov. According to HHS, families spend anywhere between $100 and $500 a week for full-time care for an infant in a center for subsidized care. \n\nThe freeze also threatens the viability of many day care centers, Cindy Lehnhoff, director of the National Child Care Association, an industry group, told NPR.\n\n“Providers are extremely concerned, as they should be, that they are not going to be able to remain open if there are any delays in receiving their subsidized payments for the children they care for,” Lehnhoff said.\n\n“And this will not just affect the 1.4 million children that are on subsidized care,” she added, “but it’s very common for centers to serve subsidized care and working parents that are paying for care. So if these centers are closed, you’re going to affect millions of children and families that rely on this essential service to work.”\n\nFreeze initially targeted Minnesota\n\nTrump administration officials reacted quickly to Shirley’s Christmas Eve video, even as news organizations raised questions about its veracity. Officials used the allegations from the video to criticize Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who was his party’s vice presidential nominee in 2024.\n\n“We believe the state of Minnesota has allowed scammers and fake day care to siphon millions of taxpayer dollars over the past decade,” O’Neill said in a video he posted on X. He also requested Walz to furnish attendance records, licenses, complaints, investigations and inspections of all centers operating in Minnesota. \n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison threatened legal action against the Trump administration, saying the action was prompted by a single social media video and was a “scorched earth-attack.” He added that his office has prosecuted more than 300 Medicaid fraud cases and won more than $80 million in judgments and restitution. \n\n“What I will not do, if it is at all within my power, is let the Trump administration devastate funding for services that Minnesota families depend on to afford their lives,” Ellison said in a statement.\n\nPayments help families afford care\n\nThe federal subsidies are a form of assistance offered to eligible families so their children can receive care in preschool, day care or other child care facilities. \n\nAccording to the Administration for Children and Families, states are limited from setting copayments of about 7% of a family’s income, regardless of how many children get care. Twenty-nine states waive copayments for families at or below 100% of the federal poverty level for a family of their size. For instance, if a family of four has a combined annual income of $24,112.50, and they seek assistance in Kansas, the state would waive their costs. \n\nBut copayments are much higher in some states. In Vermont, for instance, the cost to families can run as high as $1,075 a month.\n\nChild care burdensome for some families\n\nChild Care Aware of America said in its annual report for 2024 that there were 84,592 licensed centers across the nation, an increase of 1.5% from 2023. The nonprofit counted 99,958 licensed family child care homes, an increase of 4.3%. \n\nOn average, families paid $13,128 for the year. The nonprofit calculated that in some states, paying for child care could take up as much as 62.2% of the median income for a single-parent family and 17.9% for a married-couple family.\n\n“Child care prices remain high for families,” the organization said. “According to CCAoA’s analysis, the price of child care continued to rise in 2024. The five-year increase in child care prices from 2020 to 2024 is 29%. Over the same five-year period, overall prices rose by 22%, meaning child care prices grew by 7% more.”\n\nChildCare.gov acknowledged that for some families, the cost could be the biggest part of a family’s budget and can often exceed housing, food or a college tuition expenses.\n\nThe post Federal assistance for child care is frozen after influencer’s viral video alleges fraud in Minnesota appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2026/01/02/federal-assistance-for-child-care-is-frozen-after-influencers-viral-video-alleges-fraud-in-minnesota/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251397595_Michael_M_Santiago_Getty_Images_clean-VmLLdl.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:33:08","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.631},{"id":390854870,"title":"Iran opens fire on protesters despite Trump threat","text":"WorldMiddle EastProtests\n\nIranian security forces opened fire on protesters on Friday night despite Donald Trump’s threat to intervene in the rapidly spreading unrest.Demonstrators came under fire in Tehran, while there were claims at least one person had been killed in the city of Qom.Loading...The Telegraph London or Subscribe to save articleEmailLinkedInTwitterFacebookSubscribe to gift this articleGift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.Subscribe nowAlready a subscriber?

She is said to have close pastoral connections with roots in Nigeria, a detail that helped explain her emotional investment in the plight of Christians in the country. Yet, strikingly, while Nigerian-American organisations and mainstream Nigerian Christian bodies have been largely muted or fragmented in response to Nigeria’s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) for religious persecution, the loudest and most organised voices have come from largely white—Christian conservatives and church-driven advocacy groups in the United States.\n\nIndeed, much of the pressure for stricter U.S. action against Nigeria has been driven by American Christians deeply alarmed by repeated reports of Islamist violence sweeping across parts of the country. These advocates view the Nigerian situation not through the lens of ethnic competition, banditry, or state fragility, but as a clear-cut religious war against Christianity. Last Thursday, that narrative gained renewed momentum when U.S. Congressman Riley Moore circulated posts allegedly by ISWAP, showing images of a Christian community in Adamawa State engulfed in flames.\n\nThe posts claimed that Christians were issued an ultimatum: convert to Islam or pay the jizyah tax to avoid violence. Moore left little room for nuance in his response. “If there were any remaining doubts that Christians in Nigeria are being targeted for their faith in Jesus Christ, this should end that debate,” he wrote.\n\n“This isn’t about land usage, ‘climate change,’ or any other argument the Left wants to make. This is persecution of our brothers and sisters for their faith in Christ, plain and simple.”\n\nMoore’s intervention typifies a broader movement within American politics where the Christian Right has successfully leveraged moral outrage into concrete policy pressure. Many white American lawmakers and evangelical leaders have marshalled their influence to shape U.S. foreign policy, using Trump as both symbol and instrument. Ironically, this mobilisation occurred despite Trump’s own colourful personal history. What mattered to the movement was not sanctimony, but results.\n\nThrough sustained organisation, messaging discipline and political bargaining, the American church succeeded in pushing back against what it views as a secular leftist ideology that denies God, blurs the identity of men and women, and elevates sexual politics above faith. Within a year, policies associated with President Joe Biden—particularly those advancing LGBTQ+ rights, transgender participation in women’s sports and broader gender redefinitions—were either reversed or aggressively challenged under conservative pressure.\n\nThe Christian Right has since extended its reach beyond domestic culture wars. No longer content with a traditional fixation on Israel alone, it has broadened its foreign-policy agenda to include the protection of persecuted Christians worldwide. It is therefore unsurprising that whenever Trump references Nigeria—sometimes even controversially—he frames his actions as protective of Christians.\n\nThe military strike against Islamists embedded in Sokoto was rhetorically justified as part of a global defence of Christian lives.\n\nIronically, such framing has found cautious acceptance among both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria, largely because Islamist violence has not spared Muslim communities either. This shared suffering has diluted what could otherwise have escalated into a full-blown religious war, underscoring the complexity of Nigeria’s crisis—one that defies simplistic dichotomies.\n\nWhat remains startling, however, is the contrast between the organisational muscle of the American church and the lethargy of its Nigerian counterpart. At a moment when global attention was being drawn to Nigeria’s religious crisis, the country’s media space was saturated with salacious reports about the sexcapades of a flamboyant cleric, Pastor Chris Okafor, following his much-publicised latest wedding to a new wife. Even more troubling was the presence of respected church leaders, including international evangelist Matthew Ashimolowo, at the ceremony.\n\nWhile the jury remains out on why prominent pastors would celebrate a figure mired in allegations of moral excess, the episode raises a deeper question: what moral authority do such leaders retain to confront the Nigerian state on allegations of Christian persecution?\n\nOne can easily imagine the awkwardness of figures like Ashimolowo or Okafor seeking an audience with President Tinubu to demand action on Christian killings, only for the conversation to be hijacked by unresolved scandals involving estranged spouses and public accusations.\n\nMore disturbing is the persistence of a culture in which these figures are exalted as “Papa” by devoted congregations, despite biblical injunctions to the contrary. When Christ explicitly warned, “Call no man father,” he could scarcely have imagined the theatrical deviation that now passes for spiritual leadership in parts of Nigeria. Titles are brandished, reverence demanded, yet moral credibility steadily erodes.\n\nThis inglorious motif—where celebrity replaces Christian character and spectacle supplants substance—has rendered the organised church largely ineffective in influencing governance, policy advocacy and national moral leadership. Many Nigerians, particularly older generations, recall with nostalgia the era of Benson Idahosa, a cleric who spoke truth to power without scandal, without theatrics, and without compromise.\n\nUntil the Nigerian church regains that moral spine, it will remain a spectator while others—foreign churches, foreign lawmakers, and foreign celebrities—define its narrative on the global stage.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2026/01/chris-okafor-and-the-untold-story-of-american-bombs-over-sokoto-by-emmanuel-aziken/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aziken-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:16:57","author":"Emmanuel Okogba","authors":["Emmanuel Okogba"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.283},{"id":390854654,"title":"Tesla loses place as world’s top electric vehicle seller to China’s BYD","text":"Tesla has lost its place as the top global seller of electric vehicles to Chinese company BYD, capping a year defined by outrage over CEO Elon Musk’s political manoeuvring and the end of United States tax breaks for customers.\n\nThe company revealed on Friday that it had sold 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, compared with BYD’s 2.26 million vehicles. The sales represented a 9 percent decline for Tesla from a year earlier.\n\nTesla, founded in 2003, had for years far outpaced traditional automakers in its development and sale of electric vehicles. However, the market has become increasingly crowded with competitors, with China’s electric vehicle market bounding ahead.\n\nMusk’s embrace of US President Donald Trump in 2024 and subsequent spearheading of a controversial “government efficiency” panel (DOGE) behind widespread layoffs of federal workers has also proved polarising. The political foray prompted protests at Tesla facilities and slumps in sales.\n\nThe company’s fourth quarter sales totaled 418,227, falling short of the much-reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet, an investment research firm, had expected.\n\nMusk left DOGE in May, in what was largely viewed as an effort to reassure investors.\n\nTesla was also hard hit by the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September. Trump’s opposition to electric vehicles has contributed to a strained relationship with Musk.\n\nDespite the downward trends in sales, investors have generally remained optimistic about Tesla and Musk’s ambitious plans to make the company a leader in driverless robotaxi services and humanoid robots for homes.\n\nReflecting that optimism, Tesla stock finished 2025 up about 11 percent.\n\nTesla has also recently introduced two less expensive electric vehicle models, the Model Y and Model 3, meant to compete with cheaper Chinese models for sale in Europe and Asia.\n\nMusk entered 2026 as the wealthiest person in the world.\n\nIt is widely believed that the public offering of his rocket company, SpaceX, set for later this year, could make the 54-year-old the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nIn November, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially historic pay package of nearly $1 trillion if ambitious performance targets were met.\n\nMusk scored another huge win in December,when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a lower court’s ruling, awarding him a $55bn pay package that had been paused since 2018.\n\nConversely, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its licence to sell cars in California after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about the safety of its driverless taxis.","summary":"Decline in sales comes amid outrage of Elon Musk&#039;s political forays, end in US electric vehicle tax breaks.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/2/chktesla-loses-place-as-worlds-top-electric-vehicle-seller-to-chinas-byd?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/afp_6958473c74f8-1767393084.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:16:49","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":390849576,"title":"Australian prime beef producers brace for fresh China tariff pain","text":"Australian cattle farmers producing wagyu and Angus beef are likely to be among the hardest hit by China's 55 per cent tariff on beef exceeding the 205,000-tonne quota.\n\nChina's global trade restrictions came into effect on January 1 after claims by farmers in that country that beef imports were hurting their profitability.\n\nNSW Hunter Valley Angus producer Robert Mackenzie said the 55 per cent tariff would have a detrimental affect on his industry.\n\n\"There would be no way that you'd be selling any product into China once that tariff comes into play, so it'll be a little bit of a mess,\" he said.\n\nMr Mackenzie's company, Macka's Australian Black Angus Beef, exports 26 tonnes of produce to China a month.\n\n\"I'm worried that a lot of the big processors will flood the market into China with trims, offal and bones, which will go towards making up that 205,000 metric tonnes,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australia's high-end products only made up 20 per cent of that annual quota.\n\n\"That could be chilled beef, Angus, wagyu products, and that's going to leave a big hole in the Chinese market for people looking for that higher-end product,\" he said. \n\nHe said once the quota was filled by June or July and his Chinese customers were unable to absorb the tariff, producers would need to reallocate their products to other markets.\n\n\"Naturally, when we reach out to those other potential customers, they'll straight away know that the tariff has taken effect on Australian produce and they'll play a little bit of hardball.\" \n\nMr Mackenzie said the federal government should work with the sector's peak bodies to implement a system to ensure fair access to the 205,000-tonne quota. \n\n\"So if you're selling product into China in 2024 and it was \"x\" amount of kilos or tonnages you might be allowed to have that quota for 2026, and then it won't be such a rush to the door,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just going to be a rush for people to pump that product into China. It'll just go into cold stores, be frozen and they'll just use it throughout the year.\"\n\nProfessor Ben Lyons, from the University of Southern Queensland's Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, said the Chinese beef industry was difficult to understand, but it had been declining as rural workers continued to drift to cities where wages were higher. \n\n\"A lot of Chinese peasantry have left the beef industry in China [and] we see a lot of aggregation, or larger herd sizes, to signify that,\" he said.\n\n\"It's another chapter in a long saga of dealing with China as an export country and a regime that looks to control its agrifood and geopolitical aspirations.\"\n\nTrump tariffs partly to blame\n\nGarry Edwards said China was dealing with an oversupply of beef because South American exporters were locked out of the US market after US President Donald Trump imposed his own tariffs.\n\n\"They've diverted massive volumes of beef and put it into China at very moderate pricing, which has obviously had an impact on that market,\" he said.\n\nHe thinks Australia should not have been caught up in this tariff.\n\n\"That's certainly not what Australia has done,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia has continued to supply high-quality Australian beef at pricing that's consistent with the rest of our global contemporaries and it really sought to continue to meet the demand of Chinese consumers.\"\n\nImpact in Australia\n\nAustralian businesses, like Razorback Ranch in NSW, have been sending full-blood wagyu heifers to China as live exports. \n\nIt was a lucrative trade but owner Nick Togias said it had slowed in the past two years. \n\n\"At this stage, the direct impact of the Chinese tariffs is unclear,\" he said. \n\n\"However, global demand for Australian wagyu remains exceptionally strong across multiple regions,\" he said. \n\nHe also thinks the price of premium beef in Australia will remain high. \n\nCasino Food Company CEO Simon Stahl said his company would be significantly affected by the tariffs. \n\n\"It's about a quarter of our business, 20 to 25 per cent, so about a gross value of $100m is the business to China,\" he said.\n\nHe said supply could be diverted to and increased in other export markets but that would cost Australia.\n\n\"It would be at a lower price and that's not going to be good for anyone, for processors and the farmers in this country,\" he said.\n\nPrice cut coming \n\nMeat analyst Simon Quilty, from Global AgriTrends, said Australian prices could drop in the last half of this year as other major beef exporters look for new markets. \n\n\"That's 600,000 tonnes globally that needs to find a new home, so you are now competing with more beef because others are impacted in the same way,\" he said.\n\nGarry Edwards, chair of Cattle Australia, said that, while lower-cost products could find a home in other markets in the US or South East Asia, the more expensive cuts would be harder to shift. \n\nAnd he said Chinese consumers would suffer as well.\n\n\"They're really doing themselves a disservice because if they don't get it from us, they're not going to get it from any other country around the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, what they're going to do is push the price up domestically in their country for the high-quality marble beef that they buy from Australia.\"","summary":"Australian cattle farmers producing wagyu and Angus beef are likely to be among the hardest hit by China's 55 per cent tariff on exports exceeding a 205,000-tonne quota.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2026-01-03/wagyu-angus-casualty-of-china-tariffs-on-australian-beef/106194112","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d3d91c562f859f8a76f8396729953832?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=676&cropW=1200&xPos=0&yPos=85&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:12:51","author":"Annie Brown","authors":["Annie Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":390854948,"title":"Cash still king: Poll shows strong support for forcing businesses to accept cash","text":"New polling shows a large majority of Americans would support legislation that would force businesses to accept cash as a form of payment. Data, however, shows that more businesses are taking only credit or debit cards or digital payment forms at the point of sale.\n\nThe poll was conducted by the Siena Research Institute at Siena University in New York on behalf of the Payment Choice Coalition, a group that includes companies that operate automated teller machines (ATM) and provide secure cash logistics and similar services. It showed overwhelming support for a cash option.\n\nDesire for cash payments\n\nAmong the more than 5,500 people surveyed over several months, 84% opposed the U.S. becoming a fully cashless society.\n\nAnd even among those who said they don’t use cash themselves, 87% said they believe cash should remain a payment option.\n\n“For several reasons, people want to have the option to use cash, and the Siena survey shows overwhelming support for requiring businesses to accept it as a valid payment,” Jeff Thinnes, a Payment Choice Coalition representative, said in a statement.\n\nDespite more businesses going cashless, currency remains the most-used payment method. The poll found 85% of respondents had paid for something in cash in the last 30 days. That’s compared to 75% who used credit cards and 74% who used debit cards.\n\nMobile banking, digital apps and checks rounded out the top six payment methods.\n\nThe poll also found people see cash as an easier way to pay; 76% said businesses that do not accept cash make it too difficult for some people to buy what they want. Another 70% also found using cash makes it easier to stay within a budget.\n\n“Seeing ‘no cash accepted’ signs when people walk into retail establishments is both an affront to peoples’ right to choose how to pay or who want control over their personal data,” Thinnes said. “It’s also discriminatory against those who fully depend on cash.”\n\nThe survey also found Americans view cash as a significant security benefit. Of those surveyed, 94% said it’s important for the U.S. to keep cash available in case of national security threats, especially threats that could disrupt electronic payment forms.\n\nAnother 86% of respondents said digital payments increase the risk of identity theft.\n\nProposed legislation\n\nEighty-five percent of those surveyed said they supported the Payment Choice Act, which would require retail businesses to accept cash for any purchases of $500 or less and would ban businesses from charging more for paying in cash.\n\nThe Senate version of the bipartisan bill, introduced by Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., and Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., has been awaiting a committee vote since July. A House version, sponsored by Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn., has been stalled in committee since last February.\n\n“Forcing the use of credit and debit cards or imposing premium prices on goods and services paid for with cash limits consumer choice,” Cramer said. “Americans should have the option of using cards or cash, but they should be the ones who make that choice.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether either bill has enough support to pass and whether President Donald Trump backs the proposal.\n\nSupporters say the legislation would especially help the 4% of households, or 5.6 million people, who do not have a checking or savings account.\n\nBusinesses going cashless\n\nThe payment processing company Clearly Payments says 40% of U.S. businesses no longer take cash as a form of payment.\n\nThat number grew rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the number of cashless businesses rose from 8% to 31%.\n\nThere are several reasons why businesses move away from cash other than reducing the spread of the coronavirus during the pandemic.\n\nGoing cash-free diminishes the risk of theft, either by robbers or employees. It also reduces the risk of human error in calculations as well as of banking issues. Cash requires business owners to make physical deposits, while bank transactions are more streamlined with cashless systems.\n\nDespite the ongoing trend of going cashless, 57% of businesses recently polled said they never expect to go fully cashless.\n\nThe post Cash still king: Poll shows strong support for forcing businesses to accept cash appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2026/01/02/cash-still-king-poll-shows-strong-support-for-forcing-businesses-to-accept-cash/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1207431130_Creative_Touch_Imaging_LtdNurPhoto_via_Getty_Images_clean-VNs0cJ.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 23:08:04","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":390841528,"title":"Iran's New Year's Resolution: Threaten U.S. Military, Hope for the Best","text":"There's an old saying about someone's \"mouth writing checks his butt can't cash.\" It's usually taken to mean someone is making threats they can't back up.\n\nIt's a warning that Iran's current leadership should take to heart; instead, following President Trump's warning that the United States is concerned about theocracy cracking down on the ongoing protests, the leaders of Iran's armed forces are... threatening the United States.\n\nYeah, Iran, let us know how that works out for you.\n\nAs nationwide protests continued to spread across Iran on Friday, the regime’s hardline Parliament speaker warned the U.S. that American forces and bases in the region would be considered \"legitimate targets\" if Washington intervenes in the country’s ongoing political unrest.Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf made the comments after President Donald Trump said earlier Friday that the U.S. would take action if Iran uses force against demonstrators. It comes as protests entered a sixth day and appear to be spreading, with Iranian opposition groups claiming at least eight deaths.\"The disrespectful President of America should also know that with this official admission, all American centers and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets for us in response to any potential adventurism,\" Qalibaf wrote in Persian on X.\n\nOK, I have a question for the Iranian Parliament Speaker: You're going to target American forces and installations with, what, exactly? Iran has, at last known count, had 65 F-4 Phantoms, 40 F-14 Tomcats, 35 F-5 Tigersharks, 20-some MiG-29s, 20 Su-24 Fencers, and a few other old, Cold-War era fighters; it's not clear how many of them are even operational. Any dust-up between the United States and Iran would be an air war; there's just no portion in us getting involved in boots on the ground in Iran, which would be a slog of WW2 proportions. And even with our admittedly low numbers of F-22 and F-35 fighters, backed up by the new F-15 EX air-superiority fighters, we could wipe away Iran's air defense capability like brushing dust off a windshield. \n\nIran does have a significant counter-air capability in missiles and even guns, but those would only be a problem for us hitting targets in Iran; and the recent Operation Midnight Hammer, in which the United States Air Force reduced Iran's nuclear program to glowing, radioactive rubble, demonstrated very clearly that we can hit targets in Iran without the Iranians even knowing our aircraft were around until things started exploding.\n\nWhatever else happens, Iran doesn't want to take on the USA. Not directly. Their Hamas/Hezbollah/ISIS proxies, though? That's a different story.\n\nRoughly 40,000 active-duty U.S. troops and War Department civilians are deployed across the Middle East, according to Military Times, citing Pentagon officials. Forces are stationed in countries including Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq and Syria, according to Reuters.Trump said earlier Friday that the United States is \"locked and loaded and ready to go\" if Iranian authorities violently suppress demonstrators.\"If Iran shoots and ‘violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,’\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nIt's not entirely clear what the Trump administration and the War Department could do to affect events in Tehran, but we certainly could establish air superiority in the region in a few days, at most. That would give American forces some interesting options with drones and precision munitions. Personally, I'd rather not see the United States get militarily involved; better to let the Iranian people overthrow the mullahs themselves than to see any possible new government (cross your fingers) tainted by accusations of American interference, because that's the first line any opposition to such a new government would trot out.\n\nAnd, yeah, it sure looks like something is cooking.\n\nRead More: Watch: Protests in Iran Are Spreading, As More Bravely Stand Up to the Regime\n\nThat doesn't mean the United States can't help the uprising by providing financial and logistical support, along with promising to remove sanctions when a new government is seated. We've already seen President Trump do this in Syria, whose government is still shaky and questionable - but it's better than the old one. Iran is likely to end up just like that; not great, but better. And that's OK; better is, well, better.\n\nWe might note that the 2009 Green Revolution may well have overturned the mullahs then, 16 years ago, if then-President Obama had tossed them some support. Instead, he gave the Green Revolution the cold shoulder, so here we are, today, with the Iranian people taking another shot at it. They've certainly suffered long enough.\n\nAs for Iran's threats over American interference, yeah. Let them try it.\n\nEditor's Note: Thanks to President Trump and War Secretary Pete Hegseth's leadership, the warrior ethos is coming back to America's military.\n\nHelp us report on Trump and Hegseth's successes as they make our military great again.

However, their relationship changed after the latter became president of the United States. Now, the two high-profile individuals are involved in a so-called 'word wars,' where Clooney and Trump have been publicly criticising each other.\n\nLast week, Trump called Clooney and his entire family's naturalisation as French citizens 'good news' in a sarcastic post on Truth Social, before calling the actor's movies 'mediocre'. Clooney has since fired back, saying he's looking forward to making America great again, but he'll start in November, a clear reference to the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nGeorge Clooney's Sarcastic Response to Donald Trump\n\nThe President accompanied his post on Truth Social with other statements that also dragged former President Joe Biden into the feud.\n\n'[They] officially become citizens of France. Which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,' Trump wrote.\n\nTrump went on to claim that Clooney previously dumped Biden during a fundraiser. He also criticised the actor's works by calling his movies mediocre.\n\nThe President's online tirade continued with Trump accusing Clooney of constantly complaining about politics. 'He wasn't a movie star at all. He was just an average guy who complained constantly about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Trump posted.\n\nClooney fired back at Trump by saying he's looking forward to making America great again, but he'll start in November, which happens to coincide with the midterm elections.\n\nAmal Clooney Once Criticized the POTUS\n\nThis isn't the first time that Clooney and Trump criticised each other. In 2021, the Ticket to Paradise actor said that Trump's name will forever be associated with the January 6 riots at the US Capitol. Two years earlier, Amal Clooney, Clooney's wife, had slammed Trump for putting journalists at risk due to his rhetoric.\n\n'Today, the country of James Madison has a leader who vilifies the media, making honest journalists all over the world more vulnerable to abuse. With authoritarianism, isolationism, and nationalism gaining ground, the relevance of international institutions and respect for intentional norms are seriously in question,' Amal said.\n\nGeorge Clooney Won't Back Down\n\nDuring his conversation with Anderson Cooper last year, Clooney acknowledged that a lot of people are scared of being targeted by the Trump administration. However, the actor stressed that he is not one to back down.\n\n'Sure, everybody worries about it. But you know, if you spend your life worrying about things, then you won't do things. I want to be able to look at my kids in the eye and say where we stood and what we did at certain times in history, and I have no problem with that,' he said (via The Independent).\n\nGeorge Clooney and Donald Trump's Friendship\n\nDespite everything that has been happening right now, Clooney has never denied the fact that he was once friends with Trump.\n\nWhile speaking with Variety, the actor revealed that Trump used to phone him often. There was also a time when Trump offered to help him get into a hospital to see a back surgeon.\n\n'I'd see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He's a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed,' he said.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/george-clooney-donald-trump-feud-amals-husband-fires-back-following-potuss-sarcastic-remarks-3794236","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4634459/george-clooney.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:56:20","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":390845288,"title":"Maduro Says Trump Is Laying Groundwork for a 'Forever War,' Calls Drug Claims 'As False as Weapons of Mass Destruction'","text":"Venezuela's authoritarian President, Nicolás Maduro, said president Donald Trump is laying the groundwork for a \"forever war\" against the country and accused the United States of fabricating drug-trafficking allegations that he compared to Washington's discredited claims about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\nThe comments were made during a televised interview recorded on New Year's Eve with Spanish journalist Ignacio Ramonet and filmed as Maduro drove through Caracas.\n\n\"Since they cannot accuse me, since they cannot accuse Venezuela of having weapons of mass destruction, since they cannot accuse us of having nuclear missiles, of preparing a nuclear weapon, or of possessing chemical weapons, they have invented an accusation that the United States knows is as false as the accusation about weapons of mass destruction that led them into a forever war,\" Maduro said during one portion of the hour-long interview.\n\nIn another part of the interview, Maduro said Venezuela was prepared to engage in talks with Washington, including on drug trafficking and energy investment. \"If they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we're ready,\" he said. \"If they want oil, Venezuela is ready for U.S. investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it.\"\n\nThe interview comes amid reports that the U.S. had carried out a pre-Christmas strike on a docking facility on Venezuela's coast allegedly used by drug traffickers. Maduro, however, declined to confirm or deny the attack saying that \"perhaps we'll discuss it in a few days\" and defending Venezuela's defense systems:\"our people are safe and at peace.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged last week that the U.S. had struck a coastal facility in Venezuela but declined to say whether the operation was carried out by the military or the CIA. U.S. media reports have cited intelligence involvement, while other accounts said the site was unoccupied and no casualties were reported.\n\nIf confirmed, the strike would mark the first attack on Venezuelan territory since the Trump administration escalated military pressure in August.\n\nMaduro said he last spoke with Trump in a brief, \"cordial\" phone call on Nov. 21, but described subsequent developments as deteriorating. He again called for \"dialogue and diplomacy,\" warning that the current course risked drawing the United States into another prolonged conflict in the region.\n\nOriginally published on Latin Times","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/maduro-says-trump-laying-groundwork-forever-war-calls-drug-claims-false-weapons-mass-3794235","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4639197/venezuelas-president-nicolas-maduro-addresses-media-caracas.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:56:16","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":390857564,"title":"Trump on Track to Beat Obama's Eight-Year Golf Record After 88 Trips in 2025","text":"Donald Trump is on pace to surpass Barack Obama's eight-year presidential golf record in just four years after visiting his golf clubs 88 times throughout 2025, according to tracking data. The frequent trips stand in stark contrast to his campaign rhetoric, when he repeatedly criticised Obama for playing too much golf and promised supporters he would be 'working for you' and wouldn't have 'time to go play golf'.The 79-year-old president wasted no time returning to the links in 2026, appearing to spend New Year's Day at Trump International Golf Club Palm Beach in Florida. The 88 visits in 2025 account for just over 25 per cent of the days in his second term so far and are estimated to have cost US taxpayers upwards of £87 million ($110.6 million).Exceeding First Term Golf FrequencyThe tally of 88 visits represents one more day than Trump spent playing golf in 2017, the first year of his first term. It marks the most golf outings in any single year Trump has spent in the Oval Office.According to the Trump Golf Tracker, a website that monitors the president's golf-related activities, Trump's trips to the green in 2025 are estimated to have cost everyday Americans upward of£87 million ($110.6 million). That figure, based on a 2019 Government Accountability Office report on four golf trips during his first term, does not include costs for December or 1 January.On Track to Double Obama's RatePresident Barack Obama played an estimated 333 rounds of golf over the course of his eight years in office. Obama's golfing averaged about 41 rounds per year, or roughly one round every 8.77 days. With 88 visits to golf clubs in 2025 alone, Trump is on track to exceed Obama's eight-year total in just the four years of his second term.Trump, who owns 18 golf courses in several countries around the world, has made little secret of his affinity for the game over the years. All of his golf trips this year were to his own properties, including Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, Trump National Doral Miami, and Trump National Golf Club Jupiter in Florida, as well as Trump National Golf Clubs in Sterling, Virginia, and Bedminster, New Jersey.White House Defends President's Schedule'President Trump is working 24/7 to Make America Great Again and make the world a safer place', a White House spokesperson previously said. 'Nobody works harder than President Trump who has delivered a record number of historic achievements in only a year', they added.Trump's first trip back to Florida took place at the end of January, just one week into his second term. He headed back to Bedminster for the first visit of his second term in March and to his Virginia club in April. The president spent nine days golfing in both March and November, and visited his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, nine times in December alone.Stark Contrast to Campaign PromisesThe frequent golf outings mark a dramatic reversal from Trump's campaign rhetoric, when he repeatedly criticised Obama for playing too much golf whilst in office. In August 2016, then-candidate Trump told supporters at a rally, 'If I win, I may never see my property—I may never see these places again', adding that he would be 'working for you' and wouldn't have 'time to go play golf'.During the 2016 campaign, Trump also stated at a December 2015 rally: 'I love golf. I think it's one of the greats. But I don't have time... We don't have time for this. We have to work'.By contrast, President Joe Biden was not an avid golfer during his presidency, though he made frequent visits to his homes in Delaware. Some visits were for a single day, whilst others were weekend getaways to both his primary residence and his Rehoboth beach house.Understanding Presidential Travel CostsThe substantial costs associated with presidential golf trips stem primarily from security and transportation expenses. Flying Air Force One costs thousands of pounds per hour, whilst additional expenses include the presidential motorcade, Secret Service protection, and specialised security equipment. Each trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida is estimated to cost approximately £2.7 million ($3.4 million) in taxpayer funds, according to HuffPost analysis.The majority of expenses are attributed to salaries for military and law enforcement personnel. Security for Mar-a-Lago visits presents unique challenges, as the resort's coastal location requires extensive marine patrols and lengthy road closures that disrupt local communities. These factors contribute to the escalating costs associated with presidential visits to Trump-owned properties, raising questions about government transparency and the intersection of public service with private business interests.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-track-beat-obamas-eight-year-golf-record-after-88-trips-2025-1767774","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1779901/trump-golf-scotland.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=56f66789e788dd8275711e3a2e210d8a","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:45:02","author":"Bernadette B.

Fears of World War 3 have surged after a senior Iranian official issued a chilling response to Trump's threat to help protesters flooding Iran’s streets. Protestors are speaking out amid a cost-of-living crisis and soaring inflation. The official warned on Friday (January 2) that the Islamic Republic could retaliate against American bases and troops in the region. The speaker of Iran’s parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): \" The disrespectful President of America should also know that with this official admission, all American centres and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets for us in response to any potential adventurism.” Ghalibaf was reacting to Trump’s warning on Truth Social, the president’s social media platform, where Trump declared that his administration is “locked and loaded and ready to go” to intervene and protect “peaceful protesters” if Iranian authorities open fire and “violently kill” them, according to US political website The Hill. At least seven people have been killed in violence surrounding demonstrations that have taken place for nearly a week, according to the AP. Trump imposed sanctions on Iranian officials in 2019 in response to the regime ’s violence against protesters, part of a “maximum pressure campaign” to squeeze the country’s ability to fund its nuclear programs. Tensions ratcheted up further in June with the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites alongside Israeli strikes on the country. Iran retaliated at the time by launching an attack on Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar , which hosts American troops. No one was injured but the attack caused some damage. President Trump claimed at the time that the US strikes “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear capabilities. However, he claimed on Monday (December 29) that Iran was rebuilding itself. He warned that the US “can’t let them build up because if they build up, there can’t be peace in the Middle East”, according to The Hill. The Hill added a statement on X by Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, accusing Trump and Israel of exploiting the protests to launch new attacks on Iran. He wrote: \"With statements from Israeli officials and [Trump], what was happening behind the scenes has become clear.” “We distinguish between the position of the protesting merchants and the actions of the sabotage elements, and Trump must realise that US intervention in this internal matter will lead to destabilising the entire region and destroying American interests.” For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"Iran has reacted with fury to Trump's warning that the US is 'locked and loaded' to defend 'peaceful protesters', sparking fears that war could break out and trigger global conflict","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/ww3-fears-rise-iran-gives-36489393","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article36489491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Meets-With-Israeli-PM-Netanyahu-At-His-Palm-Beach-Estate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:44:50","author":"Antonio Scancariello,Paul Withers,Piers Evans","authors":["Antonio Scancariello","Paul Withers","Piers Evans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":390846904,"title":"Pastor Gino Jennings Lights The Match — Trump’s Rhetoric, The Epstein Files, And GOP Silence - TDS NEWS","text":"Pastor Gino Jennings did not come to whisper — he came to apply pressure.\n\nIn a fiery moment now circulating online, Jennings goes all the way in, calling out Donald Trump’s rhetoric targeting Somalis, raising questions around the still-murky Epstein files, and dragging the Republican Party for what he describes as a loud, strategic silence. No dog whistles. No dancing around it. Just straight smoke.\n\nReporting on the moment, Emma Ansah doesn’t just amplify the heat — she adds context, balance, and receipts. While acknowledging the emotional weight behind Jennings’ commentary, Emma also zooms out to expose what many critics argue is a glaring hypocrisy within Trump-era politics: the selective outrage.\n\nEmma points out that while immigrants — particularly Black and Muslim communities — are constantly framed as threats, a long and documented list of mass shootings in the United States has been carried out by white men, many of whom “look like” the very people being positioned as protectors of law and order. Yet, according to Emma, that reality rarely sparks the same political fury, policy panic, or media hysteria.\n\nThe contrast is hard to ignore. One group is relentlessly scrutinized. The other? Handled with kid gloves.\n\nThis isn’t about partisan cheerleading — it’s about accountability. Emma makes it clear: if leadership claims to care about safety, justice, and morality, then the outrage can’t be selective.

Kyrylo Budanov, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs to focus on security issues, developing its defense and security forces, and peace talks — areas that are overseen by the office of the president.\n\nZelenskyy had dismissed his previous chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, after anti-corruption officials began investigating alleged graft in the energy sector.\n\nThe president framed Budanov’s appointment as part of a broader effort to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy.\n\n“Kyrylo has specialized experience in these areas and sufficient strength to achieve results,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nBudanov, 39, said on Telegram his new position is “both an honor and a responsibility — at a historic time for Ukraine — to focus on the critically important issues of the state’s strategic security.”\n\nIn his evening address, Zelenskyy announced further changes to his team, saying he had proposed Mykhailo Fedorov, the current minister for digital transformation, as the new minister of defense.\n\nFedorov, 34, is credited with spearheading the introduction of drone technology in Ukraine’s army and introducing several successful e-government platforms in his current role.\n\nHe replaces Denys Shmyhal who took up the post last July in a major government shake-up. Zelenskyy thanked Shmyhal and said he would be taking up another role in government. He also credited the ministry for reaching a target production of more than 1,000 interceptor drones per day in December.\n\nEarlier, Zelenskyy appointed Foreign Intelligence Service head Oleh Ivashchenko to replace Budanov as intelligence chief.\n\n‘Prominent face of Kyiv’s intelligence effort’\n\nBudanov is one of the country’s most recognizable and popular wartime figures. He has led Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, known by its acronym GUR, since 2020.\n\nA career military intelligence officer, he rose through the defense establishment after Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. He also took part in special operations and intelligence missions linked to the fighting with Moscow-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine before the full-scale invasion of February 2022. He reportedly was wounded during one such operation.\n\nSince the full-scale invasion, Budanov has become a prominent face of Kyiv’s intelligence effort, regularly appearing in interviews and briefings that mix strategic signaling with psychological pressure on Moscow. He has frequently warned of Russia’s long-term intentions toward Ukraine and the region, while portraying the war as an existential struggle for the country’s statehood.\n\nUnder Budanov, the GUR expanded its operational footprint, coordinating intelligence, sabotage and special operations aimed at degrading Russian military capabilities far beyond the front lines. Ukrainian officials have credited military intelligence with operations targeting Russian command structures, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure and naval assets, including strikes deep inside Russian territory and occupied areas.\n\nHis appointment to lead the office of the president marks an unusual shift, placing an intelligence chief at the center of Ukraine’s political and diplomatic coordination.\n\nIhor Reiterovych, a Kyiv-based independent political expert, noted that Budanov had participated in the talks with the U.S. and “will fit much more naturally into the overall context” of the negotiations.\n\n“Unlike Yermak, he has both experience in this field and has worked in a relevant position,” Reiterovych said, adding that the GUR also has had certain contacts with Russia on issues such as prisoner exchanges.\n\nRussia reports a higher death toll from a strike\n\nRussian authorities said Friday the death toll from what they called a Ukrainian drone strike on a cafe and hotel in a Russian-occupied village in Ukraine’s Kherson region rose to 28. Kyiv strongly denied attacking civilian targets.\n\nSvetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman of Russia’s main criminal investigation agency, the Investigative Committee, said those killed in the village of Khorly, where at least 100 civilians were celebrating New Year’s Eve, included two minors, while 31 people were hospitalized.\n\nA spokesman for Ukraine’s General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, denied attacking civilians. He told Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and “carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.”\n\nHe noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations.\n\nThe Associated Press could not independently verify claims made about the attack.\n\nWashington praises progress in negotiations\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.”\n\nThe U.S. efforts has faced a new obstacle earlier this week, when Moscow said it would toughen its negotiating stand after what it said was a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia early Monday.\n\nKyiv has denied attacking Putin’s residence, saying the Russian claim was a ruse to derail the negotiations.\n\nIn his New Year’s address, Zelenskyy said a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10% — believed to include key sticking points such as territory — would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.”\n\nOvernight attacks\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russia struck a residential area of Kharkiv with two missiles Friday, Zelenskyy wrote on his Telegram page, adding that Moscow’s forces “continue the killings, despite all the efforts of the world, and above all the United States, in the diplomatic process.”\n\nAt least 19 people in the eastern city were injured, including a 6-month-old, said regional administration head Oleh Syniehubov.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry denied launching any strikes with missiles or other airborne weapons on Kharkiv on Friday and suggested, without offering evidence, that the damage could have been caused by the detonation of ammunition at a weapons depot.\n\nEarlier Friday, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia. At least nine drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure but causing no casualties, according to Ivan Fedorov, head of the regional administration.\n\nOverall, Russia fired 116 long-range drones at Ukraine, according to Ukraine’s air force, with 86 intercepted and 27 striking their targets.\n\nThe Russian ministry said its air defenses intercepted 64 Ukrainian drones overnight in multiple Russian regions.\n\nThe Russian city of Belgorod was hit by a Ukrainian missile, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Two women were hospitalized after the strike, which shattered windows and damaged an unspecified commercial facility and a number of cars in the region that borders Ukraine, he said.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/volodymyr-zelenskyy-appoints-new-chief-of-staff_n_6958455ce4b0edc730d1d658?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/695846382b0000c63d6832c8.jpeg?cache=s6c8Gs7EiD&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:37:24","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.233},{"id":390838072,"title":"Iran warns Trump not to cross ‘red line’ over threats to intervene in protests","text":"Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if its government kills demonstrators, prompting warnings from senior Iranian officials that any American interference would cross a “red line”.\n\nIn a social media post on Friday, Trump said that if Iran were to shoot and kill protesters, the US would “come to their rescue”. He added: “We are locked and loaded, and ready to go”, without explaining what that might mean in practice.\n\nProtests in Iran are in their sixth day, and are the largest since 2022, when the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini triggered demonstrations across the country. The current unrest was triggered by an unprecedented decline in the value of the national currency on Sunday. The Iranian rial dropped to about 1.4m to the US dollar, further harming an already beleaguered economy.\n\nIran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, called Trump’s statement “reckless and dangerous”, and said the country’s military was on standby. He also said the protests had been mostly peaceful, but that attacks on public property would not be tolerated.\n\n“Given President Trump’s deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,” he said.\n\nAt least seven people have been killed, and videos have shown security forces carrying shotguns with the sound of shooting in the background.\n\nIn response to Trump’s threat of intervention, Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that Iran’s national security was a “red line, not material for adventurist tweets”.\n\n“Any intervening hand nearing Iran security on pretexts will be cut off with a regret-inducing response,” Shamkhani said in a post on X.\n\nThe threats come just days after Trump said that the US could strike Iran if it was found to be rebuilding its nuclear programme, further escalating tensions between the two countries.\n\nAnother senior Iranian official, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, accused the US and Israel of having a hand in the demonstrations in Iran, a common refrain by officials in response to protests.\n\n“Trump must realize that US intervention in this domestic matter will lead to destabilisation of the whole region and the destruction of American interests,” Larijani wrote on X. “The American people must know that Trump is the one that started this adventure, and they should pay attention to the safety of their soldiers.”\n\nIran has threatened to target American soldiers stationed in the Middle East in the past, and in June it attacked Al-Udeid airbase in Qatar after the US struck Iranian nuclear enrichment sites.\n\nThe current protests have taken place in Tehran but have also spread to other cities, such as Isfahan in central Iran. Shopkeepers have closed their stores in protest and students have taken over campuses to express their grievances. Though economic conditions are the central grievance, demonstrators have also chanted anti-government slogans and decried what they said was corruption and mismanagement by the government.\n\nProtests continued on Friday, with marches taking place to commemorate the burial of several demonstrators killed. Videos appeared to show mourners stopping security forces from attending the funeral of 21-year-old Amirhessam Khodayari, who was killed on Wednesday in Lorestan province.\n\nKhodayari was originally reported as a member of the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary group, but his father denied the claims on video.\n\nThe Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, initially invited protest leaders for talks, taking a less confrontational approach than authorities did in the 2022 protests, which they violently suppressed. Pezeshkian said that he had instructed the government to listen to the protesters “legitimate demands”.\n\nThe recent deaths of demonstrators, however, could signal that authorities are taking a harder line against protests as they continue.

As they risk their lives to end this regime's 46-year reign of chaos and terror, they send me with a responsibility and a message: to seek the relationship Iran once had with America that brought peace and prosperity to the Middle East.\"President Trump, thank you for your strong leadership and support of my compatriots.

With your leadership of the free world, we can leave a legacy of lasting peace,\" he added.Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that the United States is \"locked and loaded\" to respond if Iranian authorities use violence against peaceful protesters, as demonstrations over worsening economic conditions spread across multiple provinces in Iran.In a Truth Social Post, Trump wrote, \"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"This comes as people in Iran continue to protest against rising prices and economic hardship pouring into the streets across several provinces in Iran, with some protests escalating into fatal confrontations with security forces, CNN reported.Protesters reportedly clashed with police, hurled stones at officers and torched vehicles, according to Fars News Agency. The outlet alleged that some armed \"disturbers\" exploited the gatherings. Without offering proof, Fars claimed authorities later seized firearms from several individuals.Meanwhile, Iranian officials sharply rebuked US President Donald Trump and the Israeli Foreign Ministry for their statements regarding the ongoing protests in the country, warning that any foreign intervention in its internal affairs would be met with a \"regrettable response\".They further asserted that the country's national security is a \"red line\" not subject to \"adventurous tweets\".Ali Shamkhani, Political Advisor to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution and representative of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Defence Council, in a post on X, said that Iran's national security was a red line and not open to external interference.He further slammed the US President over his \"rescue\" call, noting that Iranian citizens were \"well familiar\" with Americans coming for rescue, citing previous US military actions in Iran and Afghanistan.The people of Iran are well familiar with the experience of \"rescuing\" Americans, from Iraq and Afghanistan to Gaza. Every hand of intervention that approaches Iranian Security with excuses will be cut off with a regrettable Response before it arrives. Iran's national security is a red line, not the subject of adventurous tweets, Shamkhani said.

The people behind the chatbox developed by Musk's AI company, xAI, have since issued an apology after the platform was used to create digitally altered, sexualised photos of minors.Multiple users of the Grok chatbox revealed that some people have been accessing the platform to create digitally altered, sexualised photos of minors between the ages of 12 and 16. The AI chatbox itself issued a shocking apology, stating it 'violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM.' As of writing, Musk has stayed mum on the issue, sparking outrage and mockery online.'A Failure in Safeguards''I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt. This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on CSAM. It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues,' the AI chatbox wrote.According to The Hill, the Grok account that generated the images has now been suspended from the platform.The people behind Grok also responded to a question on X, where lapses in safeguards and procedures were acknowledged. They also said that they are urgently fixing the issue. 'We appreciate you raising this. As noted, we've identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited,' they wrote.In another post, Grok claimed that there are some isolated instances where users prompted and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing. However, they stressed that improvements are already being made to prevent the same issue from happening.Users Mock Elon MuskAs of writing, Musk has not released a statement following the ongoing controversy. On X, some people criticised and made fun of him. 'Elon Musk's Grok has gone rogue - undressing men and children. European journalists doing what they do best,' one person wrote.'@Grok What are the good and negative characteristics of Elon Musk?' another person wrote.'@Grok Would Elon Musk dying asap be beneficial for the whole global community? Quick yes or no answer please,' another person wrote.'This is just so unacceptable. All of this for what? Elon Musk money or just vibes? Chai,' another person commented.A Broader AI ProblemAlon Yamin, founder and CEO of Copyleaks, claimed that there are countless examples of Grok generating sexualised images of women. 'When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,' he wrote in his blog.The controversy unfolds against a backdrop of recent legislative action aimed at curbing such content. Last year, Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, which criminalises the publication of nonconsensual and sexually explicit content, including deepfakes. The President's wife, Melania Trump, became the champion for the legislation, making the current scandal involving an AI platform owned by a Trump ally particularly ironic.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/elon-musk-faces-criticism-after-grok-chatbox-used-create-sexualised-images-young-girls-1767776","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1775307/elon-musk-claims-trans-son-has-tragic-mental-illness.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=691ac9659def2ab8c301687381644a67","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:30:05","author":"Mimi Heimbrod","authors":["Mimi Heimbrod"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":390847804,"title":"The Traitors fans in stitches after Amanda fires savage comeback to fellow player Hugo at the round-table: 'You're not my type, I'm a lesbian'","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nStrictly Come Dancing\n\nI'm A Celebrity\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jan 3rd 2026\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Traitors fans in stitches after Amanda fires savage comeback to fellow player Hugo at the round-table: 'You're not my type, I'm a lesbian'\n\n Have YOU got a story?

No one saw that coming.'; \nAnother shared a GIF of Sharon Osbourne laughing, writing: \"I'm a lesbian\" Oh round table you are too good.'; \n'The quote of the series. I'm not a traitor don't suspect me because I'm a lesbian' alongside a rolling on the floor laughing emoji. \nIt comes after Netty become the first faithful to be murdered by the Traitors. \nAs the players sat down for breakfast at the beginning of the episode, they soon discovered that Netty had been chosen by the Traitors to leave Ardross Castle, leaving several players visibly devastated and shocked. \nSpeaking to the camera after her elimination, Netty said: 'I'm so gutted. I think I would have been a really good Faithful. Maybe I've been too good a faithful, too loud, and now my time is done.' \nShe added: 'It has been awesome, so good luck Faithful.' \nFollowing her dramatic exit, fans of the hit show flocked to X, formerly Twitter, to share their bewilderment at the Traitors' decision to target Netty first. \n\nAppearing baffled by the speculation, Amanda told one player: 'It's lovely that you think you know, that we're together, or whatever, but we're not - I'm a lesbian' \n\nTurning to Amanda, Hugo jokingly asked: 'So I'm not your type?'\n\nSmirking, Amanda delivered a savage reply: 'No, you're not my sort', leaving the fellow players and viewers at home in stitches\n\nFollowing Amanda's comeback, viewers flocked to X, formerly Twitter, to share their amusement\nOne fan wrote: 'I'm shocked the Traitors killed Netty. She was a huge target with her bond with Ross & that would've been a great distraction at a roundtable.'; \n'Netty gone? That's an absolutely wild choice.' \n'Wow, I'm surprised they got rid of Netty. I would've kept her in because the traitors could've used all the suspicion over her and Ross's relationship to get them banished at the round table. I think Maz should've gone.' \nIt comes as The Traitors fans are certain two of the contestants are a secret couple - after spotting two 'really obvious' clues in the previous episode.\nHosted once again by Claudia Winkleman, the hit BBC show returned to screens last night for its fourth series.\nViewers have already learned about some pre-existing relationships among the cast - and think they've sussed out one more. \nNamely, suggesting that contestants Ross, 37 and Ellie, 33 are secretly in a romantic relationship with each other.\nThe pair, both of whom are from London, were seen chatting on the train to the castle.\n\nIt comes after Netty become the first faithful to be murdered by the Traitors \n\nAs the players sat down for breakfast at the beginning of the episode, they soon discovered that Netty had been chosen by the Traitors to leave Ardross Castle\n\nSpeaking to the camera after her elimination, Netty said: 'I'm so gutted. I think I would have been a really good Faithful. Maybe I've been too good a Faithful, too loud, and now my time is done'\nEagle-eyed fans thought they saw hints of the pair seeming too familiar for supposedly meeting for the first time. \nOnline sleuths highlighted how the pair's interaction on the train was supposedly flirty.\nAnd when fellow contestant Netty recognised Ross as a years-ago acquaintance, viewers seemed to see Ellie react by grimacing.\nTaking their deductions a step further, eager fans proceeded to look up both contestants online.\nThey discovered how Ross had 'liked' a post shared by Ellie on LinkedIn back in July, although it is unclear whether this was before or after filming.\nWriting on Reddit, one viewer shared: 'Their initial scene did have a fake energy. If you live in London and someone else says they do too, especially when you’re young, you wouldn’t be surprised! \n'It’s not like both living in Cornwall or Grimsby or something.'\nAnother commented: 'They could be a couple potentially- I did see Ellie react when Netty recognised Ross.'\n\nIt comes as sleuthing fans of The Traitors have shared theories suggesting Ross and Ellie could secretly be a couple\n\nIf these suspicions are proven correct, it would mean Ross, 37, had two pre-existing connections before entering the game\n\nRoss and Nettie were stunned to see each other - having met years ago through a mutual friend but had not seen each other for years\n\n The Traitors murder their first victim of the series as fans share bewilderment over players' decision to target a 'huge threat' \nWhile a third remarked: 'She glances at him when everyone is sitting in a group after traitors are chosen just at the end of the edit, just a split second but looks like she’s checking his reaction to what’s being said, it looks really obvious to me there!'\nBBC Bosses say it was not planned to have a second pair of contestants on the show who already know each other, as it was revealed in the first episode that there is also a mother and daughter duo in the game.\nWhen conducting background checks, producers did find that Netty and Ross followed each other on social media, but the link was tenuous and they didn’t want to not cast them because of it.\nMike Cotton, Creative Director at Studio Lamberts, told the Daily Mail that neither player was warned ahead of the opening scene, as they wanted to watch their natural reaction on-screen for the first time and see how it played out in the game.\nNetty’s stunned look quickly turned to excitement as she jumped into Ross’ arms after exiting the black 4x4s, while Ross was more reserved, making the reunion slightly awkward.\nShe then points to Ross and screams to the group, ‘I know him!’\nSpeaking to the camera, Netty added: ‘I get out of the car, and I recognise a face of someone called Ross who I met 10/15 years ago. I had no idea Ross was going to be here.’\nHe later explained that he was worried people would be suspicious of them.\n‘Seeing Netty for the first time, I was like oh can we keep…,’ he said, while pretending to zip his mouth shut.\n‘But she is a very honest person, and I didn’t want to betray her, and it was really nice to see her. In the back of my mind, I was thinking this looks a bit suss.’\nThe pair later explained that they know each other through mutual friends in London, but Netty has since moved to Glasgow, and they haven’t seen each other for over 10 years. \n\nElsewhere, Roxy revealed to viewers that she and fellow contestant Judy are mother and daughter - after seemingly accidentally spilling the beans earlier in the episode\nMeanwhile, fellow contestant Roxy, 32, let viewers in on her secret: she and co-star Judy, 60, are mother and daughter.\nJudy explained to the camera that she adopted Roxy when the latter was four, with the pair operating in the game as a secret alliance.\nThis revelation came after another player, James, told Roxy how Judy was being suspected as a Traitor.\nAs it happens, Roxy had already unintentionally spilled the beans earlier in the day - but no one appeared to notice.\nViewers realised she had seemingly referred to Judy as 'mum' while the group took on their first mission.\nThe Traitors continues Saturday at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\nThe TraitorsLondonBBC\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Traitors fans in stitches after Amanda fires savage comeback to fellow player Hugo at the round-table: 'You're not my type, I'm a lesbian'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy JESSICA JANES, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:20:19 GMT, 2 January 2026 |Updated:22:29 GMT, 2 January 2026 \n\nThe Traitors have now murdered their first victim of the series. \nDuring Friday evening's instalment of the hit BBC series, Netty become the first faithful to be murdered by the Traitors. \nAs the players sat down for breakfast, they soon discovered that Netty had been chosen by the Traitors to leave Ardross Castle, leaving several players visibly devastated and shocked. \nSpeaking to the camera after her elimination, Netty said: 'I'm so gutted. I think I would have been a really good Faithful. Maybe I've been too good a faithful, too loud, and now my time is done.' \nShe added: 'It has been awesome, so good luck Faithful.' \nFollowing her dramatic exit, fans of the hit show flocked to X, formerly Twitter, to share their bewilderment at the Traitors' decision to target Netty first. \n\nThe Traitors have now banished their first victim of the series\n\nDuring Friday evening's instalment of the hit BBC series, Netty become the first faithful to be murdered by the traitors \nOne fan wrote: 'I'm shocked the Traitors killed Netty. She was a huge target with her bond with Ross & that would've been a great distraction at a roundtable.'; \n'Netty gone? That's an absolutely wild choice.' \n'Wow, I'm surprised they got rid of Netty. I would've kept her in because the traitors could've used all the suspicion over her and Ross's relationship to get them banished at the round table. I think Maz should've gone.' \nIt comes as The Traitors fans are certain two of the contestants are a secret couple - after spotting two 'really obvious' clues in the previous episode.\nHosted once again by Claudia Winkleman, the hit BBC show returned to screens last night for its fourth series.\nViewers have already learned about some pre-existing relationships among the cast - and think they've sussed out one more. \nNamely, suggesting that contestants Ross, 37 and Ellie, 33 are secretly in a romantic relationship with each other.\nThe pair, both of whom are from London, were seen chatting on the train to the castle.\n\nAs the players sat down for breakfast, they soon discovered that Netty had been chosen by the Traitors to leave Ardross Castle, leaving several players visibly devastated and shocked\n\nSpeaking to the camera after her elimination, Netty said: 'I'm so gutted. I think I would have been a really good Faithful. Maybe I've been too good a Faithful, too loud, and now my time is done'\n\nShe added: 'It has been awesome, so good luck Faithful'\n\nFollowing her dramatic exit, fans of the hit show flocked to X, formerly Twitter, to share their bewilderment at the Traitors' decision to target Netty first\nEagle-eyed fans thought they saw hints of the pair seeming too familiar for supposedly meeting for the first time. \nOnline sleuths highlighted how the pair's interaction on the train was supposedly flirty.\nAnd when fellow contestant Netty recognised Ross as a years-ago acquaintance, viewers seemed to see Ellie react by grimacing.\nTaking their deductions a step further, eager fans proceeded to look up both contestants online.\nThey discovered how Ross had 'liked' a post shared by Ellie on LinkedIn back in July, although it is unclear whether this was before or after filming.\nWriting on Reddit, one viewer shared: 'Their initial scene did have a fake energy. If you live in London and someone else says they do too, especially when you’re young, you wouldn’t be surprised!\n'It’s not like both living in Cornwall or Grimsby or something.'\n\nIt comes as sleuthing fans of The Traitors have shared theories suggesting Ross and Ellie could secretly be a couple\n\nIf these suspicions are proven correct, it would mean Ross, 37, had two pre-existing connections before entering the game\n\nRoss and Nettie were stunned to see each other - having met years ago through a mutual friend but had not seen each other for years\nAnother commented: 'They could be a couple potentially- I did see Ellie react when Netty recognised Ross.'\nWhile a third remarked: 'She glances at him when everyone is sitting in a group after traitors are chosen just at the end of the edit, just a split second but looks like she’s checking his reaction to what’s being said, it looks really obvious to me there!'\nBBC Bosses say it was not planned to have a second pair of contestants on the show who already know each other, as it was revealed in the first episode that there is also a mother and daughter duo in the game.\nWhen conducting background checks, producers did find that Netty and Ross followed each other on social media, but the link was tenuous and they didn’t want to not cast them because of it.\nMike Cotton, Creative Director at Studio Lamberts, told the Daily Mail that neither player was warned ahead of the opening scene, as they wanted to watch their natural reaction on-screen for the first time and see how it played out in the game.\nNetty’s stunned look quickly turned to excitement as she jumped into Ross’ arms after exiting the black 4x4s, while Ross was more reserved, making the reunion slightly awkward.\nShe then points to Ross and screams to the group, ‘I know him!’\nSpeaking to the camera, Netty added: ‘I get out of the car, and I recognise a face of someone called Ross who I met 10/15 years ago. I had no idea Ross was going to be here.’\n\nElsewhere, Roxy revealed to viewers that she and fellow contestant Judy are mother and daughter - after seemingly accidentally spilling the beans earlier in the episode\n\n The Traitors fans convinced a pair of faithful contestants are a secret couple after spotting two 'really obvious' clues in first episode \nHe later explained that he was worried people would be suspicious of them.\n‘Seeing Netty for the first time, I was like oh can we keep…,’ he said, while pretending to zip his mouth shut.\n‘But she is a very honest person, and I didn’t want to betray her, and it was really nice to see her. In the back of my mind, I was thinking this looks a bit suss.’\nThe pair later explained that they know each other through mutual friends in London, but Netty has since moved to Glasgow, and they haven’t seen each other for over 10 years. \nMeanwhile, fellow contestant Roxy, 32, let viewers in on her secret: she and co-star Judy, 60, are mother and daughter.\nJudy explained to the camera that she adopted Roxy when the latter was four, with the pair operating in the game as a secret alliance.\nThis revelation came after another player, James, told Roxy how Judy was being suspected as a Traitor.\nAs it happens, Roxy had already unintentionally spilled the beans earlier in the day - but no one appeared to notice.\nViewers realised she had seemingly referred to Judy as 'mum' while the group took on their first mission.\nThe Traitors continues Saturday at 8pm on BBC One and iPlayer.\nBBCClaudia WinklemanThe TraitorsLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe Traitors murder their first victim of the series as fans share bewilderment over players' decision to target a 'huge threat'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 111\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Likewise, another fraud scheme in the state stems from the Housing Stability Services Program, which offered Medicaid coverage for housing stabilization services in an attempt to help those with disabilities, mental illnesses and substance-use disorders receive housing. The bulk of those charged are part of Minnesota’s Somali population, prompting Trump to announce in November that he was ending the Temporary Protected Status for Somali migrants in Minnesota that offers protection against deportation. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that it was spearheading a major operation to arrest and remove those involved in the fraud.

The magistrate concluded there are no conditions of release that can reasonably protect the public from the danger that Cole allegedly poses.\n\nDepartment of Justice prosecutors say Cole confessed to placing pipe bombs outside the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters only hours before a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Cole said he hoped the explosives would detonate and “hoped there would be news about it”.\n\n“Mercifully, that did not happen,” Judge Sharbaugh wrote in the order.\n\n“But if the plan had succeeded, the results,” he said, could have been devastating, “creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, DC, grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse.”\n\nAfter his arrest last month, Cole told investigators that he believed someone needed to “speak up” for people who believed the 2020 election, which Democrat Joe Biden won, was stolen and that he wanted to target the country’s political parties because they were “in charge”, according to prosecutors.\n\nTrump and his allies had spent months baselessly claiming the 202 vote was marred by widespread fraud, a position he has maintained since his election victory in 2024.\n\nThe US president was later indicted for his role in fomenting the January 6, 2021, riot, which occurred as Congress met to certify the election results, but the case was abandoned after his election victory in 2024. Under longstanding Justice Department policy, it does not prosecute sitting presidents.\n\nAfter taking office, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 of the rioters, including those convicted of violent crimes at the Capitol.\n\nIf convicted, Cole faces up to 10 years of imprisonment on one charge and up to 20 years of imprisonment on a second charge that also carries a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.\n\nCole’s lawyers asked for him to be released on home detention with GPS monitoring. They said Cole does not have a criminal record, has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and lives in a stable home that he shared with his parents in Woodbridge, Virginia.\n\n“Mr Cole simply does not pose a danger to the community,” his defence lawyers wrote in court filings. “Whatever risk the government posits is theoretical and backward-looking, belied by the past four years where Mr Cole lived at home with his family without incident.”\n\nCole continued to buy bomb-making components for months after the January 6 riot, according to prosecutors. They said he told the FBI that he planted the pipe bombs because “something just snapped”.\n\n“The sudden and abrupt motivation behind Mr Cole’s alleged actions presents concerns about how quickly the same abrupt and impulsive conduct might recur,” Judge Sharbaugh wrote in the order.","summary":"Prosecutors say Brian Cole confessed to planting bomb while parroting Trump&#039;s false claims 2020 election was stolen.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/2/us-judge-orders-dc-pipe-bomber-to-remain-in-custody-ahead-of-trial?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/epa_6958339dbe55-1767388061.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:11:20","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":390845752,"title":"Bridgewater, D.E.

Trump Thinks They Deserve To Die.","text":"On September 2, President Donald Trump gleefully announced that he had ordered a \"kinetic strike\" on a speedboat \"transporting illegal narcotics,\" killing 11 men he described as \"positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists.\" That SEAL Team Six operation became newly controversial a few months later because it included a follow-up missile strike that obliterated two defenseless survivors of the initial attack as they clung to the smoldering wreckage. But even before that revelation, it was clear that the attack marked an alarming escalation of the war on drugs.\n\nThe September 2 operation inaugurated a deadly military campaign against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific that so far has killed 115 people in 35 attacks. This new anti-drug strategy treats cocaine couriers as \"combatants\" who can be killed at will, from a distance and in cold blood, rather than criminal suspects subject to arrest and prosecution. Yet remnants of the latter approach persist, creating contradictions that underline the illogic, immorality, and lawlessness of the murderous methods that Trump prefers.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard is still intercepting boats suspected of carrying illegal drugs, as it did for decades before Trump deemed that strategy insufficiently violent. Between September 1 and November 30, The New York Times reports, \"the Coast Guard interdicted 38 vessels suspected of smuggling drugs.\" During the same period, the U.S. military blew up 22 suspected drug boats, killing 83 people. The smugglers who were lucky enough to be caught by the Coast Guard met a strikingly different fate: By and large, they were returned to their home countries because the Justice Department declined to prosecute them.\n\nUnder U.S. law, the death penalty generally is not available in drug cases. But the Trump administration says cocaine couriers deserve death, delivered without legal authorization or any semblance of due process, because supplying Americans with the drugs they want is tantamount to murder. It also says cocaine couriers are committing crimes so minor that prosecuting them would be a waste of Justice Department resources. That blatant inconsistency exposes the fallacy of conflating drug smuggling with violent aggression.\n\nIn an executive order he issued on his first day in office, Trump said \"it is the policy of the United States to ensure the total elimination\" of drug cartels. Toward that end, Attorney General Pam Bondi instructed federal prosecutors to eschew charges against low-level drug offenders, including smugglers very much like the ones Trump is summarily executing, in favor of higher-value cases involving \"leaders and managers\" of drug trafficking organizations.\n\n\"Under the total-elimination policy,\" Bondi wrote in a February 5 memo to Justice Department employees, \"it will often be prudent to pursue removal from the United States of a low-level investigative target without immigration status, rather than incurring the time and resource costs associated with criminal prosecution. Similarly, because the Department is working toward elimination of these threats from the homeland, it will rarely be consistent with this policy to pursue foreign arrests and extraditions of targets who may be eligible for safety-valve relief or minor role adjustments. This includes foreign arrests of low-level narcotics offenders pursuant to the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act under Chapter 705 of Title 46.\"\n\nThat law authorizes the Coast Guard to intercept and arrest drug smugglers in international waters. But according to Bondi, such cases generally are not worth pursuing. So what happens to \"low-level narcotics offenders\" nabbed by the Coast Guard?\n\nWhen the Justice Department \"declines prosecution,\" the Coast Guard told the Times, \"the Coast Guard coordinates either the direct repatriation to the detainee's country of nationality or transfer ashore to Department of Homeland Security custody for additional investigation and expedited removal.\" On November 19, for example, a Coast Guard cutter returned to Port Everglades after seizing 49,010 pounds of cocaine in 15 boat interdictions. \"The cutter took custody of 36 smuggling suspects during the mission, repatriated 29 to Ecuador for prosecution and referred the others to the Justice Department,\" the Times reports. In other words, at least four-fifths of the crew members were deemed unworthy of federal prosecution.\n\nAccording to Tampa defense attorneys who represent smuggling suspects, the Times says, their clients typically are \"men so poor they get their lawyers through court appointment.\" They \"don't own the boats and may not know where they are going until they reach a boat and are handed a GPS device with preprogrammed coordinates.\" They are \"poor fishermen and farmers willing to risk their lives on the drug boats\" in exchange for payments that reportedly range from $500 to $10,000 per trip.\n\nIt seems likely that many of the \"narcoterrorists\" whose deaths Trump has ordered fit that profile. We have no way of knowing for sure because the government has provided almost no information about the people killed in these strikes. In most cases, it has not even identified the criminal organizations for which they allegedly worked. But one thing is clear: The same crime cannot be so heinous that it merits the death penalty yet so petty that federal prosecutors can't be bothered to prove it.","summary":"Even as the president blows up drug boats, the government routinely declines to pursue charges against smugglers nabbed by the Coast Guard.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/02/the-doj-thinks-cocaine-couriers-are-not-worth-prosecuting-trump-thinks-they-deserve-to-die/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Donald-Trump-US-Army-photo-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:10:50","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":390837508,"title":"Exclusive Look: The Private Event That Prompted Trump’s Aides to Depart Mar-a-Lago","text":"A fashionable socialite, sporting stilettos, learned a painful lesson at Donald Trump’s crowded Mar-a-Lago New Year’s Eve event when she twisted her ankle in the chaos. This year, she chose to skip the event altogether.\n\nShe wasn’t the only one to pass on the celebration this time around.\n\nSeveral members of Palm Beach’s high society and some administration officials decided to forgo what is typically considered the most sought-after ticket in Southern Florida.\n\nAccording to a well-connected insider from Palm Beach, those who do attend what was once an exclusive affair are now mostly “grifters and people who think Trump is Jesus,” as shared with the Daily Mail, laced with a hint of disapproval.\n\nIronically, the highlight of Trump’s grand event was a live performance by artist Vanessa Horabuena, who created an abstract painting of Jesus Christ. The artwork was later auctioned off for $2.75 million, benefiting charity.\n\nOne Trump supporter downplayed the excitement surrounding the yearly gathering, telling the Daily Mail that he opted out of the Mar-a-Lago festivities this year, adding, “I’ve been for NYE before, it was boring, and I left early.”\n\nSome members of the president’s inner circle noticeably chose to skip the circus to opt for alternate, more low-key parties to welcome 2026.\n\nAt the top of the list was Alina Habba, senior advisor to Attorney General Pam Bondi and former counselor to the president, who decided to throw a alternative New Year’s event at her new house in Florida.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel and his country music singer girlfriend Alexis Wilkins decided to hit Habba’s, a well-placed source told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe source revealed that while top Trump advisor Margo Martin started her night at the president’s private Palm Beach club, she left around 10PM to ring-in 2026 at Habba’s home instead.\n\nThe guest list also included Real Housewives of New Jersey star Siggy Flicker, who is close with New Jersey-native Habba. \n\nA person familiar with the event said that the Habba party was much more ‘chill’ and ‘intimate’ with a ‘selective’ guest list of ‘A-list government and White House staffers.’\n\nThey said that a lot of people wanted to ‘opt out of the chaos and the madness’ of spending New Year’s with the crowd at Mar-a-Lago – ‘especially when they work in chaos of DC the rest of the year.’\n\nAbout 30 people attended Habba’s party, the source estimated. \n\nOne Palm Beach source told the Daily Mail that ‘so many people just want to go to Mar-a-Lago and take a picture’ with the president or to show they were at the event. It’s more about status, they say, than actually having a good time. \n\nImages posted to social media by MAGA insiders show Martin was at Mar-a-Lago for at least part of the evening. \n\nBut later in the night she took a selfie with Chamberlain Harris, who serves as Trump’s special assistant and deputy director of White House Oval Office Operations, next to the 2026 pool-side light-up sign in Habba’s yard right down the road from the club. \n\nHabba posted some images from her family-friendly New Year’s Eve party with her children, who apparently still live full-time and attend school in New Jersey. \n\nTrump appointed Habba as acting US attorney for New Jersey in March 2025, despite her having no prosecutorial experience. She resigned in December 2025 after an appeals court ruled she was serving unlawfully in the position.\n\nAs a small circle of Trump loyalists partied at Habba’s, the president was down the road at Mar-a-Lago with thousands gathered to celebrate 2026 and the impending end of his first year back in office.\n\nMAGA luminaries spotted at the shindig included former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; former Fox News host and US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro; MyPillow CEO and Minnesota US Senate hopeful Mike Lindell; Hollywood director Brett Ratner, who directed the upcoming Melania documentary; and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nTrump’s children Donald Trump Jr., Eric and Barron were spotted.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held official meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, were among the most high-profile guests of the night.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA fashionable socialite, sporting stilettos, learned a painful lesson at Donald Trump&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Exclusive Look: The Private Event That Prompted Trump&#8217;s Aides to Depart Mar-a-Lago first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/exclusive-look-the-private-event-that-prompted-trumps-aides-to-depart-mar-a-lago/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Inside-the-party-that-had-Trumps-aides-ditching-Mar-a-Lago.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-02 22:03:17","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.226}]}
