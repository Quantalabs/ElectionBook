He noted that Afridi has not met the party founder due to concerns that any direct instructions could trigger disruption. Sethi asserted that the provincial chief minister is unable to make independent decisions without guidance from the founder, while the political party actively keeps the PTI founder’s issue alive to maintain relevance.\n\nTurning to regional affairs, Sethi spoke on Pakistan-Afghanistan relations, foreseeing deteriorating conditions. He suggested that if militant incidents originate from Afghan territory, Pakistan may retaliate with strikes, indicating the prospect of rising cross-border tension.\n\nWhen asked by host Syeda Ayesha Naz about the recent meeting between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Donald Trump, Sethi deemed it a highly significant development, particularly as it took place after eight years. He highlighted Saudi Arabia’s strategic concerns as Israel’s neighbour and its interest in revisiting the Abraham Accords, especially after recent tensions reportedly involving the Palestinian negotiation team in Qatar.\n\nAccording to Sethi, Saudi Arabia wishes to sign the Abraham Accords to reduce hostilities with Israel, but negotiations have stalled. He said the reported Israeli action in Qatar targeting a Palestinian delegation has caused a major shift in diplomatic thinking across the region.\n\nHe revealed that Saudi Arabia recently signed a defence agreement with Pakistan and subsequently urged the United States to strengthen involvement. Riyadh reportedly questioned Washington’s credibility for not informing them about developments in Qatar, demanding greater assurance of protection and strategic cooperation.\n\nSethi further explained that the Saudi Crown Prince has called for upgrading the existing defence agreement with the United States, seeking a clause that would classify any attack on Saudi Arabia as an attack on the US. He [the Crown Prince] also demanded F-35 fighter jets, while addressing American concerns about possible technology leakage to Pakistan or China.\n\nIn response, Donald Trump pursued substantial economic gains, securing a $600 billion investment agreement from Saudi Arabia. Following the talks, conversations around the Abraham Accords were also revived, signalling a pivotal reshaping of regional alliances and strategic partnerships.","url":"https://www.dunyanews.tv/index.php/en/Pakistan/920672-najam-sethi-returns-to-dunya-tv-with-revelations-on-sohail-afridis-","image":"https://img.dunyanews.tv/news/2025/November/11-29-25/news_big_images/920672_52248121.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 07:00:00","author":"Staff Reporter","authors":["Staff Reporter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":383240982,"title":"Suspect in National Guard Shooting Faces Murder Charge","text":"WASHINGTON: Charges against the man accused of shooting two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia announced Friday, while investigators continue to seek a motive and the U.S. government announced a halt to all asylum decisions. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24 were hospitalized in critical condition after the Wednesday afternoon shooting near the White House. Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office said the charges against Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, now include one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Beckstrom and Wolfe were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard as part of President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting mission that federalized the D.C. police force. The president also has deployed or tried to deploy National Guard members to other cities to assist with his mass deportation efforts but has faced court challenges. Trump called the shooting a “terrorist attack” and criticized the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the U.S. The president has said he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and expel millions of immigrants from the country. The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on the social platform X that all asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.” In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C.\" Pirro said officials have been working around the clock to determine the suspect's motive. Investigators are executing warrants in the state of Washington, where Lakanwal lived, and other parts of the country. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited National Guard troops in the nation’s capital Friday and led them in a prayer for Beckstrom and Wolfe. “Some of you may have known her,” Hegseth said of Beckstrom. “Obviously a beautiful human being and a great American willing to serve her country brutally targeted.” Hegseth said he and his wife briefly visited Wolfe on Thursday night “to be there, lay hands on him, pray over him.” Wolfe remains in “very critical condition,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday. He ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom’s death. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state,” Morrisey said. Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman. Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal’s in Bellingham, told the AP in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. Some of his children attended the same school as Lakanwal’s children, Sherzad said. “He was so quiet and the kids were so polite, they were so playful. But we didn’t see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,” Sherzad said. Sherzad said Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago. Lakanwal had briefly worked as an independent contractor for Amazon Flex, which allows people to use their own cars to deliver packages, a company spokesperson shared with The Associated Press. Lakanwal delivered packages from the end of July to the end of August and hadn’t been active since. Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that resettled Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement. In a Thanksgiving address to the troops Thursday, Trump said that Lakanwal “went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts.” Lakanwal served in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit, known as one of the special Zero Units, in the southern province of Kandahar, according to a resident of the eastern...","summary":"Trump called the shooting a “terrorist attack” and criticized the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the U.S","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/suspect-in-national-guard-shooting-faces-murder-charge-1920401","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/29/1984092-untitled-design.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 01:15:40","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":383238910,"title":"Inside Gaza’s apocalypse: A doctor’s testimony from a landscape of rubble and starvation","text":"A regular visitor to his wife’s native Kinsale, Dr Maynard spoke to the Irish Examiner ahead of a public talk he will give in Co Clare this weekend.\n\nHe said he had been “privileged” to lead the first UK emergency medical team into Gaza two months after the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, in which some 1,200 Israeli citizens were killed and 254 hostages taken, sparking the latest bombardment of the region.\n\nSince then, in the region of 70,000 people are estimated to have been killed by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the besieged enclave.\n\nThis week, Amnesty International warned Israel was “still committing genocide” against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, despite the ceasefire agreed last month.\n\nThe fragile truce between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10, after two years of war.\n\n“The ceasefire risks creating a dangerous illusion that life in Gaza is returning to normal,” said Amnesty’s secretary general Agnès Callamard. \n\n“But while Israeli authorities and forces have reduced the scale of their attacks and allowed limited amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza, the world must not be fooled. Israel’s genocide is not over.”\n\nDr Maynard spoke of the horrors he has witnessed in Gaza.\n\n“I’ve seen babies who’ve been shot. I’ve seen babies who’ve lost their limbs. I’ve seen multiple young teenage boys who’ve been deliberately shot by the Israeli military and shot in specific parts of the body on specific days,” he said.\n\n“This clustering of injuries was so striking it cannot possibly be coincidence.\n\n\"And all of us who witnessed it felt it could only be a form of target practice that they were saying ‘Right, today, lads, we’re going to shoot them in the head. Tomorrow, we’ll shoot them in the chest. On Saturday night, we’ll shoot them in the testicles'.\"\n\nHe said he had witnessed extreme malnutrition, with babies dying because of the lack of formula feed.\n\n“I remember a little baby called Zaynab who was seven months old, who died when I was there because there was no there was no formula feed to give her. All the nurses could give her was water with sugar in it, which has no nutritional value.” \n\nDr Maynard said four days before Zaynab died, American doctors had come to Gaza with formula feed in their luggage, and the Israeli border guards removed every container.\n\n“They say they remove anything that could be used as a weapon. I’m really struggling to think what purpose could formula feed have other than feed babies. It’s obscene, deliberate starvation, a war crime.\"\n\nConditions in Gaza are worse than can be imagined from television news reports, he said, with the areas in the north of the Gaza Strip and around Gaza City almost uninhabitable.\n\n“If you ever saw the Mad Max films of yesteryear, the post-apocalyptic landscape in those areas, it is exactly like that. As far as you can see, it’s just rubble, mass destruction.” \n\nThe majority of the population has now been displaced, he said, and are living in their hundreds of thousands in Al-Mawasi, a previously unoccupied desert coastal area from Deir al-Balah down to Rafah now filled with thousands of makeshift tents.\n\n“The word ‘tents’ doesn’t really do it justice, they’re for the most part tarpaulin sheets, canvas covers, which are, of course, all being destroyed in the severe rains which have taken place in recent weeks.\"\n\nHe said he feels despair whenever he goes to Gaza, and a fear he will never see Gazan friends alive again.\n\n\"You feel an extreme anger that the world is allowing this to happen, you feel a complete incomprehension about how humans can treat other humans like this.\"\n\nDr Maynard said he was “blown away” by the pressure Irish people have placed on their Government.\n\n“I spend a lot of time in Cork, in Kinsale, and I often join the Cork people in their march every single Saturday. They’ve marched every Saturday since October 7, which is wonderful, and they need to continue doing that,” he said.\n\n“The Irish Government can do more. They’re doing more than the UK government, of course, but they could put a lot more pressure on the US government, and at the end of the day, the US government could stop this completely overnight.\n\n“It was, frankly, bizarre that Donald Trump should be campaigning for the Nobel Peace Prize when he could have stopped it the minute he came into power, when the minute he took over the US presidency. Indeed, Biden could have stopped it two years ago,” he said.\n\n\"The US have it within their power to stop this overnight, and they have failed to do so.\"\n\nThe 1948 UN genocide convention defines genocide as any of five “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.\n\nIn December 2024, Amnesty concluded Israel was committing genocide in Gaza by three of those acts — including deliberately inflicting on Palestinians conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.\n\nIn an update on Thursday, Amnesty said: “Israel continues to severely restrict the entry of supplies and the restoration of services essential for the survival of the civilian population.\n\n“Despite a reduction in scale of attacks, and some limited improvements, there has been no meaningful change in the conditions Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and no evidence to indicate that Israel’s intent has changed.”\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry has consistently rejected allegations of genocide, describing them as “entirely false”, “fabricated” and “based on lies”.\n\n Dr Nick Maynard will give a fundraising talk at 6pm this Saturday, November 30, at Cultúrlann Sweeney in Kilkee, Co Clare. Tickets are €20, with all proceeds going to Medical Aid for Palestine.\n Further information here.","summary":"A veteran volunteer surgeon describes deliberate shootings, starvation and mass devastation in Gaza as he prepares to speak in Clare","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/spotlight/arid-41750877.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9756/4878123_10_seoimage1x1_GettyImages-2225774509_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 01:00:00","author":"Donal O'keeffe,Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Donal O'keeffe","Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.618},{"id":383240532,"title":"World News | Eight More Arrested in Connection with Hong Kong Fire That Killed 128 People","text":"Hong Kong, November 29 (ANI): Eight more people have been arrested in connection with the massive fire at Wang Fuk Court residential compound in the Tai Po district, Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said on Friday.\nAccording to the Global Times, the ICAC has launched an investigation into possible corruption linked to the building's repair and maintenance works.

It’s insane,” VanDiver told AP. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans. He represents himself.”\n\nOn Thursday, it was announced that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, deployed with the National Guard under orders from Trump, had died from her injuries while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained in critical condition in a local hospital.\n\nWhile heartbreak and mourning was widely shared for the victims of the shooting, Trump’s xenophobic response to the violent assault, including his racist social media posts on Truth Social that critics said echoed white nationalist rhetoric, proved for many observers once again his shortcomings as a national leader during times of crisis, but also as a human being.\n\n“The perpetrator should face accountability but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual,” said Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, said Thursday. “That would be terribly unjust and complete nonsense. Cool heads must prevail.”\n\nArash Azizzada, co-director of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow, which long-opposed the US war in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 and continues to advocate on behalf of the Afghan-American community, condemned Trump for “using this tragedy as a pretext to demonize, criminalize, and target an entire community. Exploiting a single incident to cast suspicion on Afghans—people who have already endured decades of displacement and America’s forever wars—is both irresponsible and cruel.”\n\nAzizzada also pointed out how the alleged gunman now in police custody, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, “worked alongside US Special Operations forces and served in a CIA-backed covert paramilitary group known as ‘Zero Units’ that functioned outside the purview of any accountability and have a documented history of widespread human rights abuses against Afghan civilians over two decades.”\n\n“We both condemn the violence by one individual on the streets of Washington, DC as well as the violence perpetrated by the US in Afghanistan and elsewhere,” said Azizzada. “America must confront the decades of violence it inflicted on Afghanistan and acknowledge that its forever wars are a major reason why Afghans seek safety here. Blaming refugees for the consequences of those actions is unjust and we call for the promises to Afghans to be honored, not abandoned.”\n\nJournalist Ryan Grim, co-founder of Drop Site News, put it this way: “The idea that we should freeze all migration because one of the CIA’s death squad recruits went on a rampage is absurd. Smarter would be to stop training death squads.”\n\nEvacuate Our Allies, a group that advocates on behalf of Afghans who helped the US during the war and now seeking to resettle, expressed deep sympathies for the victims of the shooting and their families and condemned the “reprehensible attack.” The group also denounced the “alarming vilification of an entire community based on the actions of a lone individual.”\n\n“No community, Afghan or otherwise, should be judge, demonized, or collectively punished for the behavior of one person,” the group said. “Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions. Collective blame is not only unjust but dangerous. It undermines the immense sacrifices our nation’s Afghan allies made, sacrifices that cost many their safety, their homes, their loved ones, and, in too many case, their lives.”","summary":"Advocates for refugees in the United States continued to raise alarm Friday after President Donald Trump moved quickly to exploit the murder of one National Guard soldier and the wounding of another—allegedly shot by a national from Afghanistan who worked for the US military and CIA during the war there before seeking asylum in the US—by issuing a sweeping ban against asylum-seekers and halting all immigration from what he termed “all Third World countries” in response to Wednesday’s shooting in Washington, DC.\n\n“Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status,” said Matthew Soerens, a vice president with the faith-based World Relief, speaking with the Associated Press, “we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”\n\nShawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the US during the war in Afghanist","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-afghans/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/u-s-president-donald-trump-looks-down-as-he-participates-in-a-call-with-service-members-of-u-s-army-jtf-southern-border-101s.jpg?id=62256827&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=832%2C0%2C833%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:45:35","author":"Common Dreams,Jon Queally","authors":["Common Dreams","Jon Queally"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":383238852,"title":"National Guard shooting suspect faces murder charge as US halts all asylum decisions","text":"ReutersMembers of the National Guard patrol the Smithsonian Metro Station after two National Guard members were shot on Wednesday, in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 28, 2025. \n\nCharges against the man accused of shooting two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia announced Friday, while investigators continue to seek a motive and the U.S. government announced a halt to all asylum decisions. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24 were hospitalized in critical condition after the Wednesday afternoon shooting near the White House. Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office said the charges against Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, now include one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Beckstrom and Wolfe were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that federalized the D.C. police force. The president also has deployed or tried to deploy National Guard members to other cities to assist with his mass deportation efforts but has faced court challenges. Trump called the shooting a \"terrorist attack\" and criticized the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the U.S. The president has said he wants to \"permanently pause migration\" from poorer nations and expel millions of immigrants from the country. Live Events The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said in a post on the social platform X that all asylum decisions will be paused \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.\" In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are \"many charges to come\" beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and \"ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C.\" Pirro said officials have been working around the clock to determine the suspect's motive. Investigators are executing warrants in the state of Washington, where Lakanwal lived, and other parts of the country. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited National Guard troops in the nation's capital Friday and led them in a prayer for Beckstrom and Wolfe. \"Some of you may have known her,\" Hegseth said of Beckstrom. \"Obviously a beautiful human being and a great American willing to serve her country brutally targeted.\" Hegseth said he and his wife briefly visited Wolfe on Thursday night \"to be there, lay hands on him, pray over him.\" Wolfe remains in \"very critical condition,\" West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday. He ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom's death. \"Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state,\" Morrisey said. Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman. Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal's in Bellingham, told the AP in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. Some of his children attended the same school as Lakanwal's children, Sherzad said. \"He was so quiet and the kids were so polite, they were so playful. But we didn't see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,\" Sherzad said. Sherzad said Lakanwal \"disappeared\" about two weeks ago. Lakanwal had briefly worked as an independent contractor for Amazon Flex, which allows people to use their own cars to deliver packages, a company spokesperson shared with The Associated Press. Lakanwal delivered packages from the end of July to the end of August and hadn't been active since. Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that resettled Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement. In a Thanksgiving address to the troops Thursday, Trump said that Lakanwal \"went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts.\" Lakanwal served in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit, known as one of the special Zero Units, in the southern province of Kandahar, according to a resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin. He said Lakanwal was originally from the province and that his brother had worked in the unit as well. The cousin spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. He said Lakanwal had started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012 and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist. Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA that also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Activists had attributed abuses to the units. They played a key role in the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, providing security around Kabul International Airport as the Americans and withdrew from the country. On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration initiative that brought roughly 76,000 people to the country, many of whom had worked as interpreters and translators. The program has faced intense scrutiny from Trump and others over allegations of gaps in the vetting process, even as advocates say there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Beckstrom 'exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism' Beckstrom had enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. \"She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,\" the statement said, adding that Beckstrom \"volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful, helping to ensure the safety and security of our nation's capital.\" The president called Beckstrom an \"incredible person, outstanding in every single way.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onlakanwalwest virginia national guardtrumptalibanspecialist sarah beckstromoperation allies welcomenational guardjeanine pirro sfox newsdefense\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onlakanwalwest virginia national guardtrumptalibanspecialist sarah beckstromoperation allies welcomenational guardjeanine pirro sfox newsdefense \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"Charges against Rahmanullah Lakanwal were upgraded to first-degree murder after National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom died from injuries sustained in a shooting near the White House.

US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said on Fox News on Friday that other charges would be filed against 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who she said ambushed the soldiers from the West Virginia National Guard near the White House on Wednesday. Formal charges were not immediately filed against Lakanwal, who had been in the US since 2021 under a program of then-president Joe Biden&apos;s administration to resettle Afghans who helped the US during the war in their homeland. He was granted asylum under the Trump administration. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Her National Guard colleague, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was in critical condition, Pirro said on Friday. The two were in Washington as part of President Donald Trump&apos;s deployment of the military in recent months to help the police fight crime in the city. On Friday morning, following the national holiday, notably fewer National Guard members were seen patrolling the capital. Trump, whose dispatch of troops to Washington faces fierce legal challenges, took to social media late on Thursday to escalate his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year, he has stepped up arrests of immigrants, including some in the US legally, and cracked down on unlawful border crossings while stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of people. \"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden&apos;s autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\" Trump said in his social media posts, referring to his predecessor in the White House. Trump did not say which countries he considers \"Third World,\" nor what he meant by a permanent pause. Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 through Biden&apos;s Operation Allies Welcome. More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US under the program for those fearing reprisal by the Taliban forces, who seized control of Afghanistan after the US military&apos;s withdrawal. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the US. He was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a US government file on him seen by Reuters. Investigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said he would be proposing regulations to ensure that people he referred to as \"illegal aliens\" do not receive certain credits on income tax they have paid. The tax code is set by Congress, which already limits what kind of benefits, if any, non-citizens are eligible to seek. Lakanwal lives in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect&apos;s family, Trump said: \"We&apos;re looking at the whole situation with family.\" United Nations agencies urged the US on Friday night to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country, including due process rights, in keeping with international law. \"We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general.

He was granted asylum under Trump.\n\nIn a call on Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday with US military service members, Trump said the shootings were a \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nSarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Her National Guard colleague, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was in critical condition, Pirro said on Friday. The two were in Washington as part of Trump's deployment of the military in recent months to help the police fight crime in the city.\n\nOn Friday morning, following the national holiday, notably fewer National Guard members were seen patrolling the capital.\n\nMeanwhile, the US State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghan passport holders. \n\nSecretary Marco Rubio confirmed the move Friday, saying the pause applies to all individuals travelling on Afghan passports.\n\nTrump ratchets up rhetoric on immigration\n\nTrump, whose dispatch of troops to Washington faces fierce legal challenges, took to social media late on Thursday to escalate his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year, he has stepped up arrests of immigrants, including some in the US legally, and cracked down on unlawful border crossings while stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\" Trump said in his social media posts, referring to his predecessor in the White House.\n\nTrump did not say which countries he considers \"Third World,\" nor what he meant by a permanent pause. It echoed the sweeping \"Muslim ban\" Trump tried to enact in his first term before it was diluted by successful legal challenges.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted again on social media to say he was rescinding any document that Biden signed using an autopen, a tool that US presidents, including Trump, have used for decades, often to answer mail or sign checks, or sometimes to meet authorisation deadlines while travelling outside the capital.\n\nAfter taking office in 2021, Biden reversed many of the restrictive immigration policies of Trump's first term, saying they blocked people in need of humanitarian protection and were discriminatory.\n\nAsked about Trump's comment on \"Third World\" countries, the US Department of Homeland Security referred Reuters to 19 countries listed in a June travel ban.\n\nOn Thursday, Homeland Security officials said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the Biden administration and permanent-residency green cards issued to citizens of the 19 countries, which include Afghanistan.\n\nJorge Loweree, the managing director of programmes and strategy at the American Immigration Council, said the president does not have authority through executive action to make permanent changes to the immigration system, which is codified by Congress. He warned of chaos and disarray in the US immigration system even if Trump is ultimately blocked by federal courts.\n\nShooting prompts sweeping immigration reviews\n\nLakanwal entered the US in 2021 through Biden's Operation Allies Welcome. More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US under the program for those fearing reprisal by the Taliban forces, who seized control of Afghanistan after the US military's withdrawal. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the US.\n\nHe was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a US government file on him seen by Reuters.\n\nInvestigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he would be proposing regulations to ensure that people he referred to as \"illegal aliens\" do not receive certain credits on income tax they have paid. The tax code is set by Congress, which already limits what kind of benefits, if any, non-citizens are eligible to seek.\n\nLakanwal lives in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect's family, Trump said: \"We're looking at the whole situation with family.\"\n\nInternational groups defend asylum seeker rights\n\nUnited Nations agencies urged the US on Friday night to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country, including due process rights, in keeping with international law.\n\n\"We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general.\n\nJasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration at the Lebanese American University, said freezing Afghan applications or reconsidering thousands of approved asylum claims would disrupt families and local communities.\n\n\"While the recent incident is tragic, using an isolated incident to justify mass restrictions is inconsistent with evidence showing no link between refugee arrivals and increased crime,\" Diab said in an interview.","url":"https://www.geo.tv/latest/636290-accused-washington-shooterr-faces-murder-charge-trump-wants-to-halt-third-world-migration","image":"https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2025-11-29/l_636290_061614_updates.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:33:53","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":383240496,"title":"World News | India, Russia Hold Expert Panel Meeting in Delhi to Discuss Defence Cooperation","text":"New Delhi [India], November 29 (ANI): India and Russia held an expert panel meeting in New Delhi from November 26 to 28 to discuss military and its technical cooperation.\nThe Defence Ministry informed that the meeting was co-chaired by Joint Secretary (International Cooperation) Amitabh Prasad and Deputy Chief of FSMTC (Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation) Yashin Sergey Borisovich.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Says US Skipped Johannesburg G20 Summit Over 'Rights Concerns', Declares South Africa Won't Be Invited to 2026 Miami Summit.\nBoth sides reaffirmed the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia during the discussions.\n\"India-Russia Expert Panel Meeting was held in New Delhi from 26-28 Nov 2025, co-chaired by JS (International Cooperation) Shri Amitabh Prasad and Deputy Chief, FSMTC Mr Yashin Sergey Borisovich.

The attack has intensified political tensions and raised new questions about the suspect’s background and possible motive, which investigators say remains unclear.Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were critically wounded in Wednesday’s shooting while deployed to Washington as part of President Donald Trump’s crime-fighting initiative that placed D.C. police under federal control. Trump announced Thursday night that Beckstrom had died; Wolfe remains in very critical condition.US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said the suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, now faces one count of first-degree murder and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed. Pirro told Fox News that prosecutors expect many charges to come, adding that warrants were being executed in Washington state, where Lakanwal lived, and other states as authorities work around the clock to determine a motive.TRUMP CALLS IT A TERRORIST ATTACKTrump described the shooting as a terrorist attack and used the moment to criticise the Biden administration for admitting Afghans who worked alongside US forces during the war. He also renewed his push for mass deportation operations and ordered a review of Afghan refugees who entered the US under Operation Allies Welcome, the post-withdrawal resettlement programme..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with troops in Washington on Friday, leading them in prayer.

Neighbors described him as quiet and polite. “We didn’t see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,” said neighbor Mohammad Sherzad, who added that Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago.He briefly worked as an independent contractor for Amazon Flex, delivering packages for around one month last summer, the company confirmed.Lakanwal entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, though his asylum application was ultimately approved under the Trump administration, according to #AfghanEvac. His background includes service in a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force known as a Zero Unit, operating in Kandahar. A man identifying himself as Lakanwal’s cousin said he had joined the unit as a security guard in 2012 before becoming a team leader and GPS specialist.Zero Units, staffed by Afghans but supported by the CIA, were active in front-line fighting and played a major role in securing Kabul airport during the chaotic 2021 withdrawal. Human-rights activists have accused the units of committing abuses during the war.INVESTIGATION CONTINUESAuthorities say they are still working to understand what led to the attack. Lakanwal’s family, neighbors and former colleagues are being interviewed, and electronic evidence is being collected from properties associated with him.The White House and Pentagon have not released additional details.

He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people.\n\nHernandez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.\n\nA lawyer for Hernandez, Renato C. Stabile, expressed gratitude for Trump's actions.\n\n\"A great injustice has been righted and we are so hopeful for the future partnership of the United States and Honduras,\" Stabile said. \"Thank you President Trump for making sure that justice was served. We look forward to President Hernandez's triumphant return to Honduras.\"\n\nA separate lawyer for Hernandez, Sabrina Shroff, declined comment.\n\nThe post was part of a broader message by Trump backing Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura for Honduras' presidency, with Trump saying the U.S. would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that \"the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.\"\n\nAsfura, 67, is making his second run for president for the conservative National Party. He was mayor of Tegucigalpa and has pledged to solve Honduras' infrastructure needs. But he has previously been accused of embezzling public funds, allegations that he denies.\n\nIn addition to Asfura, there are two other likely contenders for Honduras' presidency: Rixi Moncada, who served as the finance and later defense secretary before leaving to run for president for the incumbent democratic socialist Libre party, and Salvador Nasralla, a former television personality who is making his fourth bid for the presidency, this time as the candidate for the Liberal Party.\n\nTrump has framed Honduras' election as trial for democracy, suggesting in a separate Truth Social post that if Asfura loses, the country could go the way of Venezuela and fall under the influence of that country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump has sought to apply pressure on Maduro, ordering a series of strikes against boats suspected of carrying drugs, building up the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean with warships including the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford.\n\nThe U.S. president has not ruled out taking military action or covert action by the CIA against Venezuela, though he has also floated that he was open to speaking with Maduro.\n\nOutgoing Honduran President Xiomara Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the U.S. administration and she has received visits from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Army Gen. Laura Richardson, when she was the commander of U.S. Southern Command. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras' extradition treaty and military cooperation with the U.S.\n\nUnder Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the U.S. and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei, a staunch admirer of Trump, also gave his support to Asfura in Honduras on Friday.\n\n\"I fully support Tito Asfura, who is the candidate who best represents the opposition to the leftist tyrants who have destroyed Honduras,\" the libertarian president said on his X account.","summary":"Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was convicted for drug trafficking and weapons charges and sentenced to 45 years in prison.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/28/nx-s1-5624478/trump-plans-to-pardon-juan-orlando-hernandez","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/5760x3840!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1b%2F58%2Fb90aed1e42df8228e716a6dd890e%2Fap25332779283824.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:19:02","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031},{"id":383234458,"title":"Energy minister apologizes after suggesting Coastal First Nations could meet by Zoom over pipeline concerns","text":"Advertisement oopStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\n Subscribe $12 for 1 year \n\nAdvertisement 2AdvertisementThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle contentFormer Liberal minister Steven Guilbeault, who served as environment minister under Trudeau, resigned in protest over the deal, also citing concerns about the lack of consultation with both B.C. and the region’s Indigenous rights-holders.Article contentCoastal First Nations invited Hodgson back in mid-October to meet by the end of the month to discuss their concerns over the pipeline proposal.Article contentThe minister responded, saying he was unable to do so in that time frame, referring its leadership instead to speak with his chief of staff and senior department officials, whom he said he had asked to meet to discuss their concerns.Article contentThe minister’s office then reached out on Wednesday, the day before Carney and Smith released their new pipeline pact, to invite Coastal First Nations to meet in Vancouver on Friday, where the minister was set to meet with Eby.Article contentHodgson’s apology on Friday marks the second one in one week from a key figure of the Liberal government.Article contentCarney himself apologized earlier this week for what he also called a “poor choice of words” when asked by a reporter when the last time he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump was, to which the prime minister responded by saying, “Who cares?”Article contentWith a file from The Canadian PressArticle contentNational PostArticle contentOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

It's very useful for people whose signature appears on thousands of letters. That's why presidents, including Trump, have relied on them for over a century.\n\nPresidents are legally allowed to use autopen\n\nPresidents are thought to have employed the autopen for more than 200 years, since the time of Thomas Jefferson, who obtained one of the machines after it came under patent in 1803, according to the Shapell Manuscript Foundation. Gerald Ford, Lyndon B. Johnson, George W. Bush and Barack Obama are all known to have made use of the device. Obama became the first president to rely on an autopen to sign a piece of legislation in 2011.\n\nIn 2005, under Bush, the Justice Department found autopen use is legal. \"A person may sign a document by directing that his signature be affixed to it by another,\" a DOJ memo said.\n\nLegal scholars have noted that nothing in the Constitution requires presidents to sign pardons at all.\n\nWhat else did Trump say?\n\nTrump suggested without evidence that Biden was unaware of actions he signed by autopen, which he maintains would invalidate those signings.\n\n\"The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,\" Trump continued in his post. \"The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury.\"\n\nTrump made similar allegations in June, at which time he called for an investigation. On Oct. 28 the Republican-led House Oversight Committee recommended the Justice Department investigate.\n\nThe White House responded to questions as to how Biden's orders being \"terminated\" would be put into effect by simply referring back to Trump's post.\n\nTrump also uses autopen\n\nTrump told reporters in March that he has used autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"\n\n\"You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren't feeling well, etcetera,\" Trump said. \"But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful.\"\n\nBiden rejects Trump's claims\n\nIn a July New York Times interview, Biden said Republicans are \"liars\" for claiming he was not aware of his own White House actions that were signed by autopen.\n\n\"I made every decision,\" Biden said.\n\nCan Trump do this?\n\nNormally a president can reverse previous executive orders with a fresh executive order of his own. He does need to produce an actual order, however, not just make a statement on social media.\n\nPardons, on the other hand, are irreversible. In March, Trump asserted that pardons Biden issued are \"null and void\" because he used autopen.\n\nIs this really about the pardons?\n\nTrump has taken unprecedented steps to deploy the Department of Justice against his political adversaries, and he has a longstanding vendetta against the Biden family. To protect his family from potential future prosecution by the Trump administration, Biden pardoned family members for any possible crimes, including his son Hunter and his brother James before leaving office.\n\nTrump had previously indicated his intention to target \"the entire Biden crime family\" for prosecution. Future Trump appointees such as FBI Director Kash Patel made similar comments.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/28/trump-says-joe-biden-autopen-actions-are-terminated/87514381007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/28/USAT/87515334007-usatsi-27101714.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:16:39","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":383237630,"title":"Reflections | Trump insiders’ ‘Mar-a-Lago faces’ echo Chinese elites’ unhealthy efforts to please a king","text":"The “Mar-a-Lago face” has become the newest unofficial badge of power in Washington.\nThe look typically features inflated lips, immobile brows and sharply sculpted contours.

Men in the same political orbit are now seeking jaw sculpting, neck tightening and skin smoothing to project what they believe signals youthful vigour and authority.\nA large part of what drives this aesthetic is political. It is well documented that Trump has long favoured a particular type of look on women that is at once garish and synthetic. For these right-wing elites, sporting the Mar-a-Lago face becomes the most visible gesture of personal loyalty to Trump and cultural alignment with the Maga cause.\nThe same pattern of behaviour appears throughout China’s history, as it surely does in the histories of many other nations.\nFew anecdotes illustrate this more clearly than the well-known story of King Ling of Chu, who reigned from 540BC to 529BC and who preferred his officials to be thin-waisted. Versions of this tale appear in many early sources, but the Annals of the Warring States and the ancient philosophical text Mozi preserve the most detailed accounts.\nIn the Annals, King Wei of Chu (who reigned from 339BC to 329BC) remarks on the absence of great ministers in his own time. His senior official, Zihua, responds by recalling the case of King Ling, whose preference for slender-waisted officials unleashed an unhealthy fad.\nThe reason for King Ling’s predilection is unknown, but it was probably tied to his distaste for corpulence and its unmerited association with sloth.\nTo win royal approval, the king’s officials reduced themselves to a single meal a day in pursuit of a tiny waist. Many became so weak that they needed to support themselves against walls simply to stand.\nAlthough they longed to have proper, filling meals, they suppressed their desires so that they could achieve the physique their king admired. Some, the text suggests, were willing to risk their lives doing so.\n\nZihua’s point to King Wei was clear. A ruler’s personal tastes, even when trivial, can shape the conduct of an entire elite. If a king prizes ministers with real abilities over those possessing certain physical attributes, he will not find it difficult to attract talented people.\nMozi retells the episode and pairs it with another example to highlight the same principle.\nDuke Wen of the state of Jin (671BC-628BC) preferred attendants who dressed plainly, and so his officials appeared in sheepskin coats, cowhide belts and undyed silk caps.\nKing Ling’s taste for narrow waists produced a court so underfed that the faces of its denizens were green with hunger. The moral of the stories in Mozi is simple: people respond to what a ruler likes, especially if they have something to gain.\nAcross cultures and centuries, elites routinely remodel themselves, literally and figuratively, to match the preferences of those in power. Whether in ancient China or present-day Washington, personal taste at the top, however unreasonable, bizarre or even harmful, continues to reshape appearances, priorities and the behaviour of those seeking favour.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/chinese-culture/article/3334343/trump-insiders-mar-lago-faces-echo-chinese-elites-unhealthy-efforts-please-king?module=opinion&pgtype=homepage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/27/41faf735-182e-49b4-befb-f0382a10b6cb_18b2dba1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:15:11","author":"Wee Kek Koon","authors":["Wee Kek Koon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.324},{"id":383237626,"title":"Reflections | Trump insiders’ ‘Mar-a-Lago faces’ echo Chinese elites’ unhealthy efforts to please a king","text":"The “Mar-a-Lago face” has become the newest unofficial badge of power in Washington.\nThe look typically features inflated lips, immobile brows and sharply sculpted contours.

For these right-wing elites, sporting the Mar-a-Lago face becomes the most visible gesture of personal loyalty to Trump and cultural alignment with the Maga cause.\nThe same pattern of behaviour appears throughout China’s history, as it surely does in the histories of many other nations.\nFew anecdotes illustrate this more clearly than the well-known story of King Ling of Chu, who reigned from 540BC to 529BC and who preferred his officials to be thin-waisted. Versions of this tale appear in many early sources, but the Annals of the Warring States and the ancient philosophical text Mozi preserve the most detailed accounts.\nIn the Annals, King Wei of Chu (who reigned from 339BC to 329BC) remarks on the absence of great ministers in his own time. His senior official, Zihua, responds by recalling the case of King Ling, whose preference for slender-waisted officials unleashed an unhealthy fad.\nThe reason for King Ling’s predilection is unknown, but it was probably tied to his distaste for corpulence and its unmerited association with sloth.\nTo win royal approval, the king’s officials reduced themselves to a single meal a day in pursuit of a tiny waist. Many became so weak that they needed to support themselves against walls simply to stand.\nAlthough they longed to have proper, filling meals, they suppressed their desires so that they could achieve the physique their king admired. Some, the text suggests, were willing to risk their lives doing so.\n\nZihua’s point to King Wei was clear. A ruler’s personal tastes, even when trivial, can shape the conduct of an entire elite. If a king prizes ministers with real abilities over those possessing certain physical attributes, he will not find it difficult to attract talented people.\nMozi retells the episode and pairs it with another example to highlight the same principle.\nDuke Wen of the state of Jin (671BC-628BC) preferred attendants who dressed plainly, and so his officials appeared in sheepskin coats, cowhide belts and undyed silk caps.\nKing Ling’s taste for narrow waists produced a court so underfed that the faces of its denizens were green with hunger. The moral of the stories in Mozi is simple: people respond to what a ruler likes, especially if they have something to gain.\nAcross cultures and centuries, elites routinely remodel themselves, literally and figuratively, to match the preferences of those in power. Whether in ancient China or present-day Washington, personal taste at the top, however unreasonable, bizarre or even harmful, continues to reshape appearances, priorities and the behaviour of those seeking favour.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/chinese-culture/article/3334343/trump-insiders-mar-lago-faces-echo-chinese-elites-unhealthy-efforts-please-king?module=latest&pgtype=homepage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/27/41faf735-182e-49b4-befb-f0382a10b6cb_18b2dba1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:15:11","author":"Wee Kek Koon","authors":["Wee Kek Koon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"hk","sentiment":0.324},{"id":383238336,"title":"Trump advisor ought to face 'espionage and treason' charges: ex-GOP strategist","text":"A former Republican strategist suggested Friday that a top advisor for President Donald Trump ought to face prosecution for spying and treason.\n\nSteve Witkoff serves as a peace envoy for negotiations related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump asserted that documents bearing an autopen signature were invalid unless Biden personally signed them, claiming without evidence that aides used the device to bypass a mentally declining president. He said roughly 92% of Biden’s executive actions fell into that category and warned that if Biden insisted he approved them, he could face perjury charges, even though Biden has not testified under oath about the matter. Biden has rejected the autopen allegations in the past. He said publicly in June that he made all decisions on pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations, calling suggestions otherwise false. His camp did not immediately respond to Trump’s latest statement. Autopens, which replicate a person’s signature, have been used for decades in the White House by presidents of both parties, including Trump. Barack Obama was the first to sign legislation via autopen while overseas, and Biden used the tool while traveling to avoid delays in time-sensitive measures. There is no public accounting of how often Biden relied on it, but its use has been routine for presidents managing heavy document flows. The larger legal question is whether a president can invalidate a predecessor’s actions solely because an autopen was used. A Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion from the George W. Bush era concluded that the president does not need to physically sign a bill for it to become law, as long as he directs that his signature be affixed. Legal analysts say that principle has generally been understood to cover other presidential documents as well. Trump’s claim therefore appears to rest on proving a lack of authorization, not the mere presence of an autopen signature. Republicans in Congress and conservative advocacy groups have pressed the autopen issue for months, arguing that some Biden-era directives were not properly approved. A recent House Republican push called for a Justice Department investigation, though no direct evidence has been made public showing that staff acted without Biden’s consent. Trump has already moved to reverse several Biden executive orders through standard executive authority. His new autopen rationale could widen the fight into courts and Congress, while further entrenching the political narrative he is building about the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/rkmhy3p1111x","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/28/HyjolYPZbg/HyjolYPZbg_0_0_850_479_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:09:10","author":"Ynet","authors":["Ynet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.529},{"id":383232834,"title":"Trump administration officially instructs a pause on all asylum decisions after National Guard 'terror attack'","text":"The Trump administration ordered a nationwide pause on asylum decisions after two National Guard members were shot this week in Washington, DC.\n\nThe order was handed down to officers with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Friday, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News.\n\nThis is the latest effort by President Donald Trump to clamp down on immigrants coming to the United States, this time spurred on by Wednesday's attack, which was allegedly perpetrated by a 29-year-old Afghan immigrant.\n\nUSCIS asylum officers will now refrain from approving, denying or closing asylum applications that are received. \n\nAfter CBS News reported on the new policy stance, the State Department added that immigration from Afghanistan specifically will receive extra scrutiny.\n\n'The Department of State has IMMEDIATELY paused visa issuance for individuals traveling on Afghan passports.

The IDF says it has struck the organization’s sites in Syria and Lebanon repeatedly during the current war.\n\nChannel 12 political correspondent Amit Segal noted Friday that the incident marks the first time since December 2024 — when Israeli forces took control of the Syrian side of Mount Hermon — that Israeli troops were wounded in a Syrian firefight.\n\nSegal wrote: “Could Syria become the IDF’s new Lebanon? … With six soldiers wounded overnight, the big question is whether this is a one-off event, or if it signals the beginning of a long, uncomfortable Israeli presence in Syria.”\n\nTensions between Syrian interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have intensified since Sharaa’s unprecedented visit to Washington earlier this month. Sharaa met President Donald Trump at the White House for discussions on sanctions relief and counterterrorism coordination, making him the first Syrian leader to visit Washington since the Syrian war began.\n\nNetanyahu publicly criticized the visit the same day, saying Sharaa “returned inflated with a sense of international legitimacy,” and warning that any U.S.-Syria discussions must “not come at Israel’s expense.”\n\nAdditional reporting in the Jerusalem Post and Channel 12 noted that security arrangements affecting Israel’s northern front were discussed in broad terms between U.S. and Syrian officials, though no agreements were reached, and Washington stressed that consultations with Israel were ongoing.\n\nFriday’s clash came the same week the Trump administration launched a sweeping effort to designate Muslim Brotherhood affiliates as terrorist organizations. The White House directive instructs federal agencies to evaluate and sanction Brotherhood entities in countries including Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, citing global financial, political and operational ties among affiliates.\n\nThe White House statement said the Brotherhood “fuels terrorism and destabilization campaigns against U.S. interests and allies.”\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, praised the move on his podcast Verdict, telling co-host Ben Ferguson that the designation marks the culmination of a decade of legislative efforts. Cruz said “This is literally 10 years of hard work, and it will make America safer because the Muslim Brotherhood is funding terrorists that want to murder you and want to murder me.”\n\nHe noted that many U.S. allies in the Middle East — including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE — have already outlawed the organization, telling listeners: “They really want the United States to do what President Trump did this week.”\n\nAs Washington intensifies pressure on Brotherhood-linked movements, Israel is increasingly confronting Brotherhood-affiliated armed groups across the northern arena — from Hamas in Gaza to al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nWith Beit Jann emerging as a focal point for cross-border operations, and American policy tightening, analysts say the regional confrontations involving Brotherhood-connected groups may be entering a new phase.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIDF battles terrorists in Syria raid Footage from a body-camera captures a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Israel Unveils Body-Cam Footage of Strategic Syria Operation Against Muslim Brotherhood-Linked Militants first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/israel-unveils-body-cam-footage-of-strategic-syria-operation-against-muslim-brotherhood-linked-militants/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Israel-releases-body-cam-video-of-deadly-Syria-raid-targeting-Muslim.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:05:13","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":383237454,"title":"Republican to Oppose Trump&#039;s Redistricting Due to &#039;Derogatory&#039; Remark","text":"Indiana state Senator Michael Bohacek, a Republican, said on Friday that he will vote against a redistricting plan supported by President Donald Trump, citing his “insulting and derogatory references” after he called Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, “seriously retarded” in a Truth Social post.\n\nWhy It Matters \n\nEarlier this month, Trump criticized two Indiana Republican lawmakers in a post on Truth Social after the state Senate declined to move forward with a redistricting plan that the president said could have delivered two additional congressional seats to the Republican Party amid next year’s midterm elections.\n\nRedistricting efforts have played a significant role in political control at the state and national levels, with recent moves in Democratic-led states like California which saw voters pass a redistricting ballot measure, while some Republican-led efforts have faced internal disputes and legal challenges.\n\nWhat To Know \n\nIn a Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump called Walz “seriously retarded,” a term widely regarded as derogatory toward people with intellectual disabilities, after the president wrote that “hundreds of thousands” of Somali refugees were “taking over” Minnesota and suggested Somali gangs were “roving the streets.”\n\nThe governor then responded by calling for the release of Trump’s recent MRI results, drawing renewed attention to questions surrounding the 79-year-old commander-in-chief’s health.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month that Trump received an MRI in October “as part of his routine physical examination.” \n\n“The full results were reviewed by attending radiologists and consultant and all agreed that President Trump remains in exceptional physical health,” she said. \n\nAfter Trump’s Truth Social post about Walz, Bohacek wrote on Friday that he has been an “unapologetic advocate” for people with intellectual disabilities since the birth of his second daughter who has Down syndrome. \n\n“This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences,” Bohacek said. “I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority.”\n\nEarlier this month, Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said in a statement that the Senate will not reconvene in December and there were “not enough votes” to move forward with drawing the state’s congressional maps. \n\nHowever, Bray said in a Tuesday statement that “the issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state,” adding that “to resolve this issue, the Senate intends to reconvene as part of the regular 2026 session on Dec. 8 and make a final decision that week on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”\n\nTrump then reacted on Truth Social and wrote that he was “glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes.” However, he added that if the measure does not obtain enough votes, he will partner with “incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” \n\nPresident Donald Trump pauses while speaking with reporters while in flight on Air Force One from Joint Base Andrews to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 25.\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday, in part: “It looks like the Indiana Senate Republicans will be coming back in two weeks to take up Redistricting, a very important initiative to balance out the Democrats’ endless ‘Sue to Blue’ and Census rigging strategy that has stolen seats from Republicans, and given them to Democrats who would not have them if they played fairly…Republicans must do what is necessary to stop the destruction of our Country by these people who hate America, and are so ungrateful for the opportunities our Nation has given them. Our Country and Democracy is special, and we must do everything we possibly can to defend it from the Far Left infiltrators who want to destroy it. I am glad to hear the Indiana House is stepping up to do the right thing, and I hope the Senate finds the Votes. If they do, I will make sure that all of those people supporting me win their Primaries, and go on to Greatness but, if they don’t, I will partner with the incredibly powerful MAGA Grassroots Republicans to elect STRONG Republicans who are ready to do what is needed to protect our Country and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Braun, a Republican, wrote on X on November 14: “I called for...","summary":"A Republican Indiana state senator said on Friday he will vote against a redistricting plan supported by the president.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-to-oppose-trumps-redistricting-due-to-derogatory-remark-11127971","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25330049171845.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:02:37","author":"Jenna Sundel","authors":["Jenna Sundel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":383240764,"title":"Letters: We must keep pressure on lawless ICE agents","text":"Keep pressure on\nlawless ICE agents\n\nMany of us are sickened by the ongoing inhumane treatment of immigrants and others by ICE.\n\nEvery day, there are headlines about ICE’s violent treatment of innocent people. Anyone who still believes these assaults are directed toward criminals is choosing to remain ignorant. There’s overwhelming evidence that ICE routinely detains people solely due to the color of their skin, and without warrants. The trauma and destruction caused by these unconstitutional detainments include deaths, sexual abuse and neglect in ICE custody; denial of due process rights; the disappearances of hundreds after the closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’; and assaults on peaceful protesters.\n\nAs a Catholic, I note that Pope Leo XIV stated that being “pro-life” should include opposition to the inhumane treatment of immigrants. The pope called for reflection on the treatment of detained migrants. It’s imperative that people of goodwill do everything we can to stop ICE’s aggressive and criminal behavior.\n\nLaura Murray\n\nSJ must make sure\nprogress includes all\n\nAs an African American student at Evergreen Valley College, I see our community’s future being priced out.\n\nMany of us, especially from Black and Brown neighborhoods, are watching our families get squeezed by rising rents while new tech jobs pour in.

Let’s make sure progress includes everyone.\n\nDemari Agbulos\n\nDOJ won’t prosecute\nMAGA lawbreakers\n\nRe: “Justice demands prosecuting fake electors” (Page A7, Nov. 21).\n\nIn his column, Mark Barabak quotes Derek Muller, a Notre Dame law professor (and a long-time member of the Federalist Society, the judicial arm of the anti-democracy MAGA movement).\n\nRegarding fake electors, Muller suggests that “the ballot box — rather than a courtroom — may be the better venue to litigate the matter.”\n\nApparently, Muller attended the “Alice In Wonderland Law School” where he undoubtedly received an A+ in circular logic.\n\nIt is against the law to overturn the outcome of a presidential election; it is idiotic to say that when a bunch of MAGA criminals break election laws, we should rely on another election (in which MAGA operatives are hard at work illegally suppressing the votes of millions of likely Democratic voters), instead of prosecuting MAGA criminals to the full extent of the law.\n\nNo wonder people distrust lawyers — especially when they promote excusing law-breaking instead of prosecuting the lawbreakers.\n\nBill Charleston\n\nVictory more important\nthan female president\n\nRe: “How long until we elect a female president” (Page A7, Nov. 20).\n\nA half-page column in the Mercury News asks, “How long until we elect a female president?” The author finds it “kind of depressing” that this January, the country will have reached “the historic moment when 28% of its governors are female.” I’m old enough to be impressed, not depressed, by this statistic.\n\nMore importantly, I implore Democrats to focus on the much more important goal of defeating the Republicans in 2028. In both 2016 and 2024, we elected Donald Trump over much more experienced women, who believed in the rule of law and our democracy. While I volunteered for the Kamala Harris campaign in 2024, our country is simply not yet ready for a woman leader, as more enlightened countries such as India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel and Great Britain have shown themselves to be.\n\nGiven the apparent misogynistic nature of the American voters, let’s not repeat the mistakes of 2016 and 2024.\n\nUkraine peace plan\nfavors the invaders\n\nRe: “Trump offers a Ukraine peace plan Kremlin can love” (Page A4, Nov. 23).\n\nThe word is that Russia is in on a full war production level and showing it by an atmospheric rain of drones on civilian and energy targets. I have never understood the timid arms policy that forbids Ukraine from having weapons with mileage into Russia. Vladimir Putin understands force only. Is Donald Trump so dazzled by the vision of a Nobel Peace Prize that the art of the deal and the cards Trump holds created this outrageous peace plan?\n\nThis is worse than the Munich Deal that led to WWII. To give up even more land on its Black Sea ports, considering Russia’s efforts to blockade grain shipments, would be disastrous. To limit its army to 600,000, forbid NATO membership, and not allow long-range weapons is another gift to dictator Putin, who feeds on such rewards, like Crimea he took in 2014.\n\nIt’s time for Congress to wake up.\n\nDavid Eisbach","summary":"Also: Include all &#124; Prosecute lawbreakers &#124; Put victory first &#124; Favoring Putin.

Back then, he was just finding his feet, figuring out where and who to push and just how much he could get away with. \n\nHe could never have anticipated, lo those many years ago, that he would lead an insurrection, steal government documents, be convicted of 34 felonies, and be found liable for sexual abuse. Yet thanks to Chief Justice John Roberts giving him sweet, sweet blanket immunity, Trump has returned to office tanned, rested, and ready to commit some much bigger crimes. \n\nLet’s look back on how our bribe-fueled tyrant started out. \n\nWho could forget the ridiculous stack of obviously completely blank papers? You recall the ones where Trump pretended he was going to divest all of his business interests, and somehow that required a giant stack of manila folders too: “After the news conference concluded, transition staffers blocked reporters from looking at them. And some photos of the news conference show folders without labels and, in some cases, seemingly blank pages inside.” You don’t say. \n\nHow about the totally fake blind trust? At the start of 2017, we heard all about how Trump had placed everything in a trust controlled by his large vicious adult sons and therefore, per whatever lawyer Trump had as a mouthpiece back then, he was “completely isolating himself from his business interests.” \n\nIt only took until April of that year before someone had to confirm to ProPublica that Trump could withdraw profits and assets from that trust any time he wanted. So blind, much ethics. \n\nGod, and there was the tacky hotel in Washington, D.C.! During Trump’s first term, somehow every foreign leader and domestic GOP politico were all completely compelled to stay there, definitely because it was objectively the best place to stay and not at all because it was a discreet way to shower cash on the sitting president. \n\nOnce Trump was out of office and sold the thing, everyone suddenly found they didn’t want to stay there any longer. To be fair, Trump began to make it much easier just to give him money directly, thanks to his crypto grifting, so who needs a stupid hotel?\n\nSpeaking of hotels, how about that Secret Service scam where Trump stayed for free at properties he owns but charged his protection detail a hilariously inflated rate to stay there with him? Since the detail obviously had to be where Trump was, it was an ongoing chance to line his pockets. By the end of Trump’s first term, the Secret Service had paid $1.75 million to various Trump properties.\n\nAs the House Democrats noted, he treated the Secret Service as his own personal ATM. Agents paid $1,185 per night for a room in that tacky D.C. hotel, even though the per diem at the time was $201.\n\nHe’s probably keeping that one going into this term, even though it is remarkably small potatoes compared to what he can do now. But why pass up an opportunity to fleece the American people, no matter how minor?\n\nEight years ago, it seemed like quite the scandal that somehow the Trump family was able to get some very speedy trademarks in China. Yes, the Trump companies kept doing business in China during his first term—you know, all those companies that Trump only pretend-divested from? \n\nThe Chinese government approved 38 Trump trademarks in an “unusually quick” fashion. Do you really need to be told that all of these were just English and Chinese variations on Trump’s name? Keeping it all in the family, China also fast-tracked dozens of trademarks for his daughter Ivanka in 2017 and 2018 as well. \n\nSince Trump has graduated to grifts that are much larger and much more openly like bribes—free plane, anyone?—his first-term habit of having foreign leaders buy his overpriced subpar real estate offerings is no longer necessary. But back in the day, you could get in good with Trump just by becoming a tenant in Trump Tower. That’s why the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which China owns, and the Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority became tenants. \n\nGotta show the king some fealty, gotta let him know you’ll always tithe. Too bad for all these folks that the price of bribing Trump just keeps going up and up.","summary":"As we watch President Donald Trump use his second term to grift like never before, it’s tough to remember that when Trump took office in January 2017, his attempts to leverage the presidency to line his pockets were positively quaint compared to now.

His statements echo those of former US consulate officer Mahvash Siddiqui, who said most working visas issued during her Chennai posting were fraudulent. The allegations, emerging amid policy tightening under Donald Trump, have sparked diplomatic unease. India’s tech sector, heavily dependent on H-1B visas, is watching developments closely as the controversy threatens to reshape future immigration policies.\n\n 5.4K views | 2 days ago","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/international/moscow-accuses-nato-of-fabricating-russia-fear-to-justify-massive-military-buildup-in-europe/videoshow/125646192.cms","image":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-125646192/125646192.jpg?resizemode=4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-29 00:00:00","author":"Timesofindia.com","authors":["Timesofindia.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":383232830,"title":"Trump announces termination of Biden's orders signed using autopen","text":"Washington, DC [US], November 29 (ANI): US president Donald Trump on Friday (local time) said that documents signed by former Democratic president Joe Biden using an autopen stand terminated. He claimed that the majority of Biden's orders were signed with an autopen, a machine that produces a copy of a given signature.\n\n'Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92% of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect. The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,' Trump posted on 'Truth Social'.\n\nAnnouncing the cancellation of all executive orders and 'anything else' that was not directly signed by Biden, Trump reiterated his claims that people had illegally operated the autopen. The Republican leader threatened to prosecute Biden on 'charges of perjury' if the latter claimed that staff was acting under his direction.\n\n'The Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him. I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally. Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury,' the US president said.\n\nTrump has time and again claimed that Biden was unable to control the executive office, given his age and mental state. He has repeatedly criticised Biden for using an autopen during his presidency. \n\nWhile the practice has been routine in the White House, Trump has claimed that Biden's reliance on the device shows he was not in control of his presidency. He had earlier claimed that Biden aides made several decisions without his knowledge.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump said that he would permanently pause migration from all 'third-world countries' to allow the US system to terminate illegal admissions into the United States.\n\nThis comes in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard service members in Washington, DC, on Wednesday by an Afghan national, which resulted in the death of one National Guard member and left the other critically injured.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said, 'I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquillity, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.'

He was granted asylum under Trump.\n\nIn a call on Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday with U.S. military service members, Trump said the shootings were a \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nSarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Her National Guard colleague, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was in critical condition, Pirro said on Friday. The two were in Washington as part of Trump's deployment of the military in recent months to help the police fight crime in the city. \n\nOn Friday morning, following the national holiday, notably fewer National Guard members were seen patrolling the capital.\n\nTRUMP RATCHETS UP RHETORIC ON IMMIGRATION\n\nTrump, whose dispatch of troops to Washington faces fierce legal challenges, took to social media late on Thursday to escalate his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year, he has stepped up arrests of immigrants, including some in the U.S. legally, and cracked down on unlawful border crossings while stripping legal status from hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,\" Trump said in his social media posts, referring to his predecessor in the White House.\n\nTrump did not say which countries he considers \"Third World,\" nor what he meant by a permanent pause. It echoed the sweeping \"Muslim ban\" Trump tried to enact in his first term before it was diluted by successful legal challenges.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted again on social media to say he was rescinding any document that Biden signed using an autopen, a tool that U.S. presidents, including Trump, have used for decades, often to answer mail or sign checks, or sometimes to meet authorization deadlines while traveling outside the capital. \n\nAfter taking office in 2021, Biden reversed many of the restrictive immigration policies of Trump's first term, saying they blocked people in need of humanitarian protection and were discriminatory.\n\nAsked about Trump's comment on \"Third World\" countries, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred Reuters to 19 countries listed in a June travel ban.\n\nOn Thursday, Homeland Security officials said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the Biden administration and permanent-residency green cards issued to citizens of the 19 countries, which include Afghanistan.\n\nJorge Loweree, the managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, said the president does not have authority through executive action to make permanent changes to the immigration system, which is codified by Congress. He warned of chaos and disarray in the U.S. immigration system even if Trump is ultimately blocked by federal courts.\n\nSHOOTING PROMPTS SWEEPING IMMIGRATION REVIEWS\n\nLakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Biden's Operation Allies Welcome. More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under the program for those fearing reprisal by the Taliban forces, who seized control of Afghanistan after the U.S. military's withdrawal. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. \n\nHe was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.\n\nInvestigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops.\n\nLess than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday he would be proposing regulations to ensure that people he referred to as \"illegal aliens\" do not receive certain credits on income tax they have paid. The tax code is set by Congress, which already limits what kind of benefits, if any, non-citizens are eligible to seek.\n\nLakanwal lives in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect's family, Trump said: \"We're looking at the whole situation with family.\"\n\nINTERNATIONAL GROUPS DEFEND ASYLUM SEEKER RIGHTS\n\nUnited Nations agencies urged the U.S. on Friday night to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country, including due process rights, in keeping with international law.\n\n\"We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,\" said Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general.\n\nJasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration at the Lebanese American University, said freezing Afghan applications or reconsidering thousands of approved asylum claims would disrupt families and local communities.\n\n\"While the recent incident is tragic, using an isolated incident to justify mass restrictions is inconsistent with evidence showing no link between refugee arrivals and increased crime,\" Diab said in an interview.

Wolfe remains fighting for his life as of Friday.\n\nThe soldiers were ambushed on Wednesday while on patrol as part of President Donald Trump's ongoing effort to clean up the streets of DC.\n\nAfghan soldier Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was named as the alleged gunman in the horror shoot-out. He entered the US in 2021 under Joe Biden's administration. \n\nHe allegedly fired at the National Guard soldiers just 800 yards from the White House and only stopped when a National Guard member intervened by shooting back. \n\nFollowing the heinous shooting, security efforts have been ramped up across the US capital. \n\n'Law enforcement agencies across Washington, DC, including the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), are working in close coordination with the National Guard to ensure the safety of our community,' an MPD spokesperson told The Hill on Friday.\n\n'As we enter the holiday season, we encourage everyone to remain vigilant.' \n\nTrump declared that he will 'permanently pause migration' from third-world countries and ordered a green card audit of 19 nations in response to the attack.\n\nHe also vowed to end all federal benefits for noncitizens, denaturalize migrants who undermine the US, and deport any foreign nationals deemed a security risk or 'non-compatible with Western Civilization.'\n\n'I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover,' he wrote on Truth Social on Thursday night. \n\n'Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for - You won’t be here for long!'\n\nThe Trump administration has blamed Wednesday's shooting on Biden's lax immigration policies. \n\n'He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021, on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about. Nobody knew who was coming in,' Trump said of Lakanwal. \n\n'His status was extended under legislation signed by President Biden, a disastrous president, the worst in our history.'\n\nLate on Wednesday night, CIA Director John Ratcliffe told Fox News that Lakanwal had direct links to the CIA from his work alongside US Special Forces in Afghanistan.\n\n'The Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the US government, including CIA,' Ratcliffe admitted.\n\nHe said his involvement with the CIA was 'as a member of a partner force in Kandahar, which ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation.'\n\nLakanwal was part of the elite paramilitary outfit that engaged in combat with the Taliban during the war in Afghanistan, often referred to as a 'death squad.' \n\nLike President Trump, Ratcliffe slammed the former administration's 'disastrous' actions during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which allowed unvetted foreigners to enter the US on temporary visas.\n\n'The individual - and so many others - should have never been allowed to come here,' Ratcliffe said.\n\n'Our citizens and service members deserve far better than to endure the ongoing fallout from the Biden administration's catastrophic failures.'\n\nTrump broke the heartbreaking news of Beckstrom's death on Thursday night. \n\n'Just seconds before I went on, right now, I heard that Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we were talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... outstanding in every way, she's just passed away,' he said.\n\n'She's no longer with us. She's looking down on us right now. Her parents are with her. It's just happened. She was savagely attacked, she's dead.'\n\nLakanwal is facing first-degree murder and related charges, federal prosecutors announced. \n\nHe is in custody while hospitalized for the non-life-threatening wounds he allegedly sustained in the shootout.","summary":"The dramatic picture depicted officers running to the aid of Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, 24, as they lay unconscious on the ground.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15336353/terror-attack-washington-dc-picture-national-guard.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/28/22/104283273-0-image-m-12_1764370245792.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/27/4514660270682259423/1024x576_MP4_4514660270682259423.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-28 23:51:21","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.272}]}
