This is a rupture,\" he said. \"This is a sharp change in a short period of time, driven by a variety of factors. We have a determination to rise up and meet this.\"\n\nCarney said Canada's response is to \"build strength at home,\" diversify abroad and pursue \"a variable geography to defend our values and pursue our interests.\" The prime minister cited his government's work in promoting interprovincial trade, boosting defence spending and diversifying its trading and security partnerships, including with the European Union.\n\nCarney presented Canada as a trustworthy trading partner with connections to every major market.\n\nAfter marking his remarks, Carney spoke one-on-one with Michael Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nThe wide-ranging conservation — which began with a joke from Froman about whether Carney was able to get into the U.S. with a Canadian passport — touched on trade, Canada's support for Ukraine and the government's recent move to recognize Palestinian statehood.\n\nOn Sunday, the United Kingdom, Australia and Portugal joined Canada in recognizing an independent Palestinian state before world leaders arrived in New York City for this week's 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nCarney said Monday the move to recognize Palestinian statehood is consistent with Canada's longtime policy of supporting a two-state solution. He said Canada and other countries are actively trying to create conditions for a ceasefire and a peace process.\n\n\"It's necessary in our judgment, and the judgment of most other countries in the world, that we have to push on this now,\" he said.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron announced France would also recognize Palestinian statehood during a high-profile meeting at the general assembly Monday. Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco also announced or confirmed their recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nGermany, Italy and Japan took part in the meeting but did not recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nIn an address during the meeting on a two-state solution in the UN General Assembly hall, Carney said the Israeli government is \"working methodically to prevent the prospect of a Palestinian state from ever being established.\"\n\nHe also said Hamas has \"stolen from the Palestinian people, chased them and cheated them from their life and liberty, and it can in no way dictate their future.\"\n\n\"In this context, Canada recognizes the State of Palestine and we offer our full partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,\" he added.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \"statehood for the Palestinians is a right, not a reward.\" That appeared to push back against the Israeli government and the Trump administration, who have both said that recognizing statehood rewards Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack set off the war in Gaza two years ago.\n\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt said U.S. President Donald Trump disagrees with the move from some of America's closest allies. During a press briefing in Washington Monday, Leavitt said Trump \"feels this does not do anything to release the hostages – which is the primary goal right now in Gaza.\"\n\n\"It does nothing to end this conflict and bring this war to a close,\" she said. \"And frankly he believes it’s a reward to Hamas.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Anita Anand, who is in New York this week, told CTV Monday that she is in contact \"weekly\" with her Palestinian counterpart.\n\nDiscussing the pressures on Canada's economy stemming from policy decisions made in Washington, Carney told the Council on Foreign Relations audience that Canadians understand the need to be \"masters in our own house.\"\n\n\"The country does not want to wake up and look on, with all due respect, on Truth Social or X to see what the latest change is in U.S. policy, but wants to get on with what we can control,\" he said. \"And that's a big part of the government's strategy.\"\n\nCarney suggested that the trade tensions with the United States have created a \"strong consensus\" in Canada on the need to develop new trading arrangements and boost defence spending.\n\n\"We needed the rupture, we needed the shock, it seems,\" he said.\n\n\"Candidly, we've been done a favour because all of these things we could have done before ourselves. There is a very strong consensus in the country to do that.\"\n\nCarney said Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are in the early stages of developing a \"very attractive\" version of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on trade.\n\nCarney later Monday met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an and Kenyan President William Ruto.","summary":"Prime Minister Mark Carney pitched Canada as a reliable trading partner that &quot;has what the world wants&quot; before an international audience Monday in New York City.\n\nAddressing the Council on Foreign Relations think tank before attending the UN General Assembly, Carney said Canada has the r...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/573759/Carney-says-Canada-has-what-the-world-wants-at-a-critical-time","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/9/415d4ad71bea5f31f0486e6d2e5c7910139f4e938479cbcdba3ef4acde225d65.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 00:41:00","author":"Kelly Geraldine Malone","authors":["Kelly Geraldine Malone"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.221},{"id":362661362,"title":"‘True to the historic commitment’: France recognises Palestinian state at UN","text":"France formally recognised the state of Palestine on Monday, marking a significant diplomatic step at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where world leaders gathered to press for a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. The announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron drew loud applause from more than 140 leaders present, with the Palestinian delegation, including its UN ambassador Riyad Mansour, standing to cheer, according to news agency AP.“True to the historic commitment of my country to the Middle East, to peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, this is why I declare that today, France recognises the state of Palestine,” Macron said. He later told delegates that recognition was “the only path to a peaceful future for Israel,” adding that it meant acknowledging “legitimacy, humanity, and dignity”, as per New York Times.France was joined by Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Monaco, who also announced or confirmed their recognition, following similar declarations a day earlier from the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal. However, Germany, Italy and Japan stopped short of recognition, though they participated in the discussions.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, addressing the assembly by video after the US revoked his visa, condemned the “killing and detention of civilians, including Hamas’ actions on Oct. 7, 2023,” and urged an end to “violence and war.” He confirmed the Palestinian Authority had abolished payments to families of militants killed or jailed by Israel, a demand long pressed by Israel and the US. “What we want is a state with one law and one legitimate security force,” he added, pledging that Hamas would have no role in a reformed Palestinian Authority.UN Secretary-General António Guterres insisted Palestinian statehood was “a right, not a reward,” warning that without two states “there will be no peace in the Middle East, and radicalism will spread around”.Israel, however, had strongly opposed the move. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said recognition of Palestinian statehood amounted to “an absurd reward for terrorism,” vowing to fight such efforts “both at the UN and in all other arenas”. Netanyahu also hinted at unilateral steps, including potential annexation of West Bank territory, a move his far-right coalition has pushed. The UAE, a key broker of the Abraham Accords, has warned annexation would cross a “red line”.The United States also criticised the recognition drive, with President Donald Trump’s administration blaming it for derailing ceasefire talks with Hamas. Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, walked away from negotiations in July, while an Israeli strike this month targeted Hamas negotiators in Qatar, one of the mediators.Although recognition of Palestinian statehood will not immediately alter realities on the ground, where Israel continues its Gaza offensive and settlement expansion in the West Bank, diplomats argue it reflects a widening global consensus. “It does underline that there is still some potential pathway to a diplomatic solution for the Palestinians, even if everyone recognises that it is an extremely long pathway,” said Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group, as quoted by The New York Times.Around three-quarters of UN member states already recognise Palestine. A “New York Declaration” backed overwhelmingly in the General Assembly earlier this month by 142-10 votes, co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, set out “tangible, time-bound and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution, condemning both Hamas’ October 7 attacks and Israel’s assaults on civilians in Gaza.Still, the war grinds on. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 34 people, including children, on Sunday night, according to Gaza health officials. For many Palestinians fleeing the devastation, international recognition offers little immediate relief but some hope. “This is a beginning, or a glimmer of hope, for the Palestinian people,” said Fawzi Nour al-Deen, escaping Gaza City with his family, as per AP.","summary":"France formally recognised the state of Palestine at the UN General Assembly, joined by several other nations, as world leaders pushed for a two-state solution. Despite opposition from Israel and criticism from the US, the move reflects a growing global consensus, offering a glimmer of hope amid ongoing conflict and devastation in Gaza.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/true-to-the-historic-commitment-france-recognises-palestinian-state-at-un-macron-links-step-to-peaceful-future-for-israel/articleshow/124058803.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-124058812/124058812.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 00:34:25","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.335},{"id":362658640,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel's comeback is derailed as major ABC affiliate refuses to air show after MAGA erupts at Disney","text":"Jimmy Kimmel's comeback to late night has been dealt a massive blow with ABC affiliates refusing to air it in nearly 40 major markets after Disney announced the liberal talk host will return Tuesday.\n\nSinclair Inc., whose local stations pay to run ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, is standing by its policy from last week that it would keep the show off the air indefinitely, though the two sides were in talks. \n\n'Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,' the company said. \n\nThe biggest affiliate Sinclair owns is WJLA in Washington, meaning Donald Trump and the nation's other major power players who have watched on with interest in this saga won't be able to watch. \n\nSinclair had previously said it will refuse to lift the suspension of Kimmel's show on its stations 'until formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability.' \n\nThe broadcaster also called on Kimmel to issue a 'direct apology to the Kirk family' and to make a 'meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA.' TPUSA is a conservative college campus group founded by Kirk, with Kimmel a well-known liberal. \n\n'Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country,' Sinclair Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in the announcement. \n\n'We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities.' \n\nJimmy Kimmel Live! will be back on the air on Tuesday night, less than a week after his suspension for controversial comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\nIn a statement, ABC parent company Disney said it would 'return the show on Tuesday'.\n\nKimmel had been suspended since Wednesday, after the host said that 'the MAGA gang' was attempting to portray the suspect in Kirk's assassination 'as anything other than one of them'.\n\n'Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,' Disney's statement said.\n\n'It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. \n\n'We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.'\n\nNo further details were provided.\n\nKimmel's controversial comments occurred on his show last Monday.\n\n'We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it,' he said.\n\n'In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving on Friday. The White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this.'\n\nKimmel then played a clip of Trump responding to a question about how he was coping with Kirk's death, before poking fun at the president's mourning process.\n\nHe was reprimanded just two days later for his comments by FCC boss Brendan Carr. \n\nCarr told conservative podcaster Benny Johnson he was considering an investigation into Kimmel and ABC over his remarks on Wednesday.\n\nWithin hours, more than a dozen ABC affiliates told the network and Disney it would not be airing Kimmel's show until the remarks were addressed.\n\nDisney and senior ABC execs then made the call to pull Kimmel's show 'indefinitely'.\n\nThe two parties had been engaged in talks since, in hopes of finding a way to get the show back on the air.\n\nCarr, during his conversation with Johnson, framed an apology 'as a very reasonable, minimal step that can be taken'.\n\nNo such plans were detailed in Disney's statement Monday. It remains unclear whether Kimmel will address his comments directly. \n\nDisney co-chairman Dana Walden and chief executive Bob Iger made the call to suspend the host over his on-air comments.\n\nSuspect Tyler Robinson, meanwhile, has been charged with capital murder. \n\nProsecutors released a slew of text messages and other evidence that appeared to hint at a motive last week\n\nIn a text to his transgender partner shortly after the murder, Robinson allegedly said of Kirk: 'I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.' \n\nIn another, he discussed how his father 'has been pretty die-hard MAGA' since Trump had been re-elected.\n\nUtah Governor Spencer Cox has said the suspect's ideology 'was very different than his family', and that his motivation was rooted in radicalization. \n\nA New York Times report last week detailed White House plans to crack down on a nondescript left-wing network that Trump has suggested radicalized the suspect in the Kirk case.\n\nTrump has also promised to bring racketeering cases against people funding protests linked to such groups.\n\nThe Daily Mail has contacted ABC for comment.","summary":"Sinclair Inc., whose local stations pay to run ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, is standing by its policy from last week that it would keep the show off the air indefinitely.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15124189/Jimmy-Kimmel-comeback-derailed-major-blow.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/23/00/102362663-0-image-m-14_1758585396314.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/21/2491014589071443693/1024x576_MP4_2491014589071443693.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-23 00:24:20","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor,Stephen M.

Rising Medicare premiums and essential living costs could leave retirees with little extra cash in hand.\n\nThe \"Trump Bump\" refers to a projected Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of about 2.7% for 2026, which is partly attributed to the inflationary effects of tariffs and trade policies implemented during Donald Trump's presidency. Nearly 70 million Social Security beneficiaries in the U.S. are expected to see an average increase of around $54 per month in their Social Security checks starting in January 2026 due to this adjustment.However, there is a significant catch: higher Medicare Part B premiums—which are deducted directly from Social Security checks—are expected to rise by about 11.5% to approximately $206.20 per month in 2026. This increase in premiums will likely offset much or even all of the COLA increase for many beneficiaries, limiting the net financial benefit they actually receive. Additionally, the official COLA figure is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which may not fully capture the actual inflation experienced by retirees, especially in medical and housing costs. Hence, despite the \"Trump Bump,\" many retirees may feel little to no improvement in their purchasing power in 2026.When will the SSA officially announce the 2026 COLAThe Social Security Administration (SSA) will officially announce the 2026 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) on October 15, 2025, after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter (July to September) of 2025. This announcement sets the final COLA percentage that will determine how much Social Security benefits increase starting January 2026 for nearly 70 million beneficiaries.The 2026 COLA is expected to be around 2.7% to 2.8%, with payments reflecting the increase beginning in January 2026, scheduled according to recipients' birth dates. This official announcement date is standard timing based on the SSA’s use of Consumer Price Index data to calculate COLA each year.Live EventsHow will Medicare Part B premiums change in 2026Medicare Part B premiums are projected to increase significantly in 2026. The standard monthly premium is expected to rise from $185 in 2025 to approximately $206.50 in 2026, which represents an 11.6% increase or about a $21.50 monthly hike. This would be the largest single-year jump since 2022.The increase is driven by rising healthcare costs, and this premium is typically deducted directly from Social Security checks for most beneficiaries. The annual deductible for Part B is also projected to increase from $257 in 2025 to about $288 in 2026, a 12% increase.While the 2026 Medicare Part B premium increase is substantial, it is anticipated that for most beneficiaries, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) will cover or exceed this increase, meaning most recipients will still see a net increase in their monthly payments despite the higher premium deductions.Final premium amounts will be officially announced by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the fall of 2025.What households will see net loss after premiums are deductedHouseholds most likely to see a net loss after Medicare Part B premiums are deducted from their Social Security increase are those with the lowest or no income adjustments besides the COLA, particularly:Beneficiaries without significant additional income beyond Social Security benefits, since their premium increases hit their net income directly.Lower- and middle-income retirees for whom the Medicare premium hike of approximately 11.5% (around $21.50 more monthly) offsets or exceeds the average 2.7% COLA increase (around $54/month on average).Single retirees with modest benefits, where the Medicare premium increase consumes a larger share of their COLA increase.Households or individuals who face surcharges on Medicare premiums due to higher income thresholds or additional costs could also experience a net reduction.In essence, while the headline COLA increase provides a gross boost to Social Security, many households with average or lower benefits will see a diminished or no net gain, and some might practically experience a net loss once the higher Part B premiums are deducted. This \"catch\" particularly affects retirees whose medical premiums rise faster than their benefit increases.The exact net effect depends on each household's Social Security benefit amount, taxable status, and premium deductions, but broadly those with limited other income outside Social Security are most vulnerable to a net loss scenario after premiums.Households that will see a net loss after Medicare Part B premiums are deducted are primarily those with modest or lower Social Security benefits, for whom the Medicare premium increase offsets or exceeds their cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) increase. Specifically:Single retirees with average or below-average benefits.Households relying heavily on Social Security as their primary source of income.Beneficiaries who face the standard Medicare Part B premium rise of about 11.5%, approximately $21.50 more per month in 2026, which can consume most or all of the roughly 2.7% COLA increase (around $54 per month on average).Retirees without additional income sources to offset higher premium costs.How is the Social Security COLA calculated each yearThe Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) is calculated each year based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).The process involves comparing the average CPI-W during the third quarter (July to September) of the current year to the average CPI-W during the third quarter of the last year a COLA was determined. If the CPI-W has increased, that percentage increase becomes the COLA, which is then applied to Social Security benefits starting in January of the following year.If there is no increase in the CPI-W, no COLA is applied. The CPI-W reflects price changes in about 80,000 items based on consumer expenditure surveys and retail price checks in various sectors.This method aims to adjust benefits to keep pace with inflation, although it has been criticized for not fully capturing the higher medical and housing costs many older adults face. The official COLA announcement is usually made in mid-October.The 2026 COLA offers a small lift to retirees, but it’s clear the “Trump Bump” won’t dramatically change financial realities. With rising healthcare and living costs, seniors may need to plan carefully, explore supplemental coverage, and budget wisely. Policymakers also face pressure to adjust the COLA methodology to better reflect the cost pressures that older Americans truly face.Essentially, these households experience the \"catch\" of the 2026 \"Trump Bump\": while gross benefits rise, elevated Medicare premiums reduce or eliminate the net income gain, leading some to effectively see no improvement or a slight net loss in their monthly income after premiums are deducted.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onsocial security 2026trump bumpcola increasemedicare part b premiumssocial security raisedisability benefitsretirement securitysocial security news2026 Social Security Trump Bump Impact\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Here, they spent time aboard their friend Steven Spielberg’s extravagant $250 million yacht.\n\nArriving at the yacht separately, Michelle was seen boarding before Barack, who joined her later with a seemingly somber demeanor. However, a source revealed to the Daily Mail that this getaway was just what they required.\n\n“They realized the trip was more necessary than expected,” the insider shared. “It was a wonderful chance for them to unwind and be with each other, and everyone was in good spirits.”\n\nThis vacation served as a crucial time for Michelle and Barack to reconnect amid ongoing gossip about their relationship, though it wasn’t solely about relaxation.\n\nThey claimed that acclaimed director Spielberg used the getaway to pitch a potential new movie that he wants to make about about the couple. \n\nAccording to the insider, “Steven discussed the possibility of a film about the Obamas, with him showing interest in directing and certainly producing it.”\n\n‘But though that was talked about, that was in no reason for the hangout. They are friends first and have had a very nice time together and treated it like a fun double date for a few days.’\n\nIn the end, the source insisted that Barack and Michelle are in a ‘great place,’ and plan to stick together amidst the ‘s**t show’ that’s going on in politics right now.\n\n‘They are interested in being in the world together rather than apart, because the world they live in outside of everything is a s**t show in their eyes, politically speaking,’ they said.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the Obamas for comment.\n\nPhotographers caught a solo Michelle, 61, getting onto Spielberg’s luxurious, 357-foot water vessel via a tender ahead of her husband on Friday. \n\nShe looked fashionable, donning some baggy jeans, a matching denim button-down top, a white tank top underneath, and some brown and white patterned Birkenstock sandals.\n\nSpielberg, 78, greeted her with his arms open wide before he gave her a warm hug.\n\nThe two were then seen sitting outside on his massive boat, called the Seven Seas, chatting happily together, along with a woman who appeared to be his wife, Kate Capshaw. \n\nLater on, Barack, 64, was spotted looking downcast as he arrived in the picturesque Italian seaside village alongside some security; he dressed casually in a brown top and white cap. \n\nThe morning after Barack joined his wife on the yacht, the group enjoyed breakfast outdoors on the boat’s deck, before they headed ashore to Punta Chiappa for lunch.\n\nAt one point, Barack – who wore a black polo shirt – was pictured sitting alone staring intently at what appeared to be a tablet or laptop.\n\nTheir vacation comes days after the former president made a startling marriage confession.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Jefferson Educational Society event in Erie, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, Barack joked that he had spent much of his time since leaving office trying to appease his wife, which he described as ‘challenging.’\n\n‘I have spent over eight years now trying to dig myself out of a hole with Michelle,’ he said. \n\n‘And that’s been challenging, but I feel like I’m making progress. I’m almost breaking even at the moment.’ \n\nThis marks the first time the couple had been seen together since they sat down for an astonishing joint interview on Michelle’s podcast back in July, during which they finally addressed the state of their marriage. \n\n‘What, you guys like each other?’ Michelle’s brother and co-host Craig Robinson joked, before Michelle replied: ‘Oh yeah, the rumor mill.’ \n\n‘She took me back!’ Barack light-heartedly chimed in, adding: ‘It was touch and go for awhile.’ \n\nThe former first lady said it was nice to be in the same room as her husband, sassily telling her brother: ‘When we aren’t, folks think we’re divorced.’ \n\nMichelle then made a heartfelt admission about her relationship with her husband of almost 33 years.\n\n‘There hasn’t been one moment in our marriage where I thought about quitting my man,’ she said passionately.\n\n‘And we’ve had some really hard times. So we had a lot of fun times, a lot of adventures, and I have become a better person because of the man I’m married to.’\n\nBarack admitted he missed a lot of the speculation, and he was largely unaware of what people were saying.\n\n‘These are the kinds of things that I just miss, right? So I don’t even know this stuff’s going on,’ he confessed.\n\n‘And then somebody will mention it to me and I’m all like, ‘what are you talking about?” \n\nThe Obamas have been married for almost 33 years and share daughters, Malia, 26, and Sasha, 24. \n\nRumors surrounding the Obama’s relationship began when Michelle skipped several high-profile events, including Donald Trump’s inauguration and former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor months, rumors have been swirling that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were headed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Inside Look: Barack and Michelle Obama&#8217;s Relationship Following Their Italy Trip first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/inside-look-barack-and-michelle-obamas-relationship-following-their-italy-trip/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Truth-about-Barack-and-Michelle-Obamas-relationship-after-Italy-trip.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-23 00:00:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.223},{"id":362659470,"title":"Rupert Murdoch calls Trump’s US$10B libel lawsuit an ‘affront’ to free speech","text":"Australian businessman Rupert Murdoch was among the guests at a state banquet for U.S. President Donald Trump at Windsor Castle in England on September 17, 2025.

The world leader declared that pregnant women should steer clear of the medication Tylenol unless they're battling an \"extremely high fever\" and also advised parents against administering it to their youngsters. During a press briefing in the Oval Office alongside Robert F Kennedy Jr, Mr Trump declared: \"Fight like hell not to take it\" and implied that expectant mothers \"have a responsibility\" to bear discomfort rather than consume the paracetamol brand. However, Kenvue, the company behind Tylenol, has slammed the President's assertions, maintaining that the medication remains safe for pregnant women. The consumer health giant, which also produces Calpol, Benadryl, Trosyd and other well-known products, stated categorically that no connection exists between Tylenol and autism, reports the Mirror . UK specialists have also raised concerns about Mr Trump's contentious declaration. One researcher has argued that Mr Trump's stance \"risks stigmatising families who have autistic children as having brought it on themselves\". Meanwhile, the NHS website confirms that \"paracetamol is the first choice of painkiller if you're pregnant. It's commonly taken during pregnancy and does not harm your baby\". Kenvue's full statement, given to the Mirror this morning, reads: \"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mum and baby or use riskier alternatives. High fevers and pain are widely recognised as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated. \"Acetaminophen is also one of the most widely studied pain relievers and fever reducers in infants and children, and numerous randomised, controlled clinical trials support the safety of acetaminophen in infants and children when used as directed. \"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. \"We will continue to reinforce that expecting mothers speak to their health professionals before taking any over-the-counter medication and will explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\" Paracetamol - Tylenol's active ingredient - remains the safest pain relief choice for expectant mothers, it added, and without it, women are left with a perilous decision between enduring conditions like fever or turning to riskier options. During the press conference, the President described the increase in autism across the US as \"one of most alarming medical crises in history,\" pointing to a 400-per-cent rise over recent decades. He stated: \"You know it's something artificial. With Tylenol, don't take it. There's not an alternative to that.\" However, studies examining paracetamol - the active component in Tylenol - have produced mixed results, and leading health authorities continue to endorse it for pregnant women. No conclusive evidence exists linking it to foetal brain development issues. Meanwhile, folic acid, also referred to as vitamin B9, is an essential nutrient that aids DNA synthesis and helps replicate and repair cells across the body. Women are already encouraged to take folic acid whilst pregnant to prevent birth defects affecting the foetal brain and spinal cord, but emerging research indicates it might help restore neural pathways in a child's brain long after delivery.

Nexstar and Sinclair, two of ABC’s largest affiliate owners, said they would pull the show from their stations.\n\nBut by Monday, ABC said the show would be back on starting Tuesday.\n\nHere is a look at some of the key disputes Trump has had with media over his second term: \n\n Sept. 22: ABC reinstates Kimmel’s late night show \n\nABC said in a statement that the decision to reinstate the show came after days of “thoughtful conversations\" with Kimmel, who has hosted his show on ABC since 2003.\n\nAndrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, said in a statement on X: “Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmel back on the air is not surprising, but it’s their mistake to make. Nexstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice.”\n\nNexstar and Sinclair did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nWord of Kimmel's return came after hundreds of movie, TV and stage stars as well as comedians, directors and writers added their names to an open letter Monday from the American Civil Liberties Union that says it is “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.”\n\n Sept. 19: Judges tosses Trump's lawsuit against New York Times \n\nA Florida federal judge tossed out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit that Trump filed against The New York Times. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that Trump’s lawsuit was overly long and was full of “tedious and burdensome” language that had no bearing on the legal case.\n\n“A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally,” Merryday wrote in the order. “This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner.”\n\nThe judge ruled that Trump has 28 days to file an amended complaint that should not exceed 40 pages in length.\n\nThe lawsuit targeted four of the newspaper’s journalists, a book and three articles published within a two-month period before the 2024 presidential election. \n\nThe book and an article written by Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig focused on Trump’s finances and his pre-presidency starring role in television’s “The Apprentice.” \n\nTrump also cited an article by Peter Baker last Oct. 20 headlined “For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgment\" and a Michael S. Schmidt piece two days later featuring an interview with Trump’s first-term chief of staff, John Kelly, headlined “As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator.”\n\nThe Times has called the lawsuit meritless and an attempt to discourage independent reporting. \n\n July 18: Trump sues The Wall Street Journal \n\nTrump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch whose News Corp owns the paper. The move came a day after the Journal published a story reporting on his ties to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe article described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday. \n\nThe Justice Department had earlier asked a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s sex trafficking case. The Trump administration had announced it would not be releasing additional files from the case.\n\n July 18: ‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ canceled \n\nCBS announced it would cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” next May. Colbert is one of Trump’s most prominent and persistent late-night critics. CBS said “Late Show” was canceled for financial reasons, not for content. However, the announcement came three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and CBS parent company Paramount Global over the “60 Minutes” story. \n\n July 2: CBS owner agrees to settlement with Trump \n\nParamount Global decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit regarding editing of a CBS’ “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last October. At the time Harris was the Democratic candidate for president. \n\nTrump’s lawyers claimed he suffered “mental anguish” following the interview and sued for $20 billion. The company was hoping to put the issue to rest as it sought administration approval of a merger. Paramount, which owns CBS, said the money will go to Trump’s future presidential library and to pay his legal fees.\n\n May 1: Trump slashes funding for PBS and NPR \n\nTrump signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to PBS and NPR and alleged “bias” in the broadcasters’ reporting. His order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies “to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS” and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. \n\nLater that month, NPR and three of its local stations sued Trump, arguing that the order violated their free speech and relies on an authority that he does not have. This summer, Congress approved eliminating $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting.\n\n Feb. 12: Trump removes The Associated Press from White House press pool \n\nTrump decided to remove The Associated Press from the White House press pool. That meant AP journalists no longer would have access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events not open to a full press corps. The move was in retaliation for AP’s decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in all instances.\n\nThe AP Stylebook calls for referring to the body of water by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump chose. The reasoning is that AP disseminates news around the world and must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences. \n\nThe wire service later sued Trump and a district court sided with the AP in April, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organization for the content of its speech. A federal appeals court in June stayed that decision. \n\n December 2024: ABC agrees to settle defamation lawsuit \n\nABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library as part of a defamation lawsuit settlement over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable of raping writer E. Jean Carroll. The network also agreed to pay $1 million in legal fees. \n\nThe settlement agreement described ABC’s presidential library payment as a “charitable contribution.” \n\nTrump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in a Miami federal court in March 2024 after the network aired the segment in which Stephanopoulos repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll’s two civil lawsuits against Trump. Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s contentious relationship with U.S. news organizations over his time in office has led to a host of legal battles and disputes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-npr-b2831661.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/00/Trump-Jimmy_Kimmel_58411.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 23:33:39","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":362657194,"title":"Trump escalates crackdown by designating ‘Antifa’ a domestic terror group","text":"The Trump administration’s crackdown on perceived left-wing threats following the death of Charlie Kirk continued on Monday evening, with Donald Trump announcing an executive order titled “Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.” The order directs federal departments and agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support.”\nThe impact of the order is unclear, as experts have noted that “domestic terrorism” isn’t recognized or sanctioned in the way foreign terror groups are.

The directive comes after Trump's promise to impose a terror designation on the radical \"anti-fascist\" group last week. \"I hereby designate Antifa as a 'domestic terrorist organization,'\" the president's order stated. The announcement emerges as Trump prepares to issue a bombshell warning regarding paracetamol use. \"All relevant executive departments and agencies shall utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations - especially those involving terrorist actions - conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support, including necessary investigatory and prosecutorial actions against those who fund such operations.\" The president referenced Antifa's \"pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law,\" when making the classification, reports the Express . Within minutes of the announcement, users swarmed X with remarks criticising the decision. Tina Leigh commented, \"Antifa is not an organization. Antifa is an ideology. Most of us are antifascist. Is he going to have 99% of the population arrested?\" Tessa Blackwell made this comment, \" Antifa is not an organization, it's just a designation that the right gives to anyone who opposes their increasingly authoritarian government and policies. The nebulous bogeyman of Antifa that they use to scare their children in their beds at night, and stop them questioning\". Edgieversion questioned the global implications \"What about Europe? Does Antifa exist in Europe?\". Others flocked to the social media platform to back the move. Andy said, \"This is the reason for Antifa being decentralized. They can claim it doesnt exist. Follow the money it will expose the chain of command.\" Mattieu posted, \"Proud Boys protect citizens from Antifa.\" The White House released a statement on its website declaring: \"President Donald J. Trump is right: the violence problem is on the Left. That's why he just designated Antifa - a network of Radical Left terrorists that aim to overthrow the government through violence and agitation - as a domestic terrorist organization. \"Antifa's terror is part of the trend of Radical Left violence that has permeated the nation in recent years, incited by constant lies and vicious attacks against Republicans from unhinged Democrat politicians, well-funded leftist organizations, and their allies in the media. \"This is a time that demands fearless and courageous leadership - not moral cowardice, indecision, or the lack of fortitude to call this what it is: an epidemic of Radical Left violence.\" The president first made the announcement on his Truth Social platform last week, writing: \"I am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.\" The decision comes in the wake of far-right commentator Charlie Kirk's murder in Utah. Trump attributed \"radical left wing political violence\" to the shooting, declaring it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\" No proof has been offered connecting the suspected Kirk killer to antifa. Several extremist specialists are challenging the president's power to make such a classification. Unlike international terrorist organisations such as Islamic State, no legal structure exists for branding domestic groups as terrorist organisations due to first amendment worries about criminalising political beliefs. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism and an expert witness on hate groups and extremism who has testified before Congress, labelled the move as \"ridiculous on its face\". She stated that Trump's declaration seems to have \"no basis in law or fact\".","summary":"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order branding the antifa movement as a &quot;domestic terrorist organization,&quot; the White House announced on Monday","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trumps-antifa-terrorist-organisation-35947537","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35947519.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_Trump-25265768585983.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 23:24:19","author":"Michael D.

Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who has argued that no vaccine is safe, the president called for a re-examination of a link between vaccines and autism, a theory that has been repeatedly debunked, and a series of changes not grounded in science.\n\n\"Taking Tylenol is not good. I'll say it. Not good,\" Trump said. \"You shouldn't give the child a Tylenol every time he gets a shot.\n\n\"Fight like hell not to take it.

Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again movement to provide answers on the causes of the marked increase in autism cases in the US in recent years.\n\nExperts say the rise in cases is mainly due to a new definition for the disorder that now includes mild cases on a \"spectrum\" and better diagnoses.

claims using paracetamol when pregnant strongly raises the risk of autism","text":"UK experts reacted with fury last night at Donald Trump's claim that taking paracetamol during pregnancy strongly increases the risk of autism.\n\nThe President insisted that pregnant women 'have a responsibility' to endure pain instead of taking the drug and should only do so if they 'can't tough it out' or have an extremely high fever.\n\nBut UK scientists stressed there is 'no robust evidence' of such a link and described suggestions to the contrary as 'fearmongering' that could put pregnant women at risk.\n\nMr Trump's remarks also 'risk stigmatising families who have autistic children as having brought it on themselves', they added.\n\nDr Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, said: 'There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship [between paracetamol and autism] and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced, and unsupported by the most robust methods to answering this question. \n\n'I am exceptionally confident in saying that no relationship exists.'\n\nDr Botha added that 'paracetamol is a much safer option during pregnancy than basically any other alternative' and that 'fearmongering' would prevent women from accessing the appropriate care.\n\nMr Trump, meanwhile, said autism research has been restricted by scientists who fear being 'politically incorrect'.\n\nThe US president also advised parents to spread their children's MMR vaccinations over five years instead of just making one visit to the doctor; and that children should avoid getting the hepatitis vaccine until they are 12 years old.\n\nParacetamol is known as acetaminophen in the US and is sold under brand name Tylenol stateside.\n\nLast night in the White House Mr Trump said: 'Effective immediately the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] will notify physicians that use of acetaminophen, which is basically Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.\n\n'For this reason, they are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary.' \n\nMr Trump also claimed: 'There are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism,' he added before pointing to the Amish community.\n\nHe said children should not be given Tylenol.\n\nThe announcement comes as part of a federal review fronted by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr into what is driving rising autism rates in the US.\n\nIn April he pledged to find the cause of the complex neurological disorder in just five months. \n\nBut several public health experts have accused the politician of promoting conspiracy theories in his post, especially about vaccines.\n\nShares in Tylenol maker Kenvue plummeted yesterday due to concerns over Mr Trump's comments.\n\nKenvue last night said claims Tylenol causes autism were 'dangerous' and insisted the drug is the safest option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women.\n\nA spokesman said that it was 'deeply concerned' with the risk Mr Trump's claims pose for 'expecting mothers'.\n\nMeanwhile, a US federal report recommended a specific type of the vitamin folate, known as Leucovorin, as a way to treat autism. \n\nCosting around £2 per pill, it is usually used to relieve the toxic effects of some forms of chemotherapy.\n\nThe number of autism sufferers has surged by almost 800 per cent in the past 20 years, according to research in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.\n\nMany experts believe this increase is largely due to a better understanding of autism among doctors and parents. \n\nThis means children with the symptoms who might once have gone undiagnosed are now being spotted at an early age. \n\nDimitrios Siassakos, professor in obstetrics and gynaecology at University College London, said: 'Autism results from several factors, often combined, particularly genetic predisposition, and sometimes low oxygen at the time of birth as a result of complications.\n\n'Undue focus on paracetamol would risk preventing families from using one of the safest medications to use in pregnancy when needed.'\n\nLast month a study from Harvard University and New York's Mount Sinai medicine school suggested exposure to paracetamol during pregnancy may mean children were more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.\n\nThe research, published in BMC Environmental Health, analysed results from 46 previous studies. \n\nThey concluded that while steps should be taken to limit use of the drug, it was important for treating fever and pain in mothers, which could also harm babies.\n\nDr Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the UK medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, last night said: 'There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children. \n\n'Paracetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women.\n\n'Untreated pain and fever can pose risks to the unborn baby, so it is important to manage these symptoms with the recommended treatment.","summary":"The President (pictured, with US health secretary Robert F Kennedy)

cancer researchers hit by Trump cuts","text":"The UK should import US scientists whose cancer research projects have been cut by Donald Trump, Ed Davey will argue at a Liberal Democrat conference that has focused heavily on how the party can respond to hard-right populism.\n\nIn his closing speech, Davey will also criticise Nigel Farage, saying the Reform UK conference applauded the Trump administration’s decision to slash funding for mRNA vaccines, which are being trialled as a way to offer personalised immunotherapy treatment for some cancers.\n\n“It is hard to express the cruelty and stupidity of cutting off research into medicine that has the power to save so many lives,” Davey is expected to tell the gathering in Bournemouth on Tuesday, adding: “A decision, by the way, that was enthusiastically applauded by Farage’s party at their conference.”\n\nDavey has long been the strongest critic of Trump among the three main Westminster leaders and has increasingly extended the criticism to Farage, reflecting the growing competition the Lib Dems face from Reform.\n\nWhile the bulk of the new seats won by Davey’s party in last year’s election were taken from the Conservatives, with the Tories flagging further and Labour’s poll numbers diving, Lib Dem officials are preparing for contests in which Reform is expected to be their main competition, most immediately in local elections across England next May.\n\nIn his speech on Tuesday afternoon, Davey is expected to set out what he said was a direct link between the cuts to mRNA vaccine research announced by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health secretary, and Reform’s likely policies.\n\nAt the Reform conference last month, the main auditorium applauded Aseem Malhotra, a British cardiologist and vaccine sceptic now linked to Kennedy, when he set out the US plan to cut research into mRNA technology.\n\nThe General Medical Council is examining comments made by Malhotra in the speech, in

The Republican leadership is listening to Trump and not talking to us,” Schumer told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has been receptive to such a meeting, saying over the weekend that he would love to meet with the Democratic congressional leaders but also that he didn’t think it was “going to have any impact.”\n\nAsked Sunday if such a meeting would actually happen, Schumer said he and Jeffries were “ready to meet with him any time and place to negotiate and avoid the Trump shutdown.”\n\nAs CNN has reported, the Democratic leaders, as well as rank-and-file, have publicly projected a united front in recent days, and many in the party are eager for a fight with Trump. But some also worry about the party’s exit strategy if Trump and the GOP refuse to cave.\n\nOn Friday, Lawmakers left Washington for a week without a path forward, after the Senate rejected both a House-passed seven-week government funding measure and a Democratic alternative.\n\nRepublicans have argued their bill to fund the government through November 20 is a “clean” continuing resolution, or CR, with only $30 million in extra security money for members of Congress and $58 million for security for the executive and judicial branches. It also includes a funding “fix” for DC, which would free up $1 billion of the city’s own money, adjusting a mistake in an earlier bill.\n\nThe Democratic bill, meanwhile, included expensive health care changes, such as extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have argued it’s inappropriate to add such provisions to a stopgap funding bill and that they should be negotiated as part of a year-end funding bill.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

What about the Latino communities the Supreme Court just gave ICE permission to racially profile in Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, stopped for speaking Spanish, standing on a corner, or simply looking “foreign”? That isn’t public safety. That’s state-sponsored racism.\n\nLet’s call it what it is: ICE hides behind masks because they know their actions can’t withstand accountability. Police don’t get masks. Judges don’t get masks. Soldiers don’t get masks. Only these agents, empowered by Trump’s mass deportation machine, demand secrecy while ripping families apart.\n\nCalifornia is right to ban masks. If you wield the power to destroy lives, the public has the right to see your face: no more hiding, no more badges for racism.\n\nDipanjot Kaur\n\nSan Mateo County must\ndo right by ‘extra help’\n\nSan Mateo County relies on long-serving “extra help” workers, especially in libraries, to provide essential public services.\n\nDespite their critical roles, these employees lack basic benefits such as health care, retirement and job security. Living in one of California’s most expensive areas, many struggle financially while the county expands free public programs — sometimes used irresponsibly.\n\nThis reflects a troubling priority: favoring public-facing services over fair treatment of workers. By treating dedicated staff as temporary, the county creates a two-tier workforce that contradicts its own values of equity and inclusion. These workers deserve fair compensation, benefits and a path to permanent employment.\n\nDavid Smith\n\nEpstein’s birthday book\nwould tell the story\n\nRe: “Panel presses FBI director on Epstein files” (Page A3, Sept. 18).\n\nDonald Trump and his administration have thrown everything possible at the wall, hoping that it will take the focus off Jeffrey Epstein. Grand jury files are sealed and not really necessary. Instead, a pdf of each and every page of the birthday book would tell the story.\n\nPoliticians, sports and other public figures receive requests for autographs and other special recognition for friends and family. Seeing what made it to the birthday book should be enlightening. A generic happy birthday in response to Giselle Maxwell’s request is quite different from something very personal, like the drawing and message from Trump. Let us judge for ourselves not only Trump, but every other person who contributed to the book.\n\nGood people cannot imagine knowing — even at a distance — someone as vile as a pedophile. Pedophiles have great façades — they do not look like the degenerates they are.\n\nPresident is at heart\nof social media vitriol\n\nRe: “What I learned stepping away from Facebook” (Page A8, Sept. 21).\n\nLarry Magid’s comments about how social media spreads misinformation, leading to increased violence, were right on.\n\nHe mentioned inflammatory posts, but failed to mention the person who posts many of these: the president of the United States. Donald Trump’s almost daily posts are offensive and filled with untruths. And talk about how quickly they spread — it’s almost instantaneous — and how quickly people act on them.\n\nLet’s place much of the blame where it belongs — on Trump.\n\nToni Blackstock\n\nKirk’s mixed legacy still\nworthy of mourning\n\nThe killing of young, passionate Charlie Kirk was reprehensible and indefensible. It is hard to imagine the grief felt by his wife, children, family and friends. It is right to pray for their healing and well-being. But let’s be clear that his death is no greater or less than anyone else’s. All death under these circumstances is tragic.\n\nAnd let’s remember that in his passionate speeches, he was critical of DEI, claiming it gave benefits to those who were undeserving. He was critical of those on the margins, blaming them for their own circumstances. What he failed to talk about was decades of White privilege, Jim Crow laws, legacy advantage and nepotism that gave any number of white people “access” whether they were qualified or not.\n\nThere is much to admire and mourn about Charlie Kirk, flaws and all.\n\nLarry Lauro\n\nFarm to School could\nchange how kids eat\n\nThe USDA’s new Farm to School grants are more than just funding — they’re a chance to transform how children eat and how they think about food. Imagine school cafeterias filled with fresh, local fruits and vegetables, offering meals that are vibrant, delicious and entirely plant-based.\n\nThis is about more than nutrition. It’s about teaching kids that what’s on their lunch tray can protect their health, safeguard our planet and show compassion for animals — all at once. What better legacy could we give the next generation than the knowledge that food can be both kind and powerful?\n\nFarm to School programs don’t just connect classrooms to local farms; they can set the standard for what compassionate, sustainable eating looks like. If schools seize this moment, students will carry forward the lesson that every meal is a chance to make the world better. That’s a change worth fighting for.\n\nRalph Findlay","summary":"Also: 'Extra help' &#124; Birthday book &#124; Online vitriol &#124; Mixed legacy &#124; Farm to School.

But in the current context, when we have the United States administration that is enacting and administering tariffs all over the world at different tariff rates and on different commodities depending on the particular climate, both politically, economically, it becomes exceedingly difficult to actually produce that Plan C, D or E when we’re going down that supply chain.”\n\nHarrison said every tariff is like a domino that has effects through the supply chain. “So from a commercial perspective, this has been an extremely challenging time for our clients,” she said.\n\nShe added that they have advised their clients to dive deeper into their commercial relationships and potentially reframe contractual agreements, understand what the tariff exposure is and start exploring other markets to diversify supply chain management.\n\nOn Friday, the Canadian government launched public consultations on the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) that facilitates free trade across North America. It is set for a joint review in 2026.\n\nFor now, most goods from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S. are avoiding tariffs because of CUSMA. However, that could change if Trump seeks major changes to the agreement or withdraws from it altogether.\n\n“We are telling clients to stay the course,” Harrison said.\n\n“There’s no doubt that this will be the most important negotiation that the Carney administration will have in the near future. What’s interesting is that Prime Minister (Mark) Carney and Mexican President (Claudia) Sheinbaum have entered into a specific project-based agreement now, looking at all manner of sectors, looking at ports, rails, infrastructure, energy, security.”\n\nShe said they are informing their clients that there is a plan to place to ensure that while volatility exists between Canada and the U.S., Canada and Mexico can negotiate as a block against the United States.\n\n“So our clients are looking forward to achieving some stability, but we’re again encouraging them to consider alternative markets with a special focus on (those) where Canada has a free trade agreement, such as the European Union,” Harrison added.\n\n“We’ve seen a real uptake and interest in that area, and bilateral trade between the EU and Canada is going to meaningfully increase over the next 24 months, and our clients want to have a lot to do with that.”\n\nHarrison said that time will tell what happens between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, but she said it is likely that Canada and Mexico have to come to the table with different proposals that can be used as negotiating and leverage tools.\n\n“One example might be deeper security relationships,” she added.\n\n“We know that border security is an area where President Trump would love to see additional wins. So playing into that desire for additional wins will be important for Canada. And once we know what sectors and what relationships are going to be discussed and negotiated between the three countries, I think we’ll better be able to predict how this will play out for Canadian industry generally.”","summary":"Martha Harrison told Global News their client base has been 'dramatically impacted' by Donald Trumps tariffs and the volatility that now exists in the international trade sphere.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11440910/donald-trump-tariffs-8-months-trade-lawyer/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/f534124c7c115cce37b2f71a19c8f72e7cd2176d155fd9aa188e1c64f1fde448.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:57:11","author":"Amy Judd,Jordan Armstrong","authors":["Amy Judd","Jordan Armstrong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.296},{"id":362661464,"title":"Truth about Barack and Michelle Obama's marriage as they frolic in the sun aboard Spielberg's yacht","text":"For months, rumors have been swirling that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama were headed for divorce.\n\nAfter years of standing fiercely by her husband's side, Michelle was noticeably absent from a slew of public events, forcing Barack to attend solo and leaving many to wonder: is the former first couple facing marital woes?\n\nNow, the pair has put on a rare show of unity by jetting off on a lavish getaway to Portofino, Italy, where they vacationed on their pal Steven Spielberg's $250 million superyacht.\n\nDespite coming separately - a solo Michelle was photographed boarding the vessel ahead of her husband, who arrived hours later looking downcast - a source has told the Daily Mail exclusively that the trip was exactly what they needed.\n\n'They needed this trip more than they thought they did, it [was] a really nice time to be able to lay low and be together,' dished the insider. 'Everyone was in great spirits.'\n\nAccording to the source, the vacation, while it served as a vital bonding moment for Barack and Michelle amidst the constant chatter about their romance, was not all for relaxation.\n\nThey claimed that acclaimed director Spielberg used the getaway to pitch a potential new movie that he wants to make about about the couple. \n\n'Steven talked about the potential of a movie made on the Obamas that Steven would be interested in directing and definitely producing,' the insider continued. \n\n'But though that was talked about, that was in no reason for the hangout. They are friends first and have had a very nice time together and treated it like a fun double date for a few days.'\n\nIn the end, the source insisted that Barack and Michelle are in a 'great place,' and plan to stick together amidst the 's**t show' that's going on in politics right now.\n\n'They are interested in being in the world together rather than apart, because the world they live in outside of everything is a s**t show in their eyes, politically speaking,' they said.\n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the Obamas for comment.\n\nPhotographers caught a solo Michelle, 61, getting onto Spielberg's luxurious, 357-foot water vessel via a tender ahead of her husband on Friday. \n\nShe looked fashionable, donning some baggy jeans, a matching denim button-down top, a white tank top underneath, and some brown and white patterned Birkenstock sandals.\n\nSpielberg, 78, greeted her with his arms open wide before he gave her a warm hug.\n\nThe two were then seen sitting outside on his massive boat, called the Seven Seas, chatting happily together, along with a woman who appeared to be his wife, Kate Capshaw. \n\nLater on, Barack, 64, was spotted looking downcast as he arrived in the picturesque Italian seaside village alongside some security; he dressed casually in a brown top and white cap. \n\nThe morning after Barack joined his wife on the yacht, the group enjoyed breakfast outdoors on the boat's deck, before they headed ashore to Punta Chiappa for lunch.\n\nAt one point, Barack - who wore a black polo shirt - was pictured sitting alone staring intently at what appeared to be a tablet or laptop.\n\nTheir vacation comes days after the former president made a startling marriage confession.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Jefferson Educational Society event in Erie, Pennsylvania, earlier this month, Barack joked that he had spent much of his time since leaving office trying to appease his wife, which he described as 'challenging.'\n\n'I have spent over eight years now trying to dig myself out of a hole with Michelle,' he said. \n\n'And that's been challenging, but I feel like I'm making progress. I'm almost breaking even at the moment.' \n\nThis marks the first time the couple had been seen together since they sat down for an astonishing joint interview on Michelle's podcast back in July, during which they finally addressed the state of their marriage. \n\n'What, you guys like each other?' Michelle's brother and co-host Craig Robinson joked, before Michelle replied: 'Oh yeah, the rumor mill.' \n\n'She took me back!' Barack light-heartedly chimed in, adding: 'It was touch and go for awhile.' \n\nThe former first lady said it was nice to be in the same room as her husband, sassily telling her brother: 'When we aren't, folks think we're divorced.' \n\nMichelle then made a heartfelt admission about her relationship with her husband of almost 33 years.\n\n'There hasn't been one moment in our marriage where I thought about quitting my man,' she said passionately.\n\n'And we've had some really hard times. So we had a lot of fun times, a lot of adventures, and I have become a better person because of the man I'm married to.'\n\nBarack admitted he missed a lot of the speculation, and he was largely unaware of what people were saying.\n\n'These are the kinds of things that I just miss, right? So I don't even know this stuff's going on,' he confessed.\n\n'And then somebody will mention it to me and I'm all like, 'what are you talking about?'' \n\nThe Obamas have been married for almost 33 years and share daughters, Malia, 26, and Sasha, 24. \n\nRumors surrounding the Obama's relationship began when Michelle skipped several high-profile events, including Donald Trump's inauguration and former President Jimmy Carter's funeral.","summary":"A source has revealed where they stand following the trip, and why it was vital for their relationship.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15123619/barack-michelle-obama-italy-vacation-steven-spielberg-yacht-marriage-relationship.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/22/21/102358789-0-image-m-122_1758573382434.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:55:35","author":"Editor,Lillian Gissen","authors":["Editor","Lillian Gissen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.164},{"id":362656116,"title":"Macron recognizes Palestinian state at landmark UN summit","text":"UNITED NATIONS: French President Emmanuel Macron recognized a Palestinian state at the United Nations on Monday, spurring a wave of Western moves to defy Israel in making the landmark – if symbolic – move.\n\nMacron, speaking at a summit that Israel and its chief backer the US did not attend, called for an end to the war in Gaza.\n\n“The time for peace has come, as we are just moments away from no longer being able to seize it,” Macron said in an address in the General Assembly.\n\n“The time has come to free the 48 hostages held by Hamas.

It was ‘prosecute Donald Trump.’ She was saying she was going to prosecute Donald Trump before she even knew if Donald Trump committed a crime — which, of course, we did not.”\n\nHalligan formally took over the position as the lead prosecutor for the Commonwealth’s Eastern District shortly after Leavitt’s remarks to reporters, CNN reported, including a photo of Halligan reportedly arriving for her first day.\n\nThe Virginia prosecutor’s office had been under pressure from top administration officials for months to bring charges against James, who led the civil fraud case against Trump last year, resulting in a $454 million judgment against him. The financial component of that judgment has since been overturned, and the Democratic-led Empire State is appealing that ruling.\n\nHalligan sworn in after push to remove Siebert\n\nHalligan formally assumed the role days after Mary “Maggie” Cleary, a conservative DOJ official who had previously said she was falsely accused of participating in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, led the office over the weekend to ensure continuity.\n\nHalligan, who has no prosecutorial experience, served as one of Trump’s attorneys during the early phases of the Mar-a-Lago classified documents probe, a case that Trump has called politically motivated.\n\nTrump celebrated Halligan’s appointment in a Truth Social post Saturday, saying she “represented me (and WON!) in the disgraceful Democrat Documents Hoax,” and praised her as “extremely intelligent, fearless” and ready to be “absolutely OUTSTANDING in this new and very important role.”\n\nMortgage allegations remain unresolved\n\nThe federal investigation into James stems from her 2023 purchase of a home in Virginia. In April, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging James falsified mortgage records by misrepresenting the property as her primary residence to secure more favorable loan terms.\n\n“Ms. James was the sitting Attorney General of New York and is required by law to have her primary residence in the state of New York — even though her mortgage applications list her intent to have the Norfolk, VA, property as her primary home,” Pulte wrote.\n\nThe referral alleged that James had a pattern of misrepresentation, pointing to a separate 2021 real estate transaction in Brooklyn in which she allegedly claimed a five-unit property with only four units in building permits and mortgage filings. Pulte suggested several possible violations, including false statements to a financial institution, bank fraud, and wire fraud.\n\nHowever, sources familiar with the case told ABC News last week that the five-month investigation has so far failed to yield enough evidence to support an indictment. Prosecutors reportedly determined that a power of attorney form, signed by James’s niece at closing, had been generated by a third-party template and was not reviewed by the mortgage lender’s underwriters.\n\nSources told the outlet that in response to Siebert’s decision not to seek charges for James, Pulte reportedly encouraged Trump to fire him and replace him with a prosecutor who would be willing to bring charges against her.\n\nWhat’s next for the investigation?\n\nWhile no charges have yet been filed, the investigation remains open. Under Virginia law, most grand jury formations result in a discharge if no report or indictment is filed within six months of their impanelling.\n\nThe prior round of grand jury activity began in May under Siebert’s oversight, and any next phase would likely involve new grand jury proceedings, though officials have not formally confirmed such plans.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Mike Benza, now a professor at Case Western Reserve University, said federal grand juries typically operate on six-month terms, but there’s no cap on how many can be formed.\n\n“There’s no limit to how many grand juries can be formed over the same investigation,” Benza said. “If the government doesn’t think it has enough to proceed, they can pause and resume when they’re ready.”\n\nComey inquiry also under Halligan’s purview\n\nSiebert was also overseeing a separate investigation into former FBI Director James Comey, including whether he lied to Congress during testimony about surveillance activities under the Obama administration. In that case, like the James inquiry, it has drawn close attention from Trump and his advisers.\n\nHalligan’s arrival places another one of Trump’s personal legal allies at the helm of a major U.S. Attorney’s Office tasked with executing some of the administration’s most politically sensitive investigations.\n\nSeveral ranking members of the Justice Department, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Solicitor General D. John Sauer, represented Trump during his criminal indictments leading up to the 2024 election. Another personal attorney to Trump, Alina Habba, serves as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. However, a federal judge recently ruled she was “unlawfully” holding the office beyond her interim term, casting doubt on her authority.\n\nA power struggle inside the GOP legal world\n\nThe shake-up at the Eastern District has sent ripples through Virginia’s legal and political establishment. \n\nSiebert is the son-in-law of Richard Cullen, a towering GOP legal figure who once served as Virginia attorney general, U.S. attorney, and personal attorney to former Vice President Mike Pence, who famously had a falling out with the president following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Cullen now serves as legal counsel to Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R).\n\nTrump’s removal of Siebert, a member of one of Virginia’s most prominent Republican legal families, is widely seen as a direct response to Siebert’s reluctance to pursue politically explosive charges against James without more substantial evidence.\n\nIt is unclear whether a new grand jury will be convened under Halligan’s supervision, though sources within the administration have stressed that the investigation into James is multifaceted and active.\n\nA separate grand jury in Albany, New York, continues to investigate whether James violated Trump’s constitutional rights during the New York fraud case, which came as Trump was fending off two federal indictments under then-Attorney General Merrick Garland’s oversight and two state-level criminal cases.\n\nJames’s legal team has dismissed both investigations as political retaliation.\n\nAbbe Lowell, who previously represented former President Joe Biden’s son in his criminal cases, is representing James in addition to leading the defense of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook amid Trump’s attempt to fire her. He accused Trump in a statement last week of “firing people until he finds someone who will bend the law to carry out his revenge.”\n\n“Punishing this prosecutor, a Trump appointee, for doing his job sends a clear and chilling message that anyone who dares uphold the law over politics will face the same fate,” Lowell said.\n\nLeavitt pushed back against criticism of the Justice Department under Trump, saying the administration “is not going to tolerate gaslighting” amid allegations that the current presidency is “weaponizing” the DOJ.\n\nTRUMP NOMINATES LINDSEY HALLIGAN FOR TOP VIRGINIA PROSECTOR\n\n“The President is fulfilling his promise to restore a Department of Justice that demands accountability, and it is not weaponizing the Department of Justice to demand accountability for those who weaponize the Department of Justice,” Leavitt said, saying “it was Biden” who used the DOJ to go after Trump.\n\nA spokesperson for the Eastern District of Virginia did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide and longtime personal attorney to President Donald Trump, has officially taken over as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing Erik Siebert after he was forced out amid internal resistance to indict one of Trump’s chief political adversaries: New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Recognising Palestine must ‘spur’ action as two-state solution in peril","text":"Recognising Palestinian statehood must be a “spur” to action rather than a “substitute” for it, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the United Nations.\n\nMs Cooper said the UK’s decision to recognise Palestine, a largely symbolic step it took alongside Canada, Australia and Portugal on Sunday, reflects the “grave reality” that the two-state solution is in “profound peril”.\n\nShe spoke at a UN General Assembly meeting in New York on Monday which French President Emmanuel Macron opened by officially recognising Palestinian statehood.\n\nUN secretary-general Antonio Guterres called statehood for Palestinians “a right, not a reward” in an apparent pushback against the Israeli government’s stance that recognition rewards Hamas for the October 7 attack that sparked the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also sees the move as a “reward to Hamas”, the White House said.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary told the UN the decision to recognise Palestine is “born of urgency and principle” and the pathway being set out is the “opposite of Hamas’s hateful vision”.\n\n“This step, alongside friends and partners, reflects a longstanding truth that statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people, and that two states is the only path to security and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\n\n“But it also reflects a grave reality: the two-state solution that for decades has commanded global support is in profound peril from continued bloodshed, man-made famine, terrorism and hostage taking, settlement expansion and settler violence.\n\nShe stressed there can be no role for Hamas in the future governance of Palestine and that recognition would come alongside “unwavering support” for Israel’s security.\n\n“But recognition must be a spur, not a substitute for urgent action, a ceasefire now, the release of all hostages, the restoration of aid and a lasting framework for peace,” she said.\n\nOn Sunday, Ms Cooper urged Israel not to retaliate to the recognition by expanding settlements in the West Bank.\n\nShe insisted the decision to recognise Palestine was aimed at increasing security by keeping the prospect of a two-state solution alive.\n\nNow that it has officially recognised Palestine, the UK plans to use the UN General Assembly to push for international backing of a framework for peace in the Middle East.\n\nMs Cooper will hold meetings to advance elements of the plan, including transitional governance and security measures to ensure Hamas has no role in the future governance of Gaza, according to the Foreign Office.\n\nThe UK Government has acknowledged that recognising a Palestinian state would not ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza nor contribute to the freeing of the hostages taken by Hamas.\n\nBut it believes the move is necessary to safeguard the prospect of a lasting two-state solution to the Middle East conflict, with Israel existing alongside a Palestinian state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has branded the UK move “absurd” and “simply a reward for terrorism”.\n\nMr Trump sees the move as a

So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies.”\n\nFamilies of hostages held in Gaza called it a “betrayal of humanity and a move that rewards Hamas while 48 hostages remain in captivity”.\n\nSenior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reportedly hailed the move as a victory for “the justice of our cause”.\n\nIn an effort to counter that criticism, Sir Keir Starmer said Hamas was a “brutal terror organisation” and confirmed plans to ratchet up sanctions on the group.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister David Lammy will represent the UK at the UN General Assembly, along with Ms Cooper and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey criticised Sir Keir’s absence at the summit.\n\nHe said: “The Prime Minister should not be missing in action from Britain’s historic recognition of Palestinian statehood just because he’s worried about upsetting Donald Trump.”","summary":"She spoke at a UN General Assembly meeting in New York which French President Emmanuel Macron opened by officially recognising Palestinian statehood.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/emmanuel-macron-yvette-cooper-un-general-assembly-palestine-hamas-b1249120.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/22/23/e116d18bf79118553554be0b8a38c7fdY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU4NjY3MTk4-2.79556890.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:49:51","author":"Helen Corbett","authors":["Helen Corbett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":362643266,"title":"Donald Trump snubs Anthony Albanese again as Kirk memorial derails hopes of Washington talks","text":"Beginning of dialog window.

He also revealed the FDA would soon approve the decades-old cancer drug Leucovorin as a treatment option for children with autism, part of a broader pledge to launch a “massive testing and research effort” into the causes of autism.A Harvard-led review in 2023 suggested possible links between prenatal exposure and a higher risk of autism or neurodevelopmental disorders, urging caution but not a ban. Tylenol maker Kenvue pushes back Kenvue, Tylenol’s parent company, strongly rejected Trump’s claims, warning they could put mothers at risk. In a statement, the company said:Live Events “Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.” The company added that acetaminophen remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women. Without it, mothers might be forced to suffer through fevers—which can be dangerous for a fetus—or turn to riskier alternatives.How reliable is the new report the administration citedThe new report cited by the Trump administration, produced by the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission, has been found to be unreliable due to numerous errors and questionable citations. Investigations revealed that the report included references to scientific studies that either do not exist or were misrepresented. For example, several cited studies were confirmed by the supposed authors as never having been written or published, undermining the report's credibility. These issues raised concerns about the thoroughness and oversight of the report's preparation, with experts suggesting that errors might be linked to the use of generative AI technology without adequate review. An amended version was later released with corrections, yet officials maintained the substance of the report remained unchanged despite foundational citation inaccuracies. Critics emphasize that such flaws severely compromise the trustworthiness of the findings and recommendations in the report.Therefore, the report underpinning the administration's claims about acetaminophen and autism risk appears to be poorly vetted and not sufficiently reliable as a scientific basis for policy or medical advice. This casts significant doubt on the validity of the report's conclusions and highlights the need for rigorous, evidence-based reviews by credible scientific authorities before issuing health guidelines.What evidence exists for or against acetaminophen–autism linksThe evidence regarding a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism in children is mixed but generally does not support a causal relationship.Evidence against a causal link:The most robust and well-controlled studies find no strong association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and autism. For example, a large Swedish study following 2.5 million children found only a very small difference in autism rates between those exposed and not exposed, and sibling comparison analysis showed no link, suggesting confounding factors explain previous associations.Several highly regarded studies, including a large 2024 study and a Japanese study using sibling controls, found no evidence that acetaminophen increases risk for autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.Genetics appear to explain much of the observed association, as mothers with a genetic predisposition to autism or ADHD may experience more pain and thus use more acetaminophen, confounding results.Leading medical experts and organizations emphasize that evidence is inconsistent and insufficient to support changes in guidelines, with acetaminophen considered safe for pregnancy use when needed.Evidence suggesting possible association:Some observational studies and reviews report associations between prenatal acetaminophen use and higher risks of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD, especially with prolonged or heavy use.A recent systematic review found consistent associations between acetaminophen and adverse neurodevelopment, including ADHD symptoms, but acknowledged potential confounders and called for further research.Mount Sinai researchers found biological plausibility for an effect through oxidative stress, hormone disruption, and epigenetic changes caused by acetaminophen crossing the placenta, but could not prove causality.Overall, the current consensus is that evidence is insufficient to conclude acetaminophen causes autism. Observed associations are likely influenced by confounding factors such as genetics and underlying maternal health. Health authorities recommend pregnant women use acetaminophen cautiously and only under medical advice to balance risks of untreated pain or fever. Further high-quality, controlled research is needed to clarify any risks.What do major medical organizations recommend about acetaminophen in pregnancyMajor medical organizations recommend that acetaminophen is generally safe for use during pregnancy when used appropriately, as it is considered one of the safest pain and fever relievers available for pregnant women.Key recommendations include:The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that acetaminophen is safe during pregnancy with no clear evidence linking its use to fetal developmental abnormalities or neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism or ADHD. ACOG emphasizes acetaminophen’s important role in managing pain and fever, which untreated can pose serious risks to both pregnant people and fetuses. They advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest time and consulting healthcare providers about any medication use.The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) supports acetaminophen as an appropriate treatment for pain and fever in pregnancy. They note that untreated fever especially in early pregnancy can increase risks of miscarriage, birth defects, and preterm birth. SMFM highlights that current research does not establish causality between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders and reassures pregnant patients about its safety when used as directed.The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) also affirms acetaminophen as the preferred medication for pain and fever during pregnancy, despite some reports suggesting associations with neurodevelopmental disorders, which they regard as not conclusive.Public health resources such as MotherToBaby state acetaminophen is considered by most healthcare providers as the pain reliever of choice during pregnancy due to a favorable safety profile compared to alternatives like NSAIDs, which carry higher risks.Overall, major healthcare organizations recommend cautious use—taking the smallest effective dose for the shortest duration—and consultation with healthcare professionals. They emphasize that the risks of untreated pain or fever during pregnancy outweigh theoretical risks of acetaminophen when used appropriately.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump Tylenol pregnancy warning autism risk debatetrump warns pregnant womentylenol autism fearstylenol autism linktrump sparks major debatetrump pregnancy warningtylenol safety questionedtrump targets tylenol usetrump tylenol statementdoctors defend pregnancy safety\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Picture: Chris Delmas / AFP\nThe surprise backflip came after mounting calls for a boycott of Disney in recent days, with stars like Cynthia Nixon and Noah Centineo among those who’ve publicly cancelled their Disney+ subscriptions.\nAnd overnight, more than 400 Hollywood stars have signed a petition supporting Kimmel and defending “free speech”.\n“We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech,” reads an open letter released by the American Civil Liberties Union. \n“Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.”\n\nCiting Kimmel’s suspension, the letter continues, “In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.”\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nDisney will have Kimmel back on the air tonight. Picture: Chris DELMAS / AFP\nThe petition concludes, “This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.”\nThe letter was signed by a slew of A-list celebrities, among them Jennifer Aniston, Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro, Selena Gomez, Jason Bateman, Michael Keaton, Natalie Portman, Martin Short, Maya Rudolph and Pedro Pascal.\nThe storm erupted over Kimmel’s show-opening monologue during last Monday’s episode of his talk show, when he claimed that slain right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer was “MAGA” and also poked fun at President Donald Trump’s response to the death of his high-profile supporter.\n\nCynthia Nixon publicly ditched her Disney+ subscription …\n\n… while Jennifer Aniston signed a petition along with 400 other celebs. Picture: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\nIn announcing he decision to pull his show, the President of broadcast media company Nexstar labelled Kimmel’s jokes “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse.”\nThe head of another affiliate network behind the suspension went a step further, issuing a list of demands that Kimmel must meet if he wants to keep his job.\n\nMore Coverage\n‘No men will desire you’: Star reveals reality\nVanessa Serna – Page Six\nBlock builder responds to ‘gross’ allegation\n\nThey include having the talk show host make a “direct apology” to Charlie Kirk’s family, and for him to make a “meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family” and to the conservative organisation he co-founded, Turning Point USA.\nIt is not yet known if Kimmel carried out any of these demands to get his show back. \nThe host’s return to the television is expected to air around 11:30pm Tuesday night in the US - early afternoon Wednesday here in Australia. \n\nJoin the conversation\n\nAdd your comment to this story\n\nTo join the conversation, please\n log in.

He seems to be plunging Gaza further and further into the abyss. \n\n“The world is becoming very angry in terms of the continuing killing in Gaza. \n\n“I think there are many people within Israel who are very disillusioned with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government. Clearly there has been genocidal intent from day one.” \n\nThe UN gathering is taking place against the backdrop of wars in Gaza and Ukraine and rising threats to the global international order - as well as the legitimacy of the United Nations system itself - from critics such as the US, Israel and others. \n\nA security cordon around the UN headquarters building in Manhattan included heavily armed NYPD and Secret Service officers as well as sniffer dogs and drone patrols. \n\nArmed officers were stationed on places of worship ahead of important Jewish festivals of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. \n\n“The resources that we are deploying are extensive and go beyond just a uniformed presence,’ said NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch. \n\n“Our specialized units will be out in full force all week, including harbor units on the rivers, aviation assets over head, heavy weapons teams and counter-terrorism officers on the street and our drone team will be providing real time situational awareness.”\n\nThe cordon for the week-long series of meetings in New York will ratchet up further ahead of the arrival of the Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nThe US president will address world leaders and is expected to have a private meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy who speaks at the UN on Wednesday. \n\nMr Martin urged Mr Trump to use his influence on Israel to end the war and stop the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the occupations in the West Bank. \n\nIn his address, the Taoiseach reiterated the need for a political path to create a Two-State solution as the only viable option for a peaceful future. \n\nHe said: “The situation on the ground has rarely looked so bleak – a just and lasting peace seems further away than it ever has. \n\n“But, in our own peace process in Northern Ireland, we recognised that, even in the darkest of days, we have a duty as Leaders to keep the flame of hope alive. \n\n“The immense suffering of the Palestinian population in Gaza over the past two years has been affront to the world. \n\n“It has horrified people around the world, nowhere more than in Ireland, where people have been moved to sorrow and to anger. \n\n“What happened to Israel on 7th October was a horrific and brutal attack on an innocent civilian population and Hamas must be held to account for its actions. \n\n“But it cannot justify what has happened since, \n\n“More than 65,000 people killed – tragically more than 20,000 of them children. \n\n“The use of food as a weapon of war, with scarcity becoming hunger, becoming famine. \n\n“Hospitals attacked. Schools destroyed. Thousands of years of culture wiped out. \n\n“People shot as they desperately seek food for their families. \n\n“Doctors, aid workers, journalists targeted and killed. \n\n“We have reached a point where what is credibly described as a genocide is being carried out in front of the eyes of the world.” \n\nMr Martin insisted the only way to end the bloodshed is with two states living side by side. \n\nHowever he added: “We know that there are people, including in the Israeli Government, who are working daily to make that outcome impossible. \n\n“That must not be our legacy to future generations. \n\n“Ireland is ready to play its part, and I look forward to our continuing steadfast co-operation.” \n\nThe moves by more nations to recognise its statehood have been welcomed by Palestinian representatives who hailed it as “historic” and said it could help bring an end to the war in Gaza. \n\nHowever Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who addresses the UN on Friday - warned the world would hear his response and declared there would never be a Palestinian state. \n\nFormer President of Ireland Mary Robinson is also in New York and attended the launch of a bid by Ireland for a place on the UN Human Rights Council. \n\nShe revealed a gathering foreign ministers had praised Ireland for being one of the first to recognise Palestinian statehood. \n\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest news from the Irish Mirror direct to your inbox: Sign up here.","summary":"Michael Martin and Simon Harris among 150 world leaders at event marking 80 years of the United Nations","url":"https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/taoiseach-warns-gaza-being-plunged-35946656","image":"https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article35946633.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Security-Increased-In-New-York-For-The-United-Nations-General-Assembly.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:32:48","author":"Neil Leslie","authors":["Neil Leslie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.008},{"id":362648628,"title":"Disney Announces ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ Is Back, After Short-Lived ‘Indefinite’ Cancellation","text":"Source: Genaro Molina / Getty It has been less than a week since Disney and ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air for what was supposed to be an indefinite suspension over Kimmel’s remarks about the death of Charlie Kirk, which were actually remarks about how President Donald Trump and his MAGA sycophants don’t actually care about Kirk and are using his death to clout chase — which is demonstrably true. Well, on Monday, the Walt Disney Co. announced that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will be back on Tuesday night, making his “cancellation” the most short-lived MAGA bluff since the Trump administration was threatening to arrest Barack Obama for a crime they conjured out of their big, stupid MAGA imaginations. Actually, Disney execs now appear to be pretending they never intended to remove Kimmel’s show for good, and it was all just the network erring on the side of caution because “our country” is still “emotional” over the death of a Christian nationalist bigot. (I might be paraphrasing a bit.) “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive,” a Disney spokesperson told CNN. ” We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.” Sure, Jan. As we previously reported, Kimmel’s response had nothing to do with Kirk himself; it was about Trump and his minions scoring political points off the right-wing podcaster’s death while showing zero signs of actual grief. Nothing about what Kimmel said was “insensitive” to Kirk, which makes it far more likely that it was the pressure from Trump and the FCC that prompted the action the network took. Disney execs also probably saw those projections of all the potential financial losses they could suffer as customers cancel their Disney/Hulu subscriptions in protest of Kimmel’s firing. It turns out that bowing down to the federal government as it plays fast and loose with free speech can have unintended consequences. “I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation,” Anna M. Gomez, the lone Democratic commissioner on the FCC, told CNN. “More importantly, I want to thank those Americans from across the ideological spectrum who spoke loudly and courageously against this blatant attempt to silence free speech.” “It will continue to be up to us as citizens to push back against this Administration’s growing campaign of censorship and control,” Gomez continued. Welp, Kimmel’s return is sure to disappoint MAGA supporters who were ecstatic about the display of censorship and government overreach because they got to watch a liberal get “cancelled,” but it’s a good look for the nation, which is observably slipping further and further into authoritarian rule.

There's not an alternative to that.' \n\nIt's thought that the active ingredient in Tylenol, known around the world as paracetamol, may hinder fetal brain development, but research has largely been inconsistent, and major health bodies still recommend it for pregnant women.\n\nThe maker of the Tylenol earlier pushed back against the Trump administration's claims that the painkiller causes autism, branding it 'dangerous' and insisting its drug remains the safest option for pain and fever relief in pregnant women. \n\nDonald Trump has claimed to have 'solved' America's autism 'epidemic,' linking the rise of the condition to Tylenol\n\nWhile widely considered safe during pregnancy, medical guidelines advise consulting a doctor before taking Tylenol (stock image)\n\nAdditionally, Trump praised the CDC's latest move to stop recommending the combined MMR and varicella vaccine and urged Americans to break up the MMR vaccine into three separate shots because mixing them 'could be a problem'. \n\n'I've heard bad things about [the MMR] personally,' Trump said, despite also calling himself a 'big believer in vaccines'. \n\nOn the flip side, Robert F Kennedy touted an 'exciting' development in autism improvement: the $2.50-per-pill drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid.\n\nWhile research on leucovorin is also mixed, doctors specializing in the relationship between the drug and autism told the Daily Mail the administration's focus on it 'gives hopes' to families across the country. \n\nI'm the doctor on the cusp of an autism breakthrough... using an everyday drug to reverse symptoms\n\nFolic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a vital nutrient that helps synthesize DNA and replicates and repairs cells throughout the body. \n\nWomen are already advised to take folic acid during pregnancy to prevent birth defects in the fetal brain and spinal cord, but a growing body of research suggests it could help repair pathways in a child's brain well after birth.\n\nDr Marty Makary, FDA commissioner, also said the agency plans to approve the use of leucovorin for autistic children, and it is expected to be covered by government-subsidized insurance, with Dr Mehmet Oz stating private insurance companies are 'likely to follow'. \n\nTrump said: 'It's not that everything is 100 per cent understood or known, but I think we've made a lot of strides.\n\n'We understood a lot more than a lot of people who studied it, we think.\n\n'This is a very important day.' \n\nTrump also repeated a long touted myth that there is no autism in the Amish community, which has been disproven.\n\nPresident Trump is pictured alongside Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz on Monday\n\nTrump warned that pregnant women should 'fight like hell' not to take Tylenol or give it to their children (stock image) \n\nThe announcement comes as the Trump administration and Kennedy have made it a top priority to tackle America's rising autism rates, with one in 31 children now estimated to have the condition compared to one in 150 children in 2000. \n\nTrump cited that the rate was closer to one in 20,000 decades ago but did not specify. Historical data suggests the president was exaggerating. \n\nExperts say the increase is largely due to a loosening of the definition of autism and because doctors have become better at detecting the condition. \n\nBut others, including RFK Jr, have suggested toxins in the environment, older parents or maternal obesity could be behind the rise.\n\nKennedy said: 'We are continuing to investigate multiplicity of potential causes.\n\n'We will be uncompromising and relentless in our pursuit. Whatever the answer is, we will tell you what we find.' \n\nNIH head Dr Jay Bhattacharya also announced his agency would devote an additional $50million to studying the causes of autism.\n\nHe said: 'The sharp rise of autism deserves an urgent response by the scientific community.' \n\nAcetaminophen is widely used by pregnant women, with about 60 per cent taking the drug, to reduce fevers and pain that could harm both mother and baby.\n\nAcetaminophen is found in Tylenol and a number of other medications, including over-the-counter cold and flu drugs such as DayQuil and NyQuil and sleep aids such as Excedrin PM.\n\nTen-year-old Meghan Dumesnil (pictured here) was diagnosed with autism as a preschooler after having 'very delayed speech.' She has had 'dramatic' improvements since starting leucovorin\n\nNathaniel Schumann (pictured here), 12, would only speak two to three words at a time before starting leucovorin, and they would only be related to something he wanted\n\nDr Makary said: 'We now have evidence we cannot ignore.' \n\nThe drug is considered to be among the only safe and doctor-approved pain and fever reliever for use in pregnant women. \n\nMajor medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, say it is safe for pregnant women to take the drug, although they recommend consulting with a doctor. \n\nACOG said in a statement: 'Today’s announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children. It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\n\n'In more than two decades of research on the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.'\n\nDr Monique Botha, a developmental psychologist at Durham University in the UK, said in a statement released by the Science Media Center: 'There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced, and unsupported by the most robust methods to answering this question.\n\n'I am exceptionally confident in saying that no relationship exists.'\n\nTylenol is widely used by pregnant women, with estimates suggesting 60 per cent take the drug during their pregnancy to help reduce fevers and pain (stock image)\n\nDr Randa Jaafar, a pain management specialist in New York City, told the Daily Mail: 'There are many other factors of maternal use that have higher links with autism like smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy.\n\n'[Acetaminophen] can accumulate in the fetal liver and brain - that is what can affect brain development but it has to be taken in high amounts for this to happen by the mother, which would be rare unless a mom is overdosing on Tylenol.' \n\nA spokesperson for Kenvue, which produces Tylenol and other popular drugs like Zyrtec and Benadryl, told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.\n\n'Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\n\n'The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism.\n\n'We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.'\n\nFolic acid-derived leucovorin, meanwhile, has seen an increasing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness. \n\nFolic acid's naturally occurring form, folate, is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, beans, and lentils. But research shows up to three in four autistic children don't get enough folate supply to their brain, causing delays in speech and behavioral issues.\n\nDr Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist at Rossignol Medical Center in Arizona, is one of 50 doctors in the US prescribing leucovorin to autistic children to improve their speech\n\nRyan Baldridge Jr (pictured here), an eight-year-old with autism, was almost completely non-verbal when he started taking leucovorin. Two weeks later, he told his father he loved him\n\nDr Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist at Rossignol Medical Center in Arizona, told the Daily Mail: 'We find that up to 75 percent of children with autism have a blockage in the ability to get folate into the central nervous system. Folate levels in the central nervous system are restored with leucovorin at prescription doses.' \n\nIt's believed these children have autoantibodies in their blood - a type of antibody that mistakenly targets and attacks the body's tissues and organs.\n\nThese autoantibodies are known to block a protein called folate receptor alpha, a protein that transports folic acid from the blood into the brain and placenta.\n\nLeucovorin is approved in the US for patients to protect their cells – especially blood cells - against the damaging effects of chemotherapy, but doctors can prescribe it 'off label' for other conditions since it has been deemed safe by the FDA.\n\nDr Frye, who has been studying leucovorin for the past 20 years and is one of just 50 doctors nationwide prescribing it to autistic children, estimates the drug helps about 70 per cent of the children who take it. \n\nThe announcement comes after health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr labeled America's rising autism rates an 'epidemic' and promised answers by September\n\nDr Frye told the Daily Mail: 'This is a safe, well-tolerated treatment which can improve lives of many individuals with autism. It is not a cure, but it improves the function of many children substantially.' \n\n'I think this is a major step forward to get many children with autism treated and improve their ability to function. \n\n'It is particularly groundbreaking in the fact that many do not think autism can be treated at its core. This treatment fixes core biological deficits and therefore could be disease modifying. \n\n'Recognition by the administration that there is such a treatment gives hope to many families.'\n\nSpeaking previously to the Daily Mail, parents working with Dr Frye revealed the 'dramatic' difference leucovorin made in their autistic children. \n\nThe family of eight-year-old Ryan Baldridge Jr, for example, said their son went from 'basically non-verbal' to speaking full sentences within six weeks.\n\nHe even was finally able to tell his father that he loved him. \n\nAnd Nathaniel Schumann, 12, went from only being able to say one or two words at a time to finally being able to tell his family about what was bothering him. \n\nHis mother told this website: 'It is a combination of therapies as well as leucovorin, but when leucovorin was added to the mix, that's when we noticed the change.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump drops bombshell Tylenol autism announcement as he vows to rip up 'disgraceful' vaccine schedule in major medical shake-up\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Donald Trump has announced an extraordinary shake-up in the medical advice given to Americans at a press conference about the possible causes of autism.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15123181/trump-links-tylenol-autism-cause-leucovorin.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/22/20/102357657-0-image-m-25_1758569406525.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/21/5563773688364550675/1024x576_MP4_5563773688364550675.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:25:34","author":"Editor,Emily Joshu Sterne","authors":["Editor","Emily Joshu Sterne"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.259},{"id":362643642,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel is returning to ABC on Tuesday, Disney says","text":"After ABC's decision last week to pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air \"indefinitely,\" he's coming back.On Monday, Disney, which owns ABC, said the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host would return and the show would resume on Tuesday.\"Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" the Walt Disney Company said in a statement. \"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"Kimmel's suspension following his on-air comments about Charlie Kirk had become a cultural flash point in recent days, drawing rebukes from the Hollywood community and free speech advocates on both sides of the political aisle. It also showcased the complex dynamics of the broadcast TV business and the new pressure playbook of Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr.ABC's decision both to suspend Kimmel and then to put him back on the air demonstrates how heated the cultural conversation around Kirk's death — and what comments about it are considered acceptable — has become. Other companies like Microsoft and The Washington Post have also taken action against employees for their commentary following the killing of the conservative activist and influencer.Hollywood heavyweights like comedian Ben Stiller and \"Star Wars\" star Mark Hamill posted jubilantly on social media in reaction to Kimmel's return, as did political figures like California Gov. Gavin Newsom.Andrew Kolvet, spokesman for Turning Point USA, the conservative organization founded by Kirk, wrote that Disney and ABC \"caving\" and letting Kimmel \"back on the air is not surprising, but it's their mistake to make.\"Disney stock pared losses of roughly 2% after the news broke, closing 1% lower for the day.Get caught up on the fallout over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension:The controversy started on Wednesday, September 17, when Carr took aim at Kimmel's comments about Kirk's death. Carr described Kimmel's comments as \"sickest conduct possible\" in an interview and said that the FCC would potentially need to review broadcast licenses.\"We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,\" Kimmel had said on air Monday, September 15. The segment included additional comments about President Donald Trump.Hours after Carr's comments on Wednesday, ABC suspended Kimmel following pressure from Sinclair and Nexstar, two major companies that own ABC affiliate stations. The situation had particularly high stakes for Nexstar, which is seeking the FCC's approval for a $6.2 billion M&A deal.On Monday, following Disney's announcement that Kimmel would be back on air, Carr referred Business Insider to comments he made earlier that day. In those, Carr said Democrats had misconstrued his comments, and said the FCC was trying to \"empower local TV stations to serve the needs of the local communities.\"Following Kimmel's suspension, Sinclair said that it wouldn't air Kimmel's show on its stations until \"appropriate steps\" were taken. Sinclair's demands included an apology from Kimmel to Kirk's family and a donation to Kirk's family and Turning Point USA.It's unclear whether Nexstar and Sinclair will air the show on their ABC affiliate stations. They didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Politicians like former President Barack Obama, and key figures in Hollywood were critical of ABC's decision to pull Kimmel off the air. Late-night television hosts from Stephen Colbert to Seth Meyers reacted to Kimmel's suspension during their scheduled Thursday night shows. A protest outside Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, took place on Thursday, too.\"This is a big moment in our democracy, and we must all stand up for the principles of free expression,\" Meyers said on air. \"There's a reason free speech is in the very first amendment. It stands above all others.\"After Kimmel's reinstatement, FCC commissioner Anna Gomez, a Biden appointee who has criticized Carr for politicizing the agency, said in a statement that she was \"glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation.\"","summary":"\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return to ABC on Tuesday after the late-night host's comments on Charlie Kirk's death caused the network to pull the show.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/jimmy-kimmel-back-on-abc-disney-after-suspension-fcc-2025-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/68d1b1eef9db348adc0bf471?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:23:21","author":"Kelsey Vlamis,Sydney Bradley","authors":["Kelsey Vlamis","Sydney Bradley"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.007}]}
