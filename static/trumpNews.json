We collaborate, we coordinate, we work together [with the United States], but there is no interference, no violation of sovereignty,” she said, adding that “this is what we want to be made clear” in light of the United States government’s designation of six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nSheinbaum also made it clear that Mexico, like the United States, is determined to combat drug trafficking, organized crime groups and violence.\n\nShe also said that the Mexican government would broaden its lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers and distributors in consideration of the designation of six cartels as terrorist groups.\n\n“There will be a broadening of this lawsuit due to the complicity [with terrorists] of those that sell weapons that are brought into our country,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nSheinbaum responds to Trump’s decision to launch anti-drug campaign\n\nA day after Trump thanked her for giving him the idea to launch an anti-drug campaign, Sheinbaum returned the favor.\n\n“I obviously thank him for the mention,” she said.\n\n“I think that it is something important,” Sheinbaum continued, referring to the U.S. anti-drug campaign.\n\n“We have always said that the trafficking of drugs to the United States has to do with drug use in the United States, that it’s not just an issue for Mexico. … There wouldn’t be distribution of drugs to the United States if there wasn’t drug use in the United States,” she said.\n\nThe decision to launch an anti-drug campaign is “recognition from the United States president of what we call attention to the causes,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… It’s recognition that they have to attend to the issue of drug use there,” she said.\n\n“And I think that’s very important. … So I think this announcement that President Trump made yesterday is very important,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nGovernment seeks agreement with gas stations to limit profits\n\nA reporter asked the president whether the government was prepared to establish a price cap for gasoline — possibly 24 pesos per liter — as part of efforts to keep inflation under control.\n\n“This issue with the price of gasoline — what is not regulated, let’s say, is the profits of a private company,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“The Pemex gas stations are in fact Pemex franchises, they’ve been operated privately for a long time, and Pemex also sells [fuel] to non-Pemex gas stations, and apart from that, there is imported gasoline,” she said.\n\n“Before entering into a scheme of fixing prices, we think that we can reach a voluntary agreement [with gas stations]. We did it [with the private sector] for the basic basket [of essential goods],” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“So first we want a voluntary agreement, in which they themselves, the gas station owners, moderate the amount of pesos they earn for each liter they sell. So that is what we are working on,” she said.\n\n“Ideally what we want is this voluntary agreement. If the voluntary agreement doesn’t happen, then we could think about other ways, but I believe — because of the meetings we’ve already had — that it is possible to reach one,” Sheinbaum said.\n\n“… We still have next week to seal [the deal] and everything is going well, so I expect that we’ll be able to sign it very soon,” she said.\n\nMexican and US forces to collaborate more closely on cross-border security issues \n\nSheinbaum said that Defense Minister Ricardo Trevilla Trejo and General Gregory M. Guillot, Commander of the U.S. Northern Command, had a “very good, very respectful conversation.”\n\nThe U.S. Northern Command said in a statement on Wednesday that the two men “met recently to discuss cooperation to increase security along the Mexico and U.S. border.”\n\n“The conversation resulted in the formulation of a Joint Statement of Understanding regarding cooperative activities along the border, to include coordinated patrols on their respective sides of the border, increased information sharing, and methods for immediate communications,” the statement said.\n\n“The conversation and agreements emphasize that each country will respect the sovereignty of the other,” it added.\n\nSheinbaum said that U.S. security forces could share information with Mexican forces about arms trafficking, for example, “or vice versa in the face of other conditions,” such as the northward flows of drugs or migrants.\n\n“Above all, communication and coordination in these cases was spoken about” during the meeting between Trevilla and Guillot, she said.\n\nBy Mexico News Daily chief staff writer Peter Davies ([email protected])","summary":"At her Thursday press conference, President Sheinbaum announced she'll submit to Congress a constitutional reform proposal aimed at protecting Mexico from foreign interference.\n\n\nThe post A reform to protect Mexico&#8217;s sovereignty: Thursday&#8217;s mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/reform-mexican-sovereignty/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1019908_Conferencia-Matutina-Netflix_web-Holding-up-reform-Daniel-Augusto-Cuartoscuro.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 01:02:09","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":292706514,"title":"‘Unacceptable’: America’s fury at Zelensky","text":"We are approaching the end of a week in which Mr Trump seemed to turn, perhaps irrecovably, against Ukraine. He has repeatedly insulted Mr Zelensky, calling him a “dictator” among other things, and has adopted a range of arguments we normally hear from Russia, which invaded its less powerful neighbour in 2022.\n\nFor example, Mr Trump has suggested Mr Zelensky is an illegitimate president because elections have not been held in Ukraine since the invasion began.\n\nThe country’s constitution forbids elections when martial law is in effect, which has been the case throughout the war. Ukraine’s parliament has repeatedly approved its extension. And the united stance of all political parties in Ukraine is that elections should be held six months after martial law is lifted.\n\nMr Trump has never demanded that Putin hold fair and free elections, despite the Russian leader’s long history of cracking down on political dissent.\n\nThe day before calling Mr Zelensky a dictator, Mr Trump accused him – not Russia – of being responsible for the war, arguing Ukraine “should have never started” it.\n\nDespite the stream of personal invective flowing so freely, all of a sudden, east across the Atlantic, the White House is now taking issue with Mr Zelensky’s tone. It is irritated by his demand that Ukraine be included in any peace negotiations with Russia, and likely by his claim that Mr Trump is trapped in a “disinformation bubble”.\n\nUkraine was not present at preliminary negotiations between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia this week.\n\nSpeaking to reporters today, Mr Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz was blunt.\n\n“Who does (Trump) think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine: Putin or Zelensky?” asked Fox News reporter Peter Doocy.\n\n“Well look, his goal here is to bring this war to an end. Period,” said Mr Waltz.\n\n“His frustration with President Zelensky, you heard, is multi-fold. One, there needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in his first term, and what we’ve done since.\n\n“Some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, and frankly insults to President Trump, were unacceptable.”\n\nHe went on to reference Ukraine’s rejection of an American demand for access to the country’s rare minerals, as a sort of payment in return for its support in the war.\n\nAt another point, CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins sought to follow up on Mr Doocy’s question.\n\n“You wrote in an op-ed in the fall (autumn) of 2023 that, ‘Putin is to blame, certainly like al-Qaeda was to blame for 9/11,’” she told Mr Waltz.\n\n“Do you still feel that way now? Or do you share the President’s assessment that, as he says, Ukraine is to blame for the start of this war?”\n\n“Well, it shouldn’t surprise you that I share the President’s assessment on all kinds of issues,” Mr Waltz responded.\n\n“What I wrote as a former member of Congress – what I share the President’s assessment on is that the war has to end.”\n\n‘It’s just unacceptable’: Trump adviser dissembles\n\nMr Waltz also popped up for an interview on Fox News today, where he was asked about specific Russian war crimes – such as its abduction and rehoming of tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.\n\nHost Brian Kilmeade was interested in what concessions Russian President Vladimir Putin might have to make to secure American approval for a peace deal. We’ve heard virtually no talk about that all week, despite the negotiations in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be great if the Russians handed back the 20,000 children they stole from the Ukrainian families – renamed them and handed them out to Russians?” he asked.\n\n“Would they ever agree to give the children back?”\n\nMr Waltz did a spot of rhetorical water-treading in response. \n\n“You know, we talked about what we’re going to have to do in the territory, what we are going to have to do in security guarantees, what we’re going to have to do, kind of, in the future, broader security arrangement, the future of our relationship and those kinds of exchanges, prisoner exchanges, children, what’s happened in some of these areas,” he said.\n\n“All of that, you know, should be resolved. And we are trying to resolve it.\n\n“But for everyone to just throw their hands up and say, ‘Well, we don’t like what they’re doing, but we don’t have a plan either.’ It’s just unacceptable.”\n\nVice President mocks ‘moralistic garbage’\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice President J.D. Vance got himself into a spat, on Twitter, with the conservative British-American historian Niall Ferguson.\n\nMr Vance took issue with Mr Ferguson (Sir Niall, if you prefer stuffy British titles) for sharing a quote from former president George H.W. Bush, a Republican, condemning Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n\n“This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression,” Mr Bush said of the invasion.\n\n“Future history students will be asked why this stopped being the reaction of a Republican president to the invasion of a sovereign state by a dictator,” said Mr Ferguson.\n\nMr Vance fired back at the historian in a lengthy Twitter post of his own.\n\n“This is moralistic garbage, which is unfortunately the rhetorical currency of the globalists because they have nothing else to say,” said the Vice President.\n\n“For three years, President Trump and I have made two simple arguments. First, the war would not have started if President Trump was in office. Second, that neither Europe, nor the Biden administration, nor the Ukrainians had any pathway to victory.\n\n“This was true three years ago, it was true two years ago, and it is true today.”\n\nHe went on to wonder whether Mr Ferguson had “an actual plan for Ukraine”.\n\n“Another aid package?” Mr Vance asked, with more than a hint of sarcasm.\n\n“Is he aware of the reality on the ground, of the numerical advantage of the Russians, of the depleted stock of the Europeans or their even more depleted industrial base?\n\n“Instead, he quotes from a book about George H.W. Bush from a different historical period and a different conflict. That’s another currency of these people: reliance on irrelevant history. \n\nPresident Trump is dealing with reality, which means dealing with facts.\n\n“We must pursue peace, and we must pursue it now. President Trump ran on this, he won on this, and he is right about this. It is lazy, ahistorical nonsense to attack as ‘appeasement’ every acknowledgment that America’s interest must account for the realities of the conflict.”\n\nMr Ferguson replied with something of a peace offering, agreeing with Mr Vance that “the war would not have happened” if Mr Trump had won the US election in 2020.\n\n“I supported his campaign for re-election last year, consistently predicted his and your victory, and welcomed the ‘vibe shift’ that victory represented. I have also supported the President’s previous calls to negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine. So I am not sure I really qualify as a globalist,” said Mr Ferguson.\n\n“But I simply cannot understand the logic of beginning a negotiation this difficult by conceding so many crucial points to Russia.”\n\nHe noted that the United States appeared to have conceded, before proper negotiations “have even begun”, that Ukraine will not become a member of NATO and will not recover swathes of its territory already in Russian hands – essentially granting two of Russia’s chief goals, pre-emptively, in return for nothing.\n\n“Correct me if I am wrong,” he said.\n\n“On Wednesday, President Trump accused Ukraine of having ‘started it’, meaning the war. He also cast doubt on the legitimacy of President Zelensky’s government.\n\n“It is not ‘moralistic garbage’ but a hard and realistic lesson of history that wars are easy to start and hard to end.\n\n“I earnestly hope that the Trump administration can negotiate an end to this war. But if we end up with a peace that dooms Ukraine first to partition and then to some future invasion, it will be a sorry outcome.”\n\nTop conservative calls Trump’s stance ‘un-American’\n\nAnother figure who is usually very much on Donald Trump’s side, the conservative American broadcaster Mark Levin, spent a significant chunk of his radio show today running through the history of Putin’s crimes.\n\nHe then turned to an implicit critique of the US President’s stance on Ukraine, albeit without naming Mr Trump directly, and a defence of Mr Zelensky.\n\n“Zelensky ordered martial law. That’s what the constitution there compelled. Zelensky hasn’t called for an election. That’s what the constitution there compels,” said Mr Levin.\n\n“Now, I’m waiting for the first free election for Vladimir Putin. I mean, this is almost comical, in a sick way, that Putin is demanding an election. Why is he demanding an election in Ukraine when he doesn’t have free and real elections in his own country? And why does he get to call the shots when, in fact, he murders people who dare to challenge him?”\n\nMr Levin went on to express his confusion and frustration regarding people who “not only oppose Zelensky, but seem to support Putin”. He accused those folks of supporting “policies that, in many ways, are un-American”.\n\n“Zelensky’s latest poll, he’s at 57 per cent. The parliament, all parties in the parliament, support what he’s doing. They’re trying to survive. Ukraine did not invade Russia. Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n“They didn’t start this war. What were they supposed to do? Roll over and play dead?”\n\nTwitter: @SamClench","summary":"The United States has lashed out at Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelensky for “insulting” Donald Trump after a week when the allies have split.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/unacceptable-us-rebukes-zelensky-for-insulting-trump-after-us-president-calls-ukraines-leader-a-dictator/news-story/8475bc7ac12b75a148ad06c084443fff?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3c39594b19630d3abe2c8bc9fb8f6b80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:54:45","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":292707480,"title":"Morning Digest: U.S. deportations highlight human trafficking syndicates; Odisha govt. summons KIIT founder Achyuta Samanta over student unrest, and more","text":"Deportations from U.S. put spotlight on human trafficking syndicates\n\nLarge-scale deportation of illegal immigrants from the United States to India has put the spotlight on human trafficking syndicates.

Brandon Gill (R-Texas) drew attention to a $2.7 trillion estimate of improper government payments since 2003, a number furnished by the Government Accountability Office.\n\n“We are uncovering what could be the biggest money laundering scandal in American history,” he said.\n\nDOGE has faced opposition from many Democrats as well as a number of lawsuits.

Before his appearance, he met with Argentine President Javier Milei, who has been frequently praised by Musk and popularized the power tool while campaigning in 2023 and proposing slashing public spending.\n\nAfter Musk appeared onstage, wearing shades and his trademark black “Make America Great Again” hat, he said Milei had a gift for him. The Argentine leader then walked onstage with the red chainsaw and passed it to Musk. The chainsaw was engraved with Milei’s slogan, “Viva la libertad, carajo,” which is Spanish for “Long live liberty, damn it.”\n\n“This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,” he said.\n\nMusk slammed the previous Biden administration for its immigration policies, specifically naming an app that was used by nearly 1 million people to be allowed into the U.S. on two-year permits with eligibility to work. He accused Biden and Democrats of doing that as an “investment” to get more support in swing states.\n\n“A lot of people don’t quite appreciate that this was an actual real scam at scale to tilt the scales of democracy in America,” Musk said before Newsmax host Rob Schmitt asked him, “Treason?”\n\nMusk responded, “Treason.”\n\nWhen Schmitt asked him if he would consider auditing the Federal Reserve, Musk responded, “Yeah, sure, while we’re at it.”\n\n“Waste is pretty much everywhere,” Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire joked that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has told him he is worried about his security and said he was open to ideas on how to improve his safety measures.\n\n“President Bukele from El Salvador, who managed to put in prison like a hundred thousand murderous thugs, and he called me. ‘I am worried about your security,’” he said the Central American leader told him. “I’m like, ‘Dude, you are worried about my security?’”\n\nWhen asked to describe what is like inside his mind, Musk replied: “My mind is a storm. It’s a storm.”\n\nSteve Bannon, a popular Trump ally who once served as his chief strategist, followed Musk’s appearance and acknowledged he was not the evening’s top attraction as he took the stage to a far less enthusiastic reception.\n\n“How did I draw the card to follow Elon Musk?” Bannon asked about a man he has frequently criticized as insufficiently loyal to Trump. “C’mon man! You bring out the world’s wealthiest guy, Superman. I’m supposed to follow it?

(1962). \n\nIn 2023 Sarandon was dropped by her Hollywood representative, United Talent Agency, which is run by Jewish CEO Jeremy Zimmer, for her comments.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show star caused controversy after she claimed Jewish people ‘are getting a taste of what it feels like to be Muslim’ amid the war with Hamas at a rally in New York City.\n\nShe then apologized for her remarks, saying that she had not planned to speak at the rally, but had been invited to address the crowd, and had intended to ‘highlight the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza’.\n\nIn an interview with The Times Sarandon has reflected on how the controversy led to the departure of her agent and how she is no longer able to star in mainstream studio films. \n\nShe told the publication: ‘I was dropped by my agency, my projects were pulled. I’ve been used as an example of what not to do if you want to continue to work.\n\n‘There are so many people out of work right now since November of last year… who have lost their jobs as custodians, as writers, as painters, as people working in the cafeteria, substitute teachers who have been fired because they tweeted something, or liked a tweet, or asked for a ceasefire.’\n\nAsked if she would ever be offered a big film role again she replied: ‘I don’t know. Not anything in Hollywood.’ \n\nBack in July 2024 Susan apologized for her remarks, saying her ‘phrasing was a terrible mistake’ while covering the latest issue of Elle Spain.\n\nShe also reiterated her desire to end the ‘genocide’ in Gaza, saying she had long been motivated to stand against injustice.\n\nCovering the magazine, the actress explained that her position has a famous actress is a ‘loudspeaker’ allowing her to bring visibility to social issues.\n\nAccepting that by speaking out she has ensured her blacklisting by a large part of the industry, Susan insisted that everyone had to come together to stop Israelis and Palestinians dying, because ‘no one deserves to die this way.’\n\nShe said: ‘Injustice has always hurt and angered me. I grew up in Washington in the 60s, with the Vietnam War hovering over that time and assassinations like Kennedy or Martin Luther King Jr. overshadowing our culture.\n\n‘I didn’t have to force myself to educate myself in this sense, it was the only plausible option. \n\n‘That’s why I’m so surprised by the misinformation that exists today, at a time when we have everything within our reach. \n\n‘It is up to each of us to stop the genocide that is happening in Gaza, and that means that Israelis and Palestinians stop dying. No one deserves to die this way.\n\n‘I understand that it is hard to accept that we are all part of the problem, but a war like this is only forged with our taxes, with your money and mine.\n\n‘That’s why it’s admirable that countries like Spain, Ireland or Norway raise their voices and say: ‘We don’t want to contribute to this.”\n\nSusan recalled: ‘I realized that my profession carried with it a loudspeaker in the 70s, when the United States introduced the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\n‘At one of the marches I was walking with Marlo Thomas, and she said to me: ‘The only way we are going to be in the news is for you to speak.’ And I did it, scared to death but I did it, because it is the way of life that I conceive.’\n\nSusan has previously protested for the visibility of AIDS, to end the war in Iraq and against gun violence, even being arrested.\n\nShe was arrested in June 2018 at the Women Disobey protests for protesting against Donald Trump’s controversial migrant policy of separating children from their parents.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJessica Lange supported her canceled pal Susan Sarandon as they stepped out&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jessica Lange

become an annual tradition.Trump thanked Black voters for their support in the 2024 presidential election, saying he had \"more votes from black Americans than any Republican president ever.\" When he talked about the possibility of running for a third term -- which he is barred from doing under the US constitution — there were cheers of \"four more years.\"Woods, who was also at the White House

continues a crackdown launched since his inauguration a month ago on so-called diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.At the Pentagon, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned the use of

Agreements With U.S. After Meeting Envoy","text":"February 21, 2025\n\nBy RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service\n\nZelenskyy Stresses Need For Strong Agreements With U.S. After Meeting Envoy\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (L) and U.S. envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg (R). \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast his talks with U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg in a positive light on February 20 despite a further sign of tension when a planned joint news conference was canceled.Zelenskyy said in his evening address that the meeting with Kellogg “restores hope” and reiterated that Ukraine needs strong agreements with the United States.“I gave instructions to work swiftly and very sensibly. Economy and security must always go hand in hand, and the details of the agreements matter -- the better they are structured, the greater the results,” Zelenskyy said.He and Kellogg discussed the situation along the front line, the need to release all Ukrainian prisoners held in Russia, and the need for a reliable and clear system of security guarantees that ensure the war “will never return and that Russians will never again destroy lives.”The meeting, which ended without the planned joint press conference and no comment from Kellogg, came as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes for a quick deal to end the war. Trump alarmed European allies and Ukraine by leaving them out of initial talks with Russia that took place in Saudi Arabia on February 18.\n\nWhat We Learned From High-Stakes U.S.-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia\n\nHe lashed out a day later against the Ukrainian president, suggesting he started the war and calling him a “dictator.”White House national-security adviser Mike Waltz on February 20 tried to shift the narrative back to a potential deal involving Ukraine's rare mineral deposits.\"He needs to come back to the table,\" Waltz said at a press conference at the White House, urging Zelenskyy to reach an agreement soon granting the United States access to the minerals, which are critical in the manufacture of high-tech equipment and batteries for electric cars.Zelenskyy previously rejected a proposal that would reportedly hand the United States $500 billion in mineral wealth, including rare-earth elements, as a form of payment for U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv's defense against the full-scale invasion that Russia launched in February 2022.Zelenskyy has pointed out that the value of U.S. wartime aid so far is far less and that the U.S. proposal did not offer concrete security guarantees.Zelenskyy also spoke by phone on February 20 with French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to discuss the latest diplomatic efforts to end the war.Macron said on X that he used the call to advise Zelenskyy about all the contacts he had made with European partners and allies that are “keen to work toward a lasting and solid peace for Ukraine and to strengthen Europe's security.\"It was his fourth call with Zelenskyy this week. Macron is due to meet Trump in Washington on February 24.Macron said he will urge Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to convince him that the interests of the United States and Europe are in line with one another.\"I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin],\" Macron said.Macron hosted a summit of European heads of state and prime ministers on February 17 to discuss the question of European peacekeeping forces to secure a possible cease-fire.Trump is also expecting a visit from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer next week. the White House said that meeting has been set for February 27.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stressed in his call with Zelenskyy that any deal to end the war must include Kyiv at the negotiating table, his office said.Trudeau reiterated Canada's support for Ukraine and \"emphasized that there can be no sustainable peace in Europe without security for Ukraine,\" according to the statement.British Foreign Secretary David Lammy warned on February 20 that he saw no indication that Russia wants peace in Ukraine after listening to a speech by Russia's top diplomat at a Group of 20 meeting in South Africa.Lammy was speaking to reporters after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov addressed other senior diplomats in a closed-door session at the G20 foreign ministers meeting. No details of Lavrov's speech were released. Lammy referred to it as “the Russian gentleman’s tired fabrications.”Lammy said he was hoping to hear some sympathy for the innocent victims of the aggression or some readiness to seek a durable peace.“What I heard was the logic of imperialism dressed up as a realpolitik,” he said. “I say to you all, we should not be surprised, but neither should we be fooled.”Lammy said that Lavrov left his seat in the meeting room when it was Lammy's turn to speak.Tensions at the meeting were underlined when a photo opportunity for the foreign ministers to pose together for pictures was canceled with no reason given.With reporting by Reuters and AP\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nBy Gulbahor Murodi\n\n3 Tajik Migrants 'Killed In Russian Security Forces Raid'\n\nRelatives identified the suspects as Tajik migrant workers Jovid Jumaev (left), Azizjon Jumaqulzoda (center), and Parviz Rustamov.\n\nThree Tajik migrants have been killed in a Russian security forces raid, relatives and friends said, after local authorities claimed they had uncovered a terrorist plot in Russia's western Pskov region.Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on February 13 that it had “neutralized” three members of an unnamed “international terrorist organization” who had been preparing an attack to “blow up the main railway station” in the provincial capital, Pskov, with makeshift bombs.Footage released by the FSB shows heavily armed law enforcement agents raiding a house where the suspects had allegedly been making explosive devices. The video also depicts knives, nails, several bottles of a flammable chemical, acetone, and other items that the suspects had purportedly gathered to use as components for homemade bombs.The recording also shows the body of a man on the floor, with what appears to be a gunshot wound to his stomach and a rifle beside his right hand.Describing the men as “citizens of one of the Central Asian countries,” the FSB said in a statement that they had been acting “on the instructions of a foreign-based emissary” of a terrorist organization and had planned to flee to “a Near East county” after carrying out the attack.The statement did not name the suspects, but several days later relatives and acquaintances of the men identified them as Tajik migrant workers Azizjon Azamqulzoda, Jovid Jumaev, and Parviz Rustamov.They disputed Russian authorities’ claim that the migrants were members of a foreign terrorist group.Fear Of Backlash“I knew these young men very well, they had so many plans and dreams for the future,” said a Pskov-based Tajik migrant worker, who gave only his first name, Behzod.“No one [among those who knew them] believes that they would be engaged in [terrorist] activity. Also, they were not the kind of people who would do something like this for money,” Behzod said, adding that he believes the Tajik workers “were made scapegoats” by Russian authorities.Bozorboi Azamqulzoda, the father of one of the suspects, told RFE/RL's Central Asian Migrants Unit on February 17 that his son, Azizjon Azamqulzoda wasn’t religious and \"did not pray.\"The three men used to work together as waiters at the Chaikhona restaurant in Pskov, but Rustamov quit to become a taxi driver, while Azamqulzoda found a job at a shopping center.Behzod and several other Tajik workers in Pskov told RFE/RL that the migrant community is concerned about a potential backlash following the FSB announcement.Behzod said many Tajiks are too afraid to leave their homes.\n\nTajik Regime Alarmed As Moscow Terror Attack Fallout Has Migrants Streaming Home\n\nTajik and other Central Asian migrants reported a spike in xenophobic attacks after a terrorist attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue in the Moscow region killed 145 people in March 2024.Russian authorities said the massacre was carried out by four Tajik nationals.Tens of thousands of Central Asians have been deported or denied entry to Russia following the attack.\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nBy Merhat Sharipzhan and\n\nRay Furlong\n\nTrump 'Very Frustrated' With Zelenskyy, U.S. National Security Adviser Says\n\nU.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy meet in Kyiv on February 20.\n\nThe White House national security adviser said that U.S. President Donald Trump is \"obviously very frustrated\" with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and urged the Ukrainian president to reach an agreement soon granting the United States access to Ukraine's critical minerals.The remarks from Michael Waltz came after Zelenskyy and Trump traded sharp criticism in recent days, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" and suggesting he started the war with Russia -- comments that caused concern in Ukraine and Europe and prompted pushback from some senior U.S. Republican lawmakers.\n\nUkraine Needs U.S. Weapons. Trump Wants Its Rare Earth Minerals In Return.\n\nA day earlier, Zelenskyy rejected a proposal that would reportedly hand the United States $500 billion in mineral wealth, including rare-earth elements, as a form of payment for U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion, which enters its fourth year next week.\"He needs to come back to the table,\" Waltz said at a press conference at the White House on February 20.Zelenskyy has pointed out that U.S. wartime aid so far was far less than that amount and that the U.S. proposal did not offer concrete security guarantees.Trump's harshest criticism to date of Zelenskyy came after Zelenskyy charged that Trump was pushing “a lot of information that is coming from Russia” and that the United States was helping Russia \"break out of years of isolation\" by holding high-level talks in Riyadh on February 18 and moving toward normalizing relations.\n\nCan The U.S. And Russia Impose A Peace Deal On Ukraine?\n\nThe bilateral U.S.-Russia talks, on the war in Ukraine and other issues, stoked worried in Ukraine and among some of its backers that Kyiv could be sidelined from negotiations and pressured to accept a cease-fire or peace deal that would favor Russia.French President Emmanuel Macron said he will travel to Washington, where he will urge Trump to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to convince him that the interests of the United States and Europe are in line with one another.\"I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of [Putin],\" Macron said. The White House said that Trump will host Macron on February 24 and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on February 27.Zelenskyy struck a conciliatory tone following what he called a \"productive meeting\" on February 20 with Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, who is on his first visit to Ukraine.The pair had \"a good discussion, [covering] many important details,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. \"I am grateful to the United States for all the assistance and bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg\n\n\"Ukraine is ready for a strong, effective investment and security agreement with the President of the United States,\" he wrote, adding, \"Strong Ukraine-U.S. relations benefit the entire world.\"However, a joint press conference by Zelenskyy and Kellogg was canceled, and there was no immediate comment from Kellogg after the meeting.Meanwhile, several senior U.S. Republican lawmakers have been pushing back against Trump's recent criticism of Zelenskyy. They worry that signaling a willingness to cut off support for Kyiv could embolden Putin.\n\nTrump Repeats Harsh Criticism Of Zelenskyy, Says He Could Have Attended Riyadh Talks\n\nTrump's framing of Zelenskyy in negative terms stands in stark contrast to those Senate Republicans who view Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression.They voiced strong support for Ukraine on February 19 and warned against appeasing Moscow.Senator John Kennedy (Republican-Louisiana) did not mince words when addressing the threat posed by Putin, describing him as \"a gangster with a black heart...who makes Jeffrey Dahmer (a notorious serial killer) look like Mother Teresa.\"\"It is Vladimir Putin who started the war.\" Kennedy said. \"I also believe through bitter experience that Vladimir Putin is a gangster…. He has Stalin's taste for blood.\"\n\nUkraine Invasion: News & Analysis\nRFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps.

Children were among the injured.After Trump called Zelenskyy a \"dictator without elections,\" the head of the Ukrainian Central Election Commission, Oleh Didenko, said in an interview with RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, that talk of elections in Ukraine only benefits Russia.“This issue is being raised in order to undermine the legitimacy of the government in Ukraine, to weaken confidence in the government, to weaken support for Ukraine from international partners,” he said.Trump also wrote that \"we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia.\" He added that Zelenskyy “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”Trump’s remarks came after Zelenskyy accused Trump of living in a Russian “disinformation bubble” and said he would like Trump’s team to be “more truthful.”Senator Thom Tillis (Republican-North Carolina) disagreed with Trump's characterization of Zelenskyy as a \"dictator,\" although he avoided directly criticizing Trump.\"It's not a word I would use,\" he said, adding that there is \"no moral equivalency between Vladimir Putin and President Zelenskyy.\"\"Clearly, Vladimir Putin is responsible for this war,\" Tillis told reporters in Washington on February 19. \"His decision has resulted in the murder, rape, torture and kidnapping of untold numbers of Ukrainians. He owns responsibility for this war.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune (Republican-North Dakota) also declined to criticize Trump for his remarks.\"The president speaks for himself,\" he told reporters. \"I think what I'm in support of is a peaceful outcome and result in Ukraine… And I think right now, the administration, the president and his team are working to achieve that.\"Although Zelenskyy's presidential mandate was due to expire in May 2024, the constitution bars elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion and has repeatedly extended.With reporting by VoA, ABC, and Forbes\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nBy Maksym Savchuk,\n\nAnna Myroniuk and\n\nHow Norway Fed Russia's War Machine Despite EU Sanctions\n\nThe Kremlin's war on Ukraine has dented the vehicle stocks of the Russian military, which has increasingly relied on civilian trucks since its full-scale invasion three years ago this month -- including for the transport of equipment and personnel.U.S. and EU sanctions imposed not long after the February 2022 invasion aimed to choke off the supply of Western automotive parts that could help keep Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military humming.But a leading Norwegian automotive supplier has exported millions of dollars in truck parts that ended up feeding Russia’s war machine via a Turkish intermediary, which resold them in circumvention of EU sanctions, an investigation by Schemes, the investigative unit of RFE/RL’s Ukrainian Service, and Norwegian public broadcaster NRK has found.Kongsberg Automotive, based in Kongsberg in southern Norway, is a major supplier of parts to leading car brands like Volvo, Ford, Scania, and Jaguar Land Rover. It says it halted all direct exports to Russia in 2022 on its own initiative, calling sales to an “aggressor” state “immoral and reprehensible.”\n\nSpain Uncovers Tons Of Chemicals Destined For Russia, RFE/RL Learns\n\nBut leaked Russian customs records obtained by Schemes show that at least 126 shipments of Kongsberg Automotive parts were made to Russia from July 2022 to April 2024 by Hidirusta Otomotiv, one of the Norwegian company’s customers in Turkey, which has not joined the Western sanctions coalition targeting Moscow.The total listed value of these shipments was around $2.8 million, the leaked records show.The roundabout route of the Norwegian company’s vehicle parts highlights the difficulties Western governments have faced in using sanctions to stem the flow of equipment and electronics critical to the Russian military.Prior to Russia’s February 2022 invasion, Istanbul-based Hidirusta Otomotiv had no recorded shipments to Russia, according to records from the commercial customs-data aggregator ImportGenius. That changed seemingly overnight: By 2023, Russia had become the Turkish firm’s largest market -- and remains so today, ImportGenius records show.Most of Hidirusta Otomotiv’s shipments to Russia consisted of Kongsberg Automotive parts it bought from other resellers, while it imported the rest directly from the Norwegian company.Hidirusta Otomotiv did not respond to a request for comment. Kongsberg Automotive called the resale of its parts into Russia “unacceptable and contrary to our values.”Norwegian Parts, Russian War MachineWhile most Hidirusta Otomotiv shipments of Kongsberg Automotive parts were sent to Russian companies involved in truck repairs or transportation services, two -- A.P.R. and Gruzavtozapchast-36 -- have documented commercial ties to Russian defense firms.A.P.R. supplied car parts to Orenburgagrosnabtekhservis, a partner of one of Russia’s oldest and largest machine-building and metallurgical enterprises, Kirovsky Zavod, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2023.\n\nChina Supplying Key Chemicals For Russian Missiles, RFE/RL Investigation Finds\n\nOne of Kirovsky Zavod’s subsidiaries, St. Petersburg-based Universalmash, provides parts for Russian military hardware the Kremlin has deployed in Ukraine.Gruzavtozapchast-36, meanwhile, has ties to Baltic Leasing, a Russian company that last year supplied bulldozers to one of Russia’s largest military training facilities, which has been under Ukrainian sanctions since 2023.Neither A.P.R. nor Gruzavtozapchast-36 responded to requests for comment in time for publication.Launching Attack DronesCivilian vans and trucks have become increasingly vital to Russia's war effort due to the toll taken on its military vehicles during the all-out invasion, according to Aage Borchgrevink, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and a sanctions project coordinator.“The war in Ukraine is very much about logistics. The entire Russian economy is geared toward producing the goods and services that will make this war possible. One of the most important things here are trucks and car parts,” Borchgrevink said.Moreover, civilian trucks can be used not only for transportation but also for launching attack drones like Iranian-made Shahed-136, which Russia actively uses in its strikes on Ukraine. In March 2022, the Iranian military-focused outlet IMA Media published a video detailing how this works.\n\n“To keep the wheels turning -- literally -- Russia needed an entirely new fleet of trucks, which then required spare parts,” Borchgrevink said.Research by the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and the Norwegian risk-analysis firm Corisk shows that Russia’s truck imports surged in the winter of 2023. Since then, Moscow has increased its truck imports tenfold, according to a Corisk report, a move aimed at sustaining battlefield logistics despite severe Western sanctions.Corisk researcher Erlend Bollman Bjortvedt said Russia increasingly relies on civilian vehicles to transport “everything from food to ammunition and grenades to the front lines.”Russian media reports echoed this trend, urging citizens to donate civilian vehicles to the war effort, citing a severe shortage caused by Ukraine’s extensive use of drones.“Just one small part can cause a truck to malfunction. So when you're a Western company and you produce perhaps small parts that look innocent, a rubber ring for a few dollars or a ball bearing, it can be that small part that actually makes a defective truck start working again,” Bjortvedt said.Negligence Or Sanctions Evasion?Confronted with these findings, Kongsberg Automotive distanced itself from the transactions, stating that it ceased direct sales to Russia in 2022.In a written response, the Norwegian company said: “We believe that it is unacceptable and sad if our products end up in places where sanctions apply. The alleged resale by our customers is unacceptable and contrary to our values.”\n\nUkraine Invasion: News & Analysis\nRFE/RL's Ukraine Live Briefing gives you the latest developments on Russia's invasion, Western military aid, the plight of civilians, and territorial control maps. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here. \nKongsberg Automotive, however, argued that tracking products after sale is difficult.“Once we sell our goods, we lose ownership and control over the supply chain if they are resold multiple times, as seems to be the case here,” the company said.Kongsberg also expressed shock that Hidirusta Otomotiv had resold such a high volume of its parts to Russia, saying it failed to properly vet its Turkish customer and claimed it did not know Hidirusta’s largest export market is Russia.“We could have had better routines in place during the onboarding process,” Kongsberg said.Following Schemes and NRK’s inquiries, the Norwegian manufacturer said it had terminated the relationship with Hidirusta Otomotiv and instructed all its customers to stop dealing with the Turkish firm. Moreover, the company said it now requires aftermarket customers to sign contractual commitments to uphold sanctions.Legal experts say Kongsberg Automotive could face consequences if authorities determine it failed to conduct proper due diligence.The obligation to check sanctions compliance falls on the authorities of the respective EU member states. In Norway, it is the Police Security Service (PST).PST deputy head Inga Bejer Engh said a company can be punished -- including criminally -- if it fails to do enough to learn that its customer is violating sanctions.Engh said she is unfamiliar with the Kongsberg Automotive case and that it would depend on whether the necessary degree of culpability has been demonstrated.“To decide what constitutes prudent conduct, you have to ask yourself how an ordinarily reasonable and conscientious person would have acted in the same situation. To be punished for negligent breach of the sanctions rules, the company must therefore have acted differently from what can be expected of an ordinarily reasonable and conscientious company,” Stian Oby Johansen, an associate professor at the University of Oslo’s Department of Public Law, said.Experts say Turkey is widely recognized as a sanctions loophole, meaning companies exporting goods there should exercise heightened scrutiny over potential resales to Russia.Borchgrevink of the Norwegian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights said it was “disheartening” that Kongsberg Automotive appeared to “put in significantly less effort to track their goods and prevent these situations from occurring.”After reviewing the findings of the Schemes and NRK, Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy's sanctions policy commissioner, Vladyslav Vlasiuk, said the case “casts a shadow over the entire sanctions policy and its effectiveness in the EU.”\n\nVladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's point man on sanctions, says the Kongsberg Automotive case “casts a shadow over the entire sanctions policy and its effectiveness in the EU.”\n\n“Spare parts for trucks in particular are what help Russia to be strong on the battlefield. That's why this is a problem,” Vlasiuk said.Oleh Symoroz, a 28-year-old veteran soldier who became an anti-corruption activist after a severe battlefield injury, said he wonders if the EU and its member states do enough to enforce sanctions.“Western countries, including Norway, can make sanctions effective. And if they had used that power, these sales to Russia would not have happened,” he said.\n\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nTrump Repeats Harsh Criticism Of Zelenskyy, Says He Could Have Attended Riyadh Talks\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks with journalists on Air Force One en route from Florida to the White House on February 19. \n\nU.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying again that he has done a terrible job and asserting that he could have attended talks with Russia this week in Saudi Arabia if he had wanted to.Trump’s comments on February 19 at a meeting in Miami of business executives hosted by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund followed similar harsh criticism of Zelenskyy earlier in the day.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Zelenskyy was “A Dictator without Elections” and warned that he “better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"In his speech in Miami, he asserted that Zelenskyy was misusing American aid intended for the war effort and had taken advantage of President Joe Biden's administration.Earlier on Truth Social he said: \"Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going,\" apparently referring to Western aid.\n\nExcluded From Talks, Bruised By Trump, Zelenskyy Calls For ‘More Truth’\n\nThose comments appeared to be a response to Zelenskyy's charge that Trump \"lives in this disinformation space” fostered by Moscow. “We have seen this disinformation,\" Zelenskyy said early on February 19. \"We understand that it is coming from Russia.”Zelenskyy made those comments after Trump seemed to blame him for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, saying he was “disappointed” that Zelenskyy had complained about being frozen out of the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war.Zelenskyy reiterated his concerns over U.S.-Russian talks held in Saudi Arabia on ending Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine launched almost three years ago.He said that the previous day's high-level talks in Riyadh involving U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, were aimed at \"taking [Russian President Vladimir] Putin out of isolation,\" and could potentially lead to a shift in the geopolitical dynamics, with implications for Ukraine's security.\"The United States helped Putin to get out of a multiyear isolation.... Putin and Russians are very happy about it,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"yesterday there was a hint that Russia is a victim, which is something new.\"Zelenskyy said when the talks were announced that Ukraine was not invited to take part.Returning from Miami late on February 19, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that the Russians have \"taken a lot of territory, so they have the cards\" in negotiations on ending the war in Ukraine.Trump, who pushed for the Riyadh talks as part of an effort bring the fighting to a close, responded to Zelenskyy's comments with the extensive social media post in which he again raised the lack of elections in Ukraine, echoing Putin.\n\nU.S. Call For Elections In Ukraine: A Step Toward Peace Or A Gift To Putin? \n\nUkraine has not been able to hold elections because it remains under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and which has been repeatedly extended.Zelenskyy's five-year term was due to end in May 2024 after elections in March, and Putin has said he would not negotiate with the Ukrainian president because he would not have the authority to sign a peace deal.Some members of Congress said Trump’s comments were insulting to the thousands of Ukrainians who have died in the war.Senator Richard Blumenthal (Democrat-Connecticut) said Trump had “disregarded the truth and the sacrifice of brave men and women who are upholding their freedom and ours. Their fight is our fight, and the president’s surrender is pathetic and weak.”\n\nHow Realistic Is A European Peace-Keeping Force In Ukraine?\n\nSenator Chris Coons (Democrat-Delaware) said other Republicans in the Senate know that Putin is not our partner. Trump risks becoming known as “the biggest loser of the 21st century” if he doesn’t demand Putin stop the war by threatening increased sanctions and even more weapons to Ukraine, Coons said on U.S. broadcaster MSNBC.John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security-adviser during his first term in office, said Trump’s characterizations of Zelenskyy and Ukraine \"are some of the most shameful remarks ever made by a US President.\" He added on X: \"Our support of Ukraine has never been about charity, our way of life at home depends on our strength abroad.\"Trump's remarks also drew condemnation from European leaders, including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. Scholz called the dictator accusation \"wrong and dangerous,\" and Baerbock said the people in Europe who live \"in the conditions of a dictatorship\" are in Russia and Belarus.U.S. Vice President JD Vance warned in an interview on February 19 with the Daily Mail that Zelenskyy's criticism of Trump would backfire.\"The idea that Zelenskyy is going to change the president's mind by badmouthing him in public media -- everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,\" Vance said.\n\nFebruary 19, 2025\n\nTrump Calls Zelenskyy 'Dictator Without Elections,' Urges Him To 'Move Fast'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talks to reporters in Kyiv on February 19.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling him a \"dictator\" who risks losing his country if he does not \"move fast.\"In his harshest public criticism of the Ukrainian leader to date, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on February 19, \"A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.\"Ukraine’s constitution bars it from holding elections under martial law, which was imposed when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and continues to this day after repeated extensions.Zelenskyy's five-year term was due to end in May 2024 after elections in March, and Putin has said he would not negotiate with the Ukrainian president because he would not have the authority to sign a peace deal.Trump wrote that \"Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the 'gravy train' going,\" apparently referring to Western aid. \"I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died.\"\n\nWhat We Learned From High-Stakes U.S.-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia\n\nTrump's statement comes hours after Zelenskyy reiterated concerns over U.S.-Russian talks held in Saudi Arabia on ending Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine launched almost three years ago.At a press conference in Kyiv earlier in the day, Zelenskyy said that the previous day's high-level talks in Riyadh, involving U.S. Secretary of State Marc Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, were aimed at \"taking [Russian President Vladimir] Putin out of isolation,\" and could potentially lead to a shift in the geopolitical dynamics, with implications for Ukraine's security.\"The United States helped Putin to get out of a multiyear isolation....Putin and Russians are very happy about it,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that \"yesterday there was a hint that Russia is a victim, which is something new.\"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed support for Zelenskyy as the democratically elected leader of Ukraine. The British government's press service said Starmer spoke with Zelenskyy by phone, saying that it was \"quite sensible to suspend elections during wartime\" as Britain did during World War II.The British prime minister reiterated his support for US-led efforts to establish a lasting peace in Ukraine that would deter Russia from any future aggression.Zelenskyy said later on Telegram that Britain's role in strengthening Europe's defense and security is very important to Ukraine.\"We discussed future prospects and opportunities. The support of Great Britain is extremely important, and we will never forget the respect of the British people for Ukraine and our citizens,\" Zelenskyy said.A day earlier, Trump seemed to blame him for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, saying he was “disappointed” that Zelenskyy had complained about being frozen out of the U.S.-Russia talks on ending the war.\"Today I heard, oh, well, we weren't invited. Well, you've been there for three years,\" Trump said, referring to Ukraine. \"You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.\"Zelenskyy, however, said on February 19 that he would like \"to have more truth\" from the Trump administration.\n\nTrump Appears To Blame Ukraine For War But 'Confident' Of Reaching Peace Deal\n\nTrump's remarks on February 19 drew condemnation from German leaders, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling the dictator accusation \"wrong and dangerous\" and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock saying it was \"absurd.\"\"If you look at the real world...then you know who in Europe has to live in the conditions of a dictatorship: people in Russia, people in Belarus,\" Baerbock said in an interview with broadcaster ZDF.U.S. Vice President JD Vance, in an interview with the Daily Mail, warned that Zelenskyy's criticism of Trump would backfire.\"The idea that Zelenskyy is going to change the president's mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the president will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration,\" Vance said.At a press conference in Florida after the Riyadh discussions on February 18, Trump did not clarify what he meant when he made his remarks but he has often blamed the war on Ukraine's desire to join NATO, and has said the full-scale invasion could have been avoided or ended quickly through negotiations.Experts say Russia's full-scale invasion was driven by Putin's imperial ambitions rather than Ukraine's NATO ambition, which had little support from the West at the time.Zelenskyy brought up the Western alliance at his press conference on February 19, pointing out that there were limited avenues available for securing security guarantees for his country's sovereignty.\"I have insisted [on Ukraine's membership in] NATO, but you know what the answers have been,\" he said, suggesting that the path to joining the Western military alliance remains obstructed.\"The safety guarantees fully depend on our partners,\" he added, reiterating that Ukraine's security relies heavily on Western support.Despite the geopolitical challenges, Zelenskyy signaled his readiness to engage in discussions, but emphasized Ukraine's need for robust defense assistance, saying his country was \"ready for talks, for a dialogue. What we need is a defense which can be provided by the West.\"\"Our army is different than it used to be at the beginning of Russia's aggression,\" he added. \"Now, our army is the strongest in Europe. We can talk confidently with our partners and foes.\" He again emphasized the need for Kyiv to be involved in any negotiations concerning the war, saying that \"no deal is possible without us.\"Responding to a question from a journalist about Trump's desire to have compensation in exchange for hundreds of billions of dollars in assistance it has received from the United States, Zelenskyy indicated that he was open to discussions regarding access to Ukraine's mineral resources, but stressed the need for meaningful negotiations as well tangible security guarantees.\"It is not a serious talk when the figure of $500 billion appears as a volume of assistance Ukraine received. I am representing Ukraine, and I cannot sell Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nUkraine Needs U.S. Weapons. Trump Wants Its Rare Earth Minerals In Return.\n\nZelenskyy also called on the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, who is visiting Kyiv on February 19, to personally meet with Ukrainian people, \"especially our military personnel fighting to stop Russia's invasion\" to find out what they think about the situation, Ukraine's current leadership, Trump's statements, and the talks in Saudi Arabia.Kellogg's visit to the Ukrainian capital comes after Trump said that he now feels \"much more confident\" of reaching a deal to end the conflict in Ukraine following the Riyadh discussions on February 18, which saw Moscow and Washington agreeing to establish teams to negotiate a path to ending the war.\"I think I have the power to end this war,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\nKey Takeaways From Saudi Meeting\nBy Mike Eckel, RFE/RL senior international correspondent(Diplomatic) Boots On The Ground.

The decision affected numerous businesses and nonprofit groups in Ukraine, which are now struggling to cope. It also affected aid programs for people in Afghanistan.\n\nUkraine Feels The Shockwaves As USAID Cuts Start To Bite\n\nTrump and Musk touched on the move during their first joint TV interview, which aired on February 18 on Fox News, a conservative U.S. news outlet. Trump said he took the step to freeze USAID's funding because his predecessor, President Joe Biden, overspent, including on foreign aid that he said did not serve U.S. interests, and widened the deficit.Since 2022, USAID has provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in humanitarian aid, development assistance, and direct budget support. Musk and Trump were not asked about the suspension of aid to the programs in Ukraine during the interview or Trump's diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.The interview focused more on Trump's relationship with Musk, the world’s richest man, and why he chose him to head DOGE.“I know a lot of businessmen and they are not necessarily good people,” Trump said. Musk is a great person who “wants to see the country do well,” Trump told Fox News interviewer Sean Hannity, who is a friend of the president.DOGE has been rooting out government waste, fraud, and abuse, Trump said, and has already saved American taxpayers millions of dollars.Since Trump returned to office on January 20, DOGE has gone from department to department, laying off or firing thousands of government employees in a major shakeup of the federal government designed to cut costs and shrink its size. A list of programs that have been identified, some costing hundreds of millions of dollars, scrolled on the screen during the joint interview.Musk said he took the role to reduce the bureaucracy and prevent the United States from going bankrupt.“The goal is to try to get a trillion dollars out of the deficit,” Musk said, claiming that Trump “was handed a two-trillion deficit when he came to office.”Musk said the average American taxpayer should be “mad as hell” over the way their tax dollars have been spent.He said some of the people on his DOGE team, which has come under withering criticism from Democrats for taking what they say is illegal actions as it slashes programs, are federal employees. Others are software engineers who could be earning million-dollar salaries but have instead opted to work for him.\n\nTrump's USAID Reform Causes Alarm As Musk Weighs In On Foreign Aid\n\nThe president said Musk has only been implementing his executive orders, and vowed that traditional programs such as Social Security and the government-funded health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid “won’t be touched” by the cuts.However, the arrival of DOGE employees this week at the Social Security Administration prompted the abrupt resignation of its chief over an apparent clash with Musk's cost-cutting team. Other senior federal officials have resigned when confronted with DOGE’s scorched-earth approach to federal spending.Trump also said that Musk has not asked him for any favors for his companies -- namely SpaceX, which holds multiple contracts with the U.S. government, and Tesla, which has benefited from U.S. subsidies to promote electric vehicles.Musk said he would recuse himself if he’s ever confronted with a situation involving his businesses, and Trump said, “If there’s ever a conflict, he won’t be involved.”Musk told Hannity he has paid a price for his support for Trump but intends to continue.“I’m a technologist and I try to make technologies that help people and improve the world,” said Musk, who wore a sport coat over a T-shirt with the words Tech Support across the front.Trump said he has always respected Musk, but his admiration for him grew when he opened the use of Starlink communications satellites to people in North Carolina whose communities had been devastated by a hurricane last year.His admiration only grew when SpaceX was able to return a rocket to Earth and be grasped out of the air “like a beautiful little baby,” and he decided he wanted him on his team.\n\nFebruary 18, 2025\n\nBy Reid Standish\n\nWhat We Learned From High-Stakes U.S.-Russia Talks In Saudi Arabia\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio (right), Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (left), and Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov attend talks in Riyadh on February 18. \n\nTop U.S. and Russian officials have finished their first talks on ending the war in Ukraine, with the Kremlin voicing new demands as Washington and Moscow agreed to move quickly to normalize their ties and begin negotiations around the nearly three-year conflict.The more than four-hour meeting in Riyadh -- which was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov -- is part of a major diplomatic push by the United States to bring the war to an end. The discussions were framed by U.S. officials as exploratory talks that could pave the way for a potential in-person meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Rubio told reporters after the February 18 meeting in the Saudi capital that the talks were \"the first step of a long and difficult journey\" over ending the war in Ukraine and that the U.S. and Russian delegations agreed on four principles during their discussions.These comprise fully restoring their diplomatic missions in Washington and Moscow after years of sanctions and expulsions, appointing a high-level team to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, exploring further \"geopolitical and economic cooperation that could result from an end to the conflict in Ukraine,\" and ensuring that the U.S. and Russian delegations present in Riyadh will remain engaged in discussions moving forward.\n\nFrance Prepares To Host Second Ukraine War Summit\n\nLavrov called the meeting \"very useful\" and said Moscow would aim to appoint a special envoy as soon as possible.\"I have every reason to believe that the American side understands our position,\" Lavrov said.Russia's chief foreign policy adviser, Yury Ushakov, who was part of the country's delegation, added that the two sides briefly discussed the conditions needed for a Putin-Trump summit. However, he added that the decision to begin deeper talks with the United States about Ukraine would ultimately rest with Putin himself.\"It's useful for the Trump administration's senior national-security team to hear these Russian positions and they can take them back to the president,\" John Deni, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told RFE/RL. \"It's still too early to know what the Russians might be willing to give up or hold onto.\"\n\nKey Takeaways From Saudi Meeting\nBy Mike Eckel, RFE/RL senior international correspondent(Diplomatic) Boots On The Ground. The two sides agreed to re-staff their diplomatic posts in Washington and Moscow. It's a diplomatic spat that predates the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, stretching into the first Trump administration (dozens expelled on both sides), and even the Obama administration, which also shuttered two diplomatic compounds in the States. Putting more diplomats on the ground is, by all accounts, fairly noncontroversial. For its part, the Kremlin signaled prior to Riyadh it wants those compounds back.Give Peace A Chance. The delegations agreed to create a high-level team to focus specifically on the Ukraine conflict. But the devil is in the details: Is NATO membership off the table? European peacekeepers? More weapons for Kyiv? Fewer sanctions for Moscow? We won't get any hints of what's on the table for weeks. Something else to watch: a side comment made earlier by Putin in the Kremlin readout of his call with Trump, which referenced \"root causes\" of the Ukraine war. If it pops up again, it may augur bad news for Ukrainian independence or autonomy.'Closer Relations And Economic Cooperation.' That can mean pretty much anything, but one bit of low-hanging fruit for closer relations is space cooperation. Russia and the United States for years largely succeeded in shielding their joint space work from politics. That's atrophied in recent years. Signing a new agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, would be an easy, noncontroversial move. \nWhat Came From The Meetings?The meeting appears to have laid the foundation for future talks between Moscow and Washington, with both Rubio and Lavrov saying each side will restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow to create missions to support Ukraine peace talks, bilateral relations, and cooperation more broadly.In a statement, the U.S. State Department said delegations from both countries have agreed to \"address irritants\" in their ties with the goal of normalizing diplomatic relations after years of tensions.Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said both countries will explore \"future cooperation\" but cautioned an exact timeline still remains unclear, noting, \"One phone call followed by one meeting is not sufficient to establish enduring peace.\"She added the Riyadh talks are an early step in a longer process.Lavrov said the two sides \"practically agreed\" that they need to resolve issues concerning the functioning of diplomatic missions.On Ukraine, he said there was \"a mutual desire\" to find solutions and Russia will wait for the United States to appoint its representatives.\"After that, relevant consultations will begin and will be regular,\" he said.The Russian foreign minister added the potential of any deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine -- which has been floated by some Western governments -- would be a \"completely unacceptable\" proposal for the Kremlin.Separately, Russian officials said a long-term peace deal in Ukraine will not be possible without addressing a wider range of security concerns across Europe.\n\nUkraine Live Briefing: France Hosts Second Summit On Ukraine In 3 Days\n\n\"A comprehensive long-term settlement is impossible without a comprehensive consideration of security issues on the continent,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on February 18.Peskov also said Putin would be open to talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"if necessary.\"Putin had previously said he was unwilling to negotiate with Zelenskyy because his rule is \"illegitimate,\" in part because Ukraine has not held elections since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly three years ago.Speaking in Moscow, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow wants NATO to disavow its 2008 promise to one day give Ukraine membership of the military alliance, and for Kyiv to agree to neutrality.What Happens Next?Both sides all agreed to appoint envoys and continue talks moving forward. Rubio also hinted at a role for the EU further down the line, saying that \"there are other parties that have sanctions, the European Union is going to have to be at the table at some point, because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed.\"Jana Puglierin, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said both Kyiv and its European allies have watched anxiously from the sidelines as U.S. and Russian officials met in Riyadh and worries are high in Ukraine and European capitals that Trump could cut a hasty deal with Moscow that ignores their security interests.\n\nWhy Is Saudi Arabia Hosting U.S.-Russia Talks? And Why Now?\n\nShe says European leaders are currently grappling with multiple \"turning points\" set off by Russia launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as well as recent comments by top U.S. officials suggesting Europe will need to play a larger part in security issues.\"February 2022 destroyed our faith in a collective security order with Russia and showed us the dark side of our fundamental dependence on Russia and China in critical areas,\" she said. \"February 2025 shows us that the Americans no longer feel responsible for European security -- and that their interests are fundamentally different from ours.\"European leaders held emergency talks in Paris on February 17 to discuss the war in Ukraine and European security matters but were unable to reach any agreement.Following the meeting in Saudi Arabia, U.S. national-security adviser Michael Waltz said any postwar peace guarantee would have to be \"European-led,\" echoing calls by U.S. officials for European allies to increase defense spending and praising Britain and France for \"talking about contributing more forcefully to Ukraine's security.\"Zeleneskyy has criticized the talks due to their lack of a Ukrainian representative and he called for \"fair\" peace talks about ending the war, arguing they should also involve the European Union, Turkey, and Britain.The Atlantic Council's Deni said any potential settlement that can be reached is still likely far off and will require further discussions with Ukraine and European governments.He added the meeting in Riyadh should be seen as the latest U.S. attempt to reset relations with Russia, following similar efforts by former President George W. Bush in 2001 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Each of those diplomatic pushes ended with strained ties and new geopolitical flashpoints in Georgia and Ukraine.\"At a certain point you need to speak to your adversary and diplomacy needs to be in the U.S. toolbox,\" Deni said. \"Reset efforts make sense, but in the past they've ended in disappointment.\"\n\nFebruary 18, 2025\n\nBy RFE/RL's Radio Farda\n\nIran Charges Detained British Couple With Espionage\n\nCraig and Lindsay Foreman had reportedly been on a motorbiking trip across the world when they were arrested in Iran.

And Why Now?\n\nThree safe zones would be designated within Gaza under the plan during an initial six-month period.

Possible funding matters are high up on the agenda.On February 4, Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House news conference that \"the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it.\"Trump said Palestinians currently living there would be resettled permanently to Arab nations in the region and that the United States would lead an effort to turn Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East.”More than 2.3 million people live in the Gaza Strip, although most have been displaced following 16 months of attacks by the Israeli military, which has vowed to wipe out the influence of Hamas -- the U.S.- and European Union-designated terrorist organization that ruled the territory.Palestinians have widely said they would not leave their homeland.Media reports have stated that Saudi Arabia is leading an urgen","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cast his talks with U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg in a positive light on February 20 despite a further sign of tension when a planned joint news conference was canceled.","url":"https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskyy-zelenskiy-kellogg-trump-ukraine-putin-macron-trudeau/33322572.html","image":"https://gdb.rferl.org/dbe1ca44-75f5-4746-b701-08dd4a80fec4_cx5_cy1_cw88_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:35:13","author":"Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service","authors":["Rfe/rl's Ukrainian Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"iq","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":292704634,"title":"IRS Taxpayer Data Is Tightly Restricted By Law. Will This Stop Trump, Musk And DOGE From Gaining Access?","text":"A view of the Internal Revenue Service's headquarters March 24, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) raised eyebrows when it requested access to sensitive taxpayer data at the IRS. According to various reports, DOGE is seeking access to the Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS). You can think of the IDRS as a master file, which includes tax returns and other taxpayer information, including bank records.\n\nTaxpayers and tax professionals alike have expressed concerns about the safety of their data. Some have even suggested that they will not file or pay their taxes until the matter is resolved. In addition to concerns about whether allowing access is legal, taxpayers worry about the privacy of their data and whether that data may be leaked or used in the private sector. Here's what you need to know about taxpayer privacy.\n\nCurrent Law\n\nToday, section 6103 of the tax code prohibits federal employees from sharing tax returns and tax return information with third parties—some exceptions may apply, including disclosures to other federal agencies. This is a broad prohibition–it doesn’t just include copying and sending information. It also means discussions about returns, including something as simple as whether a taxpayer has filed a tax return, is prohibited. That’s why attorneys, accountants and other tax professionals have to provide the IRS with signed taxpayer authorizations before they can discuss taxpayer issues with the IRS, as well as why your mortgage company or student lender will ask for authorization before asking the IRS to confirm financial information.\n\n(For purposes of this and related statutes, the definition of tax return and tax return information is very broad.)\n\nThose with access to data as part of their jobs–like IRS employees–have strict rules about what they can access or share. IRS employees are barred from viewing or disclosing taxpayer data unless they are expressly authorized to do so. Under section 7213A of the tax code, it is unlawful for any federal officer, employee, or other authorized viewer to willfully inspect a return or return information for an unauthorized purpose.\n\nThe bottom line is that they may inspect or disclose tax return information only when their \"official duties require such inspection or disclosure for tax administration purposes.” To make sure that IRS employees follow the rules, they are subject to annual UNAX (authorized access) training and testing. One IRS employee told me, \"As an IRS employee, I swore to uphold the confidentiality of this data and would have been immediately fired for accessing anything not directly involved with work on a specific case.\" Beyond firing, rule breakers risk criminal and civil penalties.\n\nIn fact, an IRS employee can’t even use the system to browse their own data. They also can’t look up information on friends or relatives, or (needless to say) a famous person just to satisfy their curiosity. Diving into Taylor Swift's returns, for example, is grounds for dismissal and prosecution, even if the employee never shares what they learned with anyone else.\n\nTo make sure that IRS employees follow the rules, digital trails track access. There’s a record of who–and in most cases why–records are accessed.\n\nHeightened controls mean that disclosures and data breaches are relatively rare compared to the vast amount of data available. In 2023, a federal contractor, Charles Edward Littlejohn, pleaded guilty to unauthorized disclosure of tax return and return information—a violation of section 7213(a)(1) of the tax code, the most serious offense for leaking tax information. His punishment was swift and severe. In January of 2024, Littlejohn was sentenced to five years in prison (the maximum sentence) for disclosing thousands of tax returns—including Donald Trump's—without authorization.\n\nIn addition, if a taxpayer’s information is improperly inspected or disclosed, they can bring a civil lawsuit to recover damages. By statute, if the accused person is a U.S. officer or employee, you can sue the government in federal district court. If the accused person is not a U.S. officer or employee, you can sue the individual.\n\n(After Littlejohn's disclosures, billionaire Ken Griffin sued the government for damages. In that case, the IRS argued for a dismissal based on the fact that Littlejohn was a contractor and not an officer or employee of the federal government. The matter was eventually settled out of court and included a public apology from the IRS.)\n\nDamages are limited under section 7431(c) of the tax code to the greater of $1,000 for each act of unauthorized inspection or disclosure or the actual economic damages. But the wronged taxpayer may also be entitled to punitive damages if the disclosure was willful, as well as costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n\nMoreover, it’s not just taxpayers’ privacy that’s explicitly protected by law. Thanks to the Nixon scandal (more on that in a moment), it’s now against the law for many political officials within the Executive Branch—including the President, Vice President, and any employee of the Executive Office of the President—to request an audit or investigation of a taxpayer or interfere with an ongoing taxpayer audit or investigation. This law (found in section 7217 of the tax code) also applies to indirect interference—for example, if the President instructs another person to request or interfere with an audit. Violating section 7217 is punishable by a fine or imprisonment.\n\nThere are several exceptions to tax disclosure laws. Those include sharing information with state agencies responsible for tax administration (this must be done in writing) or with law enforcement agencies pursuant to a court order to investigate non-tax crimes. Exceptions also apply if the Social Security Administration needs information to carry out its responsibilities, including information about your tax liability.\n\nTo make sure that these disclosures are proper, each year, the IRS is required to furnish the Joint Committee on Taxation with a report of all agencies receiving returns and return information, the number of cases in which disclosures were made to them during the year, and the general purposes for which the requests were made. Approximately 11 billion allowable, routine disclosures (including to state agencies) were made that were required to be accounted for in 2017—by 2021, that number had escalated to over 27 billion.\n\nA Little History\n\nWhile we largely assume taxpayer privacy is a given, that hasn't always been the case. Prior to 1976, tax returns were considered public records, and disclosure was permitted under statute or executive order and Treasury regulations. That had been the case more or less since 1924—under the Revenue Act of 1924, the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or a special committee of the Senate or House, could request returns or data from the Secretary of the Treasury. And, although returns were classified as public records, the President, through executive order and Treasury regulations approved by his appointees, controlled access to returns and return information other than those expressly permitted by statute.\n\nOn May 13, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon told his staff he was looking for a particular type of IRS Commissioner. In a recorded call (remember, Nixon famously taped his calls), he said, \"I want to be sure he is a ruthless son of a bitch, that he will do what he's told, that every income tax return I want to see I see, that he will go after our enemies and not go after our friends. Now it's as simple as that. If he isn't, he doesn't get the job.\" The job eventually went to Johnnie Walters, who became IRS Commissioner on August 6, 1971.\n\nView of US President Richard Nixon (1913 - 1994) talks on the telephone at his desk in the White House's Oval Office, Washington DC, June 23, 1972. (Photo by the White House Photo Office/PhotoQuest/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWalters claimed that he didn't know about Nixon's comments. He was said not to have participated in Nixon's plan to use the IRS to intimidate taxpayers on his \"enemies list\" with threats of an audit. The list was, however, provided to Walters by White House counsel John W. Dean III and included hundreds of individuals to be targeted for tax investigations.\n\nDean told Nixon in 1972 that \"Johnnie has been a disappointment.” Nixon responded, \"Well, he's going to be out. He's finished.\" Walters would be replaced in May 1973 by Raymond F. Harless—Harless only lasted a month before being replaced by Donald Alexander.\n\nBy the summer of 1973, the question of who to audit took a different turn as Nixon himself became a target. Initially, his return was flagged over a sizable charitable donation, but the audit raised additional issues over several years. Nixon's reaction? He told reporters about the scrutiny of his taxes, \"People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.\"\n\nAs accusations—and denials—flew, information about Nixon's returns was leaked in 1974. The leak was purported to have come from the IRS service center in Martinsburg, West Virginia. If the President could look at taxpayer returns—and his critics could look at his returns—where were the controls?\n\nUltimately, Nixon owed the government $476,431 in additional taxes and interest. But the damage to his presidency—and the IRS—was just beginning.\n\nThe scandal raised public concern about who had access to taxpayer information. A series of hearings in the mid-1970s culminated in a 1976 Act that eliminated executive branch control over access to tax returns. Instead of treating tax returns as public records subject to certain restrictions, the new law made clear that tax returns and return information are confidential.\n\nWhy Does Security Matter?\n\nThe IRS knows a lot about you. The information on your tax return doesn't only include the basics—your name, address, and Social Security number. A glance through your tax return can tell a reader about your family, including the ages of your children and any other persons you support. Information on the return can reveal not only your annual pay, but also where you work, the nature of your job, and whether you are saving for retirement. There's something of a running tab on your financial accounts—with account numbers—if they produce interest, dividends, or other investments. A quick glance at your Schedule A could reveal whether you have a mortgage, how much—and in some instances, where—you give to charity, and what kinds of medical expenses you pay. Your Schedules C, E, and F can reveal information about other businesses or sources of income. Some tax returns include more information, including foreign interests, digital assets, and other investments.\n\nThat information is valuable.\n\nIt's no wonder that in 2004, then-serving Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.), wrote, in a statement: \"Our tax system depends on citizens being candid about personal and financially sensitive information. In return, the government has a clear obligation to respect and protect the personal and private nature of that information. If taxpayers are given reason to doubt that the government will respect their privacy, the integrity and efficacy of our voluntary tax system will eventually crumble.\"\n\nCyberattacks\n\nIn addition to protecting taxpayers from inside actors, the IRS must protect taxpayer data from outside actors, including cyber threats. In its 2019 Integrated Modernization Business Plan, the IRS noted that it was the target of \"increasingly sophisticated and frequent efforts by cybercriminals to steal taxpayer data.\" Those efforts included 1.4 billion attacks annually, including denial-of-service attacks, unsuccessful intrusion attempts, probes or scans, and other unauthorized connectivity attempts. The report noted at the time that the IRS's computer systems withstand 2.5 million unauthorized access attempts daily.\n\nNew Concerns\n\nWhile there have been occasional breaches, the IRS has, for years, maintained that taxpayer data was safe. The systems are old, and the IRS has asked Congress for funding for modernization efforts. Before the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, that included an ask to update the IDRS–the master file that includes all of your tax data. The IRS spent $15.8 million on this investment in fiscal year 2016.\n\nBut efforts to modernize IRS systems have not been a priority for Congress. Some of the systems date back more than 50 years, making a quick fix not quite so easy.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons that taxpayers, tax professionals, and some members of Congress are concerned about DOGE access to taxpayer information. Not everyone is convinced that a quick \"audit\" of the IRS systems will be successful—or legal. This week, Senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent a letter to acting IRS Commissioner Douglas O'Donnell, including an \"urgent demand\" for information related to efforts to access that information. The Senators have requested that the IRS \"immediately disclose to the Senate Committee on Finance the full extent of the potential access to IRS systems and data granted to DOGE team members so that the Committee can address any efforts by DOGE personnel to gain access to taxpayer records at the IRS, which may constitute criminal violations of federal privacy laws.\"\n\nThere hasn’t yet been any official public response to the request. However, the Washington Post is reporting that White House and Treasury Department officials have reached an agreement that would give DOGE read-only access to anonymized tax data–the same access granted to other IT professionals who work on IRS systems. The terms of any such deal have not been confirmed.\n\nWhat’s at stake? Decades of taxpayer privacy laws–and your data.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

The deadline for these reviews was originally set for February 18, but staffers now have until March 3 to make final decisions.Other books on the list under review include Kite Runner, which deals with the rise of the Taliban, as well as Aldous Huxley's classic dystopian novel Brave New World.President Donald Trump previously issued an executive order ruling against the use of gender identities and \"ending radical indoctrination.\"What People Are SayingWill Griffin, director of communications at the Department of Defense Education Activity, told Newsweek: \"Hillbilly Elegy is available for checkout in DoDEA schools where it is part of the library collection. The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is reviewing its current policies and instructional resources in light of recent Executive Orders and Department of Defense guidance. As a DoD entity, DoDEA will fully comply with President's Executive Orders and guidance from the Secretary of Defense.\"Jacob Sherwood, superintendent of DoDEA Pacific West, said at a town hall at Osan Air Base, South Korea, this week: \"The question at hand is, is there a list right now as to what's being taken away from our libraries? The quick answer is no.\"Pro-free expression organization PEN America wrote on X: \"The Trump administration called book bans a hoax — but now the call is coming from inside the house. Vice President JD Vance's 'Hillbilly Elegy' joins the list of books removed from Department of Defense schools pending 'compliance review.'\"What Happens NextAfter the DoDEA completes its review, titles could be pulled. But Griffin added in his statement to Newsweek that, to his \"understanding,\" Vance's Hillbilly Elegy \"was not identified\" for review.\"At this time, we are conducting a review - no materials have been permanently removed from our school libraries pending completion of the review,\" Griffin said. \"During this period, materials under review will have access limited to professional staff. It is my understanding that the book was not identified for the review process.\"","summary":"Vance's memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" has reportedly been listed among many books being reviewed over \"ideology\" concerns at on-base military schools.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/was-jd-vances-book-pulled-pentagon-schools-what-we-know-2034098","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2592625/jd-vance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:29:28","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":292702846,"title":"Trump tightens grip on independent agencies, testing limits of presidential power","text":"WASHINGTON - Testing the limits of presidential power, Donald Trump this week tightened his grip on U.S. government agencies that for years have taken pride in their independence overseeing such matters as elections, stock markets and labor unrest.Trump's order on Tuesday was the latest show of force in a series that has removed critics from office, defunded federal programs, loosened government oversight and frozen billions of dollars in spending approved by Congress.The order allows the White House to shift the budget and policies of the Federal Election Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and other agencies whose day-to-day activities are traditionally kept at arm's length from the president.","summary":"The agencies have for years taken pride in their independence overseeing such matters as elections, stock markets and labor unrest.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/02/21/world/politics/trump-test-limit-presidential-power/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/02/21/453399.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:26:00","author":"Jody Godoy,Tom Hals,Trevor Hunnicutt,Web Master","authors":["Jody Godoy","Tom Hals","Trevor Hunnicutt","Web Master"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"JP","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":292707528,"title":"IRS layoffs could hurt revenue collection and foil efforts to go after rich tax dodgers, experts say","text":"By FATIMA HUSSEIN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The layoffs of roughly 7,000 IRS probationary workers beginning this week likely mean the end of the agency’s plan to go after high-wealth tax dodgers and could spell disaster for revenue collections, experts say.\n\nThe majority of employees shown the door at the federal tax collector are newly hired workers focused on compliance, which includes ensuring that taxpayers are abiding by the tax code and paying delinquent debts, among other duties.\n\nThe IRS layoffs, one of the largest purges of probationary workers this year across the government, could also hurt customer service and tax return processing during tax season this year, the union representing Treasury Department employees warned Thursday.\n\nThe upheaval comes less than two months before the tax filing deadline and as the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump adviser Elon Musk seeks to shrink the size of the federal workforce in an effort to radically cut spending and restructure the government’s priorities.\n\nVanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said on a Thursday call with reporters that the layoffs at the IRS will disproportionately harm enforcement efforts.\n\n“When you underpay and understaff the IRS, the agency doesn’t have the power or the resources it needs to go after wealthy tax evaders with their high priced lawyers,” she said, adding, “The result is, of course, a disaster for revenue.”\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022, gave the IRS $80 billion and the ability to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency, though congressional Republicans later clawed back some of the money.\n\nFormer IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel, appointed by Biden, placed a particular focus on aggressively auditing high-income tax cheats as well as executives who use business aircraft for their personal use while still writing it off as a tax expense and wealthy people who sought to get favorable tax treatment through Puerto Rico without meeting certain tax requirements.\n\nA Congressional Budget Office report issued last year describes how rescissions in funding for the IRS affect baseline projections of future revenues, offering a variety of scenarios depending on the severity of the cuts.\n\nA $5 billion rescission would reduce revenues by $5.2 billion from 2024 to 2034 and increase the deficit by $0.2 billion.

Trump is jealous of him","text":"Donald Trump’s trashing of the norms that governed America’s post-war relationship with Europe has had politicians and pundits scrabbling to find some method in what, to many, looks like madness.\n\nHugging erstwhile enemies and humiliating your friends seems like a monstrous inversion of reality, morality and common sense.\n\nSearching for answers, it is natural to cling to the hope that behind the President’s current love-in with Vladimir Putin and fall-out with Volodymyr Zelensky lies a cunning plan.\n\nCould the apparent de facto alliance with the Kremlin be a shrewd tactic, designed to peel Russia away from its partnership with China, the real challenger to American greatness? And part, perhaps, of a far-seeing project to grab the vast supplies of precious rare earth minerals vital for modern industry, found not only in Ukraine but also the Arctic, to ensure US tech leads the world forever?\n\nThere may be something in all this. But in seeking explanations for Trump’s shocking words and actions, I believe that psychology provides as many answers as realpolitik.\n\nAll politicians are egotists to some degree. Trump’s vanity is planet sized and needs constant feeding. But with it comes a painfully thin skin. Those who surround him know their position depends on Stakhanovite sycophancy and that at the first sign of dissent they will be shown the door. These two characteristics – a ravenous addiction to flattery and a violent allergy to criticism no matter how mild – have combined to poison his efforts to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nRussia understands what makes Trump tick. In the current negotiations this has allowed them – borrowing the phrase he employed to deride Zelensky’s relationship with President Joe Biden – to play him ‘like a fiddle’.\n\nPutin long ago concluded that Trump’s most sensitive erogenous zone was his ego and he has been stroking it assiduously ever since, lauding his deal-making brilliance and faking outrage at the ‘fraud’ which denied him a second presidential term in 2020.\n\nTrump must be one of the few people on earth who believes this blarney is sincere. But then he has consistently shown himself to think the best of leaders that most of the decent world regard as monsters.\n\nAutocrats tend to be indulgent towards fellow members of the club. Even Stalin and Hitler could find things to like in each other. Trump is not, of course, in the same league. But there is little doubt he genuinely admires Putin, despite his record as a murderer, oppressor and dedicated enemy of freedom.\n\nFlattery has so far got Putin everywhere with Trump. The author of The Art Of The Deal has already gifted Russia two of its key demands that would leave it owning 20 per cent of Ukraine while denying Kyiv any realistic hope of Nato membership without getting the slightest concession in return. Apparently unprompted, he has gone even further to advance Putin’s interests by questioning Zelensky’s political legitimacy. The champagne corks must have been popping in the Kremlin as Trump launched into rants regurgitating their propaganda narrative, branding Zelensky ‘a dictator without elections’, accusing him of starting the war and saying he had ‘done a terrible job’ for Ukraine.\n\nThis was the other key component of the Trump psyche kicking in. His vicious animus against Zelensky is powerful proof of a pathological touchiness. It plays an important and potentially very dangerous part in the current crisis. Moscow had no need to persuade Trump to bad-mouth Zelensky as he had already developed a deep antipathy to him.\n\nThe pair have history. In 2019 Trump blamed Zelensky for not co-operating with his plans to damage Biden’s presidential chances by investigating his son Hunter’s murky business activities in Ukraine.\n\nBut does that explain everything? Zelensky has done his share of fence-mending, hosing Trump with blandishments long before he entered the White House. And Emperor Donald has shown himself capable of forgiveness, albeit at a price. Nine years ago JD Vance was comparing him to Hitler. Now, at the cost of subservience, he is his Vice President.\n\nI believe Trump’s increasingly violent dislike of Zelensky has a simple cause. He is jealous of him. The 47-year-old Ukrainian is everything the 78-year-old American would love to be seen as – courageous, inspiring, attractive and virile. Despite the war he is still largely respected at home and a hero everywhere freedom is cherished. Zelensky’s charisma and decency rattles Trump. It is hardly any wonder that Putin is more his kind of guy.\n\nThe historian Lord Acton’s dictum that ‘power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely’ has never been more true. After just one month of presidency Trump is as high as a kite on the stuff. What will he be like when the time comes, as the constitution demands, for him to stand down with no possibility of re-election?\n\nUnderneath Trump’s bombast and insecurity I sense a deep desire to be loved. Yet his current words and actions seem designed to alienate his natural allies. If his inner demons hold him to the course he is now embarked upon it may well be that, instead of leaving a legacy of affection, he will go down as the most hated American President in history.\n\n-

union bid to halt Trump firing of government workers","text":"WASHINGTON: A US judge on Thursday (Feb 20) denied a union bid to temporarily halt the firing of thousands of federal employees on probationary status, handing President Donald Trump another legal win in his plan to slash the government workforce.\n\nDistrict Judge Christopher Cooper said he lacked the jurisdiction to handle the complaint, one of several filed in courts in recent days in an effort to pause the mass sackings.\n\nThe judge's decision comes as around 6,700 workers at the 100,000-strong Internal Revenue Service (IRS) who were on probation were being laid off.\n\nA former IRS official said most of the IRS employees being let go worked in the US tax agency's enforcement teams, less than two months before the US income tax filing deadline of Apr 15.\n\nA number of IRS employees posted messages on LinkedIn saying they had been abruptly terminated and were seeking other opportunities.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union and four other unions that represent federal employees had asked Cooper to issue a temporary restraining order preventing termination of their members who are probationary employees.\n\nCooper, an appointee of former president Barack Obama, said his court lacks jurisdiction to hear their claims and they should instead be brought before the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a body that adjudicates federal labour disputes.\n\n\"Federal district judges are duty-bound to decide legal issues based on even-handed application of law and precedent -- no matter the identity of the litigants or, regrettably at times, the consequences of their rulings for average people,\" the judge said.\n\nIn his opinion, Cooper said the federal government employs 220,000 probationary employees and he noted that workers with that status at the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Park Service and other agencies have already been sacked.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/judge-denies-union-bid-halt-donald-trump-firing-government-workers-4950971","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--lxMhVCuU--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/02/21/063_2200859714.jpg?itok=GGMTneKu","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21

scandal – £700million more than expected","text":"LLOYDS BANKING GROUP has had to shift gears and put aside £1.2billion to cover potential claims from drivers for its part in the motor finance scandal.\n\nThe sum is £700million more than it expected to be on the hook for a year ago.\n\nLloyds is heavily exposed to the mis-selling scandal through its Black Horse brand.\n\nMillions of Brits could be due compensation after a court last October found car dealerships had broken the law by receiving commission on finance deals without customers being aware.\n\nThat landmark ruling quashed the long-held view that consumer duty protections could not be -applied to the past.\n\nThe motor finance scandal has been called PPI 2.0 – following the misselling of payment protection insurance which led to banks paying out £50billion in redress.\n\nYesterday, credit rating agency Fitch said that the costs associated with the motor finance scandal would exceed £2billion this year, largely due to legal costs.\n\nThe situation is being closely watched by the Government, and the Treasury was this week blocked from intervening in the Supreme Court appeal process.\n\nFinancial giants have warned the Chancellor that there is a risk of spooking global investors if they believe the UK can change its regulations on a whim.\n\nLloyds Boss Charlie Nunn yesterday said investors had raised concerns because the ruling “seems to be at odds with 30 years of regulation, and that creates a problem in the minds of investors.\n\nNot just for this sector, not just for the financial services sector, but actually a broader investability question in the UK.”\n\nA director at another firm said there was the risk of being penalised later for following the law “to the letter”.\n\nBut another big institution told The Sun that the firms that were now being chased had commission policies in place that “might have been legal, but didn’t pass the smell test.\n\n\"They should have known it was wrong.”\n\nLloyds’ compensation provision has knocked its annual pre-tax profits by a fifth to £6billion.\n\nBut its shares rose by five per cent yesterday after it sweetened investors with a 2.1p-a-share dividend and a £1.7billion buyback.\n\nDiamonds no longer Anglo's best friend?\n\nDIAMOND’S are no longer Anglo American's best friend after the miner wrote down the value of its De Beers business by $2.9billion (£2.2 billion).\n\nThe diamond industry is currently in a crisis caused partly by the rapid rise of cheaper lab-grown diamonds.\n\nNatural diamonds have fallen in price by about a quarter in the past two years.\n\nThe miner is already trying to find a way to offload De Beers, either in a sale or a stock market listing.\n\nBoss Duncan Wanblad is trying to overhaul Anglo American after a hostile £39billion takeover attempt by miner BHP last year.\n\nAt the time Anglo American said it could boost shareholder value by focusing on its more profitable core and iron ore mines instead.\n\nThis week it sold off its Brazilian nickel business and is in the process of separating its South African platinum arm.\n\nLayoffs shocker for Quiz\n\nSHOPWORKERS at Quiz have complained they were given just an hour’s notice before being told they were losing their jobs and locks were changed on shuttered stores.\n\nThe struggling fast-fashion firm, which employed 722 people across 65 shops, filed for insolvency this week before striking a deal to transfer 531 workers and 42 stores to a business connected to the firm’s family owners.\n\nAs a result 23 outlets shut from Brighton to Bristol and 191 staff were made redundant.\n\nOne worker told The Sun they were informed on a 4.30pm conference call that they faced a job loss before contractors arrived at 5.30pm to change the locks.\n\nAdministrators at Teneo advised on the deal to the controlling Ramzan family.\n\nQuiz had already been through one insolvency in 2019 and delisted from the stock market in December.\n\nGOLD has surged to a record high amid fears of a global trade war sparked by US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nPrices rose by 0.4 per cent to $2,944 yesterday.\n\nSome analysts are

Donald Trump is shown engorging himself with the three branches of government, shredding them into pieces and spewing them back out, with no thought of order or replacement.\n\nOne can only surmise that Trump and Elon Musk together are destroying legitimate departments for their personal gain in order to reduce their taxes and those of other billionaires. Who knows what other plans they envision? They show no thought of the serious consequences faced by the hundreds of thousands of citizens who benefited from these departments or the thousands who lost their jobs and will struggle without them.\n\nSusan Dillon\nMorgan Hill\n\nWe must speak up in\npresence of bigotry\n\nWhen we just shake our heads and walk away from bigotry and extremism, we condone it and empower those who promote it.\n\nSuch acts cannot be tolerated. They must be met with equal and resounding words and acts of condemnation. Everyone must stand up and speak out against such behaviors. Every false statement must be confronted with the truth. That’s our responsibility, a requirement of the citizenry as provided in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. We must gather and defy a growing movement of zealotry that threatens credibility, our democracy and our fate as a country.\n\nTo walk away and do nothing is to give away our hard-won freedom and liberty.

The author has no idea of the technical problems with using high-power lasers to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles.\n\nThis is not the magic of a ray gun to zap an incoming missile in a fraction of a second, with the ability to engage large numbers of targets in a few seconds. This technology doesn’t exist. The Israeli Iron Dome works but was recently overcome through a very simple tactic, permitting missile strikes on sites in Israel, a far smaller area to protect than the United States.\n\nThe cost of a U.S. system like Iron Dome would be enormous, at least hundreds of billions of dollars, and would not work, but would provide enormous profits to the defense contractors on the project.\n\nDr. David Lewis\nMountain View","summary":"Also: Working for themselves &#124; Speak up &#124; Faith a light &#124; Short memory &#124; No technology.

It did the same thing in January.\n\nThe analysts also pointed to yuan-dollar swap points – the difference between forward and spot prices – as another tool the PBOC can use to manage the market’s currency expectations.\nDuring periods of heightened depreciation pressure, the central bank could manage the swap market to narrow the gap, or even push it into negative territory, to curb excessive depreciation expectations.\nHistorically, the PBOC has also employed other tools to stabilise the yuan, such as tightening the management of cross-border capital flows and guiding market expectations, the Haitong Securities analysts wrote.\nBy midday on Thursday, the offshore yuan had strengthened from the day before to trade at around 7.269 per US dollar. On the final trading day of last year, it touched 7.3698 per US dollar – its weakest level since October 2022.\nZhang Zhiwei, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said that beyond technical measures to raise the cost of shorting the yuan, China’s “massive current account surplus” plays a crucial role in the PBOC’s ability to stabilise the exchange rate, as it brings a steady inflow of foreign currency, providing the central bank with ample resources to intervene in the foreign exchange market when needed.\n“Behind the surplus is the competitiveness of China’s export sector, as well as, to some extent, domestic deflationary pressure,” Zhang said.","summary":"Adjustment of daily fixing seen as one way to resist depreciation pressure.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3299477/chinas-central-bank-vows-enhance-yuan-amid-looming-risks-strong-us-dollar","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/20/4beeb34c-c0a3-4554-abab-03a2a0d157a5_32d72336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:00:13","author":"Sylvia Ma","authors":["Sylvia Ma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.096},{"id":292699780,"title":"Fox News Confronts Trump Adviser on Who Is Most Responsible for Ukraine War","text":"Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy confronted national security adviser Mike Waltz on Thursday over who the U.S. thinks is to blame for the Russia-Ukraine war..Newsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment on Thursday.Why It MattersDoocy's questioning comes amid a dramatic shift in U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis Ukraine and Russia. The Biden administration, in conjunction with the U.S.'s European allies, made clear that Russia violated international laws by launching an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine three years ago.The West subsequently isolated Russian President Vladimir Putin and levied crippling economic sanctions on Russia, while sending billions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine to help it fight off Putin's aggression.But Trump reversed much of that policy last week, when he spoke to Putin on the phone about the war in Ukraine—a conversation that Zelensky was not part of. The U.S. also sent a delegation to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to meet with Russian officials for a discussion on ending the conflict. Ukraine was not a part of that meeting either.Trump escalated tensions another notch when he amplified Russian talking points on Wednesday by falsely suggested on Truth Social that Zelensky was a \"dictator\" and that Kyiv had started the war.What To KnowDoocy grilled Waltz on Thursday about the shift in policy and pointed to Trump's Truth Social post, which also claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. spent more than $350 billion toward Ukraine.\"After the president's post on Truth Social yesterday, I need to know—who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin or Zelensky?\" Doocy asked.Waltz didn't directly answer Doocy's question but said Trump's goal is to \"bring this war to an end, period. And there has been ongoing fighting on both sides. It is World War I-style trench warfare. His frustration with President Zelensky that you've heard is multifold.\"He continued: \"There needs to be a deep appreciation for what the American people, what the American taxpayer, what President Trump did in his first term and what we've done since. So some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, and insults to President Trump were unacceptable.\"Waltz went on to talk about the Trump administration's offer of an economic partnership involving Ukraine's minerals and other resources that Trump says would help guarantee Ukraine's long-term security, while recouping the financial aid the U.S. sent to Ukraine during the Biden administration.\"Rather than enter into some constructive conversations about what that deal should be going forward, we got a lot of rhetoric in the media that was incredibly unfortunate,\" Waltz told Doocy.The national security adviser also compared the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"So many people in Washington that were just demanding, pounding the table for a ceasefire in Gaza are suddenly aghast that the president would demand one and both sides come to the table when it comes to Ukraine—a war that has been arguably far greater in scope and scale and far more dangerous in terms of global escalation to U.S. security,\" Waltz said.Zelensky fired back by saying Trump \"lives in this disinformation space.\"What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday, \"We have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine, where we have martial law, essentially martial law in Ukraine, where the leader in Ukraine, I hate to say it, but he's down at 4 percent approval rating, and where a country has been blown to smithereens.\"The Ukrainian constitution does not allow for the country to hold elections when it's under martial law, as Ukraine has been since Putin invaded in 2022. There is also no credible polling in Ukraine that shows Zelensky at a 4 percent approval rating.Zelensky, referring to Trump's comments, told reporters: \"We have seen this disinformation, we understand that it is coming from Russia ... [Trump] lives in this disinformation space.\"What Happens NextTrump and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov have both said that Ukraine would participate in the peace negotiations in some way.Zelensky told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Meet the Press last week: \"I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine, never.\"He added: \"This is the war in Ukraine, against us, and it's our human losses.\"","summary":"Fox's Peter Doocy didn't get a straight answer when he asked who the U.S. thinks is most to blame in the Russia-Ukraine war.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-donald-trump-ukriane-war-zelensky-putin-2034106","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2592638/miek-waltz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 00:00:01","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":292704330,"title":"Texas AG asks court to require NCAA to begin gender testing as part of new transgender policy","text":"LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — The Republican attorney general in Texas wants the NCAA to take its transgender policy a step further and require gender testing for athletes who compete in women’s sports.\n\nAG Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit in December in state district court and on Thursday added a filing that seeks a court order requiring gender screening for athletes and an injunction intended to prevent the NCAA from “falsely and deceptively claiming that only biological women may participate in female-specific competitions.”\n\nEarlier this month, the NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes, limiting competition in women’s sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

Angus King of Maine told his Senate colleagues on Thursday that America is facing a constitutional crisis as President Donald Trump moves aggressively to slash government spending and drastically reduce the federal workforce without the approval of Congress.\n\nDelivering a floor speech in the Senate Thursday, King said the founders drafted the U.S. Constitution to share power among three branches of government — a deliberate move to ensure the country was not run by a monarch or dictator. He said the Constitution clearly gives Congress the power of the purse and tasks the president with implementing laws passed by Congress.\n\n“This is a constitutional crisis and we have to respond to it,” King said during a 20-minute floor speech. “This is a very dangerous moment. We’ve got to wake up.”\n\nKing, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, took aim at Republicans for sitting idly by and watching Trump usurp their constitutional powers with the hope that the courts will stop any overreach. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have already suggested they may not comply with court orders, he said.\n\nLeaving it to the courts is “a cop-out” and “an abdication of our responsibility” as elected officials, he said.\n\n“Many of my friends in this body say, ‘Well it will be difficult. We don’t want to buck the president and everything. And we’re going to let the courts take care of this,'” King said.\n\n“That’s a cop-out. It’s our responsibility to protect the Constitution — that’s what we swear to when we enter this body. But to stand back and say, ‘Well, we’re going stand back and watch as this happens and the courts are going to take care of it,’ that’s an abdication of our responsibility.”\n\nThough Maine’s other senator, Republican Susan Collins, the top senate appropriator, has said that she hopes the courts will overturn any unconstitutional moves to cut congressionally approved spending and agencies, her office pointed out Thursday that she also has pushed back on issues such as the firings at the FBI, funding cuts at the National Institutes of Health and the National Park Service layoffs that affected Acadia National Park.\n\nCollins also has said that efforts by Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency are unconstitutional. But she voted to confirm Russell Vought as the White House budget chief despite Vought’s view that the president has the power to cut federal spending and programs without the approval of Congress, a position that Collins opposes.\n\nIn describing her thinking, Collins, who is up for reelection in 2026, said that presidents should have latitude to choose their cabinet members, and Vought was qualified since he held the post in Trump’s first term.\n\n“If there are impoundments, I believe it will end up in court, and my hope is the court will rule in favor of the 1974 Impoundment and Budget Control Act,” Collins told the Press Herald.\n\nKing’s comments came as the Senate began debating government funding bills. He listed a host of controversial decisions in Trump’s first month in office, including the indiscriminate firings and buyouts of federal workers, hiring freezes and ending Congressionally approved programs, like the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nHe said the administration’s approach is thoughtless, pointing to the firing of hundreds of workers who maintain the safety of the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal, which the administration is now trying to reverse, and people charged with airline safety at a time when the country has experienced four high-profile crashes in the last month, including one in Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.\n\nKing also pointed to the administration’s firing of probationary employees. While many of those workers may be new, he noted that it also includes recently promoted employees and veterans.\n\n“It’s not a rational or thoughtful way to trim the federal workforce,” King said, noting that the savings from the estimated 75,000 people who accepted buyout offers amounts to one-tenth of 1% of the federal budget. “Given the chaos and the uncertainty in the deletion of services to our American people, I would argue that’s not worth it.”\n\nKing also railed against Trump’s foreign policy, including ending foreign assistance, embracing Russia, blaming Ukraine for the war Russia started three years ago without provocation, and threatening U.S. allies.\n\n“What’s it going to take for us to wake up?” King said. “Is it going to be too late? Is it going to be when the president has accreted all this power and the Congress is an afterthought? What’s going to take?

National Security Advisor Mike Waltz on Thursday admitted that Trump’s patience with Zelenskyy is running thin, and said that discussions Wednesday between U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg and Ukrainian officials focused on assisting Kyiv \"understand\" the war must come to a halt. \"President Trump is obviously very frustrated right now with President Zelenskyy, the fact that he hasn't come to the table, that he hasn't been willing to take this opportunity that we have offered,\" Waltz told reporters Thursday in a White House press briefing. \"I think he eventually will get to that point, and I hope so very quickly.\" \"It certainly isn't in Russia's interest or in the American people's interest for this war to grind on forever and ever and ever,\" Waltz said. \"So a key part of his conversation was helping President Zelenskyy understand this war needs to come to an end.\" Vice President JD Vance on Thursday also defended the Trump administration's decision to meet with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia, despite frustration from Ukraine that it was absent from those meetings. Vance stressed that communicating with Russia is key to advancing a deal, and said he believes Europe is on the \"cusp of peace\" for the first time in three years. \"How are you going to end the war unless you're talking to Russia?\" Vance said at the Conservative Political Action Conference near the nation's capital. \"You've got to talk to everybody involved in the fighting. If you actually want to bring the conflict to a close.\" Meanwhile, U.S. officials also have met with Ukrainian officials about a peace deal, and Kellogg said Wednesday in a post on X that the U.S. remains committed to ending the war and finding ways to establish \"sustainable peace.\" The increased pressure on Ukraine to agree to a deal comes on the heels of several tense days between Trump and Zelenskyy, as each hurled insults back and forth toward one another after the meetings between U.S. and Russian officials. While Zelenskyy accused Trump of perpetuating Russian \"disinformation\" on Wednesday, Trump took a jab back and labeled Zelenskyy a \"dictator\" who has failed his country and suggested Ukraine initiated the war. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY WAR OF WORDS HEATS UP EVEN AS US LOOKS TO WIND DOWN WAR IN UKRAINE Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Waltz met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and President Vladimir Putin’s foreign affairs advisor, Yuri Ushakov, to hash out ways to end the conflict. Zelenskyy said Ukraine didn’t receive an invitation to the meeting and told reporters Tuesday in Turkey that \"nobody decides anything behind our back,\" after stressing in recent days that Kyiv will not agree to a peace negotiation without Ukraine’s input. RUSSIA, UKRAINE TAKE ‘SIGNIFICANT FIRST STEP TOWARD PEACE’ AFTER RUBIO-LED NEGOTIATIONS, WHITE HOUSE INSISTS Meanwhile, the U.S. has signaled interest in giving way to some of Russia’s demands for a peace agreement in recent days, and Trump told the BBC on Wednesday that he believes Russia is the one that has \"the cards a little bit, because they've taken a lot of territory.\" As of January, Russia has taken control of approximately 18% of Ukraine’s territory, according to the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Brookings Institution. Trump’s Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Feb. 12 that it wasn’t realistic for Ukraine to regain its pre-war borders with Russia, prompting criticism that Ukraine is being forced to give into concessions. \"Putin is going to pocket this and ask for more,\" Brett Bruen, director of global engagement under former President Barack Obama, told Fox News Digital on Feb. 13. Additionally, the U.S. has suggested it backs holding an election in Ukraine — a key condition for Russia to agree to a peace deal. Nearly a year after Zelenskyy's five-year term was slated to end, he has remained in his position leading Kyiv because the Ukrainian constitution bars holding elections under martial law. Ukraine has been under martial law since February 2022. However, Russia wasn't the only one exerting pressure to force Ukraine to hold an election, Trump said Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. ‘MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN’: HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS As a result, Zelenskyy’s hands may be tied and he may have no other option but to give in to the concessions, according to Trump’s former deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland. \"If President Zelenskyy is going to walk away from this and somehow say, ‘I'm against any deal with Russia, I'm against any deal with America.’ Really?\" McFarland said Thursday in an interview with FOX Business Network’s \"Mornings with Maria.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Well, how does he plan to keep this country safe for the next 20, 30, 40 years?\" McFarland said. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, and Trump vowed on the campaign trail in 2024 that he would work to end the conflict if elected again.
