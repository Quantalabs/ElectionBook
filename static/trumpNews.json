White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson confirmed that the president authorized using the Illinois National Guard members, citing what she called \"ongoing violent riots and lawlessness\" that local leaders have not quelled. \"President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities,\" Jackson said. Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said the guard received notice from the Pentagon early in the day. He called the move unnecessary and \"a manufactured performance - not a serious effort to protect public safety.\" \"This morning, the Trump Administration's Department of War gave me an ultimatum: call up your troops, or we will,\" Pritzker said in a statement. \"It is absolutely outrageous and un-American to demand a Governor send military troops within our own borders and against our will.\" Live Events Trump has long threatened to send troops to Chicago, but it was not immediately clear when or exactly where they would be deployed. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the shooting of the woman on the southwest side of Chicago. It said in a statement that Border Patrol agents on patrol \"were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars,\" and when they got out of their trapped vehicle, \"a suspect tried to run them over, forcing the officers to fire defensively.\" The woman who was shot was a U.S. citizen and was armed with a semiautomatic weapon, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, noting that the woman was accused in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin last week of doxing agents. The woman was treated and released in the afternoon, according to Mount Sinai Hospital. No officers were seriously injured, McLaughlin said. The Chicago Police Department confirmed a shooting in the area but offered few details, saying it responded only to \"document the incident\" and control traffic. \"CPD is not involved in the incident or its investigation. Federal authorities are investigating this shooting,\" it said in a statement, referring questions to federal officials. The escalation of federal law enforcement follows similar deployments in other parts of the country. Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and to Washington, D.C., as part of his law enforcement takeover there. Tennessee National Guard troops are expected to arrive in Memphis to help police. California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued to stop the deployment in Los Angeles and won a temporary block in federal court. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling that the use of the guard was illegal, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated that it believes the government is likely to prevail. Pritzker criticized the Illinois deployment for pulling the National Guard troops away from their families and regular jobs, saying, \"For Donald Trump, this has never been about safety. This is about control.\" He also noted that state, county and local law enforcement have been coordinating to ensure the safety of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Broadview facility on the outskirts of Chicago. Federal officials reported the arrests of 13 people protesting Friday near the facility, which has been frequently targeted during the administration's surge of immigration enforcement this fall. Trump also said last month that he was sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, calling the city war-ravaged. But local officials have suggested that many of his claims and social media posts appear to rely on images from 2020, when demonstrations and unrest gripped the city following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Oregon officials sued to stop the deployment the next day. U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut heard arguments Friday and temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from deploying the guard in Portland. Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs said a deployment would violate the U.S. Constitution as well as a federal law that generally prohibits the military from being used to enforce domestic laws. Trump has federalized 200 National Guard troops in the state, but so far it does not appear that they have moved into Portland. They have been seen training on the coast in anticipation of a deployment.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump National Guard deploymentChicago riotsBorder Patrol shooting ChicagoGovernor Pritzker responseWhite HouseIllinois National Guard deploymentIllinois National GuardDepartment of Homeland SecurityU.S. Immigration and Customs EnforcementChicago Police Department\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

welcomed progress on a peace plan between Israel and Hamas, with US President Donald Trump revealing Israel has agreed to a limited troop withdrawal as negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release continue.\n\nMr Albanese said there was no question Australia's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood at a recent United Nations meeting, alongside allies the UK, Canada and France, played a minor role in helping the move towards peace.\n\nIndustry Minister Tim Ayres on Sunday echoed the sentiment, saying Australia was regarded as a genuine player by its partners and had helped build momentum.\n\n\"I think that Australia is playing the role that Australians would expect it to, as a middle power, engaged with our partners around the world, particularly on the question of statehood,\" Senator Ayres told Sky News.\n\n\"But you've seen over the whole two-year period, Australia playing a role for a ceasefire, working with partners on those questions, working with partners on questions like making sure that there's a strong international consensus for adhering to international law.\n\n\"In terms of statehood, of course, it's part of creating momentum towards a peaceful settlement.\"\n\nBut the government's position drew a derisive reaction from opposition frontbencher Melissa McIntosh, who channelled Australian 1990s cult film The Castle and lead character Darryl Kerrigan's signature line in response.\n\n\"Tell the PM he's dreaming if he thinks that he had a whole lot of influence,\" she said.\n\n\"President Trump and the US administration, it seems, were working on this for some time, and actually publicly said that Australia's position on this was more of a hindrance than a help.\"\n\nAnnouncing his 20-point peace plan, Mr Trump called countries that had recognised Palestine \"foolish\" but acknowledged their frustration over a lack of progress on the issue.\n\nAustralians continue to voice their opposition to Israel's assault on Gaza, which has killed more than 66,000 people, according to the strip's health authorities.\n\nPro-Palestine protesters will once again march on the State Library of Victoria on Sunday, in a now-familiar display of solidarity in Melbourne.\n\nBut protesters in Sydney will have to get Supreme Court approval to rally at the Sydney Opera House forecourt after opposition by NSW Police, who say the proposed event on October 12 would be unsafe.\n\nMs McIntosh urged the state government to use all levers to block the \"disrespectful\" rally.\n\nThe event is due to take place shortly after the two-year anniversary of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, which killed 1200 people and resulted in hundreds more being taken hostage.\n\n\"There's nothing respectful in having a protest at the Opera House, one of our most well-known, recognised icons, at that point in time,\" she said.\n\nFederal Greens leader Larissa Waters called on the government to expel Israel's ambassador if six Australians on board a flotilla detained by Israel were not freed and allowed to return home.\n\n\"And our government should be doing everything it can to get our citizens home safely,\" she told ABC's Insiders

in Gaza","text":"PTIIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump \n\nPresident Donald Trump told Axios he is pushing hard to cement a US-brokered Gaza deal that he said could lead to the immediate release of hostages and a phased Israeli withdrawal. According to Axios, Trump said that a Gaza peace deal is “close,” adding that he plans to push for its completion within the next few days.According to Axios, he said, \"Bibi, this is your chance for victory.' He was fine with it,\" Trump told me. \"He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine. Bibi took it very far and Israel lost a lot of support in the world. Now I am gonna get all that support back,\" he said.The developments followed a conditional response from Hamas to Trump’s multi-point proposal and an apparent operational shift by the Israel Defense Forces, which the Israeli military said moved to defensive operations as negotiators prepared to meet. According to Axios website, that envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner traveled to Egypt to finalize the technical details of the hostage release and discuss a long-term peace agreement.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that he had paused Israel’s military offensive to “prepare for the immediate implementation of the first phase of the Trump Plan for the release of all hostages,” according to a statement from his office.Live EventsOn Truth Social, Trump praised Israel’s choice to “temporarily” halt bombings, saying it allows the hostage release and peace deal a chance to be completed. He urged Hamas to act swiftly in releasing the hostages, warning that any delay could jeopardize the agreement. “I will not tolerate delays, which many expect, or any outcome where Gaza becomes a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” he added.Trump also said that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had been “very helpful” in urging Hamas to proceed with the hostage release. “Erdogan helped a lot. He is a tough guy, but he is a friend of mine and he was great,” Trump added.Hamas’s standHamas issued a formal response indicating its willingness to accept several key aspects of Trump’s proposal, such as ending the war, carrying out prisoner and hostage exchanges, and establishing humanitarian access, while reserving the right to negotiate other terms and stressing the need for appropriate conditions on the ground for implementation. In a statement, the group said it agreed \"to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump's proposal\" - if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.Political and Human stakeAccording to Axios website, more than 67,000 Palestinians have died in the Gaza war, according to Gaza’s health authorities; international agencies and rights groups say the toll has been catastrophic and that humanitarian needs are urgent. Israel’s campaign since Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 attack has also produced deep domestic political strain inside Israel and growing international criticism, factors Trump said he wanted to reverse by brokering a deal.Trump shared a map outlining the proposed initial Israeli withdrawal from parts of Gaza, scheduled to coincide with the hostages’ release, noting that Hamas had also received the map. The withdrawal line is set to be the central point in the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas beginning in Egypt. Trump added, “When Hamas confirms, the ceasefire will be immediately effective, the hostage and prisoner exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal, bringing us closer to ending this 3,000-year catastrophe.

Last month, a judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles was illegal. The pattern suggests potential legal limits to the president’s approach to deploying troops in Democratic-led cities, which also includes Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Memphis.\n\nTrump has also ordered a review of federal aid to Portland, with the White House stating, “we will not fund states that allow anarchy,” though no specific funds were identified. The president has repeatedly threatened to withhold federal funding as punishment for political opponents, despite such funding being mandated by Congress.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building in Portland has been the site of nightly protests following expanded deportation raids under Trump’s immigration policies. \n\nHowever, Judge Immergut found that demonstrations were “small and uneventful” in the days and weeks leading up to Trump’s order. The protests and occasional clashes with law enforcement have been limited to a one-block area in a city covering approximately 145 square miles with 636,000 residents. Recent protests typically drew a couple dozen people before the deployment announcement.\n\nWhile presidents generally receive significant deference to federalize National Guard troops when regular law enforcement cannot execute federal laws, Judge Immergut determined this standard was not met in Portland. She wrote that plaintiffs successfully demonstrated the protests were not significantly violent or disruptive, concluding that “the President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.”\n\nOregon filed the lawsuit on September 28 after Governor Tina Kotek failed to convince Trump to cancel the deployment during a 10-minute phone call. The state argues that sending 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is “not about public safety, it’s about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order,” according to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.\n\nThe controversy intensified after conservative journalist Nicholas Sortor was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct during a protest. The White House called the arrest part of a “troubling trend” and said the Justice Department’s civil rights division was reviewing whether it constituted “viewpoint discrimination.” \n\nThe Portland Police Bureau responded that “arrests are based on observed behavior and probable cause — not political affiliation or public profile.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJudge Karin Immergut: “Whether we choose to follow what the Constitution mandates with respect to these three relationships goes to the heart of what it means to live under the rule of law in the United States.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “President Trump will end the radical left reign of terror in Portland once and for all.”\n\nOregon Governor Tina Kotek: “When the president and I spoke yesterday, I told him in plain language that there is no insurrection or threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland or any other city in our state.”\n\nOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a press release on Friday: “Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal.

Immergut, appointed by President Donald Trump, has issued a temporary restraining order following lawsuits by Oregon and Portland. This order is set to expire on October 18, though it may be renewed.\n\nIn her decision, Immergut explained that the U.S. Constitution entrusts Congress with the authority to summon troops, referred to as the “militia” in the original document, for law enforcement, quelling insurrections, or defending against invasions.\n\n“The President’s decision to federalize the Oregon National Guard without constitutional authority challenges Oregon’s sovereign rights as safeguarded by the Tenth Amendment,” Immergut remarked in her ruling.\n\nWhile this ruling is not definitive, Immergut noted that the plaintiffs presented a convincing likelihood of prevailing legally, warranting the temporary restraining order. This order halts the execution of a memo dated September 28, which intended the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard.\n\nImmergut emphasized that “this nation has traditionally resisted governmental overreach, particularly when it involves military interference in civil matters.”\n\nThe ruling is a setback for the Trump administration as it seeks to use military troops in some Democratic-run cities.\n\nA federal judge in California last month ruled that the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles was illegal.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco found that the administration breached the Posse Comitatus Act — a law from 1878 prohibiting the use of military forces as a domestic police entity by the president.\n\nIn the Portland case, the city and state sued on Sept. 28 to prevent the use of military troops in Portland, and they asked a federal court to stop the deployment to the city.\n\nHours after a Friday hearing before Immergut and before she had issued any ruling, U.S. Northern Command announced that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had activated the 200 troops.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said that Trump directed Hegseth to call the Oregon National Guard into federal service for 60 days to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other government personnel in the city.\n\nPortland is not the only U.S. city that Trump has targeted for the deployment of military troops.\n\nOn Saturday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he was informed by the Trump administration that the Department of Defense plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and deploy them within his state.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Trump signed a memo ordering the National Guard to Memphis. Although Tennessee has a Republican government, the city’s mayor is a Democrat.\n\nThat order was also to send federal law enforcement agencies to Memphis in what Trump characterized as a crackdown on crime.\n\nTrump said at that Sept. 15 signing that Chicago was “probably next.”\n\nGovernors have the authority to deploy their states’ National Guard. The Trump administration would be federalizing the National Guard to send troops to cities if the governor declines to do so.\n\nPritzker, the governor of Illinois, said Saturday that he was given an ultimatum by Defense Department officials to “call up your troops, or we will.” Pritzker said he would refuse.\n\n“I want to be clear: there is no need for military troops on the ground in the State of Illinois,” Pritzker said. “I will not call up our National Guard to further Trump’s acts of aggression against our people.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA federal judge in Oregon on Saturday temporarily blocked the deployment of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Court Halts National Guard Deployment in Portland for Now first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/court-halts-national-guard-deployment-in-portland-for-now/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Judge-temporarily-blocks-use-of-National-Guard-in-Portland.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 00:11:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":366257942,"title":"Judge temporarily blocks Trump administration from deploying troops in Portland, Oregon (World)","text":"A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland, ruling in a lawsuit brought by the state and city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit.

Speaking Tuesday to U.S. military leaders in Virginia, the president proposed using cities as training grounds for the armed forces.\n\nLast month a federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of some 4,700 National Guard soldiers and Marines in Los Angeles earlier this year was illegal, but he allowed the 300 who remain in the city to stay as long as they do not enforce civilian laws.\n\nAs for Portland, the Defense Department announced that it was placing 200 members of Oregon’s National Guard under federal control for 60 days to protect federal property at locations where protests are occurring or likely to occur.\n\nThat announcement came after Trump called “war-ravaged” in late September, a characterization that Oregon officials called ludicrous while saying they do not need or want federal troops there.\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland has been the site of nightly protests, and the demonstrations and occasional clashes with law enforcement have been limited to a one-block area in a city that covers about 145 square miles (375 square km) and has about 636,000 residents.\n\nA handful of immigration and legal advocates often gather at the building during the day. At night, recent protests have typically drawn a couple dozen people.\n\nA larger crowd demonstrated Sept. 28 following the announcement of the guard deployment. The Portland Police Bureau, which has said it does not participate in immigration enforcement and only intervenes in the protests if there is vandalism or criminal activity, arrested two people on assault charges.\n\nA peaceful march earlier that day drew thousands to downtown and saw no arrests, police said.\n\nTrump sent federal officers to Portland over the objections of local and state leaders in 2020 during long-running racial justice protests following George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police. The administration sent hundreds of agents for the stated purpose of protecting the federal courthouse and other federal property from vandalism.\n\nThat deployment antagonized demonstrators and prompted nightly clashes. Federal officers fired rubber bulled and used tear gas.\n\nViral videos captured federal officers arresting people and hustling them into unmarked vehicles. A report by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general found that while the federal government had legal authority to deploy the officers, many of them lacked the training and equipment necessary for the mission.\n\nThe government agreed this year to settle an excessive force lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union by paying compensating several plaintiffs for their injuries.","summary":"A federal judge in Oregon temporarily blocked President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland, ruling in a lawsuit brought by the state and city.\n\nU.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued the order pending further arguments in the suit.

Professor Kondapalli said, \"Field Marshal Munir visited China a few weeks ago and the Chinese concern is the CPEC's security, prosperity, etc. So, I do not think that the Chinese are moving away from Pakistan.

He further highlighted that China has invested $52 billion in Pakistan through CPEC, which is nearly double the US' investment of $24 billion, suggesting the depth of China's engagement with the country. He stated, \"As of now, we do not have enough evidence to show that Pakistan is moving too close to the United States and away from China. China had given Pakistan $52 billion in the CPEC. United States gave Pakistan $24 billion so far in counterterrorism measures and others. So the weight of China is more in Pakistan than compared with the US. There are 36,000 Chinese security guards in Pakistan. These are basically people's armed police force.

He said Washington had made clear that it did not want its vital supply chains, especially in semiconductors, entangled with China’s.\nWhen we scale up we’ll have to play both games, both supply chains. We have no choice\nMalaysian trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz\n“They [the US] won’t stop you from trading with China, that one they are very clear [about]. But they just don’t want their technology to be compromised,” Zafrul said. “And I think China also feels the same way now.”\nHe predicted, therefore, that the “two kitchens” approach was not merely a theory but “going to be an eventuality”, with both sides insisting their strategic industries remain insulated – even if that means untangling previously inseparable supply networks.\nTrump, who is set to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ summit in Malaysia later this month, was preceded in September by his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, who delivered a blunt message in Kuala Lumpur: the US would not budge on its goal of reclaiming control over critical sectors, including semiconductors, which also make a vital contribution to the economies of Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.\nOn Monday, the latest volley in Trump’s tariff campaign hit imported furniture with a 25 per cent duty, aimed chiefly at Chinese and Vietnamese manufacturers who together accounted for 60 per cent of America’s US$25.5 billion furniture imports last year. But the fallout will also be felt by smaller Southeast Asian exporters.\n\nWashington’s aggressive trade stance has prioritised the suffocation of Beijing’s access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology, setting the tone for Trump’s Malaysia visit. He arrives at a time when the region is racing to diversify its markets, yet remains acutely aware of the need to avoid antagonising China, its largest trading partner.\nSoutheast Asia is now part of a new region-centric supply chain being rapidly built out as global uncertainty rises in the wake of Trump’s protectionism, according to global strategy consultancy Roland Berger.\n“The traditional global supply chain no longer meets regional needs for resilience,” the firm said in its latest analysis, published last month. “Europe, North America and Asia are therefore building their own systems, laying the foundation for a multipolar global supply chain.”\nChina has already taken a leading role in establishing an Asia-centric supply chain, deepening ties with Southeast Asia and building economic and technological partnerships with both Japan and South Korea.\n\nBut for smaller countries like Malaysia, the fragmentation of global trade presents a dilemma, especially as it seeks to move up the value chain.\nMalaysia supplies around 13 per cent of the world’s advanced chip testing and packaging and aspires to expand into the more lucrative sectors of wafer fabrication and integrated circuit design. But any move to deepen links with China’s tech sector risks Washington’s wrath.\nDuring his visit to Malaysia last month, Greer described chips as “critical” to US national security and warned that regional manufacturers must shift production to America or face punitive tariffs. This follows Trump’s earlier threat to impose at least 100 per cent tariffs on semiconductor firms that resist relocating to the US.\n\n“When we scale up we’ll have to play both games, both supply chains. We have no choice,” Zafrul said, referring to accessing both the US and Chinese markets.\nThe trade chief, who has led Malaysia’s negotiations with Washington since April, said his team was laser-focused on finalising details of a deal ahead of Trump’s arrival. He said the agreement would offer long-sought clarity: “Once we have an agreement, it creates certainty.”\nThe pact is expected to formalise a 19 per cent tariff on Malaysia – matching rates the US imposed on Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand – in return for a US$240 billion pledge to invest in the US economy and buy a range of American goods, from corn to aircraft.\n“We never expected to stop Trump. Nobody was able to do it. Even Singapore,” Zafrul said, referring to the neighbouring city state that was hit with a 10 per cent tariff rate despite buying more from America than it sells and having “zero” barriers to trade.\n“What else can they give?” he asked, adding: “I’ve engaged my counterpart there [in the US], and I think their boss is very clear. He’s not going to just give up and reduce them [the tariffs] so fast.”","summary":"As the world’s two largest economies drift further apart, Malaysia’s top trade official has reached a sobering conclusion about what that means for Southeast Asia: businesses must build not one, but “two kitchens” to survive.\n“Our factories, our companies have to start preparing for having two kitchens,” Tengku Zafrul Aziz told This Week in Asia – an allusion to the reality that firms must now simultaneously cater to both American and Chinese demands and their increasingly divergent rules.\nThe...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3327816/malaysia-touts-2-kitchens-solution-us-china-trade-war-we-have-no-choice","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/03/a463575f-2bc4-4506-bf43-21e803dfd0e4_228585a2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-05 00:00:16","author":"Joseph Sipalan","authors":["Joseph Sipalan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.107},{"id":366254942,"title":"Trump reveals phone call that pushed Netanyahu to accept Gaza ceasefire: 'This is your chance for victory'","text":"Donald Trump told an Israeli news outlet that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted his plan for a ceasefire with Hamas during a decisive phone call.\n\nThis comes as Israel has expressed support for an end to the conflict and paused their bombing campaigns in Gaza.\n\n'Netanyahu had reservations but I told him that this is his opportunity for victory,' Trump told Israeli television's Channel 12 on Saturday.

Because of his rhetoric about 'making America great again', many people think he is backward-looking. \n\nYet Trump has managed to overturn decades of consensus of how US policy should work, both at home and abroad.\n\nThe property developer at the White House does not believe in 'business as usual' – and nowhere is this more obvious than in his approach to the Middle East.\n\nAlmost two years after the brutal rampage by Hamas fighters into Israel, people feared that – because Trump's promises to end the Gaza war upon re-entering the White House initially came to nothing – he had abandoned both Israeli hostages and Palestinian civilians to their fate.\n\nNot so. In the early hours of yesterday morning, the President took to social media to announce a breakthrough. A deal.\n\nAnd he had achieved it not with the normal long-winded process of assembling the various interested parties and reaching some sort of rickety consensus, but through the ruthless prioritisation of America's strategic concerns and his own electoral interests at home.\n\nTrump's antennae had picked up shifts in American public opinion which the wider Establishment has missed. Support for Israel had suddenly slumped at home.\n\nAs Trump well knows, moreover, he won over Muslim voters in a key swing state such as Michigan by promising to end the war in Gaza. So he took the initiative.\n\nWhile it's true that Trump has threatened Hamas with 'all hell' if the terrorists refuse to release their hostages and accept his peace plan, the bigger point is this: he bounced Israel into accepting a ceasefire and ending its occupation of Gaza. \n\nTrump put Benjamin Netanyahu's government on the spot, insisting that 'Israel must immediately stop bombing'. No Israeli government has faced such an American ultimatum before.\n\nPrime minister Netanyahu, whose US education taught him how to appeal directly to the American public, has long been able to swerve the demands of diplomats and even presidents. \n\nTrump, though, is the most media-savvy US President ever – and, in this way at least, is more than a match for Netanyahu. Trump is most authentically himself as a showman. He loves the drama of power. His critics focus on his vain demands that he be centre-stage. They see it as a weakness.\n\nYet while his opponents look the other way, they miss how the President manages to bend foes – and allies alike – to his will.\n\nTrump is a seething mass of contradictions. He is unafraid to use force yet has refused to get bogged down in the forever wars of his predecessors.\n\nLast June, Trump demonstrated full backing for Netanyahu when he dispatched B-2 bombers to join Israel's raids on the mullahs' underground nuclear facilities. \n\nBut no sooner had the mission been completed than Trump declared the targets destroyed and brought Israel's attacks on Iran to a sudden halt – well short of Netanyahu's goal of toppling the Ayatollah's regime.\n\nTrump wanted to protect Israel from destruction by an Iranian atomic bomb. But he did not want to reduce Iran to the kind of chaos that US-led regime change brought to Iraq in 2003.\n\nIt is possible that, to persuade Israel to sign up to his Gaza deal, the President has sweetened the pill – perhaps by assuring Netanyahu that the US Air Force would continue to suppress any renewed Iranian nuclear weapons project.\n\nBut make no mistake: on Gaza, Trump has squeezed Israel.\n\nIt was striking that in a video address yesterday, the President thanked a long list of Muslim states for helping him. But not Israel. Announcing a deal and seeing it through are very different things, of course.\n\nHamas will hope it has left itself some wriggle room. The terrorist group has agreed to Trump's demand for hostage releases but how the rest of the deal would be implemented has been left vague.\n\nThe fact that Hamas can still speak for anti-Israeli groups in Gaza suggests it intends to remain a player even if it promises to leave politics.\n\nSplits inside the Israeli government and between the Palestinians mean the 'lasting peace' announced by Trump could yet be sabotaged.\n\nBut he has seized the initiative in a way no other US President has ever done.\n\nHow he will react to anyone defying him – and trying to wreck the deal – is very uncertain.\n\nAnd that alone could be enough to deter hardliners in either camp from trying it on.","summary":"MARK ALMOND: Donald Trump is the most revolutionary President in US history.

The US ICE building in the city has recently been the site of nightly protests, which typically drew a couple dozen people in recent weeks before the deployment was announced.","summary":"ICE agents clash with protesters, deploying rubber bullets and pepper spray amid Chicago immigration demonstrations.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/4/border-patrol-agents-shoot-woman-amid-chicago-immigration-protests?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68e1a0bd-1759617213.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 23:30:37","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":366258812,"title":"US envoys head to Mideast as Trump warns Hamas against peace deal delay","text":"Donald Trump said that Israel had agreed to an initial line of withdrawal in Gaza and that the information had been shared with Hamas.

'But it should have been called Everyone Sucks But Me. 107 Days is a victim's title, because get it, she only had 107 days to win.\n\n'Yeah, and a billion and a half dollars, and a built-in army of about 75 million people who'd vote for any human-adjacent life form that wasn't Trump,' he continued.\n\nHe also pointed out that she heaps blame on former President Joe Biden for not dropping out of the race soon enough.\n\nThe then-81-year-old made the official call to step aside on July 21, 2024, and Harris was named the Democratic nominee just over two weeks later on August 5.\n\nMaher also joked about a passage in Harris's book that accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of not answering her call when she was asking for her endorsement.\n\nNewsom texted back, 'Hiking. Will call back.' According to Harris, he never did.\n\n'Gavin Newsom, he was asked for his endorsement, but texted, hiking, we'll call back. But then never did. And then he didn't even ask her to prom,' Maher said.\n\nOf course, Newsom did end up endorsing Harris later on that day and explained that he didn't realize it was Harris calling him.\n\nMaher then tackled the controversy that was Harris not picking Pete Buttigieg as her running mate because he is gay and that would have been 'asking a lot of America'.\n\n'America, America itself, lets Kamala down by not being ready for the running mate she really wanted, Pete Buttigieg. So she's stuck with the Home Depot paint salesman, and the rest is herstory. Poor Kamala,' Maher said, referring to her ultimate choice, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\n'We made her the star of a rom-com and didn't even give her a gay best friend, he added. \n\n'Kamala writes that on election night, when it was clear she'd lost, an aide peeled the words, Madam President, off the cupcakes before handing them out.

I am for you'.\n\nHer rhetorical pivot comes after many national Democrats, including Newsom, have said it is unfair for trans girls to play high school sports.","summary":"Bill Maher slammed Kamala Harris for not taking responsibility for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 election.

But we've also done the detailed work.'\n\nThis is an existential time for a party languishing at a rock-bottom 15 per cent in the polls.\n\nYesterday, it was reported that allies of Mr Jenrick were collecting no-confidence letters from Conservative MPs, calling for Mrs Badenoch to quit.\n\nUp to a dozen supporters were said to have penned the letters for deployment after November 3 – the date when the party leader's year of immunity from being ousted will lapse.\n\nMr Jenrick's team describe the reports as 'bollocks', but the mood in the party is undoubtedly febrile. \n\nMr Philp, said to covet leadership ambitions of his own, brushes away talk of a 'crisis' for the Conservatives, saying the party was in an 'expectant' mood ahead of its conference.\n\nHe said: 'I feel like we need to get behind Kemi, because being leader of the Opposition following a terrible election defeat –the worst election defeat for 200 years – is probably the toughest job in British politics. \n\n'Even Margaret Thatcher found doing that job in 1975 a tough gig.'\n\nThe 49-year-old, who clung on to his Croydon South seat with a majority of 2,000 last year, adds: 'I mean, look at the alternatives. You look at Labour imploding, putting up our taxes, losing control of our borders.\n\n'And you've got Reform with, you know, good slogans, yes, a charismatic leader, yes, but no credible plans to fix that country's problems. \n\n'So it falls to the Conservatives to provide that credible alternative.'\n\nThis weekend, Tory morale was further dampened by swirling rumours about further imminent defections to Reform following the departures of former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and MP Danny Kruger.\n\nBut Mr Philp remains chirpy: 'I was very sad Danny left. The door is always open if he wants to come back. \n\n'I think recovering after an election defeat like the one we suffered after 14 years in power, it just takes time. \n\n'It needs patience and that's what I would ask for.","summary":"The Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick, has been campaigning hard for the anti-migration measures that Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp has been setting out to The Mail on Sunday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15162973/Tories-strength-small-boats-crisis-Shadow-Justice-Secretary.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/04/23/102712219-0-image-m-39_1759618466615.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 23:15:24","author":"Editor,Glen Owen","authors":["Editor","Glen Owen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":366258024,"title":"Hamas and Israel are on the verge of a ceasefire. What’s being left unsaid, though, could scupper the deal","text":"Hamas announced that it has accepted several parts of the peace plan put forth by US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to finally end Israel’s war on Gaza.\n\nHamas has agreed to release the remaining Israeli captives it holds and is willing to hand over administration of Gaza to a technocratic committee proposed by the plan. \n\nHowever, Hamas did not say it would disarm. Nor did it agree to withdraw from Palestinian politics fully. Instead, it said the future of the Gaza Strip and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people should be decided on the basis of a “collective national position” and relevant international laws and resolutions.\n\nWith ceasefire talks resuming in Egypt on Monday, Netanyahu said he expected the hostages to be quickly released and Trump said he believes Hamas is “ready for a lasting peace”. \n\nHowever, there are many reasons for Hamas to be reticent about supporting a plan that is replete with ambiguity and robs Palestinians of agency to decide their own political fate. \n\nA future governance plan sidelining Palestinians\n\nSo, why does Hamas seem reticent? \n\nFirst, the plan envisages Israel’s continuing military occupation of Gaza until it can hand over responsibility to an “international stabilisation force” at some point in the future. \n\nThen there is the plan’s proposed governance structure.\n\nUnder the plan, Gaza would be administered through a transitional period by “a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee”. This would be responsible for delivering basic services to millions of starving, traumatised, homeless and jobless Gazans. \n\nYet, this committee would also include international experts, which will dilute Palestinians’ voices and their ability to decide the fate of Gazans. Again, many details remain unknown, including who will sit on the committee, when it will be formed and how many members would be Palestinian. \n\nA new international transitional body called the “Board of Peace” would also be formed, headed by Trump and purportedly including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Importantly, the plan does not specifically say the board would include any Palestinians.\n\nThe board would be responsible for the committee’s “oversight and supervision”. It would also oversee the reconstruction of Gaza until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is currently dominated by the Fatah party, has undergone reforms and is able to take back control of Gaza. \n\nMany questions remain unanswered here, too. These include:\n\na timeline for new elections for the Palestinian Authority\nwhether Gazans can take part in an election\nwhich political factions would be permitted to run candidates \nwhether these candidates would be screened by the board, and\nwho decides whether the PA has reformed sufficiently. \n\nThis leaves an open-ended political process exposed to differing interpretations that Hamas may fear will take power out of the hands of Palestinians. \n\nAfter Hamas’ statement was released, a senior Hamas official outright rejected the idea of the “Board of Peace”, saying:\n\nWe will never accept anyone who is not Palestinian to control the Palestinians.\n\nThe plan also stipulates that Hamas “and other factions” (left unstated and open to interpretation) will not have a role in the future governance of Gaza. And it mandates that Gaza be demilitarised. But how this would be achieved and by whom, again, remains unknown. \n\nWhat Palestinians say they want\n\nThese stipulations not only deprive the Palestinians of agency. They ignore the reality of Palestinian politics and the legitimacy that Palestinians attach to resisting Israeli occupation and the Netanyahu government’s stated goal of denying Palestinian statehood.\n\nThis highlights the greatest challenge for the “Board of Peace” – a reformed Palestinian Authority under the control of the Fatah party would struggle to gain legitimacy among Palestinians. \n\nIn a poll of 1,270 respondents in the Occupied Territories in May, Fatah garnered only 21% of popular support, compared with 32% for Hamas, and 12% for third parties. \n\nWhen asked what the PA should be doing, most respondents nominated forming a unity government comprising all Palestinian factions to negotiate with Israel and the international community to rebuild Gaza.\n\nWhen asked about plans to disarm Hamas, 77% of respondents in both the West Bank and Gaza opposed this action, with 65% of respondents opposed to expelling Hamas leaders from Gaza. \n\nTellingly, 80% of total respondents believed that if Hamas did disarm, Israel would not end the war and withdraw from Gaza. \n\nThe reality is some Palestinians still want Hamas to be a part of any future Palestinian government and remain capable of protecting Gazans from Israel’s military. \n\nThe disconnect between the plan’s aspirations and the political reality on the ground means it may have little chance of success, even if Hamas ultimately agrees to it.\n\nIt’s also unclear if Netanyahu truly supports the Palestinian Authority running a future Gaza, as the peace plan says. His remarks alongside Trump last week run counter to the plan:\n\nYour plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas. […] Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas nor by the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThis suggests that Netanyahu’s primary goal here is dismantling Hamas’ military capabilities and political rule, while also maintaining the political division that currently exists between Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem. \n\nHowever, this would deny Palestinians the only faction many see as willing to resist Israel’s occupation and its intent of destroying any chance of Palestinians gaining statehood. \n\nAdditionally, the establishment of a new civil and military bureaucracy to help Gaza’s transition would take an indefinite period of time. It would also be subject to the political whims of capricious Western leaders. \n\nThis would leave the Israeli military occupying Gaza for the foreseeable future. This means there would be nothing to protect the millions of Gazans from further assaults from a military already accused of serious breaches of international humanitarian law.","summary":"The political process described in Trump’s peace plan is open to differing interpretations and many fear it would take power out of the hands of Palestinians.","url":"https://theconversation.com/hamas-and-israel-are-on-the-verge-of-a-ceasefire-whats-being-left-unsaid-though-could-scupper-the-deal-266581","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/694423/original/file-20251004-56-pgi0mv.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C6000%2C3000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 23:12:08","author":"Department of Government and International Relations,Martin Kear,Sessional Lecturer,University of Sydney","authors":["Department of Government and International Relations","Martin Kear","Sessional Lecturer","University of Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":366254758,"title":"Israel has agreed to ‘withdrawal line’ in Gaza – Trump","text":"US President Donald Trump has said that Israel agreed to withdraw its army to the line it held before launching the major offensive on Gaza City last month.

They're not going to get that coming out of the military.'\n\nThat system shock can often be accompanied by difficulties in friendships or relationships, Castro added.\n\n'They're not ready for the emotions that they have when they look around and all of their high school peers are much further along in their careers than they are,' he said. 'They are starting over again.'\n\nFor some veterans, that restart can often feel meaningless.\n\nCastro explained: 'This feeling of 'what I did in the military was important,' and now what I'm doing is like, 'Who cares even if I did this job that I'm doing?'\n\nThat contrast can become even starker when veterans compare their current lives to their time serving.\n\nFor some, Castro said, the experience of being deployed and in combat can never be topped - but it goes away after leaving the military.\n\nHe said: 'They may not be there right away, but in about two-to-three years, they start looking fondly back upon their time in the military.\n\nIn many cases, it's one of the best times of their life.'\n\nBut then, veterans return to real life and face various forms of 'rejection', Castro said.\n\nThat can result in 'lone wolf' shooters, which is what happened last weekend as the figure of mass shooters with prior military experience grew to include Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, and Nigel Edge, 40.\n\nBoth had been deployed to Iraq.\n\nEdge allegedly killed three people and injured five in Southport, North Carolina, on September 27 around 9.30pm after using an assault rifle to shoot at a waterfront bar from a boat.\n\nHe is a combat veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, Southport police chief Todd Coring said at a news conference.\n\nThe 40-year-old - whose birth name was Sean William Debevoise - was a Purple Heart recipient. Edge's last assignment was with a Wounded Warrior battalion.\n\nIn addition, he was awarded the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, two Iraq Campaign Medals, Humanitarian Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. \n\nEdge was deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2005 and 2006, and served about six years in the Marines from 2003 to 2009, according to ABC News.\n\nAbout 12 hours later, Sanford rammed his car into a Mormon church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, before setting it ablaze and shooting at congregants, killing at least four and injuring eight. \n\nHe was shot dead by police in the church's parking lot.\n\nThe former Marine served from 2004 to 2008, working as an automotive mechanic and vehicle recovery operator.\n\nSanford was also deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom from August 2007 to March 2008. \n\nHe left the Marines ranked as sergeant.\n\nOne family friend told journalist Ty Steele that Sanford had been battling post-traumatic stress disorder. \n\nShe said: 'It's hard to feel sad for someone who did something so terrible, and I still feel sad. I had heard through family events that he had had PTSD.\n\n'He would make comments occasionally and it was something that was kind of talked about. It wasn't talked about in depth... so I don't know the depth of his issues.'\n\nSanford was a father-of-one. \n\nGene Petrino, a retired SWAT Commander, said that Sanford and Edge's stories were part of the wider trend regarding the abandonment of veterans.\n\nPetrino told the Daily Mail: 'What ends up happening is you're just like, cut off.

It needs to not just be once just a one time thing. There needs to be continuing follow-up with them as well.\n\nWhen it comes to the military, I think that we really are failing the veterans.'\n\nMilitary service is not a predictor of mass shooters, as only a minuscule portion of veterans carry out these heinous acts. Time in the military also does not mean combat experience.\n\nHowever, veterans show up much more frequently among shooters than in the general US population.\n\nVeterans carried out four of the 15 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history: the 1966 UT-Austin Tower shooting that killed 15, the 1991 Luby's Cafeteria shooting that killed 23, the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting that killed 26 and the 2023 Lewiston shootings that killed 18.\n\nThe full list is extensive.\n\nIn 2002, the deadliest mass shooting in Massachusetts history was executed by Michael McDermott. The US Navy veteran gunned down seven of his coworkers using an AK-47 variant rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and a .32 caliber pistol.\n\nSeven years later, then-major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and injured 32 at Fort Hood, Texas. It was the worst mass murder at a military base in US history.\n\nEarlier this summer, Army Sergeant Quornelius Radford shot and injured five soldiers at the Fort Stewart base in southeast Georgia.\n\nRadford, who was a supply sergeant, enlisted in January 2018. He had not been deployed.\n\nFollowing the Grand Blanc, Michigan, shooting, Donald Trump posted that Sanford, the suspect, was dead and 'there is still a lot to learn.'\n\nThe US president added on Truth Social: 'In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families.\n\n'THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!","summary":"Only about seven percent of Americans are veterans, per the US Census Bureau - but 26 percent of mass shooters over the last six decades had military experience.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15157131/army-veterans-mass-shootings-nigel-edge-thomas-sanford.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/02/21/102656599-0-image-m-15_1759437400033.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 23:02:25","author":"Editor,Wilko Martinez-Cachero","authors":["Editor","Wilko Martinez-Cachero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":366254142,"title":"To survive, the United Nations must leave America","text":"The annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) is always an occasion for taking stock of the state of the world. But this year, on the 80th anniversary of the UN’s founding, it was also an occasion to take stock of the organisation itself.\nBy any measure, the UN’s situation is dire. While Russian aggression against Ukraine and mounting tensions between the US and China cannot be blamed on the UN, they do highlight a fundamental problem.\nThe UN Security Council – where China, Russia, and the US each wield a veto – is locked in a permanent confrontation over one issue or another, blocking the rest of the organisation from moving forward on almost anything.\nConsider the situation in the Middle East, where the UN has played a central role in conflict resolution and peacemaking ever since the State of Israel was established (under a UN resolution).\nNumerous UN peacekeeping operations in the region have helped to alleviate tensions, and massive humanitarian efforts, primarily aimed at Palestinian refugee communities, have saved countless lives. While the UN has not forged a lasting peace, it has certainly helped prevent some wars and shortened others.\nIn recent years, however, the UN has increasingly been sidelined. The so-called Quartet – the UN, the US, the European Union, and Russia – is now a distant memory, and numerous UN operations have come under direct attack, primarily by Israel.\nThe Israeli government not only questions the humanitarian efforts of UNRWA (the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) but now also blocks the organisation’s work whenever it can.\nBefore Hamas’s Oct 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the UN was essential to keeping the situation in Gaza relatively stable. Though it couldn’t overcome divisions among the Palestinians, especially after Hamas assumed power in Gaza in 2006, it could, and did, help provide the basic means of survival for the enclave’s two million people.\nBut now Israel has questioned or attacked virtually every aspect of the UN’s work on this issue, and it could not have done so without America’s tacit support. US president Donald Trump, in particular, seems willing to accept virtually everything that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s extremist government does.\nMeanwhile, the UN has struggled to mobilise an effective response in South Sudan, a semi-failed state, and in Sudan, where a devastating civil war is entering its third year. Similarly, from the Katanga secession in 1962 to the recent peace operations in northeastern Congo, Central Africa continues to preoccupy UN peacekeepers and mediators.\nAround the world, there is no shortage of crises that demand UN engagement – from Gaza and Sudan to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, and Afghanistan, to name just a few.\nBut with the larger powers fixated on their confrontations with one another, and with the Trump administration withdrawing not only active support but also funding, the outlook for the UN appears grim.\nThe US provides 25% of UN funding, but it has stopped sending its contributions. It also traditionally accounts for an even larger share of voluntary financing for humanitarian operations, but these funds, too, have been cut. Making matters worse, China, the UN’s second-largest contributor, is also behind on its payments.\nWith its financial situation growing desperate, UN secretary-general António Guterres warns that staff across the organisation will need to be cut by one-fifth. Morale is said to be low, as is the prospect of a change for the better.\nWith his recent address to the UNGA, Trump made clear that he has nothing but contempt for the organisation. The Trump administration’s forthcoming review of America’s multilateral commitments is almost certain to deliver more bad news.\nDoes the UN have any future? While the demand for it is as great as ever, its ability to deliver has obviously been diminished. There is no way for it to survive without scaling back its ambitions and abilities; precisely how it goes about this will be a central issue over the next few years.\nWith Guterres’s tenure ending in 2026, the process of selecting his successor will also have to feature a debate about ensuring the UN’s long-term survival.\nMoving the headquarters out of the US is a natural step, owing not only to the withdrawal of US funding and the need for cost savings, but also to the US's refusal to grant visas to those attending UN gatherings (as it did with the Palestinian leadership this year).\nYes, a UN that is no longer headquartered in New York would be different in many ways. But relocation also may be the only way for it to survive.\nDag Hammarskjöld, the UN’s second secretary-general, famously remarked that the body was not created to deliver Heaven, but rather to spare us from Hell. That task remains as important as ever. But for things to stay the same, everything must change.\n\nCarl Bildt is a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"Moving the headquarters out of the US is a natural step, owing not only to the withdrawal of US funding and the need for cost savings, but also to the latter's refusal to grant visas to those attending UN gatherings.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/10/05/to-survive-the-united-nations-must-leave-america","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/37063430-united-nation-hq-wikipedia-pic-031025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 23:00:58","author":"Carl Bildt","authors":["Carl Bildt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":366257006,"title":"Arkansas gets to learn the hard way that votes have consequences","text":"This song is getting old. \n\nTwo weeks ago, the Arkansas Department of Education told child care providers their funding was being cut.

He did her a massive favor. Because now she doesn’t have to pretend to represent Canada anymore while following her true passion: representing Ukraine.\n\nFreeland has a new role: “Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine,” officially speaking. The first question that came to mind when hearing this was, “When does she finally get to move to Kiev, already?” Imagine my disappointment to learn that she doesn’t.\n\nWell, actually, my first question was, “Is Ukraine under reconstruction now? Did I slip into a coma and miss the bomb show wrapping up?” Nope, the conflict is still raging. But I guess it makes it sound like she’s going to be keeping a careful watch over the money that Carney has “pledged” to Ukraine – perhaps in the same way that people “pledged” to pay me a dollar per lap for my childhood swim-a-thons, then bailed when I came back to collect after competing 500 laps. I guess time will tell. Canadian taxpayers can only pray that will be the case, and that Carney is just virtue signaling Canadian cash for Ukraine and not actually sending any there, in the same way that the jokers running the EU make a big stink about the evils of Russian energy while importing it on the down-low through third countries.\n\nIn the meantime, Canadian cash for weapons, “for Ukraine,” is sure pumping up the integrated US/Canada military-industrial complex, which seems to be the go-to Western strategy for boosting their GDP these days amid their tanking economies.\n\nAnother question: Will Freeland use her experience in blocking Canadian bank accounts as Trudeau’s finance minister during the Covid-era Freedom Convoy anti-mandate protests to block shady cash flowing to Ukraine? I’m guessing not, if only because those Canadian bank accounts were blocked under the ultimately false pretext (as determined by Canadian intelligence) that foreign cash was funding interference with Canadian government decisions. In Ukraine’s case, that foreign cash is considered a plus because it’s coming from the West. Seems like she’d be more likely to tackle anything that got in its way.\n\nAnyway, Freeland has just used her new Canadian taxpayer-funded role to plead Ukraine’s case in the pages of the Financial Times.\n\nShe wrote that “the fact is that we need Ukraine to save us,” presumably from the other side of the world, in Ottawa. She then goes on to qualify some murky, contentious drone activity around the Ukraine–EU border as “recent incursions into Central and even Western Europe.” At least I think that’s what she’s referring to. Unless I somehow missed the Russian tanks rolling down the Champs-Élysées. She doesn’t specify. But no matter. All the better, apparently, to argue that these incidents “show NATO needs Ukraine as a shield against Russia.”\n\nSounds like what Vladimir Zelensky was saying just the other day. The Ukrainian leader was going off about an incident last month of some alleged 90 drones over Ukraine, which he said were heading for Poland. He said that if only 20 of them actually ended up there, it was only because Kiev shot the rest down. The implication? That Ukraine was saving Poland. Trump was asked about it at the time and didn’t exactly praise Zelensky as Poland’s savior. He basically shrugged, saying, look, whatever – could have just been accidental.\n\nFreeland also cited Trump’s tongue-in-cheek remarks from the other week when he rapped on social media about how Ukraine was winning on the battlefield against Russia and probably could even conquer Russian territory. He then offered to sell the Europeans all the American weapons they wanted in that endeavor. What part of Trump’s wishing them “good luck” did Freeland not understand as a commentary on Trump being keen to profit off the EU’s delusions, as long as Washington doesn’t have to get its hands dirty? She grasped none of it, apparently. Because she wrote in the FT that “US President Donald Trump got it right at the UN last week: Ukraine is a winner, and Ukraine can win.”\n\nFreeland literally had just written of Ukraine in the same piece, a bit further up, that “we have assumed it would lose, at least without extraordinary effort from us.” Really? Your whole posse in Canada has been saying otherwise for years. “Ukraine will win and Canada will be there until the end,” said Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand, in early 2023, when she was defense minister.\n\nSo now we’ve gone from “Ukraine will win” to “Ukraine will only win if we do everything except pull the trigger” to “we need Ukraine because NATO is so weak.” Yeah, so weak that NATO is actually contemplating blasting Temu-grade drones out of the sky with F-16s, as the Romanian defense minister suggested during a recent Warsaw Security Forum panel.\n\nFreeland adds that the West can learn from Ukraine about “how to fight a 21st-century war, and how to invent, manufacture and then keep reinventing the weapons we need for this new way of war in real time.” Look out, folks! Freeland has just discovered guerrilla warfare – but apparently not the double-edged sword it represents.\n\nIt’s all good when Ukrainian Nazis are getting schooled by NATO forces to fight Russia, and when they then graduate to fulfilling Freeland’s fantasy of pretending to teach NATO how to do guerrilla warfare – as though it’s a matter of NATO lacking ability and not just guerrilla warfare being way too cheap for NATO to justify washing tax cash into defense coffers.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong with letting Ukraine play asymmetric warfare “teacher” to justify the West turning it into a giant weapons toy box? It’s not like there haven’t been reports lately of Latin American drug cartels getting their drone training in Ukraine to use back home. We’re talking about Mexican and Colombian gangsters, according to Defense News, one of the leading military publications. Just your average start-up, really.\n\nFreeland then proceeds to cheerlead the idea recently promoted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz of straight-up stealing €140 billion in European-held Russian assets as a “loan” for Ukraine. Ukraine apparently just pays it back once Russia admits fault and writes a check, huh? In other words: never.\n\nIt’s one thing for Freeland to justify her new role by bloviating and virtue-signaling in the Western press. It’s another to make taxpayers foot the bill for it when her real job should be to end this war as quickly as possible through diplomacy so some legitimate reconstruction business can be done in Ukraine’s interests that doesn’t just involve perpetuating a taxpayer-funded racket.","summary":"The office of the “Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine” has been created for Canada’s ex-deputy prime minister \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/625899-canada-ukraine-freeland-taxpayer/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.10/article/68e1309a85f5407ab22c929d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 22:51:59","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":366258224,"title":"Liam Payne's mentor Nicole Scherzinger heartbreakingly shares final text exchange the day he died","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 5th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle embraces Anna Wintour and gets a kiss from Baz Luhrmann after stunning Paris Fashion Week with surprise appearance at Balenciaga alongside Anne Hathaway\n\nRayner is taking us for a ride: Weeks after she quit in disgrace, her boyfriend is ferried around by taxpayer-funded bodyguards in £80k BMW also paid for by you\n\n'I'll deport 750,000 illegal migrants': Kemi Badenoch vows to set up Trump-style Removals Force to seal Britain's porous borders\n\nPIERS MORGAN: Woke feminists and man-bun metrosexuals may sneer.

It was just chit-chat and pretty light,' she said in a new profile for the publication published this week.\nOne of Liam's last projects was an X Factor-style reality show called Building the Band, on which he and Nicole worked with Kelly Rowland as celebrity mentors.\n\n Nicole Scherzinger shares an unseen backstage photo of late singer Liam Payne from filming Netflix's Building The Band \n'I just adored Liam. He had such a good heart. I barely knew him when I put One Direction together. I just saw these talented boys and was like: \"I’m coming out of a girl group - I know the power of a group,\"' said Nicole.\nShe also reflected on the professionalism that drove her to go on with her performance of Sunset Boulevard the day Liam died.\n'The show must go on. From then on, I dedicated a little part of the show to Liam every night. Just a little moment that always made me think of him,' she said.\nWhen she was asked if Liam's death made her contemplate her own life as a public figure, she said: 'We need more compassion in the world. Our phones are our enemies as much as they help us. I wish we’d cancel cancel culture.'\nWeeks after Liam died, she herself was subjected to a torrent of social media blowback over a comment she left on a post by comic Russell Brand.\nRussell had posted an image of a MAGA-style hat reading: 'Make Jesus First Again,' to which Nicole commented: 'Where do I get this hat!!!?' on America's Election Day.\n\nLiam, pictured in 2023, suffered a fatal fall off a hotel balcony last October, and a subsequent toxicology report revealed alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system\n\nOne of Liam's last projects was a reality show called Building the Band, on which he and Nicole worked with Kelly Rowland as celebrity mentors; all pictured behind the scenes \nLeft-leaning fans flew into a frenzy, accusing Nicole of publicly endorsing Donald Trump, but the controversy did not put a dent in ticket sales for her Sunset Boulevard revival, which in fact enjoyed an increase in revenue that week, via Deadline.\nAbout a week after Liam's fall from the balcony, Sunset Boulevard composer Andrew Lloyd Webber revealed Nicole had been texting him the day he died.\n'I suppose something that hasn’t been said, and I suppose I could say, is that of course she mentored Liam, from One Direction. On the Wednesday when he died, she was still texting him that day,' he spilled to Billboard. \nAndrew, whose shows include Cats and The Phantom of the Opera, showered praise on Nicole for going onstage right after receiving word of Liam's death.\n'She’d just heard that he died, and the fact that she even did the show at all is extraordinary,' said the six-time Tony winner.\n'I mean, she is an amazing, amazing woman. She is without any question one of the finest performers I’ve ever worked with,' added Andrew.\nOne DirectionLiam PayneNicole Scherzinger\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLiam Payne's mentor Nicole Scherzinger heartbreakingly shares final text exchange the day he died\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The FBI is on the scene of what is described as an “evolving situation” which followed a week of the suspects doxing federal officers online, according to DHS. The agency condemned the apparent use of vehicles against law enforcement on Thursday after DHS said “illegal aliens” targeted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers with cars during two separate incidents in Chicago.\n\n“While conducting routine patrolling in the greater Broadview area, near the same area of Chicago that law enforcement was assaulted yesterday, our brave law enforcement officers were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars this morning,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a Saturday statement. “Agents were unable to move their vehicle and exited the car. One of the drivers who rammed the law enforcement vehicle was armed with a semi-automatic weapon. Law enforcement was forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed U.S. citizen who drove herself to the hospital to get care for wounds.” (RELATED: ‘I’ll … Kill You Right Now’: Chicago Anti-ICE Demonstrator Allegedly Threatened Federal Officers)\n\n This morning, during routine patrolling in Broadview, in the same area of Chicago that law enforcement were assaulted yesterday, our brave law enforcement officers were rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.

One… — Tricia McLaughlin (@TriciaOhio) October 4, 2025 \n\nICE launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago and across Illinois on Sept. 8 to target illegal migrants who “flocked” to the region due to its sanctuary laws, according to DHS. Local politicians, including Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Democratic Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, have railed against the Trump administration for these efforts. In addition, many riots have broken out across the region.\n\nDHS arrested more than 800 illegal migrants throughout the operation, “including [the] worst of the worst criminals,” the agency announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe agency repeatedly noted ICE agents are being targeted around the U.S. as they continue to carry out President Donald Trump’s promise to deport illegal migrants. By comparison, illegal migration hit record highs under the Biden administration.\n\n“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences. The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters,” McLaughlin continued. “They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer. Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

With a succession of mayors lacking competence, the city has struggled with rampant crime and become a refuge for undocumented immigrants, thanks to its “sanctuary” status.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by dispatching Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) to tackle this issue, but has encountered significant resistance from leftist demonstrators. President Trump has even hinted at deploying additional federal officers or the military to help resolve the situation.\n\nSo, when Illinois Governor JB Pritzker raised concerns on Saturday about the Trump administration’s decision to activate 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, it raised questions about their intended destination and purpose, particularly regarding Chicago.\n\nThe Trump administration plans to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Saturday.\nPritzker reported that the Guard had been notified that morning by the Pentagon about their deployment, though he did not reveal specifics about the timing or location.

The (Israel Defense Forces) IDF will continue to hold control of all the territories in the depths of Gaza, in a way that ensures we maintain control deep within Gaza.”\n\nHe also revealed that a recent operation in Gaza was ordered to pressure Hamas leadership directly.\n\n“In order to return 48 of our wounded soldiers, I ordered the IDF a few weeks ago to enter the most important base of Hamas; the city of Gaza,” Netanyahu said.\n\nWhile details of the full plan remain under negotiation, a general framework is emerging.\n\nAll hostilities would immediately end. Within 72 hours, Hamas would release all hostages it holds, living or dead. The militants still have 48 hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are alive.\n\nIsrael would free 250 Palestinians serving life sentences in its prisons and 1,700 people detained from Gaza since the war began, including all women and children. Israel also would hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians for each body of a hostage handed over.\n\nThe plan calls for Hamas to disarm and the withdrawal of Israeli forces in favour of an international security force. However, Netanyahu said his country would not agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza.\n\nThe territory would be placed under international governance, with Trump and former British prime minister Tony Blair overseeing it.\n\nTrump confirmed Israel’s initial approval of the plan in a social media post Saturday afternoon and urged Hamas to act quickly.\n\n“After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas. When Hamas confirms, the ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin,” the post read.\n\nThe White House X account retweeted Trump’s statement, which said that the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal “will bring us close to the end of this 3,000 YEAR CATASTROPHE.”\n\nAccording to reports, the plan also outlines a long-term political vision.\n\nIf the Palestinian Authority carries out reforms and redevelopment progresses in Gaza, the framework suggests that “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”\n\nA group representing families of Israeli hostages welcomed the announcement, calling the latest development “the closest we’ve come” to seeing their loved ones return home. In a statement Saturday, they urged Trump to push forward “with full force” and warned that “extremists on both sides” may attempt to derail the process.\n\nTuesday marks two years since the start of the conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and devastated much of Gaza.\n\n— With files from The Associated Press and The Canadian Press, Cara Anna And Samy Magdy in Cairo","summary":"Netanyahu says Hamas agreed to release hostages due to military pressure as a U.S.-led plan aims to end the Gaza war and free captives within days.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11464785/u-s-brokered-gaza-ceasefire/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f5bde6b9f999dfd9.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 22:30:47","author":"Prisha Dev","authors":["Prisha Dev"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":366252614,"title":"Hundreds gather in the Loop to mark two years of the Israel-Hamas war","text":"A few hundred people gathered Saturday in the Loop to mark two years of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nNoura Ebrahim with the U.S. Palestinian Community Network (USPCN)-Chicago and coordinator of Boycott Divest and Sanctions Chicago told the crowd of about 300 that protesters have been demonstrating every week in support of Palestinians and that they “will never surrender our right to exist as a people.”\n\n“We continue to march week after week for Palestine and in solidarity with immigrant rights groups fighting [President Donald] Trump’s agenda because our liberation is bound together with the liberation of all oppressed people,” Ebrahim said. “But marching is not enough. Statements are not enough. We are not just fighting genocide abroad. We are confronting the corruption, white supremacy and colonial mindset that sustain it here in Chicago and America here at home.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday he hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza “in the coming days,” as Israel and Hamas prepare for indirect talks in Egypt on Monday on a new U.S. plan to end the war that began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack on southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people while 251 others were abducted. Most of the hostages have been freed under previous ceasefire deals.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war has topped 67,000. The toll jumped after the ministry said it added more than 700 names whose data had been verified.\n\nBut Netanyahu signaled there would not be a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, something Hamas has long demanded. He said Israel’s military will continue to hold territories it controls in Gaza, and that Hamas will be disarmed in the plan’s second phase, diplomatically “or through a military path by us.”\n\nThe prime minister spoke after Hamas said Friday that it has accepted some elements of Trump’s plan to end the war in the Gaza Strip, including giving up power and releasing all remaining hostages, but that others require further consultations among Palestinians.\n\nTrump welcomed the militant group’s statement but on Saturday warned that “Hamas must move quickly, or else all bets will be off.”\n\nContributing: AP","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/war-in-gaza/2025/10/04/gaza-protest-downtown-chicago","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1287d93/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7008x4672+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2f%2Ff2%2F4535c0ed4651b15afc7c1920dc62%2Fgazap","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 22:24:52","author":"Sun-Times staff and wire reports","authors":["Sun-Times staff and wire reports"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.191},{"id":366254046,"title":"Trump wants a new dollar coin so rare it's probably illegal","text":"Donald Trump's embrace of self-aggrandisement is a well-known part of his personal brand, and it has been on full display in recent days after the US Treasury posted an image of a $1 coin featuring the US president in rally mode.\n\nThe draft image of the silver coin was posted on X and shows a graven image of Trump with his fist raised in front of a US flag and the words \"Fight - Fight - Fight\" around the rim.\n\nThe coin also features the phrases \"United States of America\" and the phrase \"E Pluribus Unum\", which also graces the Great Seal of the US.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Un-American': Governor slams Trump's military 'ultimatum'﻿\n\nThe Latin phrase translates roughly to \"out of many, one\", representing the federation of the US from a disparate set of states.\n\nTrump's fist pump is a signature move but gained new significance when he performed the gesture after he was shot at onstage during a rally in Pennsylvania during ﻿a 2024 presidential campaign rally.\n\nThe coin appears to be a proposed special edition silver dollar to celebrate the US's upcoming 250th anniversary as a nation.\n\nREAD MORE: Israeli PM's major hostage announcement﻿\n\n\"No fake news here,\" US Treasurer Brandon Beach posted on X.\n\n\"These first drafts honouring America's 250th Birthday and @POTUS are real.

An annuity with payments that rises 3 per cent annually can generate £5,800 a year, against nearly £5,100 a year ago – a near 14 per cent rise in income.\n\nTaking shelter: Pension savers can use the rise in government borrowing costs to their advantage thanks to higher annuity rates\nHelen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that its average fund used to purchase an annuity was £162,729 in the first six months of 2025. That is a big increase from £62,301 when rates were at a low four years ago\nShe says the trend busts the myth that annuities only appeal to those with smaller pensions, as those with larger pots are also making use of annuities as part of their retirement strategies.\n‘The higher incomes currently available will have made them a more tempting prospect for people with larger pensions who have decided that now is a good time to get a guaranteed annuity,’ she says.\nIs it time for more retirees to consider an annuity rather than remaining invested and drawing on their pension? We explain what you need to know.\nWhat is an annuity?\nSavers with defined contribution schemes will have built up an investment pot that they must turn into retirement income.\nThe two main options are to leave your pension invested and draw on it for income, or to use the pot to buy an annuity. You can also do a combination of the two.\nAnnuities provide a guaranteed income until you die. Their pricing is heavily influenced by the interest rate, known as the yield, offered by long-term gilts.\nAnnuities are a large and long-term purchase, and you can't change your mind afterwards, so are not something to buy on a whim after a market upset.\nThose in ill-health can get higher rates, while savers should also consider if they want to leave an income to a spouse or partner after death. Fixed-term annuities can also be bought, which provide income only for a set period and then some money back.\n> Essential guide: How to turn a pension into retirement income \n\nBond market trouble and better annuity deals\nHigher borrowing costs are a headache for the Government but also mean higher yields for institutions like big pension firms willing to lend it money.\nThe turmoil in the bond markets is down to fears Chancellor Rachel Reeves is losing her grip on the public finances at home, alongside wider global issues, including President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve in the US, and a debt crisis in France.\nThese ructions led to the yield on 30-year gilts - long-term UK debt - hitting a three decade-high of 5.75 per cent a few weeks ago before falling back to around 5.50 per cent.\nThat’s bad news for the Chancellor ahead of November’s Autumn Budget but enables pension firms to fund more attractive rates for people wanting a safe income from an annuity in old age.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nHelp with financial advice and planning\n\nFinancial planning can help you grow your wealth, sort your pension, or make sure your finances are as tax efficient as possible.\nKey reasons that many seek financial planning involve investing for retirement and inheritance tax planning.\nIf you'd like support on sorting your finances and want to work out whether you need advice, planning, or coaching, we've partnered with financial adviser, Flying Colours, who can help:\n> Are you retirement ready?

There are various ways to combine annuities with investment drawdown, such as buying a fixed term annuity - which provides a guaranteed income for a set period of time - for example to fill a gap from early retirement until state pension age.\nAnother is to use income drawdown to fund early retirement and then buy an annuity for safety and less hassle monitoring investments in later life.\nThis strategy allows you to wait to see if annuity rates improve further and potentially take advantage of better rates if your health deteriorates as you grow older.\nYou can also combine drawdown and an annuity at the same time. That lets you secure a minimum level of guaranteed income to cover essential household bills with an annuity, while keeping the remainder of your pension invested with the potential for further growth and the ability to withdraw regular or ad hoc sums.\nWilliam Burrows, financial adviser at Eadon & Co, says the yield on 30-year gilts has been at its highest since 1998.\nHe says: ‘Consequently annuity rates are at their highest level for many years. It might make sense to take less investment risk with your pension pot and secure an annuity at these high levels.\n'For some people it may make sense to arrange annuities in slices as they get older and need more income security and want to take less risk.'\n\n The little-known trick to lock in a guaranteed 9% return on your pension savings - here's what you need to do \nChoose your annuity carefully\nMorrissey suggests looking carefully at the types of annuities available to make sure you get the right type for you.\n'A level annuity may give the highest starting income, but it won’t rise every year like an inflation linked product. A single life annuity will also not make provision for a spouse or civil partner when you die.'\nMeanwhile, you have the option to buy a guarantee period that ensures your family doesn't lose the entire amount paid upfront if you die a few years after buying an annuity.\nDaniel Swift, head of financial planning at TrinityBridge, says higher interest rates in recent years have meant people pay more attention to annuities, but demand is still below levels seen before more flexible retirement options became widely available following pension freedoms.\n'Our planners discuss annuities with clients in terms of their strengths - such as guaranteed income - and their drawbacks, including inflation risk if payments remain fixed,' he says. 'But the decision rarely comes down to rates alone.'\nHe explains that while fluctuating rates can spark conversations, whether a client chooses an annuity depends far more on their individual circumstances, goals, health, access to alternative savings, and risk appetite.\nSwift adds: 'Taking out an annuity is a final and fixed decision, which suits some people very well. But with pension rules and tax legislation continually evolving, many prefer to retain some flexibility and keep their options open if circumstances change.'\n\nTips on buying an annuity \n\n- You might be able to get an 'enhanced' rate if you wait to buy an annuity until you are older and your health has worsened.\n- If you are healthy, the best rates are on single life, no inflation-link 'level' annuities, but weigh up cost of living pressures because it can be better value to get some protection against rising prices over the long run.\n- If you buy a single, not a joint, life annuity there will be nothing for your spouse if you die first, so consider what they will have to live on and discuss it with them before making a decision.\n- Buying an annuity with a 'guarantee period' protects against the loss of all or most of your purchase money if you die shortly afterwards. \n\nSIPPS: INVEST TO BUILD YOUR PENSION\n\n0.25% account fee.

Ruben Gallego has sharply criticized President Donald Trump’s suggestion that the military use American cities as “training grounds,” calling the idea dangerous and unconstitutional.\n\n“The oath that our members of the military take – they will not be firing upon … their own neighbors. Only an idiot like Donald Trump would believe such a thing,” Gallego, a Marine veteran, said on CNN.\n\nThe Arizona Democrat’s comments came hours after Trump told an unprecedented gathering of more than 800 generals and admirals that he intends to deploy the National Guard and active duty military personnel to U.S. cities run by “radical” Democrats.\n\nHe mentioned San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles and reiterated a vow to deploy troops into Chicago.\n\n“I told Pete,” Trump said, referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military – National Guard, but military.”\n\n“We’re going to straighten them out, one by one,” Trump said. “And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.”\n\nGallego was one of many Democrats who rejected Trump’s assertion of a domestic “invasion” that justifies troop deployments. If Trump follows through on his threats to use military force on American streets, he said, “most U.S. citizens will stand against that in civil protest. And you’ll have many of us joining them.”\n\nThe senator also warned that troops would face legal consequences if they use force against fellow Americans.\n\n“We’ll do everything within our constitutional power to make sure we hold anybody accountable should they ever do something of that nature,” he told CNN on Tuesday afternoon. “And whether it’s now or when this president is gone, anybody that engages in that type of action against our civilian – military will be held accountable, one way or the other.”\n\nGallego, who served as an infantryman in Iraq, asserted that the commander in chief “doesn’t actually understand how the military works” if he believes that American military personnel would turn their weapons against civilians.\n\n“Most and all the people I’ve ever served with understand their oath to the Constitution. It’s not to this president, and when that moment comes, they are going to live up to that Constitution,” he said.\n\nAlong with the president, Hegseth addressed the top officers Tuesday in Quantico, Va., urging them to resign if they oppose his shift away from political correctness in what he prefers to call the “Department of War.” (A formal name change would require an act of Congress.)\n\nGallego called Hegseth “a joke” who has politicized the military.\n\n“This is the most political Department of Defense that has ever existed, and it is not fulfilling its role and mission to protect us,” he said. “It’s now becoming an arm of this presidency.”\n\nTrump announced Sept. 27 on social media that he will deploy federal troops into “war ravaged Portland.” The description left residents puzzled, and Oregon and the city have gone to court to block a deployment.\n\nTuesday’s comments underscored the president’s enthusiasm for such deployments regardless of local objections, crime rates or legal concerns like those raised by Gallego.\n\n“We are under invasion from within,” Trump said.\n\nTrump sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June in response to protests over immigration enforcement. A federal judge ruled that deployment was unlawful under the 1898 Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement. An appellate court disagreed and the case is pending.\n\nTrump also put troops on the streets of the nation’s capital for 30 days, though Washington, D.C., is unique because the district government operates under federal oversight.","summary":"The oath that our members of the military take – they will not be firing upon … their own neighbors,\" Sen.

A map with his social media post appeared to show much of Gaza still open to Israeli forces.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Israel’s army said the country’s leaders had instructed it to prepare for the first phase of the US plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has moved to a defensive-only position in Gaza and will not actively strike, said one official. The official said no forces have been removed from the territory.\n\nBut Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiyah told the Associated Press that Israeli strikes killed five Palestinians across Gaza City, while bombing had “significantly subsided”.\n\nThe army statement came hours after Mr Trump ordered Israel to stop bombing Gaza once Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan.\n\nMr Trump appears determined to deliver on pledges to end the war and return all hostages, ahead of the second anniversary on Tuesday of the attack that sparked it.\n\n“After negotiations, Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line, which we have shown to, and shared with, Hamas.

Egypt’s state-run broadcaster Al-Qahera News, which is close to security agencies, reported that indirect talks between Hamas and Israel will start on Sunday.\n\nאחיי ואחיותיי אזרחי ישראל, אנחנו על סף הישג גדול מאוד. זה עדיין לא סופי, אנחנו עובדים על כך במרץ, ואני מקווה בעזרת השם שבימים הקרובים, עוד במהלך חג הסוכות, אוכל לבשר לכם על השבת כל חטופינו, החיים והחללים כאחד, בפעימה אחת, כשצה\"ל נשאר בעומק הרצועה ובשטחים השולטים בה. pic.twitter.com/pekpeVSCkP\n— Benjamin Netanyahu - בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu) October 4, 2025\n\nA senior Egyptian official said US envoy Steve Witkoff will travel to Egypt to head the US negotiating team in the talks to release the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli detention.\n\nThe talks also will discuss maps showing the expected withdrawal of Israeli forces from certain areas in Gaza, said the official.\n\nThe official involved in the ceasefire negotiations also said Arab mediators are preparing for a comprehensive dialogue among Palestinians aimed at unifying their position on Gaza’s future.\n\nThe Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the second most powerful militant group in Gaza, said it accepted Hamas’ response to the Trump plan. The group had rejected the proposal days earlier.\n\nUnder the plan, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of them believed to be alive, within three days. It also would give up power and disarm.\n\nIn return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of Gaza, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction.\n\nHamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians.\n\nIts statement also did not address the issue of Hamas demilitarising, a key part of the deal.\n\nA group representing some families of hostages said the prospect of seeing loved ones return “has never been closer”.\n\nThey appealed to Mr Trump to keep pushing “with full force” and warned that “extremists on both sides” will try to sabotage the plan.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza tried to piece together what the plan means in real terms.\n\n“We want practical implementation. We want a truce on the ground,” said Sameer Qudeeh in Khan Younis. He worried that talks will break down again.\n\n“I hope Hamas ends the war, because we are truly tired,” said Mohammad Shaat in Khan Younis, as anxious Palestinians roamed the shattered streets.\n\nIsraeli troops were still laying siege to Gaza City, the focus of its latest offensive. On Saturday, Israel’s army warned Palestinians against trying to return to the city, calling it a “dangerous combat zone”.\n\nTwo Gaza City residents told the AP that since the morning, Israeli tanks and troops had not advanced but artillery shells and airstrikes were still heard.\n\n“We can still see the quadcopters everywhere,” Mohamed al-Nashar said.\n\nIn southern Gaza, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said its Saraya field hospital received 10 bodies and more than 70 injured after Israeli strikes on Saturday.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll in the war has topped 67,000.\n\nThe Health Ministry does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.\n\nThe ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the UN and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.","summary":"In a brief statement on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he has sent a delegation to Egypt ‘to finalise technical details’.","url":"https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/netanyahu-hopes-to-announce-release-of-all-hostages-from-gaza-in-coming-days-1815140.html","image":"https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjVcXFwvMTBcXFwvMDQxOTAzMTBcXFwvN2Q3YTFhZDJhZDlhNDU5ZGIzMDRjODliNWEzOTk2MGUtMi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NzAwLFwiaG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 22:13:19","author":"BreakingNews.ie,Press Association","authors":["BreakingNews.ie","Press Association"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":366245700,"title":"Comedy star admits he was ‘completely devastated’ by Kirk murder, calls outrage over Kimmel hypocritical","text":"Veteran comedian Jamie Kennedy said he was \"completely devastated\" by the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, despite never having met him. The \"Malibu’s Most Wanted\" and \"Scream\" star and host of the \"Hate to Break It to Ya\" podcast told Fox News Digital that he was shocked not only by the killing of Kirk but also by the reactions of people who celebrated his death. \"And then just to see [the killing] was just, you know, it was beyond shocking. So that was one level. And then to see people's reactions to it was just – it was just beyond sick. It was just beyond evil, sick, disgusting, and that really messed me up,\" Kennedy said. GAVIN NEWSOM FACES BACKLASH FOR 'RECKLESS' POST ABOUT KRISTI NOEM AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION Like many Americans, the actor and stand-up comic said Kirk’s death on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University hit him \"on the deepest of levels.\" \"I've never been so sad and so mad about someone that I never met. And I was completely, I was just completely devastated by this,\" he said to Fox News Digital. Kennedy said he struggled to comprehend that the killing happened during a free-speech event on a college campus. \"Why? Why did this happen? Like, where are we at? If you go onto a college campus, right, a place that's supposed to be the epitome of open ideas, OK? And then you go there, and then you're gunned down for a speech.\" He said that seeing people celebrate his killing revealed to him the \"newest low\" in human behavior and made him realize how divided things really are in America. \"But then to see people celebrating it, that's just a newest low. And I don't remember seeing this in my 55 years… So, it changed me because I don't want to be around anybody like that. I don't want to be near anybody like that. I want to be in my own area with people that share my ideas, my values, and let people that share those ideas and those values over there.\" 'LAST CALL' STAR JAMIE KENNEDY TALKS CANCEL CULTURE: 'THERE'S NO FORGIVENESS ANYMORE' Despite the shock and horror he felt over Kirk’s assassination, Kennedy pointed to the positive response, which included memorials and religious services held not only in the U.S. but around the world. He called the positive response to Kirk’s death \"the greatest advertisement for Jesus ever.\" He pointed to the power of Kirk’s wife, Erika Kirk, forgiving her husband’s murderer at his memorial in Arizona. \"When his wife forgave the murderer, that is literally, she is the living embodiment of Jesus's message… That was the ultimate forgiveness. I couldn't believe that she did that,\" he said. \"It was the most beautiful act of forgiveness we've ever witnessed.\" While talking to Fox News Digital, Kennedy weighed in on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host Jimmy Kimmel being suspended by Disney and ABC. Kimmel was taken off-air for several days for suggesting that the murder suspect, 22-year-old Utah native Tyler Robinson, could be a supporter of President Donald Trump. Where many Hollywood figures condemned Kimmel being pulled off the air, arguing it was censorship or a violation of free speech, Kennedy said it was fair because he made cracks at the horrific story that American viewers didn’t want to hear. \"It's like, ‘Yo, something horrific happened,'\" he said. \"’There’s one trillion things you can joke about. Maybe just not joke about this right now.’A comedian's number one thing to do is what? Read the room. The second one is to point out hypocrisies.\" Kennedy continued. \"No one wanted to hear any jokes about that. I still don't. OK? It was just terrible to do, OK? Should a person be canceled for a joke? Obviously not. But here's the thing: The hypocrisy looms large.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Kennedy explained that while Kimmel got a slap on the wrist for making Kirk’s killer monologue fodder, entertainers like sitcom legend Roseanne Barr and \"Star Wars\" actress Gina Carano had their careers destroyed for social media posts. \"Roseanne was on the same network, a comedic icon and a female. So, you get your female, you get your comedic icon on the number one show – 18 million viewers. Canceled for a tweet. She was banished – banished – to her macadamia nut farm in Hawaii, like gone. Never reconsidered.\" \"Gina Carano in the same company – gone, thrown out for a tweet. So, no, the hypocrisy is ridiculous,\" he added. Kennedy did say that he believed Kimmel’s apology for the line that got him suspended was sincere. \"I believe it was a very sincere apology, and I believe that he's truly sorry. And I've done his show many times. He's always been a very good guy to me.

This is an unprecedented new issue for the UN,” Zhang wrote in a paper in the Journal of International Studies that was published online last week.\nZhu from Bucknell University said Trump’s isolationist approach had tarnished America’s image. “Even if future US presidents wish to return to multilateralism and global leadership, it will take a long time to restore trust and credibility,” he said.\nAs the United States retreats from its traditional leadership role at the UN, countries including China – the world’s No 2 economy and the biggest provider of peacekeepers among the UN Security Council’s permanent members – appear to be racing to fill the void.\nIn New York last week, Premier Li Qiang pitched China as “a staunch defender of world peace and security” and touted its new Global Governance Initiative to reshape the international order.\n\nChina also announced that it would not seek special benefits as a developing nation in current and future WTO negotiations, a move seen as Beijing trading off economic privileges for greater global political standing.\nUnesco launched its International Institute for STEM Education in Shanghai last week in another example of China’s growing influence in the UN. China will also partner with the UN to establish a global centre for sustainable development in the city.\nHowever, Beijing has repeatedly said it does not intend to unseat the US as the dominant global power.\n“Early indicators are that even as the UN enters a ‘leaderless’ era, China is reticent to accept the volume of funding, policy process management and relentless criticism that comes as part of the burden of filling the US leadership shoes,” said Courtney Fung, an associate professor at Macquarie University in Australia.\n“It’s still unclear whether and how China’s new suite of global governance efforts – [the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative] and the latest GGI – offer substance over more than symbolic criticism of a US-led international order,” she added.\nStill, Beijing’s growing footprint has put Washington on alert.\nMike Waltz, the US top envoy to the UN, told Senate lawmakers at his confirmation hearing in July that he would prioritise “countering China” in the organisation, which he characterised as “critical”.\nThe strategic competition between the two powers now extends into global governance and international organisations, in particular the UN, according to Zhang from Fudan University.\nHe wrote that the US-China rivalry “over interests, institutions and values poses a formidable challenge to the UN”.\nIt comes at a time when geopolitical risks “exceed levels seen during the Cold War”, according to the Global Peace Index 2025 released by Sydney-based think tank the Institute for Economics and Peace in June.\n\nThat is being driven by heightened military spending, stalled efforts at nuclear disarmament, the diminished role of multilateral institutions like the UN and WTO as well as increasing competition among major and middle powers and regional blocs, the report said.\nIt also noted that from 2011 to 2024, the UN Security Council saw an increase in the use of vetoes and a decline in successful resolutions – reversing the trend in the first two decades after the end of the Cold War.\nBut neither the US or China, both permanent Security Council members, mentioned reform of the body during their speeches at the UN General Assembly high-level week.\nMany other countries did – including India, Japan, Finland and Singapore – shedding light on another aspect of the UN’s crossroads moment. As Washington steps back from its leadership role, other capitals, particularly in the Global South, are growing frustrated over their lack of permanent seats in the UN’s most powerful body.\nThe exclusive veto power of the five Security Council permanent members, also known as the P5, has frequently left the body paralysed – especially over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, where it has achieved little. Russia is one of the P5.\n“The Security Council has a composition that doesn’t correspond to the world of today,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said last month. “It corresponds to the world of 1945.”\nGuterres also expressed support for a proposal from France and Britain – both Security Council permanent members – to limit the right of veto, especially in the case of “massive violation of human rights or dramatic cases of this kind”.\nOn Wednesday, the UN General Assembly convened a debate on the US vetoing a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip on September 18.\n“A veto can extinguish hope for those trapped in conflict,” Baerbock said during the meeting.\n\nFu Cong, China’s permanent representative to the UN, condemned the US move.\n“If it were not for the United States’ repeated abuse of the veto, the Security Council’s response to the Gaza crisis would not have been so inadequate,” he said.\n“If it were not for the United States’ shielding of Israel, council resolutions and international law would not have been so flagrantly violated.”\nZhu from Bucknell University said reform of the UN was “inevitable and desirable” and the veto power held by the P5 states should be “abolished”.\n“Expanding the Security Council is complicated regarding who and how many new members should be included,” he said.\nAccording to Parlamis from the University of San Francisco, Washington’s isolationist policies might create a “tremendous opportunity” for countries in Africa, Asia and South America to step into a leadership role in the UN, which “could also help catalyse long-due reforms”.\n“Ultimately, reform of the UN … is most critical to help restore UN legitimacy and efficacy,” she said. “If the US continues to isolate, the world will have no choice but to move on without it.”","summary":"After a week-long gathering of leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York, its president struck a positive tone on Monday.\nAnnalena Baerbock, the former German foreign minister, said there was a collective will to “choose the right path at the crossroads”.\n“If high-level week is any indication, this house is fulfilling that purpose – the United Nations is still relevant,” she said.\nBut 23 years after Kofi Annan spoke of the UN’s “fork in the road”, when he was secretary general, the...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3327827/us-retreat-un-may-create-tremendous-opportunity-nations-china","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/03/0d623078-c485-4129-bbda-b207a9addc2a_94a2fef2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 22:00:09","author":"Orange Wang,Shi Jiangtao","authors":["Orange Wang","Shi Jiangtao"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":366247140,"title":"Inside Trump's Bid for Nobel Peace Prize as Norway Prepares for 2025 Winner Announcement","text":"US President Donald Trump has intensified efforts to be considered for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, prompting scrutiny in Norway ahead of the official announcement on 10 October. Trump has publicly highlighted his role in the 2020 Abraham Accords, which normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab nations, and has claimed to have ended at least six conflicts - including an armed conflict between India and Pakistan in May, fighting between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda-backed rebels, and border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia - worldwide since returning to the White House in January. Critics, however, dispute these claims, noting that many of the hostilities were smaller in scale, predated his presidency, or involved conflicts in which his role was limited. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly last week, Trump said: \"Everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize,\" citing his record in the Middle East. At a separate gathering of senior US military officials on Tuesday, he added: \"They'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing. That would be a big insult to our country.\" Behind the scenes, Trump's campaign has involved lobbying efforts by his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Reports by Bloomberg indicate that Witkoff has raised the Nobel bid with European counterparts, while Trump himself spoke to Norway's finance minister and former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg during a phone call in Oslo earlier this year. Also Read: Trump Craves Nobel Prize Glory, But Committee Dismisses Noise Corporate figures have also weighed in. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla praised Trump's handling of Operation Warp Speed, noting that the rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines \"would typically be worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.\" The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the laureates, operates independently and its deliberations are sealed for 50 years. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the Norwegian Nobel Institute, told Bloomberg: \"The committee hasn't been on the receiving end of any direct political pressure, but there are obviously several campaigns going on, both in public and private.\" Historically, efforts to influence the prize have occurred before. Ahead of the 2010 award, officials in Beijing and Oslo warned the Nobel Committee of potential consequences if a Chinese dissident were chosen. The committee awarded the prize to Liu Xiaobo, a jailed human rights activist, and it took six years to repair diplomatic and economic ties. Trump's efforts contrast with the more understated approach traditionally expected by the Norwegian committee. Hilde Eliassen Restad, Associate Professor of International Studies at Oslo Nye University College, said: \"Culturally, Trump is very much an antithesis for Norway. He's not subtle, not elegant, so that's very much different this time. But that's how he achieves his goals, so you could see why he would think he could get away with it.\" For the 2025 award, nominations closed on January 31 and included 338 candidates, of which 94 are organisations. Members of national assemblies, organisations such as the International Court of Justice, university professors, and former laureates are eligible to nominate. Republican Congresswoman Claudia Tenney has twice nominated Trump, citing his work on the Abraham Accords. Another nomination came from Oleksandr Merezhko, head of Ukraine's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, who has since attempted to withdraw it. Despite his efforts, experts note that Trump's public campaigning may clash with the committee's culture of discretion and independence. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide emphasised: \"It's simply up to the Nobel committee. It's important to remember it's an independent committee.\" Observers also note that committee composition may shift in 2026, with the potential for political changes in Norway to influence future selections. Tenney said: \"The way the committee is formed right now, even if he were to solve world peace today, he still wouldn't [get it].\" The 2025 winner will be revealed at Oslo City Hall on 10 December, marking the culmination of the committee's deliberations, which remain confidential for decades.

Lyft was letting me know that my driver, who had spent 20 minutes lecturing me about how President Trump has laundered money for Russia for decades and that Antifa doesn’t exist, had registered a complaint claiming I had discriminated against him — presumably because I disagreed with his hectoring screed. The most amazing thing about Portland isn’t actually how far left-wing it is. Everyone has seen episodes or clips from the TV show \"Portlandia.\" It’s how sure the people there are that everything is fine — that occasionally walking past dead bodies on the sidewalk is a normal American experience. DAVID MARCUS: IN DEMOCRAT PORTLAND, LUXURY, VAGRANCY AND TOTAL DISORDER And how sure they seem to be that not only is anyone calling themselves a Trump supporter wrong, but immoral. Tara Faul is a Portland-based photographer who has done excellent work documenting (and often feeding) the homeless addicts in her woebegone hometown. I was struck by something she posted on X while I was there. \"At a Portland concert last night, I heard a guy give the ‘every city is like that, bro’ to an out-of-town couple who had a rough experience in our city,\" she began, adding, \"The wife was like, ‘No, I work in downtown Detroit, and it’s not like that.’ I was there this year and agree. It’s much cleaner.\" This perfectly summed up the feeling I had — that the people in Portland are rather like a frog in boiling water. Even as the temperature rises, they cannot seem to feel the change. Jackie, a bartender whose family has lived in the area for a century — and who is as nice as can be — told me, \"You’re only talking about downtown. The rest of the city isn’t really like that.\" Sure, every city has nice neighborhoods and not-so-nice ones. But the downtown area is what everyone shares. It’s the face of a city, and in the Rose City, it almost feels like Dickensian London. Portland is very fashion-forward. There, you’ll see natty three-piece suits, handlebar mustaches and hair colors of such variety that, when in large groups, the heads appear almost like an open bag of Skittles. Much like the elites of a Charles Dickens tale — tapping walking sticks in their finery while using a nosegay to mitigate the stench of the masses — in Portland, human misery fades into the background, like the quiet but incessant rain. I could almost hear the hipsters mutter to themselves, \"Are there no soup kitchens? Are there no safe injection sites?\" About a quarter of the storefronts, by my count, are vacant. What remains is all expensive. Outside of a class group in a museum, I’m not sure if I saw a child the entire four days I was there. There’s just no life in the place. But, having said all that, the pickle at the end of the day is that, from what I can tell, most people in Portland think things are fine — great even. And if that’s true, then who are we in the rest of the country to tell them they’re wrong? That’s where the warning comes in for every American city. When you hand local government over to the far left, and it refuses to maintain order, you wind up with something like \"Blade Runner,\" where the wealthy and protected flourish, the vagrants languish and die, and everyone else stays the hell away. This is how you end up with a city where the local police arrest journalists for daring to cover the fact that Antifa has been given control of the streets — because in Portland, if you are anything short of a committed leftist, you can start to feel a little less than human. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The message I got from Lyft at the Portland airport instructed me to reply by saying I acknowledged the vague complaint against me. Instead, I wrote something to the effect of, \"Your driver lectured me about the evils of Donald Trump and was quite rude.\" When I arrived at Dulles and tried to use the Lyft app, no drivers would appear for me. I actually laughed — and then just used a different app. But it isn’t actually funny, because this is how social credit systems work. If you say something supposedly offensive, you can’t have a bank account or get a car. And I do think many, if not most, Portlanders would deep down agree that expressing conservative views deserves punishment. I can say with certainty that I have no desire to return to Portland, but I can also say, with great trepidation, that I’m a little worried Portland may be coming to me — and to all of us.

The attack also damaged several buildings nearby.\n\nIn a statement shared on Telegram, Gaza’s civil defence agency said seven children between the ages of two months and eight years old were among those killed.\n\nIsraeli forces also targeted a displacement camp in al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, killing two children and wounding at least eight others.\n\nAl-Mawasi is a so-called safe humanitarian zone that the Israeli army has been ordering Palestinian families to evacuate to. But the area has been repeatedly targeted over the last few weeks and months.\n\nThere have also been air raids on other areas, including in Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from az-Zawayda.\n\n“Hospitals are unable to treat all of these Palestinians,” she said, referring to the handful of battered medical facilities that remain functional in the north amid a severe fuel shortage.\n\n“What is happening on the ground doesn’t show that there is any type of ceasefire,” she said.\n\nTrump demands urgency\n\nOn Saturday, Trump urged Hamas to move quickly to release captives and finalise negotiations over his plan to end the war, “or else all bets will be off”.\n\n“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn a separate post later on Saturday, Trump said Israel had agreed to an initial “withdrawal line” and that it was also shared with Hamas.\n\n“When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he wrote.\n\nHamas had agreed to certain key parts of Trump’s 20-point proposal, including Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners. But the group has left some questions unanswered, such as whether it would be willing to disarm.\n\nTrump will be sending his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to Egypt to finalise the technical details of the captive release and discuss a lasting peace deal, according to a White House official. Egypt will also host delegations from Israel and Hamas on Monday to discuss things further, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThe first phase of Trump’s proposal includes the return of all captives, dead and alive, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed negotiators will be working on a timeline for the release of the remaining captives under Trump’s Gaza plan in Egypt.\n\nHe also reiterated that the US proposal includes the demilitarisation of Hamas.\n\nThat will be achieved either through Trump’s proposal or through Israeli military action, he said. He added he hoped to announce the return of the captives, all while the Israeli military remained deep in Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas has decried Israel’s ongoing attacks on the enclave, saying they are proof of “Netanyahu’s lies” about ceasing its offensive in the enclave after Trump’s call.\n\n“The Zionist occupation army continues to commit its horrific crimes and massacres against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” Hamas said in a statement.\n\nThe group called on the international community, including Islamic and Arab states, to take “urgent action to protect and provide relief to our people”.\n\nAdnan Hayajneh, a professor of international relations and US foreign policy at Qatar University, said Hamas wants guarantees that if it releases the Israeli captives, there will be implementation of the rest of Trump’s 20-point plan. This includes a clear picture of what the future governance of Gaza will look like.\n\n“There’ll be a long negotiation, and Hamas will take part in it,” Hayajneh told Al Jazeera.\n\nArab leaders also aired some reservations about the plan to Trump, “but most of the reservations were not taken into consideration regarding the governance of Gaza, the military forces … the future of arms,” said the professor.\n\n“If you look at the plan, it’s almost a surrender for Hamas,” he added. “I think they’re leaving that bargaining chip, which is very important, the hostages, for the last minute.”\n\nIsrael’s war on Gaza has killed more than 67,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and experts believe the actual toll could be as much as three times higher.","summary":"Donald Trump urges Hamas to move quickly to release captives and finalise negotiations over his plan to end the war.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/4/israel-pounds-gaza-killing-61-despite-trumps-call-for-it-to-halt-bombing?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AA-20251003-39302047-39302017-ISRAELI_ATTACK_ON_OMAR_ALMUKHTAR_STREET_OF_GAZA_CITY-1759542585.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 21:39:35","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":366244980,"title":"'Czech Trump' Babis headed for comeback as prime minister","text":"Oct. 4 (UPI) -- Billionaire Andrej Babis is poised to return to power as prime minister in the Czech Republic in a four-year comeback that mirrors U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nKnown as \"Czech Trump,\" Babis earned a decisive victory Saturday in a parliamentary election after being voted out of office. Elections took place on Friday and Saturday.\n\nBabis' populist ANO party, which means yes in Czech, took 36% of the vote, which is the party's best-ever result, according to Czech Statistics Office with about 95% of precincts counted.\n\nPrime Minister Petr Fiala conceded defeat as head of the Spolu (Together) Party with 23% followed by the STAN liberal, centrist party. There was a turnout of 68.9% in a nation of 10 million residents.\n\n\"I'm surprised they received so many votes,\" Babi said in Prague. \"I didn't believe it at first. I hoped we would reach 30%, as our poll suggested 26.\"\n\nNo major Czech party will outright majority in the 200-seat lower house of Parliament. Only parties that win at least 5% of the votes can enter parliament.\n\nCzech President Petr Pavel, who largely is in a ceremonial role, has said will begin forming a coalition on Sunday. Babis wants support from the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy coalition and the populist Motorists party.\n\nThe Freedom and Direct Democracy captured 7.9% and Motorists 6.78%.\n\nThere could be a \"a nightmare scenario for international, European partners\" should Babis invite the right-wing parties to join the government, Daniel Hegedüs, director for Central Europe at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, told The New York Times.\n\n\"There could be a huge reluctance to continue support to Ukraine, and to play the same constructive role in the European Union and NATO\" as the Czech Republic has before, he said.\n\nThe 71-year-old former premier backs policies similar to Trump to spur economic growth.\n\nHe wants to cut taxes, increase pensions, cap energy prices, freeze politicians' salaries and end funding for public television.\n\nBabis capitalized on voter frustration with the current government's response to a cost-of-living crisis. He also would promote the country's place in Europe by focusing on transactional politics over values espoused by the EU.\n\nLast year, he co-founded the Patriots for Europe, a right-wing main opposition party in the EU with Hungary's Fidesz party, France's Rassemblement National and Austria's Freedom Party, both far-right groups.\n\nBabis is riding a wave of populist politicians, including Prime Ministers Viktor Orban of Hungary and Robert Fico of Slovakia.\n\nBut unlike Trump and those leaders, Babis has never aligned himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Babiš is not an extremist but a dealmaker and populist who wants to have a catch-all party and he believes that he can offer something to everybody,\" Petr Kolar, a former Czech ambassador to Russia, told the Financial Times before the vote.\n\n\"I don't think Babiš will be against [more] sanctions\" on Russia, adding \"I believe that Babis is inspired by Orban, he admires him, but he doesn't want to be perceived as a troublemaker in Brussels so much.\"\n\nLike those leaders, Babis has vowed to buck the EU on defense spending and immigration.\n\nBabis became wealthy with an agribusiness with the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in late 1989.\n\nCzechoslovakia dissolved on Jan. 1, 1993, into Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nBabis wants to resurrect the so-called Visegrad Four -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia -- as a regional force uniting 65 million citizens for a better say in the 27-member EU. Czech Republic joined the bloc in 2004.\n\nCzechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland at one time were communist nations, like the Soviet Union, which included Russia.\n\n\"We will never drag the Czech Republic to the east, never leave the EU or NATO,\" Babis said in his last televised pre-election appeal to voters.\n\nPavel, a former NATO general, faced off against Babis in a 2023 presidential election won by Pavel.","summary":"Billionaire Andrej Babis is poised to return to power as prime minister in the Czech Republic in a four-year comeback that mirrors U.S. President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/10/04/Czech-Republic-Andrej-Babis-poised-become-prime-minister-Czech-Trmp/1991759603855/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/1991759603855/2025/1/682da4ac26aac99fa2a25b6faa584f8c/v1.5/Czech-Trump-Babis-headed-for-comeback-as-prime-minister.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 21:35:02","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.058},{"id":366243262,"title":"Tony Blair set for political comeback in Trump’s Gaza peace plan — but ghosts of Iraq still linger","text":"In political terms, he was once the king of rock ‘n’ roll, owning the stage all the way until the music died horribly.

Our Stronger Borders plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis.\n\n“That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”\n\nShe also accused the Government of offering “failed gimmicks”, including its one in, one out deal with France – dubbed “one thousand in, one out” by Mrs Badenoch – which has so far seen just 18 people returned after crossing the Channel.\n\nAs she arrived at the Tory conference, Mrs Badenoch said she could turn her party’s fortunes around.\n\nHer party has seen support collapse in opinion polls in recent months, consistently trailing third behind Nigel Farage’s Reform UK and Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour.\n\nAsked if she could turn things around, she said: “Absolutely, and this week we’re going to be showing what our plan is.\n\n“We’re the only party with a credible plan to deliver both a stronger economy and stronger borders.”\n\nA Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Conservatives’ message on immigration is: we got everything wrong, we won’t apologise, now trust us.\n\n“It won’t wash – Kemi Badenoch’s party enabled record high net migration as removals plummeted, opened over 400 asylum hotels and wasted £700 million of taxpayers’ money to send just four volunteers to Rwanda.\n\n“This Labour Government is fixing the Tories’ mess by smashing the people-smuggling gangs running the vile small boats trade, closing asylum hotels, deporting foreign criminals and signing international returns deals to bring order to Britain’s borders.”","summary":"A Removals Force will be given £1.6 billion and ‘sweeping new powers’ including facial recognition without warning to spot illegal immigrants.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/kemi-badenoch-president-donald-trump-reform-uk-labour-government-b1251278.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/10/04/22/7939b5b7e4c1471731106187119cbca1Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5Njk4NTY1-2.81876547.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-04 21:29:51","author":"Christopher McKeon","authors":["Christopher McKeon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.283},{"id":366246504,"title":"Newly discovered photos could shed light on fate of Amelia Earhart's plane","text":"Newly discovered dating back to 1938 could reveal what happened to Amelia Earhart 's plane - with a mysterious object on a remote island pointing to a possible sighting of the aircraft . Researchers claim the anomaly provides \"very strong\" evidence that it may be Earhart's missing plane. The pilot vanished over the central Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe along with her navigator, Fred Noonan. The pair were on their way to Howland Island when their radio communications failed, and were never seen again. Now, researchers are investigating a metal object located underwater in a lagoon on the island of Nikumaroro. It was spotted in newly discovered images taken a year after the pioneer aviator disappeared 88 years ago. Scientists believe the \"Taraia Object\" is Earhart's famous Lockheed 10-E Electra, according to Purdue University in Indiana. A crew of 15 researchers from Purdue and the Archeological Legacy Institute (ALI) will head to the island between Hawaii and Fiji on November 4 to inspect what they think is the main body and tail of the missing plane. \"Finding Amelia Earhart’s aircraft would be the discovery of a lifetime,\" says ALI executive director Dr Richard Pettigrew - who has long believed Nikumaroro is where Earhart's plane has been since. \"Other evidence already collected by The International Group of Historic Aircraft Recovery establishes an extremely persuasive, multifaceted case that the final destination for Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, was on Nikumaroro. Confirming the plane wreckage there would be the smoking-gun proof.\" The three-week mission will zero in on the \"Taria Object\" - a strange object first seen in 2015 satellite images on the north shore of the Nikumaroro lagoon. \"A successful identification would be the first step toward fulfilling Amelia's original plan to return the Electra to West Lafayette after her historic flight,\" Steve Schultz, senior vice president and general counsel at Purdue University, said. \"Additional work would still be needed to accomplish that objective, but we feel we own it to her legacy which remains so strong at Purdue, to try to find a way to bring it home.\" A major 16-day long search was launched by the US Navy and Coast Guard following Earheart and Noonan's disappearance. But with no success, Earhart was officially declared dead on January 5, 1939. Several more attempts were made to find her, with millions of dollars spent over nine decades, but neither Earhart’s remains nor the wreckage have ever been located.
