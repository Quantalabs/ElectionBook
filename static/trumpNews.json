{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":9779,"news":[{"id":367850558,"title":"South African farm worker says boss told him to feed women’s bodies to pigs after intruders shot","text":"Farm owner Zachariah Johannes Olivier, 60, and William Musora, 50, are on trial for allegedly murdering Maria Makgato, 45, and Lucia Ndlovu, 34, near Polokwane in South Africa’s northern Limpopo province last year.\n\nA third victim, a man, reportedly escaped.\n\nAdrian De Wet, 21, the farm supervisor, was also previously accused of murder but the charges were dropped by the prosecution in August after he turned state’s witness, claiming he was under duress when he was forced to throw the bodies into the pig enclosure.\n\nAppearing in the Polokwane High Court on Thursday, Mr De Wet explained that “when pigs are hungry enough, they’ll eat anything”, the BBC reported.\n\nMr De Wet told the court he and Mr Olivier had armed themselves with hunting rifles on the night of August 17, 2024 and waited for trespassers to enter the farm.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes they heard voices of people walking towards their direction, and opened fire. They heard a person screaming and found a person lying face down when they inspected the area.\n\nIt wasn’t until they returned the next morning that they found it was the body of a woman.\n\nMr De Wet said he was asked by Mr Olivier to help him throw the body inside the enclosure where eight to 10 large adult pigs were kept.\n\nThe following day another body, also of a woman, was found about 25 metres from where the first was found.\n\nThe two men, along with Mr Musora, are alleged to have then thrown the second body inside the pigsty.\n\nThey later returned and found large chunks of flesh had been bitten off the women.\n\nPhotos presented as evidence in court showed the women missing buttocks, face, thighs and shoulders.\n\nAsked by the state prosecutor the purpose of placing the bodies inside the pigsty, Mr De Wet replied, “We were disposing the evidence because when pigs are hungry enough, they’ll eat anything.”\n\nMr Olivier also chopped up the hunting rifles with an angle grinder and burnt the wooden parts of the gun before disposing of the evidence, according to Mr De Wet.\n\nThe farm owner was reportedly seen wiping away tears during the evidence, while the son of the one of the victims repeatedly cried in court.\n\nCross-examination by the defence will resume on Wednesday.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage in South Africa, where racial tensions between black and white people are high — particularly in rural areas where most farmland is owned by whites and most farm workers are black and poorly paid.\n\nBrutal attacks on white farmers have also been widespread, drawing attention globally, including from US President Donald Trump who ambushed his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa during an Oval Office meeting in May claiming a “genocide” was being committed against white people.","summary":"A farm worker has told a court how he was forced by his boss to feed the bodies of two women to pigs after the pair were shot while allegedly

flights","text":"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Thursday (Oct 9) proposed banning Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on flights to and from the United States, saying the practice puts American carriers at a disadvantage.\n\nUS airlines have long criticised the decision to allow Chinese carriers to use Russian airspace on some flights because it gives them the advantage of decreased flying time and burns less fuel, lowering costs.\n\nThe US Transportation Department said on Thursday in its proposed order, \"this imbalance has become a significant competitive factor\".\n\nThe Transportation Department said it was proposing to bar Chinese overflights \"to level this competitive disparity amongst US and Chinese air carriers\", saying the current situation was \"unfair and has resulted in substantial adverse competitive effects on US air carriers\".\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington and Airlines for America, a major trade group representing carriers American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines that all fly to China, did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nRussia has barred US airlines and many other foreign carriers from flying over its airspace in retaliation for Washington's banning Russian flights over the US in March 2022 after the country invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe decision could impact some US flights operated by Air China, China Eastern, Xiamen Airlines and China Southern.\n\nThe push comes amid growing tension between China and the United States over a series of economic issues.\n\nBoeing is in talks to sell as many as 500 jets to China, which would represent a major breakthrough for the company in the world's second-largest aviation market, where orders have stalled amid US-China trade tensions.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold a face-to-face meeting in South Korea at the end of October.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/donald-trump-propose-barring-chinese-airlines-flying-over-russia-us-flight-5393426","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--5N9WxZDv--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-07-08t151013z_1_lynxmpel670ml_rtroptp_3_boeing-orders.jpg?itok=8NtV","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:47 BST, 10 October 2025 |Updated:01:49 BST, 10 October 2025 \n\nVictoria Beckham has been opening up like never before this week, and now she's made some very candid confessions. \nThe former Spice Girl, 51, has led a life of glitz and glamour thanks to her pop success, fashion empire and lucrative marriage to footballer David. \nBut in a nod to her normality, Victoria has lifted the lid on shopping at Lidl, flying with Ryanair, picking up dog poo - and admitted she hasn't hoovered since 1997 thanks to 'Mr Clean' David. \nSpeaking to The Sun in her flagship Dover Street store in London, Victoria was asked if she'd ever done her shopping at Lidl, to which she responded: 'No, but my mum shops there.'\nAnd asked about if she picks up her give dogs' poo, she insisted: 'Of course I do! I hate it when people leave it lying around in the park, awful!'\nDespite the celebrity love of a private jet, Victoria also admitted she has flown budget airlines including EasyJet and Ryanair. \n\nVictoria Beckham has been opening up like never before this week, and now she's made some very candid confessions\n\nIn a nod to her normality, Victoria has lifted the lid on shopping at Lidl, flying with Ryanair, picking up dog poo - and admitted she hasn't hoovered since 1997 thanks to 'Mr Clean' David\n'I haven't hoovered in many, many years… David, Mr Clean, does all the hoovering,' she added. \nIt comes after Victoria opened up about the downward spiral for her fashion business that saw her rack up losses of over £66 million. \nThe designer launched her fashion label in 2008 with a small collection of dresses. \nIt swiftly grew to an extensive range that now includes handbags, coats, shoes and accessories but after frivolous spending she quickly began to make a loss and was forced to rely on handouts from her husband David Beckham to bail her out. \nIn 2023 she finally started making a profit for the time in 15 years - with an £890 clutch bag, a £30 eyeliner and a carefully orchestrated social media strategy which saw her post make-up tutorial videos on TikTok credited with the turnaround. \nYet in her new Netflix series, businessman David Belhassen - who invested in her failing brand - explained that he also helped by reining in her excessive spending habits. \nIn one shock admission he revealed the designer was spending £85,000 just on plants for the office. \n'She loved plants,' David mused. 'And it was costing her £70,000 a year. And then there was someone who was coming to water the plants for 15,000 a year - and that's only the beginning! \n\nIn 2023 she finally started making a profit for the time in 15 years - with an £890 clutch bag, a £30 eyeliner and a carefully orchestrated social media strategy credited with the turnaround\n'So I went her and I decided to just tell the truth, exactly the way it is, and I didn't know how she'd react. \n'I said, \"Victoria we have to change everything, restructure the business, and that's gonna be painful\", and when I finished she just listened and she left a little silence.' \nVictoria explained: ' I took it on the chin, it was hard hearing those things. I hadn't been to business school, I'd come from an entertainment background. \n'I didn't realise it at the time but the waste was mind-blowing.\n'I mean, I had 15 different linings for the insides of her outerwear, bizarre things like flowing chairs from one side of the world to the other.\n'I hear it now and I'm horrified but I allowed that to happen. I think part of the problem was people were really afraid to tell me no.\n'There's a power to be honest, the power of celebrity. People thought I wasn't used to hearing no.' \n\nHer husband David, who invested millions into his wife's ailing brand, reflected on the fear he felt when he could see the numbers spiralling. \n'It made me panic, David confessed. 'I was panicked by it because I never saw anything coming back. \n'We always agreed that we would support each other no matter what but it worried me. It wasn't sustainable.' \nVictoria added: 'There was a lot of waste, we were millions of pounds in the red. \n'I didn't know what to do and I was so desperate to save this business that I cared so much about. \n'I felt like I was breaking down myself. I felt embarrassed... I was in a hole, it felt like I was in quicksand.' \nRyanairLondonLidlDavid BeckhamTikTok\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVictoria Beckham gets candid as she talks shopping at Lidl, flying with Ryanair and picking up dog poo - and admits she hasn't hoovered since 1997 thanks to 'Mr Clean' hubbie David\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

to a breakthrough, and the last 48 hostages – about 20 of them believed to be alive — are set to be returned under the agreement announced on Wednesday.\n\nHamas saw hostages more as a liability than an asset over time, providing an opening for the deal, according to two senior US officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.\n\nOne of the officials added that negotiators, led by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, had detected that “Hamas had enough”.","summary":"After months of gridlock, the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza came together in days

President Donald Trump announced he had brokered a peace deal between Israel and designated terror group Hamas.\n\nThe group was met with a rapturous welcome from hundreds of pro-Palestinian supporters, some holding welcome home signs, others parading flags with the slogan “From the river to the sea”.\n\nFlotilla member Abu Bakr Rafiq fronted a media pack accusing IDF soldiers of abusing and torturing the aid missions’ members.\n\n“If Israel is willing to treat Australian citizens like this, imagine how they are willing to treat the Palestinians,” he said.\n\nThe activists were detained by Israeli authorities after their boats were intercepted off the coast of Gaza, with detainees slamming the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s response to their detention and lodging allegations of mistreatment by Israeli officials.\n\nMs Lamont said the Australian government had “not really supported us at all” while claiming other countries had facilitated their release into

Earle-Sears, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee have all released ads attacking Democrats over the Jones scandal. \n\nDemocrats have condemned the messages but stopped short of calling for Jones to exit the race. Earle-Sears lambasted Spanberger over her silence on whether Jones should end his campaign.\n\nIn her response to the first question of the debate about the commonwealth’s car tax, Earle-Sears quickly sought to make the debate about Jones and continued to attack in the one-hour discussion.\n\n“I’m wondering why my opponent won’t say beyond its abhorrent and disgusting … that he must leave the race because Jay Jones advocated the murder, Abigail, the murder of a man, a former speaker, as well as his children, who were two years two- and five-years old,” Earle-Sears said during the Thursday night debate.\n\n“I was born in Jamaica, and when I was 10 years old, I saw that kind of political violence, which is why I’m asking my opponent to please ask him to get out of the race. Have some political courage,” she added. \n\nAs the lieutenant governor grilled Spanberger, she remained silent, refusing to answer her questions about Jones’s role on the Democratic ticket. \n\n“You have little girls. What would it take – him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it? And then you would say, he needs to get out of the race. Abigail, you have nothing to say? Abigail?” Earle-Sears taunted her.\n\nSpanberger stood facing forward and didn’t engage each time Earle-Sears turned to her to ask questions.\n\nSpanberger told the audience at Norfolk State University that she abhors Jones’s messages, but she repeatedly dodged questions about whether he should remain on the ticket. \n\n“The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent. I denounce them when I learned of them, and I will denounce them every opportunity I get,” Spanberger said at first. “As a mother, as a public servant, as a candidate for governor, I denounce them.” \n\nShe then attacked Earle-Sears for having selective outrage on political violence at the expense of Democrats. \n\n“My opponent, unfortunately, only denounces violence when her side is the target,” said Spanberger. \n\n“Don’t lie like that, Abigail,” Earle-Sears interjected.\n\n“I hope that in the future, she will endeavor to denounce violent rhetoric and violence, no matter who the victim,” Spanberger continued. “You routinely refer to me as your enemy. I’m not your enemy. You are not my enemy. We are political opponents.”\n\nThe Democratic gubernatorial candidate was again asked about the future of Jones’s campaign, where she dodged the question. \n\n“We are all running our individual races. I believe my opponent has said that about her lieutenant governor nominee,” Spanberger said as Earle-Sears interrupted her. “And it is up to every person to make their own decision. I am running my race to serve Virginia, and that is what I intend to do.” \n\n“I’m saying as of now, it’s up to every voter to make their own individual decision. I am running for governor. I am accountable for the words that I say, for the acts that I take, for the policies that I have put out,” she added when asked again.\n\nSPANBERGER TRIES TO REDIRECT ATTENTION AS REPUBLICANS POUNCE ON MOMENTUM AFTER JONES’S TEXTS\n\nThroughout the debate, Earle-Sears was on offense, interrupting Spanberger’s responses and pivoting her answers repeatedly to questions for her opponent. Moderators dinged her multiple times for talking over her Spanberger.\n\nEarle-Sears said Spanberger’s refusal to pull her endorsement of Jones is a sign of poor leadership. \n\n“You have to make hard choices, and that means telling Jay Jones to leave the race,” Earle-Sears said.\n\n“Abigail needs to say something,” she repeated.\n\nEarly voting has already begun in Virginia and ends Nov. 1 before Election Day on Nov. 4.

From Trump to Musk, Here Are the Biggest Names in Contention","text":"As Oslo prepares to reveal the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, few contenders have generated as much controversy or spectacle as Donald Trump. The US President has spent months openly lobbying for the award, the case for which has just become stronger as Israel and Hamas finally agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal that was floated by his government. Since returning to the White House, Trump has made little effort to hide his desire for the award. With just hours to go before the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize announcement, his campaign to influence the Norwegian Nobel Committee appears to have entered its final sprint. The announcement comes a day after the peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration brought a ceasefire to the war in Gaza. As news of the truce spread, allies of the US President flooded television networks and social media, calling for Trump to be recognised for his role in the ceasefire. \"Everybody has been talking about: 'Will he get the Nobel Peace Prize?'\" said Brian Mast, a Republican Congressman from Florida, speaking on Fox News. \"Those academics and elites sitting in Norway… they need to give President Trump the Nobel Peace Prize.\" Also Read: Donald Trump Plays The Israel-Hamas 'Peace' Card Just in Time — Nobel Jury Watching? Eylon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson, echoed that sentiment, saying: \"There's very little that Israelis agree on, but there's one point of consensus this morning — President Donald Trump deserves that Nobel Peace Prize.\" Trump quickly acknowledged both men in a post on his Truth Social platform, thanking them by name. Although Trump has played down his chances publicly, he has reportedly lobbied privately for the award. Norwegian media said Trump personally phoned Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's finance minister, earlier this year to discuss \"the Nobel Peace Prize… and tariffs.\" The President also frequently mentions the award at rallies and Cabinet meetings, often comparing himself to former President Barack Obama, who received the prize in 2009. \"If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds,\" Trump had said during last year's campaign. Trump's allies have framed his recent diplomatic successes, including the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and a proposed Saudi-Iran economic cooperation plan, as evidence that he has \"ended more wars than he started.\" Other contenders for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize While Trump's name dominates speculation, the Nobel Committee is expected to weigh hundreds of nominations from across the world. Here are some of the leading contenders this year: Pope Francis (Posthumous Consideration) The late Pope Francis, who died in April, was nominated by Dag Inge Ulstein, a Norwegian lawmaker, for his \"unstoppable contribution to promoting peace and fraternity among nations.\" However, the Nobel Peace Prize has never been awarded posthumously, a rule that famously excluded Mahatma Gandhi despite several nominations. Elon Musk Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk was nominated by Slovenian MEP Branko Grims, who praised his defence of \"the fundamental human right of freedom of speech.\" Grims said Musk's commitment to \"open dialogue\" qualified him as a candidate \"for peace through communication.\" Anwar Ibrahim Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has also been nominated for his \"commitment to dialogue, regional harmony and peace through non-coercive diplomacy.\" His role in facilitating a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia was cited by nominators as a key reason for his inclusion. Imran Khan Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan, currently imprisoned, has been nominated by the Pakistan World Alliance and Norway's Partiet Sentrum party for his \"work with human rights and democracy.\" Khan was previously nominated in 2019. Volodymyr Zelenskyy Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy remains a high-profile name among bookmakers. Seen as a symbol of resilience since Russia's invasion in 2022, his leadership continues to inspire supporters even as the war drags on. Yulia Navalnaya Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is also viewed as a strong contender. Navalny died in prison earlier this year after years of persecution by Russian authorities. His widow has since emerged as a powerful advocate for democracy and human rights. Sudan's Emergency Response Rooms With Sudan's conflict continuing to devastate the country, the grassroots Emergency Response Rooms — networks providing food, education and medical aid — have been praised for their bravery amid one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières) The international medical organisation has continued operations in Gaza despite repeated attacks. It says 15 staff members have been killed during the conflict, underscoring the dangers faced by humanitarian workers. Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) The CPJ has documented record journalist deaths during the Israel-Gaza conflict and accused Israel of \"engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to silence journalists\" it has ever recorded. UNHCR The United Nations refugee agency — already a two-time winner — has been nominated again amid growing global displacement. Chief Filippo Grandi has called out countries for \"abandoning the laws of war\" in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan. UNRWA The UN agency for Palestinian refugees could also be recognised for its humanitarian work despite controversy over allegations involving some staff. UNRWA continues to operate schools and clinics across Gaza and neighbouring countries. International Court of Justice (ICJ) The ICJ, currently hearing South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide, could be honoured for upholding international law during one of the most contentious conflicts in decades. International Criminal Court (ICC) The ICC, which issued arrest warrants last year for Israeli leaders over alleged war crimes, has also been mentioned — though its own internal scandals could weaken its chances. As the Nobel Committee prepares to unveil its decision, attention remains fixed on Oslo, and on whether Donald Trump's high-profile campaign will finally deliver him the award he has long sought.","summary":"Trump's allies have framed his recent diplomatic successes, including the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, as evidence that he has \"ended more wars than he started.\"","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/nobel-peace-prize-2025-contenders-elon-musk-donald-trump-imran-khan-article-152973629","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-152973651,thumbsize-53056,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/152973651.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:28:33","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.071},{"id":367847084,"title":"Mamdani won’t  praise Trump for Gaza peace — no doubt wishing Israel surrendered instead","text":"Now that Israel and Hamas have a deal for the return of the hostages and an end to the Gaza war, the whole world is praising Donald Trump for his efforts.\n\nThe whole world except Zohran Mamdani, that is, and most of his “pro-Palestine” radical allies.\n\nAsked if Trump deserves credit for the deal, a Mamdani aide referred our reporters to his remarks to 1010 WINS: “I’m hopeful at the news of a possible ceasefire,” he said, and “that it is lasting.”\n\nHe also lamented the tragedy “with Hamas’ horrific war crime on Oct. 7 and the Israeli government’s horrific war crimes since then leading to the genocide of Palestinians.”\n\nThat is, he fell back on his usual Israel-bashing — despicably equating Hamas’ terrorism with Israel’s totally legitimate response, and flat-out lying that the Jewish state was committing a “genocide.” \n\nAnd, of course, not a single word about Trump.\n\nThe antisemitic mayoral wannabe just won’t be happy until the Jewish state is wiped off the face of the earth.

The AP reported on Thursday, citing government officials, that the U.S. is sending roughly 200 troops to Israel to help support the ceasefire deal. \n\nThe conflict has been a matter of ongoing tension at Microsoft. \n\nFor months, employees have protested the company's cloud business from the Israeli military. Five employees were fired.\n\nIn September, Microsoft said it had stopped providing certain services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, though it didn't provide specifics.

President Donald Trump threatened on October 6, 2025, to use emergency powers against rebellion to deploy more troops into Democratic-led US cities, intensifying his rhetoric as his attempts to mobilize the military face legal challenges. Trump openly mulled use of the Insurrection Act after a federal judge in Oregon temporarily halted a National Guard deployment in Portland, while another judge in Illinois allowed a similar move to proceed for now in Chicago. \n\nWhat To Know\n\nA report by The Hill on Wednesday cited three Senate Republicans who have spoken on the issue of Trump’s troop deployments, but other Republicans – including current and former elected officials and lawmakers – have started urging caution and restraint from the administration.\n\nSenator Thom Tillis, who is leaving Congress at the end of his current term, told the outlet, “I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina.”\n\nSenator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska also raised concerns “about the use of our military for policing and more the politicization that we’re seeing within the military.”\n\nSenator Susan Collins, who is seeking reelection in Democrat-leaning Maine, had a more guarded approach, saying, “I do think the National Guard has an important role to play in natural disasters, in protecting federal personnel and federal sites. In those cases, you can justify nationalizing the guard. Generally, this should be a police and law-enforcement action. It’s a complicated issue.”\n\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association, said Thursday he opposes sending National Guard troops across state borders without the state’s permission – a position that offers rare rebuke of the president from a sitting Republican official.\n\n“Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration,” Stitt told The New York Times, adding that Trump should have federalized Illinois troops like he did in Los Angeles over the summer.\n\nOther sitting governors have not spoken so openly about the issue, but three former Republican governors voiced concerns to NBC News.\n\nFormer New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman, who led the state from 1994 to 2001 and served in George W. Bush’s Administration, called Trump’s actions “infuriating.”\n\n“It is stoking resentment and fanning the flames. But as a governor there is nothing you can do to really stop the president from federalizing the guard,” Whitman advised.\n\nFormer Ohio governor and Republican presidential hopeful John Kasich, a prominent anti-Trump figure in the Republican Party, wanted to see Trump and state governors address their issues together rather than see the president “shove stuff” down the governors’ “throats.”\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson called Trump’s actions “a real constitutional dilemma that is unprecedented,” arguing that the issue will end up in the Supreme Court, where “it will have to be resolved.”\n\n“It’s difficult for the courts to step in and say, ‘We’re going to override the executive branch,’” Hutchinson said, even as he noted the president has “a lot of latitude,” especially “as interpreted by the courts.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Newsweek in an email statement: “Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker and Newscum have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities.”\n\nOregon Governor Tina Kotek, in a state...","summary":"Several Republicans - including current and former governors - have spoken out with concern about the president&#039;s deployments.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/list-republicans-sounding-alarm-trumps-national-guard-moves-10857333","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239295934.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:18:15","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":367848788,"title":"'I am fearless': New York Attorney General indicted months after defeating Trump in court— Who is Letitia James?","text":"New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a \"fearless\" person.

James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney. Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap. Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings. Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society.

Infantino used his opening remarks at this week’s European Football Clubs General Assembly in Rome to highlight the importance of the war ending and talked up the role of Trump, with whom he has developed a strong bond ahead of the USA being set to co-host next year’s World Cup. “President Donald J. Trump definitely deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his decisive actions,” Infantino said on Instagram. This is somewhat premature, but it is true that the current US president uses highly unorthodox methods in international disputes, sometimes getting results. The war, which is wholly the responsibility of the Islamic extremists of Hamas, has been a huge tragedy. It is hard to believe that it is over but any steps towards such an ending is very much welcome. Hamas should form no part of any government anywhere in the world, yet it is hard to see how they will be stopped from ultimately regaining control of Gaza. After all, they ruthlessly murder their own Palestinian rivals for power. Nearly 1,200 people were killed on October 7, and around 250 people were taken as hostages into Gaza. Some of now been released, others have been killed. Only 20 of those still in captivity are alive. While Sir Keir Starmer is right to call the peace deal a “moment of profound relief that will be felt around the world”, the big question is whether any deal with the barbarians of Hamas can hold.","summary":"News Letter editorial on Friday October 10 2025:","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/editorial-a-tentative-move-towards-a-deal-to-end-the-appalling-war-in-gaza-5353781","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmE4YjBhZDk2LThlNTktNGVkNy04NTU1LTNkOTY4ZjQyNmQ4Njo0NjlkZmQ3NS03ODcwLTRkMzktYWFlMC0xZDczNGMyZDllYWE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:16:10","author":"Editorial","authors":["Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.119},{"id":367846364,"title":"Judge partially blocks Trump’s Chicago troop deployment, ruling it unconstitutional","text":"The Trump administration is “temporarily enjoined from ordering the federalization and deployment of the National Guard of the United States within Illinois,” Perry wrote in Thursday’s order.\n\nIllinois and Chicago filed the lawsuit on Monday, requesting the temporary restraining order after the White House confirmed President Donald Trump had ordered 300 National Guard troops to “protect federal officers and assets” in Chicago.\n\n“I find that allowing the National Guard to deploy at the Broadview processing center or anywhere else in Illinois will only add fuel to the fire,” Perry said in court, according to the New York Times.

The gratitude of the families of the Israeli hostages who will soon be returned home was unconfined.\n\nThey were speaking directly to Donald Trump on a mobile phone held aloft by his personal emissary Steve Witkoff, who helped broker the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nThis was international diplomacy as reality television show, complete with rivers of tears and Trump as ringmaster. But to those relatives it was real life, the end of a two-year nightmare.\n\nThe money shot is still to come when the hostages, dead or alive, are reunited with their loved ones some time this weekend. There will be more tears, of joy and mourning.\n\nSufferers from Trump Derangement Syndrome will accuse the President of milking the moment to feed his ocean-going vanity. But, frankly, so what?\n\nYes, he’s a preening egomaniac who has to be the centre of attention at all time. But criticising the host of The Apprentice for behaving like, well, the host of The Apprentice is like complaining about what bears do in the woods.\n\nTry telling that to the Israelis dancing in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, like a sunlit Trafalgar Square in London on VE Day at the end of the Second World War. The sense of blessed relief was palpable.\n\nAnd, let’s be honest, this deal wouldn’t have happened without the force of nature which is Donald J. Trump. He made the weather which made this historic deal possible.\n\nAs the old song has it, everywhere he goes he always takes the weather with him. Like it or not, we all live in TrumpWorld now.\n\nThe self-appointed Middle East ‘experts’ – the academics, the professional diplomats, the ‘respected’ foreign correspondents – all said it couldn’t be done. Hamas would never surrender, Netanyahu would never agree to a ceasefire until every last Hamas terrorist was eliminated in a pool of blood.\n\nTrump, with the innate braggadocio of the native New Yorker, begged to differ. Critics might grumble that he was only motivated by his desire for a Nobel Peace Prize to plonk on his mantelpiece at Trump Tower.\n\nHe collects awards like some men collect baseball cards, prizes his membership of the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) Hall of Fame, and Gold Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, along with his Honorary McDonald’s French Fry Certification Pin.\n\nA Nobel Peace Prize would be the icing on the cupcake, something he has been campaigning for shamelessly since his first term in the White House when he successfully negotiated the Abraham Accords which brought Israel and neighbouring Arab nations together.\n\nThe genocidal, bloodthirsty maniacs of Hamas blew that accommodation apart under Joe Biden and then incited full-scale war with the October 7 pogrom, the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nTrump took that as a personal affront. Like the Russian war on Ukraine (which he has yet to yet to solve) he claimed, with some justification, that the Hamas slaughter at the Nova music festival would never have happened had he been President at the time.\n\nWhile maintaining resolute support for Israel, he was determined to bring peace to the region by whatever means necessary. The US continued to supply weapons to the IDF and refused to condemn Israel’s military war of self-defence.\n\nThe audacious US attack on the nuclear installations in Iran, Hamas’s paymasters, will come to be seen as a crucial turning point. So will Israel’s bombing of Hamas targets in ‘neutral’ Qatar.\n\nIt was a clear message to the duplicitous Qataris that if they insisted on giving sanctuary to anti-Semitic, genocidal Islamist terrorists, they would have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Trump wasn’t afraid to use carrot and stick with Israel, either. As his patience ran out, he accused both sides of fighting for so long they no longer knew what they were (expletive deleted) doing.\n\nWhen Netanyahu bridled at some of the conditions in Trump’s 20-point peace plan, the President told him to stop being so (expletive deleted) negative. ‘Bibi, you can’t fight the whole world.’\n\nAmerica is Israel’s strongest ally, especially after the EU and our own lily-livered appeaser of a PM Surkeir decided to reward Hamas violence by recognising a non-existent Palestinian state without insisting on the release of a single hostage. But Trump reminded Netanyahu in no uncertain terms who was boss.\n\nThis shouldn’t have come as a surprise to any sentient Trump-watcher with half a brain. He is routinely portrayed as a clown, a semi-imbecile with a thin skin, full of childish impetuousity.\n\nThin skin, maybe. He doesn’t take criticism well. And, yes, he can be impetuous. But it’s his unpredictability which makes him hard to read, but also concentrates the mind of his opponents.\n\nI keep coming back to the American comedian who compared him to a horse loose in a hospital. You don’t know what he’s going to do next - and neither does he.\n\nExcept Trump always keeps his eyes on the prize. In this case, the Nobel Peace Prize. Previously, the presidency of the United States. As Eric Morecambe didn’t say: This boy’s no fool. And he genuinely cares about humanity, which is why he spoke directly to the families of the hostages. Friends who have seen him behind the scenes at Mar-a-Lago say he always has time and kindness for his staff.\n\nThere’s method in his apparent madness, calculation even. He doesn’t trust conventional wisdom, the smug domestic or foreign policy establishment.\n\nThat’s why he sent his old friend Witkoff as his personal envoy to the Middle East and not a career diplomat. How the grand panjandrums in the navel-gazing Washington Beltway (and our own Westminster Bubble) mocked. What does a New York real estate investor like Witkoff, or Trump for that matter, know about diplomacy?\n\nQuite a lot, as it happened. Witkoff knocked heads together, got sworn enemies round a table with Trump’s backing. Both sides were left in no doubt they were on their own unless they reached a deal. Neither side was going to be entirely happy, but compromises are inevitable to stop the killing.\n\nI can remember asking Tony Blair over lunch how he felt shaking the hands of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness when sealing the Northern Ireland peace deal. He hesitated, looked uncomfortable, but confessed that sometimes you just have to bite your tongue and bear it in the interests of a greater goal.\n\nThat’s something Netanyahu has had to swallow, too, at Trump’s insistence. Yes, it could all still go pear-shaped. You can’t always negotiate with fanatical terrorists or trust what they agree to.\n\nPLO leader Yasser Arafat got a Nobel Peace Prize, then reneged immediately and launched another intifada.\n\nTrump will be aware of the perils inherent in this deal, but he will persist for now. He’s a seasoned negotiator. You don’t build a property empire in New York without dealing with a lot of men whose names end in vowels and have links to organised crime. So he won't be intimidated.\n\nBut he’s pulled it off against the odds, at least in the short term. He’s made the weather.\n\nWe must all hope it’s a lasting peace and brings not just a ceasefire in Gaza but an end to the disgusting war on our Jewish friends and neighbours back home.\n\nHere’s an illustration. On Tuesday we were walking to lunch on our North London shopping parade when a young Jewish guy in a Arsenal shirt coming in the opposite direction stopped us and said: thank you for your support.\n\nIt wasn’t anything I’d written here. He didn’t know me from Adam. He’d spotted my wife’s yellow ribbon badge on her lapel. You don’t know how much that means, he said, we must get those hostages back.\n\nThat wish is about to come true. Even the BBC acknowledges it wouldn’t have happened without the intervention of the much derided 47th President of the United States.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, he could have his Nobel Peace Prize minted and worn around his neck on a gold chain, like Mister T in the A-Team.\n\nThis may only be the beginning of the end, but if the peace holds we should all, from Tel Aviv to Tottenham, join the families of the Israeli hostages in saying: Thank you, Mr President.","summary":"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr President.

On behalf of the hostages and their families, along with the civilian population of Gaza, dare we dream that the agony of the Israel-Hamas war might soon be over?\n\nThe remaining hostages, dead or alive, could be released by Monday, which would be a giant step forward for humanity and for peace.\n\nBut even if the conflict stops and the ceasefire holds, can the hurt ever heal? For this war has peeled open a seam of hatred and anti-Semitic feeling much closer to home, with the result that many Jewish people in the UK no longer feel safe. How did we get to this regrettable state of affairs?\n\nYou only have to look at the actions of Nadia Dina Yahlom, the haughty young woman who was filmed using scissors to remove yellow ribbons put up in commemoration of Israeli hostages from a memorial in north London this week. She justified her repulsive actions by saying they – who or what? The ribbons, the Jews, the railings? – deserved it because they ‘condone genocide’.\n\nThere she was on a beautiful autumn day – this educated daughter of privilege living in a Western democracy, this woman who had brought along a nice shopping bag in which to store the desecrated ribbons, this self-righteous paragon who had chosen to marinate herself in lies, half-truths, prejudice, BBC news reports and the enabling blathers of superwoke Hollywood stars – smugly feeling that she was justified in dehumanising innocent hostages who have been starved, tortured and killed in terror tunnels deep under Gaza.\n\nEven worse, this took place in the days after a terrorist attack at a Manchester synagogue in which two Jewish people were murdered and several others injured. Even that atrocity did not give Yahlom pause for thought.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many more like her; pro-Palestine supporters who would tear down a ribbon, a hostage poster or blow out a Jewish candle of condolence for a loved one without hesitation. All of which makes me fear for the post-war future.\n\nFor no matter what your beliefs, how upset you might be or whose side you are on, what kind of unfeeling ogre vandalises other people’s markers of grief?\n\nThe ghastly Yahlom, who describes herself as a Palestinian-Jewish-British artist and visual anthropologist, typifies the kind of pro-Palestine activists who marched through London and elsewhere this week, deliberately choosing the second anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel to make their point.\n\nIf you were cutting ribbons on Monday or marching on Tuesday, then please take it from me that you are not an activist, you are an apologist for evil.\n\nKeir Starmer pleaded with the demonstrators – mostly students – not to protest, meeping that their behaviour was ‘un-British’. But look around you, dear Keir! From where I am standing it looks very, horribly, terribly British indeed.\n\nA British-Palestinian surgeon who ‘denied the Holocaust’ has been re-referred to a medical tribunal for making a throat-slitting gesture to Jewish people and claiming that a hospital in north London is ‘a Jewish supremacy cesspit’.\n\nFollowing other cases of anti-Semitic behaviour from medics, including one openly describing Jewish people as ‘circumcised vermin’, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said that doctors will be immediately banned from treating patients under new plans to ‘make it easier’ to kick racists out of the NHS. Meanwhile, complaints from Jewish students at British universities to stamp out the creep of anti-Semitism they have to endure on an almost daily basis have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nYou have to wonder what happened to the UK that makes it OK, week after week, for demonstrators to march through the streets shouting hatred against Zionists and chanting their deeply moronic wish to ‘globalise the intifada’. Answers on a postcard, please.\n\nFor if this were any other ethnic or religious community being victimised in this way, there would be hell to pay. Yet there seems to be the feeling that the Jewish people somehow deserve it, so let’s just carry on anyway. In Hollywood, Javier Bardem wears a keffiyeh and says that he will ‘never work with some companies who are not condemning the genocide in Gaza’. Oh! Everyone in Tel Aviv must be shaking in their sandals.\n\nGreta Thunberg used an image of an emaciated Israeli hostage in an Instagram post allegedly showing Palestinian torment. If this were not so serious, it would be hilarious. There is never an acknowledgement from these intifada warriors about the origins of this conflict. The war was started by Hamas and then countered by Israel with a force majeure that many around the world considered inappropriate.\n\nYet what is the correct response to an enemy whose core ideology boasts of a genocidal intent towards your people? Even in the hours after the October 7 attack, a Hamas official vowed to repeat these atrocities against innocent civilians ‘time and again until Israel is annihilated’.\n\nSince October 7, 2023, more than 80,000 people have been killed, 200,000 injured and millions have been displaced. None of it had to happen. Hamas could have surrendered or given up the hostages at any point but chose not to.\n\nSo you can call for a free Palestine, call Israel a terrorist state, cut down all the ribbons you can find and write down your demands in concrete, but you cannot excuse Hamas for what they did or ignore the jubilation in Gaza that greeted their actions.\n\nYou cannot blame Israel for everything and, most of all, you shouldn’t turn your wrath on innocent Jewish people who simply don’t deserve your wicked opprobrium.\n\nNo, really... Julia had it tough too\n\nNow and again rich, beautiful and successful celebrities like to beam down from Planet Perfect to remind everyone that they are just like us – full of doubts and worries.\n\nJulia Roberts is the latest to sally forth and talk of her pain and suffering.\n\nWhat happened darling? Tell all to your Auntie Jan.\n\n‘I encountered early on, not a lot but a few critical people who were really cruel,’ she said. I take this to mean someone once said: ‘That top doesn’t suit you.’ The actress endured ‘more bumps than smooth sailing’ aged 15 to 25 – just like everyone else, surely? NO! You have to understand that her suffering and insecurity was real.\n\n‘It was so much more about who I wanted to be as opposed to what kind of career I wanted to have. Then I wanted to take the person that I wanted to build and put that person into these different situations of work life. Now I look at it as some of the lessons I’m the most grateful for because they proved my endurance to myself.’\n\nIn her first interview since she filed for divorce, Nicole Kidman has said sex should no longer be unmentionable or off-limits. ‘Sex is an important part of our lives and is still, a lot of times, taboo – and it shouldn’t be,’ she said.\n\nWhat in the name of rumpy is Big Nic talking about? In this post-Bridgerton era, there is much more whoop‑de-doo than taboo around, on screens both big and small.\n\nThis includes a controversial new adaptation of Wuthering Heights, not to mention all the explicit and unsettling depictions of sex and sexuality in Kidman’s own movies.\n\nWould she ever consider making a non-horn film with her clothes on? That’s what I would like to know.\n\nPriced out of a big night out\n\nPubs, clubs and restaurants might soon be able to open into the early hours as part of Labour’s drive for economic growth. Critics say this might lead to more drunken disorder – but will it help the struggling hospitality industry? I doubt it.\n\nPubs have been crippled by the economy, by energy price rises, by the minimum wage and by the increase in National Insurance payments.\n\nThousands of pubs have had to close because of disastrous Labour policies. And people are not going to pubs because they can’t afford them any more. A pint of lager costs around £5.15 – more expensive in London – while four cans of Stella Artois from a supermarket costs £6.19.\n\nEven Rachel Reeves could do the maths and figure out what the problem might be.","summary":"After all the devastation of the past two years, a Gaza peace deal has been reached and Donald Trump says all that remains is 'getting the final word down in concrete'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15178945/JAN-MOIR-No-beliefs-unfeeling-ogre-vandalises-grief.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/09/22/102862157-0-image-m-26_1760044139588.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:07:57","author":"Editor,Jan Moir","authors":["Editor","Jan Moir"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":367850950,"title":"\"We Settled 7 Wars, This Is Number 8\": Trump After Gaza Ceasefire Deal","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-after-gaza-ceasefire-deal-9428674\" on this server.\nReference #18.8ea72917.1760058064.1eb5a35a\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.8ea72917.1760058064.1eb5a35a","summary":"US President Donald Trump held a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday morning, a day after announcing that the \"first phase\" of the Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas would begin soon.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-after-gaza-ceasefire-deal-9428674","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:07:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":367843528,"title":"Charlie Kirk’s TPUSA announces alternative plan in response to NFL choosing Bad Bunny for 2026 Super Bowl halftime show","text":"The NFL-Bad Bunny controversy appears to be far from finished. The Puerto Rican singer has been on the receiving end of criticism since he was announced as the headliner of the Super Bowl LX halftime show. Born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, Bad Bunny is one of the most famous artists in the world at the moment. Going from a Soundcloud rapper to a global superstar, Martinez is arguably the most famous face of the Latino community in the world. While many celebrated that the NFL picked him to headline the halftime show, others were strongly against the decision for reasons that stemmed from Bad Bunny's reluctance to perform in the United States under the risk that ICE agents would arrest his fans at the venues. He has been a vocal critic of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, too, which hasn't done him any favors with a sector of the country. In addition to fans petitioning that the NFL remove Bad Bunny from the halftime show, Turning Point USA, an organization previously led by the late conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk, announced they will give fans their version of the halftime show. The organization's X account shared the news on Thursday. \"It’s true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon.\"Bad Bunny sent daring message to critics ahead of Super Bowl halftime show On Saturday, Bad Bunny responded to all the people criticizing his designation as the headliner of Super Bowl LX halftime. During his appearance on \"Saturday Night Live,\" Martinez shared his excitement about this opportunity.“I’m very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy,\" Martinez said.He sent another message to his Latino fans, this time in Spanish.“Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”Then, he directed at those who don't want a Spanish speaker performing at the Super Bowl.“If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn,\" he added.This decision has raised many eyebrows around the league and the controversy hasn't stopped just yet.","summary":"The NFL-Bad Bunny controversy appears to be far from finished.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-charlie-kirk-s-tpusa-announces-alternative-plan-response-nfl-choosing-bad-bunny-2026-super-bowl-halftime-show","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/23252810-1760047881.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:07:24","author":"Orlando Silva","authors":["Orlando Silva"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.109},{"id":367843524,"title":"Melanie King calls Gavin Newsom the \"biggest beneficiary\" of Palisades wildfire: Details explored","text":"YouTube personality Melanie King recently called out Gavin Newsom after authorities arrested a man accused of sparking the devastating Palisades wildfire, which decimated the Los Angeles area.

She noted:“A lone wolf from Florida set the fires in The Pacific Palisades.” GTFOH Gavin Newsom was the biggest beneficiary of the wildfires. Ask him and his wife where the $100 million of relief aid went? Time to get back into this investigation.” The Palisades wildfire was one of the most destructive blazes in LA history. The fire erupted on January 7 near a hiking trail. It reportedly scorched more than 23,000 acres and caused about $150bn in damage.Notably, there was another fire, the Eaton Fire, which ignited on the same day in the LA area. It killed another 19 people and destroyed 9,400 structures. Meanwhile, Rinderknecht was reportedly arrested in Florida on Tuesday. Acting US Attorney Bill Essayli told a news conference on Wednesday that the man was charged with destruction of property by means of fire.The BBC cited a report by justice department officials, which claimed that the evidence collected from Jonathan Rinderknecht's digital devices included an image that he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city. Notably, on Wednesday, Rinderknecht appeared in court in Florida and did not enter a plea. The man is not expected to enter an official plea until his arraignment hearing in the coming weeks in LA.

However, the 57-year-old American politician also called out US President Donald Trump and Congress for failing to provide enough federal disaster aid to those impacted.Gavin Newsom said at a news conference:“We need to call out why the President of the United States and Congress has refused to provide relief to those victimized by this arsonist… Thirty-nine billion dollars — for months — and the President has said nothing. The Speaker of the House has said he’s not interested in helping the American people that were devastated here in Los Angeles.”Deadline also reported that Newsom had asked for $40B from Congress in February. The money was asked to cover housing costs and infrastructure, low-interest loans, economic development grants, grants to dislocated workers, brush clearance, unemployment assistance, forest management, and more. For the unversed, the Palisades wildfire wiped out whole neighbourhoods. The conflagration, which raged for more than three weeks, also ravaged parts of Topanga and Malibu. The fire reportedly destroyed the homes of a number of celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Mel Gibson, and Jeff Bridges.","summary":"YouTube personality Melanie King recently called out Gavin Newsom after authorities arrested a man accused of sparking the devastating Palisades wildfire, which decimated the Los Angeles area.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/melanie-king-calls-gavin-newsom-biggest-beneficiary-palisades-wildfire-details-explored","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/b7f32-17600088365215-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:07:24","author":"Afreen Shaikh","authors":["Afreen Shaikh"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.521},{"id":367843514,"title":"Phil Mickelson sends Democrat senator a message after his comments on Donald Trump potentially winning Nobel Peace Prize","text":"Phil Mickelson took to X on Thursday, October 9, to respond to Democrat Senator John Fetterman’s recent comments about former President Donald Trump potentially winning the Nobel Peace Prize.

Golf is an individual sport that doesn’t have team work, support system, partnership, team analytics, personality traits, and more. The Europeans have a template that teaches and prepares their captains for these skills,” Mickelson wrote on X.He explained that Europe’s success comes from a consistent leadership structure, while the U.S. creates“a new template every two years with little continuity.”According to Phil Mickelson, bringing in someone like Krzyzewski or Holtz would only work if it were a long-term project, not just a one-off experiment.

In a Thursday letter sent to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, members of The American Border Story (TABS) — representing Angel parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants as well as families who have lost loved ones to fentanyl — urged recognition of Trump's leadership in bringing \"peace and security\" to neighborhoods across the country. \"Fentanyl took my child’s life, and it’s taken thousands more,\" Anne Fundner, whose son died from an overdose in 2022, told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump didn’t look the other way, he went after the cartels and the traffickers poisoning our kids. He’s the only one who made this fight a priority, and because of that, lives have been saved. That’s why he deserves this recognition.\" The families credit Trump with identifying cartels and traffickers as a \"war machine that destroys lives.\" They say he made border security a priority and took action to halt the flow of drugs and violent criminals into the U.S. in a way no other leader has. TRUMP SAVES AMERICAN LIVES WITH ‘OVERWHELMING FORCE’ AGAINST DRUG SMUGGLERS ENCROACHING ON US BEACHES: EXPERT While many world leaders have sought peace abroad, the families say Trump's efforts have been focused on peace \"right here at home.\" Joe Abraham, whose daughter Katie Abraham was killed in a hit-and-run allegedly by an illegal immigrant earlier this year, said Trump is the only leader who treated the border crisis as a national emergency. FAMILY MEMBER OF INFANTS BURNED ALIVE BY CARTEL THANKS TRUMP FOR CRACKDOWN: ‘HOPEFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME’ \"My daughter was killed by someone who never should have been in this country,\" Abraham told Fox News Digital. \"… He stood up to the cartels, secured the border and fought to protect families like mine.

Buddy Carter, R-Ga., announced he was tapping Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize following his landmark agreement to end the Israel-Hamas war. Pro-Israel activist Lizzy Savetsky went further Thursday, suggesting that the Nobel should be renamed in Trump's honor to mark the world-changing achievement. The deadline for this year’s nominations was January 31. While some proposals for Trump came in before then, many arrived after the cutoff. If he does not win when the prize is announced Friday, he could be considered again next year. The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Standing defiant in a video posted on X, the New York attorney general said her faith leaves no room for fear and vowed to fight back aggressively.\n\n“I’m a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I’m not fearful. I’m fearless. And as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights, and I will continue to do my job,” James said.\n\nJames said the charges were “baseless” and accused Trump of weaponizing the justice system for political revenge.\n\n“This is nothing more than a continuation of the President’s desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding. All because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General,” James said. “These charges are baseless, and the President’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The President’s actions are a grave violation of our constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.”\n\nJames called on lawmakers in both parties to speak out against what she described as a disregard for the justice system.\n\n“His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law but to the President is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country. This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice,” James added. “I stand strongly behind my office’s litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence, not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court’s finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.”\n\nTrump appointed Lindsey Halligan in September after Erik Siebert resigned under pressure for refusing to bring charges. Two weeks earlier, a federal grand jury in the same district indicted former FBI Director James Comey, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. (RELATED: Appeals Court Makes Critical Ruling In Letitia James’ Civil Fraud Case Against Trump)\n\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) referred James to the Department of Justice in April for allegedly falsifying mortgage documents. FHFA Director William Pulte accused James of misrepresenting a Virginia property as her primary residence in 2023 to obtain a better mortgage rate, even though she is required to reside in New York as the state’s attorney general.\n\nJames previously sued Trump in 2022, alleging he inflated his net worth to secure favorable loan terms. In August, a New York appeals court overturned a nearly $500 million civil fraud penalty she had won against Trump, calling the amount “excessive.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Vargas determined in dismissing the lawsuit that the diss track's most inflammatory statements about Drake (full name: Aubrey Drake Graham) could not be considered objective facts, according to court documents obtained by the Daily Mail.\nRepresentatives for Drake and Kendrick Lamar — who was not named in the lawsuit — have not yet responded to the Daily Mail's request for comment.\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail, a spokesperson for UMG said: 'From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day. We’re pleased with the court’s dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake’s music and investing in his career.'\nNotably, both Drake — who recently spoke out about plastic surgery rumors that have dogged him — and Lamar are UMG recording artists.\n\nDrake, 38, suffered a major loss in his legal battle over Kendrick Lamar 's diss track Not Like Us after a judge dismissed his federal lawsuit on Thursday; pictured in London on July 11\n\nDrake had been suing Universal Music Group (UMG) — the parent company of his label Republic Records — for defamation in response to Lamar's chart topper, in which he described Drake as a 'pedophile'; Lamar is pictured June 9 in LA\nIn Vargas' ruling, she honed in on whether Lamar's lyrics calling Drake a pedophile could be considered statements of fact.\n'The issue in this case is whether Not Like Us can reasonably be understood to convey as a factual matter that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with minors. In light of the overall context in which the statements in the Recording were made, the Court holds that it cannot,' she wrote.\nShe noted that the statements in Not Like Us, including Lamar's line, 'Say, Drake, I hear you like ‘em young,' had to be considered in the context of the earlier diss tracks, 'in which both participants exchanged progressively caustic, inflammatory insults and accusations,' even though Drake's legal team had urged her to consider Not Like Us without that added context.\n\n Drake breaks silence on plastic surgery rumors as he candidly addresses BBL and 'fake abs' claims \nVargas cited a preceding song released by Drake, the diss track Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he rapped via an AI-generated voice mimicking the late rapper 2Pac, 'Talk about him likin’ young girls, that’s a gift from me.'\nThe judge cited the line, which appeared to goad Lamar into making the accusation about Drake liking young girls.\nShe wrote that 'The similarity in the wording suggests strongly that this line is a direct callback to Drake’s lyrics in the prior song.'\nVargas also wrote that Not Like Us had more in common with posts on social media platforms that hard journalism.\n'The average listener is not under the impression that a diss track is the product of a thoughtful or disinterested investigation, conveying to the public fact-checked verifiable content,' she wrote. \n\nIn a statement to the Daily Mail, a spokesperson for UMG said: 'From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day'\n\nDrake's lawsuit accused UMG of defamation for releasing Not Like Us, in which Lamar called him a 'pedophile' and sex offender; pictured July 11 in London\n\nJudge Jeannette A. Vargas determined that a reasonable listener could not concluded that Lamar's lyrics were statements of objective fact\n\nVargas added that Lamar's hit song was 'replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language, all of which are indicia of opinion.' \nBecause of those factors, she said that reasonable listeners 'would conclude that Lamar is rapping hyperbolic vituperations.'\nIn his lawsuit, Drake had claimed that UMG attempted to artificially boost Not Like Us' popularity with fake streams, but Vargas found the argument unconvincing.\n\n Drake gives shocking response to 'F*** Kendrick' Lamar chant at London festival \nShe described the evidence his legal team offered as 'Tweets by individual users and reporting from fans,' while determining that his lawyers' 'reliance on online comments and reporting' was 'insufficient to meet the plausibility standard.'\nDrake filed his lawsuit in January of this year, claiming that UMG had released Not Like Us despite allegedly knowing that it contained defamatory statements alleging that he was a pedophile and sex offender. \nThe hitmaker also blamed Not Like Us for break-in attempts at his Toronto mansion, as well as the May 2024 shooting of one of his home's security guards. \nDrake's mansion had been featured in the single's artwork, an aerial Google Maps screenshot.\nThe image was dotted with red markers that were intended to indicate the presence of registered sex offenders.\n\nShe also said Not Like Us' lyrics had to be considered in the context of earlier diss tracks, including Drake's lines on Taylor Made Freestyle, in which he appeared to goad Lamar into accusing him of liking young girls; seen July 12 in London\nVargas heard oral arguments in the case in June. \nDrake initially cut back on his public profile in the wake of Not Like Us' release in May 2024, particularly in the US.\nHowever, he continued to tour throughout 2025, including a run of shows in February in Australia and a collaborative European tour with PartyNextDoor from July 11 through September 23.\nDrake is set to expected to release Iceman — his ninth studio album and first since Not Like Us' release — later in 2025. \nDrakeKendrick Lamar\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDrake suffers major defeat in lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar's diss-track hit Not Like Us\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Once the deal is ratified, the cease-fire will take effect within 24 hours.\n\nBut ratification isn't a done deal. Two cabinet members -- Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir -- are expected to vote against it, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported that if the prisoner release happens, 250 prisoners serving life sentences in Israel will be released, along with 1,700 Gazans who have been arrested since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack but were not involved in it. They will be exiled abroad or sent to Gaza. About 22 minors who also did not participate in the Oct. 7 attack will be set free, the Times reported.\n\nThe release of Israeli hostages is due to take place after the Israeli Defense Force withdraws to new lines in Gaza, within 24 hours of Israel ratifying the deal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that he was invited to speak at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, and he has accepted. He said it was the first time a U.S. \"president has ever done that, so that makes it very interesting.\" The Knesset building is lit up in red, white and blue in honor of Trump's visit, the Times reported.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi invited Trump on Thursday to attend a planned ceremony in Egypt for the signing of an Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, ABC News reported.\n\nA senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said Hamas would not release hostages unless there is an agreement to fully end the war. He told a Qatari TV channel that the agreement reached in Egypt is a \"final cease-fire,\" and said the world should \"monitor Israel's behavior towards implementing the agreement.\"\n\nThe war between Israel and Hamas began Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.\n\nIsrael launched a devastating war in Gaza, killing more than 67,000 people, including more than 20,000 children and 10,000 women. About 460 died from starvation. About 1.9 million, or 90% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, and most of Gaza's infrastructure is destroyed.\n\n\"You can't even imagine how delighted we are,\" said Sanabel, an 18-year-old Palestinian, to the BBC. \"I now need to heal and get rid of every bad memory. I really want to live in peace. I really don't want to hear the sound of bombs anymore. I want to at least live one day without hearing any explosions, missiles or drones.\"\n\nBut some in Israel aren't as happy about the agreement.\n\n\"In this round, the terrorists won,\" Michael told the Post on Thursday. \"Because of political reasons, from both the right and the left, terrorists were allowed into the country and given a free hand to slaughter us like sheep. Now we're making deals with terrorists, which will only bring upon us even worse harm in the near future.\"","summary":"The Trump administration has said it will send at least 200 U.S. troops to the Middle East to monitor the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas, officials said Thursday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/10/09/nears-ratification-peace-deal-trump-invited/4661760032469/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4661760032469/2025/1/9b10a7fe7c4843562b104189c7654492/v1.5/US-troops-to-monitor-first-phase-of-Gaza-peace-deal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:02:30","author":"Lisa Hornung","authors":["Lisa Hornung"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":367847006,"title":"World News | PM Modi Congratulates Israeli PM Netanyahu on Progress Under Trump's Gaza Peace Plan","text":"New Delhi [India], October 10 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to congratulate him on the progress made under US President Donald Trump's Gaza Peace Plan.

In a post on X, Zelenskyy said, \"It is important that the prospect of establishing lasting peace in the Middle East is drawing closer to being realised. This matters not only for that one region, but for the whole world. An agreement is moving forward that could help everyone.\" Emphasising the broader impact of peace efforts, the Ukrainian President added, \"If violence and war are halted in one part of the world, global security increases for all.\" He further expressed gratitude to the United States for its diplomatic leadership, saying, \"We are grateful to President Trump @POTUS and the United States for their leadership, and to every country and leader who are helping.\"\nZelenskyy also voiced hope for the release of hostages and an end to civilian suffering in Gaza. \"We hope that the Israeli hostages, held for more than two years, will be released, and there will be no more victims in Gaza,\" he said.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed the agreement reached overnight for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages, commending the diplomatic efforts that made the breakthrough possible.\nIn a post on X, Macron said, \"Great hope for the hostages and their families, for the Palestinians in Gaza, and for the entire region. I welcome the agreement reached overnight for the release of the hostages and the ceasefire in Gaza, and I commend the efforts of President @realDonaldTrump, as well as the Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish mediators who helped make it happen.\"\nCalling for full compliance with the agreement, he added, \"I call on all parties to strictly uphold its terms. This agreement must mark the end of the war and the beginning of a political solution based on the two-state solution.\"\nMacron further underlined France's commitment to peace and reconstruction efforts, stating, \"France stands ready to contribute to this goal. We will discuss it this afternoon in Paris with our international partners.\"\nEchoing similar sentiments, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the agreement, noting that it reflected broad international collaboration to end hostilities in Gaza.\nShe said, \"I welcome the announcement of an agreement to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages in Gaza, based on the proposal put forward by @POTUS. I commend the diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye in achieving this breakthrough.\"\nVon der Leyen acknowledged the role of regional actors, adding, \"Am also encouraged by the support of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Now, all parties must fully uphold the terms of the agreement. All hostages must be released safely. A permanent ceasefire must be established. The suffering must end.\"\nReaffirming the EU's commitment to humanitarian efforts, she continued, \"The EU will continue to support the swift and safe delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. And when the time comes, we will be ready to help with recovery and reconstruction.\"\nShe concluded by stressing the importance of transforming the current opportunity into a lasting peace framework, saying, \"Today's opportunity should be seized. It's the opportunity to forge a credible political path toward lasting peace and security. A path firmly anchored in the two-state solution.\"\nFollowing the international response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also welcomed the agreement on the first phase of President Donald Trump's peace plan, highlighting the leadership of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe Prime Minister said this development reflects the strong leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He expressed hope that the release of hostages and enhanced humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza will bring much-needed respite and pave the way for lasting peace in the region.\n\"We welcome the agreement on the first phase of President Trump's peace plan. This is also a reflection of the strong leadership of PM Netanyahu. We hope the release of hostages and enhanced humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza will bring respite to them and pave the way for lasting peace,\" Modi said.\nOn Thursday, Israel's Ambassador to India, Reuven Azar, appreciated India's support for the deal.\nIn a post on X, he said, \"Thankful for the efforts of the Israeli delegation and all involved in reaching the agreement that will release all our hostages. Special thanks to POTUS Trump. May we see peace restored soon, free from terror threats. Appreciate India's support all along!\"\nEarlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also welcomed the announcement of the agreement to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, based on the proposal put forward by US President Donald Trump. He lauded the diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, Egypt, and Turkiye in brokering the deal and urged all concerned parties to abide fully by the terms of the agreement.\nAdding further confirmation of progress, Qatar's Prime Minister and official Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Majed Al Ansari, said that an agreement was reached on all the provisions and implementation mechanisms of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.\nAnsari said that the deal covered the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. In a post on X, he wrote, \"The mediators announce that tonight an agreement was reached on all the provisions and implementation mechanisms of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid. The details will be announced later.\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed what he called \"a great day for Israel,\" saying he will \"convene the government tomorrow [Thursday] to approve the agreement and bring all our precious kidnapped people home.\"\nHe thanked the Israeli military and security forces, as well as US President Donald Trump and his team, \"for their commitment to this sacred mission of freeing our kidnapped people.\"\nMeanwhile, Hamas released its first public statement since US President Trump announced that the Palestinian group and Israel had \"signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan.\"\nIn a post on Telegram, Hamas announced the \"conclusion of an agreement stipulating an end to the war on Gaza, the occupation's withdrawal from it, the entry of aid, and a prisoner exchange,\" as per Al Jazeera.\nThe statement called on the US leader, Arab mediators, and international parties to \"compel the occupation government [Israel] to fully implement the agreement's requirements and not allow it to evade or delay the implementation of what has been agreed upon.\"\nThe group concluded by saying it will remain \"faithful to our pledge and will not abandon our people's national rights, including freedom, independence, and self-determination,\" Al Jazeera reported.

Dominion became the target of years of baseless conspiracy theories from Trump and his supporters, who falsely claimed its voting machines switched votes in the 2020 election. Those claims fueled violent threats against election workers and multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuits that reshaped the media landscape.\n\nLiberty Vote’s pledge to align with Trump’s executive order raises new questions about political influence in the election technology industry. The company says it will emphasize “paper-based transparency.” Trump has said that voting machines could be hacked by malactors and is a proponent of paper ballots.\n\n“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES, which cost Ten Times more than accurate and sophisticated Watermark Paper, which is faster, and leaves NO DOUBT, at the end of the evening, as to who WON, and who LOST, the Election,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in August.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe deal was announced by KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books used to verify voter information at polling places. KNOWiNK’s owner, Scott Leiendecker, a former St. Louis elections director, will now head Liberty Vote. The company’s statement emphasized it would be “100% American-owned,” a line seemingly aimed at debunked claims that Dominion was tied to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe terms of the sale were not disclosed, though a company spokesperson said Leiendecker personally financed the purchase. Both companies are privately held.\n\nLeiendecker pledged to provide “election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency.” Dominion’s former CEO, John Poulos, confirmed the sale in a short statement: “Liberty Vote has acquired Dominion Voting Systems.”\n\nLiberty Vote also said it would reintroduce “hand-marked paper ballots” and adhere to Trump’s election order, even though that order remains blocked. The directive sought to ban voting systems that print ballots with barcodes or QR codes — a practice currently used in hundreds of counties across 19 states.\n\nDominion, based in Denver, was at the center of false claims about Trump’s 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The company’s defamation lawsuits led to record settlements, including $787 million from Fox News in 2023 and $67 million from Newsmax this year.\n\nDominion recently reached undisclosed settlement agreements with conservative outlet, One America News (OAN), along with Trump allies Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. The company has not publicly explained why it chose to resolve those cases.\n\nDominion still has active defamation lawsuits against MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, both promoters of false 2020 election claims who deny any wrongdoing.\n\nDespite widespread debunking of the conspiracy theories, Trump has continued to repeat them. He recently vowed to “get rid of voting machines” altogether, though the Constitution grants states and Congress — not the president — authority over election systems.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nDavid Becker, who runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, told CNN, “This announcement raises a lot of questions, questions that I’m sure a lot of states with current Dominion contracts are going to want answers to.”\n\nLeiendecker said in a statement, “Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nLiberty Vote’s announcement that it will follow Trump’s blocked executive order could complicate its business relationships in Democratic-led states that still use Dominion’s equipment. Voting machine companies have historically avoided overt political alignments to maintain trust across partisan lines.\n\nThis article includes reporting by the Associated Press.","summary":"Dominion, based in Denver, was at the center of false claims about Trump’s 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/dominion-voting-2020-conspiracies-trump-republican-leiendecker-10857632","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25282820715323.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:00:55","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":367846720,"title":"Robert F Kennedy claims circumcision linked to autism","text":"US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy has made a shock claim linking circumcision to autism, building on his recent controversial and unproven declaration that a common painkiller caused the condition.\n\nAt a round-table, Kennedy reasserted the unproven link between the pain reliever Tylenol and autism, and suggested people who opposed the theory were motivated by hatred for US President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring a meeting with Trump and the Cabinet, the polarising Kennedy reiterated the connection, even while noting there was no medical proof to substantiate the claim. He also mistakenly described a pregnant woman's anatomy and linked autism to circumcision.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I am worried': Boss of US's biggest bank signals stock market collapse\n\n\"Anybody who takes the stuff during pregnancy unless they have to is, is irresponsible,\" Kennedy told Trump and fellow Cabinet members.\n\n\"It is not proof. We're doing the studies to make the proof.\"\n\nKennedy has long espoused unconventional beliefs about public health, which have prompted concern among medical experts that, as health secretary, he could upend the country's evidence-based health policies.\n\nREAD MORE: Two mystery Aussies split mammoth $50 million jackpot\n\nKennedy noted during the meeting that he had seen a TikTok video, which he said featured a pregnant woman \"gobbling Tylenol\" and cursing Trump.\n\n\"The level of Trump derangement syndrome has now left the political landscape and now in the realm of pathology,\" he said. Kennedy also said the woman was taking Tylenol \"with a baby in her placenta.\"\n\nA fetus develops in the uterus, not the placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ that develops in the uterus during pregnancy and provides oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the growing fetus.\n\nREAD MORE: Can Donald Trump really win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nKennedy's statement came two weeks after he stood with Trump in the White House as the president used his office to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism.\n\nTylenol contains paracetamol, a very common painkiller drug.﻿\n\nKennedy also said today that infant boys who are circumcised have double the rate of autism because they are given Tylenol after the procedure.\n\nThis claim seems to refer to a study in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine from 2015, which looked at ritual circumcision and the risk of autism spectrum disorder in boys under the age of 10 in Denmark.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I burst into tears': The phone call from a friend that stopped Sarah Abo cold\n\nIt found that those who had undergone the procedure, which involves the removal of the foreskin from the penis, were more likely to develop autism than other boys in the study.\n\nResearchers suggested a potential link might be due to the pain of the procedure. \n\nResearchers noted that they had no data on painkillers or anesthetics used, and thus couldn't address whether Tylenol was linked to autism.\n\nOther researchers pointed out that the Denmark study looked at correlation, not causation. They also point to other studies that found no evidence to support a link between circumcision and autism.\n\nReported with Associated Press.﻿\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Uncertainties also persist about how the global economy would be affected, he added.\nThe US has imposed tariffs ranging from 15 to 40 per cent on Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Japan and South Korea.\nWhile duties on Chinese exports average more than 50 per cent, both countries have held four rounds of trade talks since April. US President Donald Trump is also set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Apec Summit in South Korea later this month.\n“‘Asean plus three’ exports expanded by around 7 per cent year-on-year in H1 2025, driven in part by front-loading of shipments ahead of US tariffs,” AMRO said.\n“However, with the new tariffs announced in August in effect, the anticipation is for export growth to slow towards the end of the year, with recent purchasing manager indices pointing to weaker external demand going forward for some regional economies.”\nDespite the conclusion of trade negotiations for most regional economies, AMRO noted that crucial details – such as implementation timelines and specific terms – “remain opaque”, while the risk of tariffs expanding to exempted sectors like semiconductors “remains significant”.\n“Any further escalation of US trade actions could weigh heavily on regional economic activity,” the research office said, noting that higher and broader tariffs for the region – including those targeting transshipments or currently excluded products – could shave half a percentage point off growth in 2026, returning to the sluggish post-pandemic pace of 2022.\nAMRO added that weaker-than-expected growth in China – due to a protracted property sector slowdown or external headwinds like US tariffs – could also weigh on regional trade, investment and tourism flows.","summary":"The “Asean plus three” group of countries achieved solid economic growth in the first half of 2025, but unpredictable policy shifts in the United States could still send tremors through the region this year, a top economic surveillance body said.\nGrowth in the grouping – the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, along with China, Japan and South Korea – is projected to reach 4.1 per cent in 2025, the Asean+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) said in a new quarterly...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3328376/asean3-growth-defies-expectations-trade-war-risks-still-high-amro-says","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/09/7cc55904-d273-417b-9d8e-861a8a2fb5d3_0df810df.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 00:00:17","author":"Kandy Wong","authors":["Kandy Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":367845822,"title":"MSNBC panel uses Katie Porter backlash to blast 'double standard' for women in politics","text":"A panel on MSNBC’s \"Chris Jansing Reports\" on Thursday discussed whether the recent backlash against California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter was because of a \"double standard\" against women in politics.

India has maintained that no third party had a role to play in the cessation of hostilities.Earlier on Thursday, Trump announced an agreement between Hamas and Israel on his Truth Social account, saying all of the hostages held in Gaza would be released soon.

We've set a target of doubling it by 2030,\" Modi said at the India-UK CEO Forum. \"I'm confident we can achieve the target before that.\"The Prime Minister also expressed hope that the India-UK free trade pact will boost small and medium companies and help create jobs.India and the UK also signed agreements furthering the CETA and a 350-million contract for the UK to supply missiles to India.Live EventsAt the Global Fintech Festival, Modi said India was helping other countries in the development of digital technologies, besides sharing them. \"This is not digital aid...there are many in the world who are interested in providing aid,\" he said. \"For us this is not aid, but digital empowerment.\"Military and Education Ties“India and the UK are natural partners. Our relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi after his talks with Starmer.“Defence cooperation between India and the UK has strengthened, advancing toward co-production and linking the defence industries of both countries,\" Modi said. India and the UK have signed an agreement on military training, under which Indian Air Force flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force.On the education sector, he said nine UK universities will open their campuses in India, and that the University of Southampton has already started operations here.Maximising PotentialStarmer said India is well on track to becoming the world's third-largest economy by 2028, in what was seen as a jibe at US President Donald Trump's claim that India's economy was “dead.”\"I want to congratulate the PM on his leadership, aiming to be the world's third largest economy by 2028. Your vision of Viksit Bharat is to make it a completely developed country by 2047,\" said the UK PM. \"Everything I have seen since I have been here is absolute proof to me that you are on track to succeed in that. We want to be partners on that journey,\" Starmer added.He asked industry leaders from India and the UK to list out what the governments of both countries could do to remove barriers stopping them from capitalising on opportunities.\"We want to support you to maximise the potential in relation to this trade agreement,\" Starmer said, adding that there has been a 6 billion pound boost in trade and investment in the three months since the signing of the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in July.The British PM, accompanied by a delegation of 125 business leaders, entrepreneurs and educationists, landed in Mumbai on Wednesday morning on a two-day visit, his first to India.Starmer's visit came two-and-a-half months after the two countries signed the landmark trade pact, CETA, which will increase market access and cut tariffs. The trade deal was firmed up during PM Modi's visit to London in July.No Violence in DemocracyLater, briefing reporters, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said the issue of Khalistani activities was discussed during Modi’s meeting with Starmer, and that India reiterated its serious concerns over the activities of such groups abroad.“The Prime Minister emphasised that radicalism and violent extremism have no place in democratic societies and should not be allowed to misuse the freedoms these societies provide,\" Misri said. “There is a need to act against such elements strictly within the legal frameworks available to both sides.\"Misri said the matter had previously been raised in discussions between the two leaders in July and was flagged again during Thursday’s talks. He said both sides agreed on the importance of mutual cooperation and respect for legal processes in dealing with extremist activities that threaten social harmony and public safety.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onbilateral tradeNarendra ModiKeir Starmerfree trade pactCETAGlobal Fintech Festivalmodiindiastarmer\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

I have no tolerance for this type of dangerous person flaunting our laws and thinking he would hide out in our county.' \n\nExantus' arrest comes just days after Donald Trump's administration expressed fury over the killer's release. \n\nShortly after Exantus was freed, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declared the White House was 'looking into this' on X. \n\n'It’s wholly unacceptable for a child killer to walk free after just several years in prison,' she wrote. \n\nExantus was found not guilty of Logan's murder by reason of insanity. However, he was found guilty but mentally ill on assault charges for stabbing Logan's father and sisters during the 2015 rampage. \n\nOn the night of the heinous crime, Exantus - who had no previous relationship with the Tiptons - drove from Indianapolis to Versailles to attack the unsuspecting family. \n\nLogan's mother, Heather Tipton, told the Daily Mail he entered their home through an unlocked door. \n\nAfter gaining entry, he unleashed a vicious assault on the entire family, killing Logan and severely injuring his father and two sisters. \n\nLogan was stabbed repeatedly in the head with such rage that the blade of the butcher's knife bent out of shape. \n\nDuring his trial, Exantus' friends recalled he was acting strangely in the days before the disturbing killing. \n\nHe was believed to have been headed to Florida to see family when he stopped at the Tipton's home. \n\nExantus told officers he had seen a sign for Gray Street and it reminded him of the medical TV show 'Grey's Anatomy'.\n\nHe told police at the time that he believed he needed to 're-enact surgery' inside the Tiptons' home and that the street name 'made him think of knives for surgery.'\n\nExantus became eligible for parole in 2019 due to credit for time served and had his parole pushed back in 2021. It was then deferred for two more years in 2023.\n\nBefore Exantus was granted release, Logan's family had fought tooth and nail in Kentucky court to have his sentence extended. \n\nIn a statement, the parole board in Kentucky told Daily Mail that they had repeatedly recommended Exantus remain behind bars.\n\nThey said: 'Exantus was reviewed for parole on 09/30/2025, as required by state law. The Parole Board issued a decision that Exantus stay in prison for the remainder of his sentence.\n\n'Despite this decision, Kentucky law required the Department of Corrections to release the inmate on Mandatory Reentry Supervision.'\n\nLogan's father, Dean Tipton, had vowed revenge against his son's killer before his rearrest. \n\n'I've had my talks with God because I'm not afraid to tell, and I've told the court if I ever cross paths with him, I will kill the man. I will kill him where he stands,' Dean said to WLKY. \n\nHeather had expressed fear over Exantus being out on the streets once again, as he told Logan's sister, Koral, he was going to kill their entire family.\n\n'If you're a victim… and there's a violent criminal going to be released that's in connection to you, I think you should be offered some sort of security or protection - or at least just a phone call,' Heather said.\n\n'It just feels like a six-year-old's life is worth more than ten years in prison.","summary":"A man who broke into a Kentucky home and fatally stabbed a six-year-old boy has been rearrested in Florida just days after his early prison release sparked outrage.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15179267/ronald-exantus-killer-arrested-logan-tipton.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/10/00/102865523-0-image-m-26_1760052653667.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 23:59:23","author":"Editor,Sonya Gugliara","authors":["Editor","Sonya Gugliara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":367843212,"title":"Peace at last for Gaza: Israeli security cabinet approves Trump-brokered agreement to end two years of brutal war with all 20 living hostages released by Monday","text":"The Israeli government has approved a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas, just days after the two-year anniversary of the October 7 massacre. \n\nBenjamin Netanyahu's office announced on Thursday that it had given its final approval to back the agreement after 734 days of war.\n\nThe Israeli Prime Minister's office said in a statement: 'The government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages – the living and the deceased.'\n\nIt came despite fierce opposition from Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nBen-Gvir, leader of the far-right party Jewish Power, had earlier declared he would be voting against the deal and threatened to topple Netanyahu's coalition government if Hamas's 'rule was not dismantled'. \n\n'In conversations held between me and the prime minister in recent days, I made it clear that under no circumstances will I be part of a government that allows the continued existence of Hamas's rule in Gaza,' Ben-Gvir said.\n\n'This is a glaring red line. The prime minister committed to me that this will be the case.'\n\nA ceasefire will go into effect within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting, when Israeli troops will also begin to withdraw from Gaza along an agreed-upon line.\n\nHamas will release the remaining living and dead Israeli hostages within 72 hours after that. Once they are returned, Israel will free 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans who have been held since October 7. \n\nDonald Trump earlier said during a meeting of his cabinet at the White House that he was 'working on the timing' to make the trip to Egypt to attend a signing ceremony. \n\n'That will be a day of joy, I'm going to try and make a trip over,' the US President said.\n\nAmerica will send 200 troops to monitor the ceasefire deal, although separate reports from a senior US official say they will not be deployed in Gaza. \n\nInstead, there will be a 'joint task force' that could include soldiers from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. \n\nUS Central Command will establish a 'civil-military coordination center' in Israel that will facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the war-torn territory, officials told the Associated Press. \n\nIt comes after Trump announced on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire, after days of indirect talks in Egypt. \n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social: 'All of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.'\n\nQatar, which helped broker the deal along with Egypt and Turkey, said it was the 'first phase' of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war. \n\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the news as a 'moment of profound relief that will be felt around the world'.\n\nUnder Trump's deal, Hamas plans to release all remaining hostages, both living and dead, in exchange for roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, the Israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of Gaza.\n\nLast night, the U.S. president spoke to the families of those held captive by the terror organisation during a phone call with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. \n\nWith Trump on speakerphone, Lutnick asked the families: 'You have the best crowd in the world, what do you have to say to President Trump?' The entire group of about a dozen people responded: 'Thank you!' \n\n'Thank you very much everybody,' responded Trump, as one of the family members exclaimed: 'You did it!' \n\nThe security cabinet meeting was delayed by several hours, after being originally scheduled to take place at 5pm local time (3pm BST). \n\nOne of the reasons for the delay was ongoing discussions regarding the list of Palestinian security prisoners to be released, reported Channel 12.\n\nThere are 48 hostages still held in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nTrump said he believed that all the hostages - including the deceased - will be 'coming back' on Monday.\n\nHe is expected to arrive in Jerusalem on Sunday, the office of Israel's president said, after the U.S. leader announced Israel and Hamas had agreed to a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nAn event scheduled for Sunday at the Israeli president's residence in Jerusalem was cancelled 'in light of the expected release of the hostages, and... the upcoming visit of President of the United States Donald J. Trump to Israel,' the office of Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n'The decision was made due to anticipated security closures in Jerusalem surrounding the visit and the historic developments unfolding in the coming days.'\n\nWhen asked whether his trip to the Middle East could include Gaza, Trump said: 'I may do that.'\n\nA final draft of phase one of the deal was signed by all parties this morning. \n\nA top official within Hamas told AFP Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners: 250 among those serving life sentences and 1,700 others detained since the start of the war.\n\nThe exchange should take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the deal, which was also 'agreed with Palestinian factions', another source within Hamas said.\n\nA daily minimum of 400 trucks of aid will enter the Gaza Strip for the first five days of the ceasefire, to be increased in following days, according to the same source.\n\nIt also provides for the 'return of displaced persons from the south of the Gaza Strip to Gaza (City) and the north immediately,' they added. \n\nThe deal stipulates 'scheduled withdrawals' of Israeli troops, the Hamas top official said, and includes 'guarantees from President Trump and the mediators'.\n\nHamas called in an official statement on Trump to compel Israel to fully implement the agreement and 'not allow it to evade or procrastinate in implementing what has been agreed'.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had announced overnight that he would be convening a cabinet meeting Thursday to approve a plan for the release of hostages. \n\nHe said on social media: 'With God's help we will bring them all home.'\n\nHe called the deal 'a diplomatic success and a national and moral victory for the State of Israel'. \n\nThe prisoner-hostage exchange should take place within 72 hours of the Israeli government vote ratifying the deal, an official told the Daily Mail.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet voted in favour of the deal, despite the fact that certain members of Netanyahu's far-right coalition have vehemently opposed any peace agreement with Hamas.\n\nFinance Minister of Israel, Bezalel Smotrich, said his far-right Religious Zionism party would not vote in support of a Gaza ceasefire. \n\nHe wrote on X of his 'tremendous fear of the consequences of emptying the prisons and releasing the next generation of terrorist leaders, who will do everything to continue spilling rivers of Jewish blood, God forbid'. \n\nOn Wednesday night, Trump said the world 'coming together' had helped forge his landmark deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nHe declared it was a 'great day for the world' as he imagined a prosperous future for the war torn area.\n\n'The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,' he said. 'This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody.'\n\nTrump also said Gaza will be a 'peaceful, much safer place' and the U.S. would remain involved to ensure its safety and prosperity.\n\n'Other countries in the area will help it reconstruct because they have tremendous wealth,' Trump said, adding: 'We'll be involved in helping them make it successful and helping it stay peaceful.'\n\nTrump confirmed that he spoke to Netanyahu earlier in the night. The prime minister told him, 'I can't believe it,' according to the president's retelling.\n\nWeary Palestinians cautiously welcomed the deal Thursday as a potential breakthrough in ending the two-year war, following days of negotiations in Egypt.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages popped Champagne and cried tears of joy when the deal was announced.\n\nAmong the photos is a rare picture of Einav Zangauker, mother of 25-year-old hostage Matan, smiling.\n\nShe has spent the past two years fiercely protesting for the release of her son, kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz, and against Netanyahu's government for the ongoing military activity in Gaza.\n\nThe major peace deal was announced by Trump just two days before the 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is revealed. The winner will be be awarded on December 10 at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Norway.\n\nTrump has long made the prize one of his ambitions as president.\n\nSaudi Arabia welcomes possible start of a ceasefire.\n\nThe kingdom said in a foreign ministry statement that it hoped the peace deal will lead to urgent action to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and a complete Israeli withdrawal.\n\nSaudi Arabia also expressed hope that the peace plan would lead to the 'initiation of practical steps to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders'.\n\nAccording to the Hamas-run Gazan authorities, some 67,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault. It followed the October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, when 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for all parties to uphold the agreement's terms, while the EU's policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on X that 'the EU will do what it can to support its implementation'.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed the deal as 'extraordinary news' and urged its swift implementation, while Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel expressed hope for wider peace in the region.\n\nIn France, President Emmanuel Macron said the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas brings hope for hostages, Palestinians in Gaza, and the entire region.\n\nHe added the agreement will be discussed in Paris later Thursday during a meeting on Gaza's future.\n\n'This agreement must mark the end of the war and the beginning of a political solution based on the two-state solution,' he said.\n\nTurkey's Erdogan thanks Trump for showing `necessary political will'\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country played a role in the negotiations, expressed pleasure with the ceasefire agreement reached between Hamas and Israel.\n\nIn a statement posted on X, Erdogan thanked Trump for 'demonstrating the necessary political will' as well as Qatar and Egypt for facilitating the deal.\n\nA senior Hamas official said the group has handed over a list of Palestinian prisoners who will be released as part of the ceasefire deal.\n\nZaher Jabarin, who oversees Palestinian prisoners' affairs, said in a statement the list was prepared in accordance with 'the criteria agreed upon in the agreement.'\n\nHe said the group still 'awaiting final agreement on the names,' and that they will be announced 'once the relevant procedures and understandings are completed.\n\nThe names of prisoners rumoured to be released include Ahmad Sa’adat, Ibrahim Hamed and Abbas al-Sayyid.\n\nSa’adat is secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and planned the assassination of Minister Rehavam Ze’evi.\n\nHamed is a senior member of Hamas' military wing in the West Bank and served as the main planner of suicide bombings during the Second Intifada. He is convicted of murdering 46 Israelis and injuring more than 400 and has been sentenced to 54 life terms.\n\nAl-Sayyid is another senior member of Hamas’ military wing in the West Bank and was one of the planners of the Park Hotel bombing in 2002, in which 30 Israelis were killed and 160 were injured.\n\nWednesday's agreement reached in Sharm el-Sheikh, a favoured location for Middle East peace conferences over the decades with a patchy record of success, is only an initial phase covering handing over hostages held in Gaza, exchanging them with Palestinian prisoners inside Israel and a partial withdrawal of Israel from the enclave.\n\nPlenty of pitfalls remain after negotiators left for later discussions about some of the thornier issues on which previous initiatives have foundered, such as the full extent of an Israeli withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas and who and how to guarantee that war will not resume after this phase.\n\nFor a start, guns have not yet fallen silent.\n\nTrump demanded Israel halt its bombing when Hamas first indicated partial acceptance for his 20-point plan on Friday. That has not happened. Scores of Palestinians have been killed since then in airstrikes and shelling, particularly in and around Gaza City, the focus of a recent Israeli offensive.\n\nHowever, the bombardment has been more sporadic since Trump declared a deal had been secured on Wednesday, prompting celebrations in Israel, where families of hostages were jubilant in Tel Aviv's so-called hostages square, and in Gaza, where people gathered among the ruins even as blasts could be heard.\n\nWhile this is a partial deal, a notable difference from previous ceasefire arrangements is that there is no deadline for reaching a full deal. It does not set a deadline of a few weeks, after which hostilities could resume if talks falter.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether that makes this deal more durable. There are those among Netanyahu's religious nationalist coalition who are already talking of more war. \n\nSmotrich, a staunch opponent of any concession to Palestinians, has called for Hamas to be destroyed after the hostages are returned.\n\nBut on this occasion, Trump has been far more vocal in his determination to hold feet to the fire on both sides, leaving less room for Israel to relaunch its offensive or Hamas to delay, even if past experience counsels caution over too much optimism.\n\nTrump announced his plan standing next to Netanyahu in Washington last week with what seemed a 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer for Hamas. Yet when Hamas gave only a partial acceptance, Trump immediately demanded Israel stop bombing. And as the days ticked by in Sharm el-Sheikh talks, he warned Hamas 'all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out' if it did not sign up.\n\nIsrael's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000 others, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its toll, but has said women and children make up around half of the dead.\n\nPalestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas met with Israeli activists in Ramallah on Thursday to discuss long-term peace after Israel and Hamas agreed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\n'I welcome the agreement signed today, the end of the war, and the release of the hostages,' Abbas told dozens of representatives from Israeli peace organisations assembled at the presidential palace in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.\n\n'A few months ago, (U.S. President Donald) Trump had a plan to expel the Palestinians, but later he forgot about it,' he added.\n\n'Nevertheless, we will remain in our homeland and establish a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank, and east Jerusalem,' he said.\n\nSpeaking from a podium in the presence of Arab-Israeli Knesset member Ayman Odeh and the Palestinian Authority's vice-president Hussein al-Sheikh, a jovial Abbas spoke to a friendly audience, sometimes exchanging smiles and jokes with activists.\n\nTwo power cuts momentarily left all attendees in the dark, an AFP journalist reported.\n\nAmong them was Iddo Ilam, an activist and refusnik who explained why he chose not to serve in the Israeli army, as Abbas gestured to him with two thumbs up.\n\n'We are asking for a different future, peace between Jews and Palestinians,' said Rula Daoud, co-director of Standing Together, an Israeli grassroots movement aiming to bring together Palestinians and Jewish Israeli communities.","summary":"Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced on Thursday that it had given its final

sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, non-governmental organisations and private-sector players, US officials said on Thursday.\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorised for release, said US Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination centre” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory wracked by two years of war.\nThe remarks provide some of the first details on how the ceasefire deal would be monitored and that the US military would have a role in that effort.\nAfter Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Trump administration plan to halt the fighting, a litany of questions remain on next steps, including Hamas disarmament, a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and a future government in the territory.\nOne of the officials said the new team will help monitor implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the transition to a civilian government in Gaza.\n\nThe coordination centre will be staffed by about 200 US service members who have expertise in transport, planning, security, logistics and engineering, said the official, who noted that no American troops will be sent into Gaza.\nA second official said the troops would come from US Central Command as well as other parts of the globe.\nThat official added that the troops have already begun arriving and will continue to travel to the region over the weekend to begin planning and efforts to establish the centre.\nTwo other senior US officials who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to publicly discuss internal deliberations offered more details about forces from other countries and what US troops would be doing.\nMembers of the armed forces of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are expected to be embedded with the team of 200 US troops, according to one of the officials.\nThe American service members will integrate the multinational force and coordinate with Israeli defence forces, the official said.\nThe exact location of where US troops will be positioned is something they will be working to determine on Friday, the other official said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, meanwhile, highlighted Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of US Central Command, during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday, saying he had worked alongside special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n“Cooper – I hear he’s been fantastic,” Trump said.\nCooper joined the US side of the talks in Egypt this week, according to one of the US officials, and he helped reassure the Arab countries at the negotiating table that the US would put a strong guarantee behind its commitments – a reassurance the Arab countries then passed along to Hamas.\nIn a show of readiness, Cooper told them he could have a command post up and running in the next two and a half weeks.\nA breakthrough deal to pause the war in Gaza was reached on Wednesday after the United States and mediators in the region pressured both Israel and Hamas to end the fighting that has devastated the Gaza Strip, killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, sparked other conflicts and isolated Israel.\nThat push sealed an agreement on a first phase that would free the remaining living Israeli hostages within days in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.","summary":"The United States is sending about 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner

back Biden-era restrictions on mining and drilling in 3 Western states","text":"By MATTHEW BROWN and MATTHEW DALY\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump’s ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.\n\nSenators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.\n\nThe timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.\n\nThe House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.\n\nTrump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.\n\nThe road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.\n\nThe Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.\n\nTrump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.\n\nA decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.\n\nAdministration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”\n\nRepublican Sen.

Nearly half of respondents, 46 percent, said neither, while 14 percent said his first term, 16 percent said his second term and 20 percent liked both terms equally. \n\nWhen comparing Trump’s two terms by initiatives, 83 percent said there’s been more immigration enforcement actions, 71 percent said there’s been more restructuring of federal agencies and 69 percent said there’s been more use of military force domestically. \n\nIn fulfilling the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, the Trump administration has carried out Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids across the country. \n\nIn another controversial move, Trump has deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles to quell anti-ICE protesters, to Washington D.C. and Memphis in the name of cracking down on crime, and near Chicago to help in his immigration enforcement efforts. \n\nA federal judge paused the deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois Thursday, after Trump was temporarily blocked from deploying guardsmen to Portland, Oregon, to stop what the president called “lawless mayhem.”\n\nEarlier in his term, Trump slashed the federal government with the help of tech billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. CNN reported in July more than 50,000 federal workers have been laid off or targeted for layoffs in Trump’s second term. \n\nThe White House has also threatened mass layoffs amid the ongoing government shutdown, which began on October 1 after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on a spending plan.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy KIRSTEN MURRAY, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:35 BST, 10 October 2025 |Updated:00:53 BST, 10 October 2025 \n\n'I really believe everyone has a snapshot of themselves from a time that they were young that they're ashamed of. \n'For me that it’s that 14-year-old overweight, unattractive kid who felt ugly to the world, who listened to hip hop and wanted so badly to be accepted by this community of skaters.'\nThese are the words Jonah Hill wrote about himself in his magazine Inner Child back in 2018 as he grappled with his identity in a candid admission. \nThe star explained he grew up with people calling him 'fat and gross and unattractive' leading him to a complicated relationship with his body image. \nAfter reportedly weighing 280 pounds at his heaviest, the 21 Jump Street star's weight has fluctuated over the years after he originally kickstarted his weight loss back in 2011. \nAnd this week the star shocked fans after he was seen cutting a much slimmer figure while filming his upcoming comedy movie. \nBut how as the actor's stature fluctuated over the years and what are his slimmed down secrets?\nIt was Brad Pitt who first spurred Jonah to change his lifestyle for the better after the pair starred together in Moneyball. \n\nAfter reportedly weighing 280 pounds at his heaviest, Jonah Hill's weight has fluctuated over the years after he originally kickstarted his weight loss back in 2011 (pictured in Superbad in 2007 when he was 23) \n\nThis week the star shocked fans after he was seen cutting a much slimmer figure while filming his upcoming comedy movie \nJonah went on to lose 40 pounds after speaking to a nutritionist and adjusting his diet. \nHe told ABC News in 2012: 'I wish there was some crazy thing I did, like a pill or a genie, but I went to see a nutritionist, and he told me what to eat to change my habits. I found that Japanese food was very helpful to me.'\nThe star also started running to ease himself into exercise. Appearing on Kidd Kraddick radio show he said he 'started physically running instead of emotionally running' as well as doing push ups. \nAfter beginning with just 10 push ups a day he eventually worked his way up to 100 reps per day. \nThe star admitted he struggled to cut out beer, confessing a pint is his 'Achilles heel'. \nOn an episode of the Kyle and Jackie O radio show he explained: 'I still drink beer—that’s my Achilles heel.\n'It’s so annoying because if I don’t drink beer, I get really thin. And when I drink beer, I get a little bigger.'\nJonah has also been vocal about how his weight was linked to his identity as a comedic actor but how important it was for his career and health to not be so big. \n\nThe star explained he grew up with people calling him 'fat and gross and unattractive' leading him to a complicated relationship with his body image (pictured in 2015) \n\nJonah lost 40 pounds in 2011 after speaking to a nutritionist and embracing Japanese food as part of his diet (pictured in December 2011) \n\nHowever, in 2016 the actor gained the weight back to play arms dealer Efraim Diveroli in War Dogs alongside Bradley Cooper and Miles Teller (pictured) \n\n Jonah Hill is completely unrecognisable as he shows off dramatic weight loss on set \nHe told Vulture in 2011, just after his Moneyball weight loss: 'Being healthier came along with maturity and it's hard, because a lot of times people want you to be the guy you were when they met you.\n'And I love doing funny movies, but I want to mature, literally, in how I treat myself. I'm not living in a frat house with a bong plastered to the table.\n'But all this stuff [points to his body] is just part of maturing in body and in mind.\n'I just want to be a good man and to make my family proud. And, you know, I want to live a long time.' \nHowever, in 2016 the actor gained the weight back to play arms dealer Efraim Diveroli in War Dogs alongside Bradley Cooper and Miles Teller. \nOnce the film was released, Jonah turned to pal Channing Tatum to ask how best to shed the weight one again. \nSpeaking candidly on the Tonight Show he told Jimmy Fallon a year later: 'I wanted to get in better shape, so I called Channing Tatum and said, \"Hey, if I eat less and go to a trainer, will I get in good shape?\"\n'[He said] 'Yes, you dumb mother****er, of course you will. It's the simplest thing in the entire world\".'\nJonah then began boxing to stay in shape after he was seen in snaps jabbing and shadow boxing with a personal trainer. \nBack in 2021, Jonah spoke up about body positivity and struggling with his body image over the years in a now deleted post. \n'I don’t think I ever took my shirt off in a pool until I was in my mid 30s even in front of family and friends,' he wrote on Instagram. \n'Probably would have happened sooner if my childhood insecurities weren’t exacerbated by years of public mockery about my body by press and interviewers.'\nHe continued: 'I’m 37 and finally love and accept myself.'\nThe star went on to say his message was for 'the kids who don’t take their shirt off at the pool.'\n'Have fun. You’re wonderful and awesome and perfect. All my love,' he concluded.\n\nOnce the film was released, Jonah turned to pal Channing Tatum to ask how best to shed the weight one again (pictured with Channing in 21 Jump Street in 2012) \n\nJonah began boxing to stay in shape in 2017 after he was seen in snaps jabbing and shadow boxing with a personal trainer\nIn 2023 the star discussed his fluctuating weight with his therapist Phil Stutz for his second feature directorial effort, the Netflix documentary Stutz.\n'When I was a kid, exercise and diet was framed to me as like, \"There's something wrong with how you look,\"' the Winning Time director recalled.\n'But never once was exercise and diet propositioned to me in terms of mental health. I just wish that was presented to people differently.'\nJonah admitted growing up overweight 'intensely f***ed me up,' and inside he still feels like 'a 14-year-old boy who's very overweight and has acne and feels very undesirable to the world.'\n'​​Inherently, at my core, I'm still this unlovable person,' he explained.\n'But the work is inching toward [realising] that it's great to be this person. But that's still very hard.'\nJonah has also talked openly about his mental health, after he revealed in a statement to Deadline in 2022 that he would not be promoting the film, or any of his upcoming movies after realising that public appearances were 'exacerbating' his mental health issues.\n\nIn 2021, Jonah spoke up about struggling as he admitted: 'I don’t think I ever took my shirt off in a pool until I was in my mid 30s even in front of family and friends' (pictured in 2021) \n\nIn 2023 the star discussed his fluctuating weight, he said 'When I was a kid, exercise and diet was framed to me as like, \"There's something wrong with how you look,\"' (pictured in 2024)\n'The whole purpose of making this film is to give therapy and the tools I’ve learned in therapy to a wide audience for private use through an entertaining film,' he explained.\n'Through this journey of self-discovery within the film, I have come to the understanding that I have spent nearly 20 years experiencing anxiety attacks, which are exacerbated by media appearances and public facing events.\n'I can’t wait to share it with audiences around the world in the hope that it will help those struggling, however, you won’t see me out there promoting this film, or any of my upcoming films, while I take this important step to protect myself.\n'If I made myself sicker by going out there and promoting it, I wouldn’t be acting true to myself or to the film.'\nChanning TatumJonah HillBrad Pitt\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJonah Hill's slimming secrets: How the actor left his '14-year-old overweight' self behind for boxing workouts and a Japanese diet as he shocks fans in new slimmed down snaps\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Let me tell you, it ain’t for fun.\nShe continued: 'What do you think I’m doing it for? It’s not to pull a look in bed.\n'He might look like that, but breaking news, even my husband snores.

The court rejected his defence of mistaken identity.\n\nFrom around August 2003, Sudanese government forces and the Janjaweed carried out large-scale attacks on civilians in the Darfur region. This included targeted killings, summary executions, assaults, rapes, theft of livestock and the forced displacement of more than two million people. \n\nThe targets of this violence were mostly communities who shared the ethnicity of various rebel groups, and later other Arab and non-Arab tribes. \n\nIt has taken over 20 years, but the delivery of justice is a major development for international law, for Sudan and for the ICC itself. The case demonstrates that while the wheels of international criminal justice turn slowly, they do turn. \n\nA milestone conviction\n\nThe case marks the first conviction arising out of Darfur, and the first from a referral to the ICC by the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIt was also the first investigation of a non-state party, meaning the accused was from a country that hasn’t signed the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC.\n\nAbd-Al-Rahman (sometimes known as Ali Kushayb or Ali Kosheib) was convicted for crimes committed between August 2003 and March 2004. Human Rights Watch published a report in December 2005 calling for accountability.\n\nThe ICC started investigating in 2005. An arrest warrant for Abd-Al-Rahman was issued that year, and a second one in 2020. He eventually surrendered himself to the ICC’s custody in 2020 and the trial began in 2022. \n\nThere are four other individuals yet to be arrested and tried. Notably, the former president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir (the first sitting president to be indicted by the ICC), is still at large despite warrants for his arrest issued in 2009 and 2010. \n\nAl-Bashir is wanted on five charges of crimes against humanity: murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. He is also accused of genocide, as well as two counts of war crimes, including intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population.\n\nArrest warrants have also been issued for three former government ministers, with reports that one of them, along with al-Bashir, is in military custody in northern Sudan.\n\nJustice for women and girls\n\nWith Sudan not a party to the Rome Statute, the conviction of Abd-Al-Rahman was only possible because the Security Council established an international commission of inquiry on Darfur. This reported that war crimes and crimes against humanity had likely been committed. \n\nThe Security Council then referred the Darfur situation to the prosecutor of the ICC as a threat to international peace and security, with the investigation starting on June 6 2005. A “confirmation of charges” hearing was held in May 2021. \n\nThis is an important precedent. It demonstrates why the Security Council should use its referral power under Article 13(b) of the Rome Statute to send cases to the ICC, even when accused individuals are from states that don’t want anything to do with the court.\n\nThe judges also ruled the attacks caused profound physical, cultural and social harm to women and girl victims. The transcript of the judgment contains harrowing testimony about the Janjaweed’s heinous actions.\n\nThis conviction signals the ICC’s commitment to pursuing justice for girls and women who are brutalised during conflicts. It also fulfils one of the goals of the late Cherif Bassiouni, the international law scholar who helped set up the ICC and pushed for a greater focus on punishing rape and gender-based crimes.\n\nThe ICC under pressure\n\nFinally, this conviction comes at a time when the ICC itself is under significant pressure, internally and externally. \n\nThe court’s chief prosecutor is subject to an internal investigation for sexual misconduct, and the ICC itself was sanctioned by US President Donald Trump in February. \n\nThe US has also issued sanctions against the chief prosecutor and individual judges for investigating US forces in Afghanistan, and for issuing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. \n\nIn August, the US went even further, sanctioning two more judges and two deputy prosecutors. This included Nazhat Shameem Khan, who issued statements on behalf of the court in the Darfur case. \n\nIn August, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the ICC a “national security threat”. The ICC has strongly condemned the sanctions, as have many other organisations and countries.\n\nNonetheless, with Abd-Al-Rahman’s sentencing still to come, the Darfur case represents a much-needed win for international law and for the ICC. For the victims, however, real justice will have to include a comprehensive and funded plan for compensation and rehabilitation.","summary":"It has taken over 20 years, and the ICC is under intense pressure, but this week’s conviction of Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman is a major win for international law.","url":"https://theconversation.com/a-landmark-conviction-for-war-crimes-in-sudan-shows-the-wheels-of-global-justice-do-turn-albeit-slowly-267090","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/695511/original/file-20251009-56-11irsk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=8%2C792%2C5992%2C2996&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 23:52:14","author":"Auckland University of Technology,Myra Williamson,Senior Lecturer in Law","authors":["Auckland University of Technology","Myra Williamson","Senior Lecturer in Law"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.404},{"id":367848774,"title":"Winner of Nobel Peace Prize to be announced in Oslo","text":"STOCKHOLM, October 10. /TASS/. The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in Oslo.\n\nIn recent years, the prize winners have included politicians, human rights defenders, political activists, and humanitarian organizations for their achievements in various fields.\n\nThis year, there are 338 nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize: 244 individuals and 94 organizations. According to media reports, among the nominees are US President Donald Trump, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, the World Health Organization, and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe full list of nominees is kept strictly confidential and will not be made public until 50 years after the awards are presented. Nevertheless, information about certain candidates' nominations is leaked to the media every year by organizations or individuals with the right to nominate.\n\nAbout prize\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize was first awarded in 1901. There have been years when no winner was announced in this category, most recently in 1972. This was due to the World Wars, disagreements among committee members, and a lack of worthy candidates.\n\nThe award ceremony will take place in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.\n\nThis year, the prize will be complemented by 11 million kroner (approximately $1.17 million).\n\nNobel Week began on October 6.

In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become “100% American-owned.”\n\nThe announcement also quotes KNOWiNK’s owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide “election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,” one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists. Almost all U.S. voting equipment already leaves a paper trail.\n\nDominion’s former CEO confirmed the sale in a single-sentence statement on Thursday: “Liberty Vote has acquired Dominion Voting Systems,” John Poulos said.\n\nThe release from the new company vows to reintroduce “hand-marked paper ballots” and adjust company policies to follow Trump’s executive order on voting procedures, which is not in effect because judges have ruled that Trump doesn’t have the power to mandate them. Part of the president’s order sought to prohibit voting equipment that produces a paper record with “a barcode or quick-response code” — equipment that is currently in use in hundreds of counties across 19 states.\n\nDenver-based Dominion was at the heart of some of the most fevered conspiracy theories about Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Those false allegations sparked a number of defamation lawsuits against conservative-leaning media and the president’s allies, including a settlement in 2023 in which Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787 million and one this year that Newsmax settled for $67 million.\n\nThe announcement from the new company does not disclose the cost of the transaction, but a spokesman said all the money was put up by Leiendecker. Both companies involved are privately held.\n\nThe false allegations against Dominion made its brand toxic in many Republican-leaning states and counties. But voting machine companies are usually careful about making overt political statements, given that the market for their equipment is split between places under Republican and Democratic control.\n\nThe statements by Liberty Vote saying it will align with Trump’s executive order, which has been challenged by Democratic state attorneys general, the Democratic National Committee and an array of voting and civil rights groups, could lead to concerns in blue states that currently use Dominion equipment.\n\nBut some election officials said Thursday that KNOWiNK had seemed to steer clear of 2020 conspiracy theories and acted like a typical, nonpartisan firm.\n\n“They have a good reputation in the field,” Stephen Richer, a Republican who was targeted by Trump and his allies when he served as the top elections official in Arizona’s Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix.\n\nDespite years of detailed debunking of the Dominion conspiracy theories, Trump has continued to repeat them even as recently as a few weeks ago, when he vowed to get rid of voting machines. The president doesn’t have the power to do that because the Constitution gives states and Congress the authority to set election and voting rules.","summary":"KNOWiNK said it was changing Dominion Voting's name to Liberty Vote.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/10/09/dominion-voting-sale/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dominion_Voting_Sale_15323.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 23:48:20","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352}]}
