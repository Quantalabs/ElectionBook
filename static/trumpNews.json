Here's What the President-Elect Said During His NBC Interview","text":"In a move signaling the start of his new administration, President-elect Donald Trump said he would issue sweeping pardons to those convicted in connection with the January 6 Capitol Hill protests after outgoing President Joe Biden pardoned his corrupt son, Hunter Biden, despite vowing not to. Trump’s move would fulfill a campaign promise that free those who were politically persecuted by the left. \n\nDuring an interview on “Meet the Press,” host Kristen Welker asked if he had plans to pardon the individuals who entered the Capitol building on January 6, including the more than 900 people who pleaded guilty to a crime.\n\n“I’m going to look at everything. We’ll look at individual cases,” Trump said. “But I’m going to be acting very quickly” within his first 100 days of office. \n\nOn the other hand, Trump said he would not pardon himself. \n\n\"I didn't do anything wrong,\" he said.\n\nHowever, in a surprising twist, the incoming president said he would not pursue legal action against Biden despite the outgoing administration's several legal attacks on Trump over the past few years. \n\nThe incoming 47th president stated that he wants to \"move the country forward\" and focus on \"restoring faith in our institutions,” emphasizing unity over retaliation. \n\nWelker pointed out that Trump’s pick for FBI Director, Kash Patel, has a book of 60 people that he claims is part of the “deep state.” \n\n“It includes Democrats like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. It includes former members of your cabinet, from Bill Barr to Christopher Wray. You campaigned on destroying the deep state. Do you want Kash Patel to launch investigations into people on that list?” Welker asked. \n\nTrump initially responded “no,” saying that he would not direct Patel to go after such members of the Democratic Party. \n\n“Is it your expectation, though, that Kash Patel will pursue investigations against your political enemies?” Welker pressed, to which Trump replied, “No.” \n\nWelker pressed the issue harder, asking specifically if Trump would legally go after Biden and the entire Biden crime family. \n\nHowever, Trump doubled down, saying he wants to make the country successful and not dwell on the past. He added that retribution would come through a prosperous country, not the fact that he turned the tables on the country’s most corrupt politicians.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/08/trump-j6-prisoners-and-biden-heres-what-the-president-elect-said-during-his-nbc-interview-n2648770","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/311/83b85d04-65cb-449d-90b4-f977f9381518.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 01:20:47","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":271591552,"title":"Barry Hirsch: RFK Jr.’s one good idea","text":"Of all of Donald Trump’s policy proposals, the one I find most baffling is his endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plan to overhaul our food industry.\n\n The idea that highly processed, high-calorie fast foods are the major cause of the obesity epidemic seems obvious to everyone. And like cigarette smoking and climate change, the only deniers are those making money from keeping the status quo. Trump loves fast food, so it is hard to believe he is the president who is going to solve this monumental problem.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Trump’s and Republicans’ political philosophy is deregulation (except of course when it comes to abortion, gender-affirming care, voting and books you can read), so it is hard to believe they are going to impose a whole new set of regulations to improve the quality of our food.\n\nOne of the former mayors of New York tried to tax large sugar drinks in an attempt to discourage their consumption and he was lambasted for it and the plan squashed. The idea that the government is going to take on “Big Ag,” which is now owned by a handful of large corporations, and impose regulations on them to produce healthy food that will be less addictive, less profitable, and more expensive is hard to imagine. During the inflation spike one of the biggest complaints was the cost of going to McDonald’s.\n\nThe moment that Trump gave lip service to such a plan I have no doubt that members of Congress were being hounded by lobbyists to kill the RFK Jr. nomination and put an end to these proposals. RFK Jr. supports a lot of crazy and dangerous ideas for which he should not be approved. Ironically, I suspect he will be rejected for the one good idea that he supports.\n\nBarry Hirsch\n\nNorthampton","url":"https://gazettenet.com/Letter-to-the-editor-58314734","image":"https://gazettenet.com//attachments/95/41914095.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 01:06:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":271591212,"title":"Trump says personal lawyer Habba to serve as presidential counselor","text":"President-Elect Donald Trump announced Sunday that his personal lawyer, Alina Habba, will serve as counselor to the president in his upcoming second term.Trump said in a Truth Social post that Habba had shown \"unwavering loyalty\" as part of Trump's legal team across several criminal and civil trials, and called her a \"tireless advocate for justice.\"","url":"https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-832596","image":"https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_537,w_822/534687","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 01:04:47","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.483},{"id":271590934,"title":"Celebrating women who redefined 2024","text":"Celebrating women who redefined 2024 (Photo: Courtesy of each)\n\nIn 2024, women around the world have shattered barriers, broken records and left indelible marks in their fields.

She also overcame controversy in the 5000m event, where she successfully appealed a disqualification to secure her silver medal.\nThe Kenyan star dominated globally, winning at the Diamond League Final and the inaugural Athlos event in New York. Kipyegon’s journey is a tale of unmatched excellence, making her a living legend in athletics.\nBeyond her remarkable achievements on the track, Faith Kipyegon recently added another prestigious honour to her growing list of accomplishments. She was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Education by the University of Eldoret, recognising her contribution to sports and her role as an inspiring figure in Kenya and beyond.\nWawira Njiru\nWawira Njiru’s visionary work as the founder of Food 4 Education has revolutionised the concept of school feeding programs in Kenya. In 2024, her organisation expanded to feed over 450,000 children daily, ensuring that no student had to learn on an empty stomach. She plans to expand the program to feed 1 million children daily by 2027. Her model combines nutrition with technology: parents can pay a minimal fee for nutritious meals using an innovative mobile wallet system called Tap2Eat.\nWawira’s efforts have not only improved school attendance and performance but also reshaped the narrative around childhood hunger in Kenya. Recognised globally, she has received accolades such as the Icon Award, the Global Citizen Prize, the Skoll Award for Social Innovation, the Elevate Prize Award, the Cisco Youth Leadership Award and recognition from the Schwab Foundation. Her story is a shining example of how local solutions can have global impacts, touching lives by addressing systemic issues with practical and scalable solutions.\nLupita Nyong’o\nLupita Nyong’o, known for her Oscar-winning acting, took 2024 by storm not just on screen but as a global cultural icon. She became Chanel’s latest ambassador, the first African to hold the position, symbolising her influence in both fashion and film. Nyong’o also made history as the first African president of the Berlinale jury, influencing some of the most prestigious film decisions globally.\nFrom her critically acclaimed podcast projects to her philanthropic efforts in Kenya, Nyong’o exemplifies the power of using fame to amplify important causes.\nCrystal Asige\nNominated Senator Crystal Asige, an advocate for disability rights, made history as one of two Kenyans named in Time Magazine’s 2024 Time100 Next list. This recognition celebrates leaders shaping the future, and Asige earned her spot for her transformative work in championing equity and accessibility for persons with disabilities.\nHer impactful legislative contributions include pushing for tax breaks for caregivers of children with disabilities and advocating for Kenyan Sign Language support, ensuring inclusivity in governance.

Her achievements inspire a generation of women aiming to balance creativity with entrepreneurship.\nHuldah Momanyi Hiltsley\nHuldah Momanyi Hiltsley made history in 2024 by becoming the first Kenyan-born politician elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives. Representing District 38A, a richly diverse area with a significant African immigrant population, Hiltsley’s win was not just a personal milestone but a breakthrough for representation. Running under the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, she garnered 64.78% of the vote.\nHer campaign resonated with voters through its focus on affordable housing, equitable education, accessible healthcare, and tailored economic opportunities. Hiltsley’s victory is particularly significant given her roots in Kenya’s Nyamira County and her immigrant journey to the United States in the 1990s. As a mother and a graduate of Bethel University, she has dedicated her career to uplifting marginalized voices and fostering inclusivity.\nSouth Africa’s Tyla\nTyla, a South African singer and performer, has cemented her place on the global stage with groundbreaking achievements this year.

Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community.\nAsked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” if he were actively working to end the nearly 3-year-old Ukraine war, Trump said, “I am.”\n\nHe refused to say if he had spoken to Putin since winning the election in November. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by both the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. It also marks Trump’s wading unusually deeply into efforts before his inauguration on Jan. 20 to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.\n\nTrump made his proposal after a weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders in Paris, where many world leaders gathered to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. None of the advisers traveling with him appeared to have expertise on Ukraine.\n\nKyiv would like to close a deal, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\n“There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.”\n\n“I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!” Trump added. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.\n\nZelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but has given no further details.\n\nIn a post Sunday on the Telegram messaging app, Zelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”\n\n“When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Trump’s post by repeating Moscow’s longstanding message that it is open to talks with Ukraine. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that formally declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader.\n\nThat decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, warned there was no such thing as a quick fix to ending Russia’s war with Ukraine.\n\n“What I’m worried about is this kind of flawed idea that Putin can be placated, right, that Putin will come to some kind of a deal,” McMaster told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n“I think it’s really important for President Trump to adhere to his instinct in this connection … peace through strength,” McMaster said, adding, “How about give them what they need to defend themselves, and then saying to Putin, ‘You’re going to lose this war?”‘\n\nWhile Trump has said before that he would like to see a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, his proposal Sunday was framed as a direct appeal to Russia. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.\n\nBoth Trump and Biden administration officials have pointed to Russia’s disengagement in Syria, where the Russian military largely moved out of the way in recent days as Syrian rebels overthrew the country’s Russian-allied president, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russia’s resources.\n\nThe Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce. Ukraine’s allies fear a quick deal would be largely on the terms of its more powerful neighbor, potentially forcing damaging concessions on Ukraine and allowing Russia to resume the war again once it has built back up its military strength.\n\nTrump portrays himself as up to making fast deals to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have frustrated many of the Biden administration’s own mediation efforts.\n\nThere is no prohibition on incoming officials or nominees meeting with foreign officials, and it is common and fine for them to do so — unless those meetings are designed to subvert or otherwise affect current US policy.\n\nThe Logan Act bars private citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.\n\nIn the NBC interview that was taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued US participation in the Western military alliance as a given during his second term.\n\nTrump has long complained that European and the Canadian governments in the mutual-defense bloc are freeloading on military spending by the US, by far the most powerful partner in NATO. NATO and its member governments say a majority of countries in the bloc are now hitting voluntary targets for military spending, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.\n\nAsked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.\n\n“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he said.\n\nBut if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the alliance. Trump responded, “Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.”\n\nTrump expressed the same openness when asked if Ukraine should brace for possible cuts in US aid. “Possibly,” he said.\n\nUS arms and other military support are vital to Ukraine’s efforts to fend off invading Russian forces, and Democratic President Joe Biden has been surging assistance to Ukraine ahead of leaving office.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday announced nearly USD1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine. Austin spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, on Sunday about the status of the war and US military backing, the Pentagon said.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-ukraine/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AP24342676305709.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 01:00:03","author":"Borneo Bulletin Ap Video","authors":["Borneo Bulletin Ap Video"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":271590888,"title":"Exclusive | Trump gushes over Prince William after Paris meeting, saying they had ‘a great talk’","text":"Donald Trump gushed about Prince William’s after their meeting in Paris over the weekend — and said he had “a great talk” with the future king. \n\n“He’s a good looking guy.

According to news agency AP, Trump made his ceasefire proposal after a weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders, claiming in a social media post that Kyiv would like to make a deal to end the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which has now stretched beyond 1,000 days. The Kremlin responded by stating it is open to negotiations, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautioned that any deal would need to ensure a lasting peace. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said both Russia and Ukraine have lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a war that should never have started. He continued, There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin. Too many lives are being needlessly wasted, too many families destroyed. Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to take action to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. His comments followed a meeting with Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, which the Ukrainian President described as constructive, according to AP. On Sunday, Zelenskyy posted on Telegram, saying, When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land. He cautioned that Ukraine needed a just and robust peace, one that Russians will not destroy within a few years. 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, 3.7 lakh injured: Zelenskyy Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated Moscows longstanding position that it is open to talks with Ukraine. He referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022, which declared that talks would be impossible as long as Putin remained in power. This decree came after Putin declared four occupied Ukrainian regions as part of Russia, despite Kyiv and the West condemning this as a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, AP reported. For most of the war, Kyiv has insisted that Russias full withdrawal from internationally recognised Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, is a precondition for peace talks. In a separate update on social media, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine has lost 43,000 soldiers since Russias all-out invasion on February 24, 2022, with 3.7 lakh soldiers wounded. Both Russia and Ukraine have been reluctant to release official casualty figures, but Western officials have noted that recent months of intense positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have resulted in record losses for both sides. Trump has previously called for a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, but his latest proposal is more pressing. The swift reactions from both Ukraine and Russia show the seriousness with which they regard the idea, especially coming from the incoming American president. The Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have refrained from urging an immediate truce, fearing that such a deal would likely favour Moscow, forcing damaging concessions on Ukraine and possibly enabling Russia to rebuild its military and resume the war. In a separate interview aired on a news channel on Sunday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies, stating that he did not see continued US participation in the Western military alliance as a given during his second term. Trump has long criticised European and Canadian governments for freeloading on military spending, despite the US being the most powerful member of NATO. However, the organisation and its member governments say that a majority of countries in the bloc are now hitting voluntary targets for military spending, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term. When asked if he would consider pulling the US out of NATO, Trump said, If theyre paying their bills, and if I think theyre treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely Id stay with NATO. He added, But if not... absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

But Mr Yoon “has not and by law, cannot, cede power to anyone” except through resignation, impeachment or election, said a senior government source familiar with the discussions inside Mr Yoon’s office. \n\nMr Yoon exercised his role as president on Dec 8 by accepting the resignation of his home minister, Mr Lee Sang-min.\n\nOpposition groups immediately complained that Mr Han was overreaching: trying to use the power vacuum created by Mr Yoon’s ill-fated imposition of martial law and the ensuing turmoil to establish himself as the top leader in the governing camp.\n\n“We have a situation where the President cannot make decisions, he cannot give guidelines, he cannot give orders,” said Seoul National University’s political science professor Kang Won-taek. \n\n“Although we have a president, we are in a state of anarchy.”\n\nThe result was deepening political uncertainty on Dec 8, as South Koreans wondered who was in charge of their government, including its military, at a time when South Korea faces multiple foreign policy challenges. \n\nThose include North Korea’s growing nuclear threat and the delicate diplomacy needed in its alliance with the US as the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump looms.\n\nAt home, thousands of young doctors have been on strike for nearly a year to protest Mr Yoon’s planned changes to healthcare policy. Militant labour unions have vowed to escalate strikes until Mr Yoon is impeached. \n\nThe country also faces a slowing economy, mounting household debt, low birthrates, unaffordable housing prices and a host of other intractable problems.\n\nThe martial law order lasted only six hours from late Dec 3 until the National Assembly voted against it early on Dec 4, forcing Mr Yoon to back down. But it prompted waves of protests and calls for his resignation or impeachment.","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/after-failed-martial-law-south-koreans-ask-whos-in-charge","image":"2024-12-08T073340Z311164756RC27KBA47O57RTRMADP3SOUTHKOREA-POLITICS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 00:52:47","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":271589238,"title":"'Zelenskyy ready for peace': Trump spills the tea over his meetings with world leaders","text":"The newly elected US President Donald Trump indicated that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is ready for \"peace\" whilst spilling the tea about his interactions with international leaders and Jill Biden during his Notre Dame visit in Paris.On Sunday, Trump shared insights from his initial overseas journey since securing a second term, which included discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron and Zelenskyy in a three-way meeting.\"He wants to make peace,\" Trump told The New York Post via telephone. \"That's new.\"\"He wants to have a ceasefire,\" he continued. \"He wants to make peace.

Russian state media later reported that Assad arrived in Moscow, where he is seeking asylum. Celebrations broke out across Syria over the weekend, with statues depicting his father and predecessor, Hafez al-Assad, pulled down from their pedestals. But in the West, there is nervousness about the rebel Islamist group that led the assault, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which has historic ties to Al Qaeda and is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. It has recently appeared to renounce more extremist elements. Hassan Abdul-Ghani, HTS’ senior commander, said in a post on WhatsApp: “To the displaced people around the world, Free Syria awaits you.” President Joe Biden lauded the regime’s fall Sunday, saying this is \"a moment of historic opportunity for the long-suffering people of Syria to build a better future for their proud country.\" He outlined continued U.S. involvement in Syria, including in the transition process led by the U.N.

President-elect Trump sits down for his first postelection broadcast interview President-elect Donald Trump said he is looking to pardon supporters involved in the attacks on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as soon as his first day in office, saying those incarcerated are “living in hell.” In an exclusive interview with NBC News’ “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, he also said that he will not seek to turn the Justice Department on his political foes and that some members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack “should go to jail.” Trump said he would leave decisions to Pam Bondi, whom he has said he will nominate for attorney general, about whether to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two separate federal cases against Trump that were dropped after the election. “I’m not looking to go back into the past,” Trump said when asked he was whether he would go after outgoing President Joe Biden. “I’m looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success.” Throughout the interview, he discussed the major policy priorities for his second term and made several false, misleading or exaggerated claims along the way.

The anonymous accuser, identified only as “Jane Doe,” said the assault happened after she was driven to an MTV Video Music Awards afterparty. The lawsuit was originally filed in October in the Southern District of New York, listing Combs as a defendant. It was refiled Sunday to include Carter. “These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!

Earlier Saturday, Yoon apologized for his actions in a brief nationally televised address, saying he regrets causing “anxiety and inconvenience to the public.” The six-hour declaration ignited public anger against him and calls for his removal from office. “I will not evade the legal and political responsibility regarding this declaration of martial law,” Yoon continued. Opposition lawmakers had said that if the impeachment motion didn’t pass, they would come back to it Wednesday.

A Charge d’Affaires is not an ambassador and there is a limit to the people he/she can interact with in the host foreign ministry. Therefore, our level of representation is not right.\n\n“Some people have spoken about paucity of funds to appoint and send ambassadors abroad. I don’t buy this argument. It is possible that the foreign ministry does not command the attention it deserves. I personally believe that if Nigeria cares, it can effectively fund the ministry and the diplomatic missions abroad.\n\n“The delay in appointing ambassadors is definitely negative on career diplomats, who will lose out because they may have less than two years to retire. This is not fair to such career diplomats. In most countries, the foreign ministry is the number one ministry. But in Nigeria, it is not so. Why? Only the government can answer this question.”\n\nHow Nigeria is missing out — Amb Amedu-Ode\n\nSpeaking on the issue, Amb Ogbole Amedu-Ode, former spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who served as ambassador in China, Mexico and Indonesia, said: “The non-appointment and deployment of principal envoys at the ambassadorial level to man key Nigerian diplomatic missions has dragged on for more than a year.\n\n“On the surface, it does not look like it matters because governance is a continuum, in the sense that governance in the area of diplomacy is structured in such a way that in the absence of the substantive head, there will always be someone to act, in this case the Charge d’Affaires ad interim (CDA).\n\n“However, after the recall of the principal envoys late last year, it is expected that by now, their successors would have assumed watch in the various missions but that is not the case right now.\n\n“As I stated earlier, it might not seem to matter. But in the strict hierarchical order of the world of diplomacy, seniority in rank or position counts a lot. And this is where Nigeria may be missing out!“For example, in PBAT’s very recent state visit to France and the visit to South Africa, it is pertinent that substantive heads of mission are on the ground in order to be granted the level of courtesies that are required in an outing such as a state visit.\n\n“At the level of career diplomats, who have come of age and are expecting their maiden outing as ambassadors, the delay is impinging on their morale and, therefore, productivity. For them, time is of the essence to fulfill their career objective.”\n\nWithout ambassadors, Nigeria’ll gain little or nothing from bilateral agreementsOne of the recently recalled ambassadors, who spoke anonymously, shared the same views.He averred that other countries would reap more from the bilateral agreements that President Tinubu has signed.\n\nHis words: “Diplomacy is pretense. They won’t tell you that the absence of ambassadors will hurt you. They will take advantage of it. For instance, Nigeria has no ambassador in South Africa, France, China to follow-up on the bilateral agreements President Tinubu is signing. ‘’Charge d’Affairs are level 12 officers, they cannot do the work of an ambassador. They cannot relate with presidents. They cannot see any officer higher than a director in any diplomatic gathering.\n\n“France has an ambassador in Abuja. He will come to follow up on French interests. It is France that will benefit from the agreements that President Tinubu signed with President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n“In the USA, President-elect, Donald Trump, will take over in January. Customarily, after taking over, Trump will meet with ambassadors. Nigeria will miss out because that first meeting of Trump with the diplomatic community is critical.\n\n“At diplomatic fora, ambassadors sit in order of seniority based on how they arrived. The oldest becomes the Dean of Ambassadors. Those who resume last take the last seats.\n\n“An ambassador can go to the prime minister and arrange meetings and other engagements for the president. CDAs can’t arrange such meetings. It means Nigeria has down-graded her representation and it will affect our foreign policy.\n\n“To recover lost grounds, President Tinubu should appoint people of high calibre, competent diplomats and technocrats as ambassadors. Diplomacy is a very complex process, we don’t need those who will come to learn on the job or those with controversial profiles because they may be rejected.\n\n‘’Some of the new ambassadors may spend only a year because agreement takes about seven months.“No ambassador resumes duty without agreement. As every country does, the way out is to put forward your nominees, security agencies will screen them, and they go to the Senate for confirmation. The ministry of foreign affairs will send letters of agreement to the countries they are being posted to and ask, ‘do you agree?’\n\n“The other countries will start their own investigations. Sometimes, agreement takes between six and eight months. The least is two months for African countries because they will ask their security agencies to carry out thorough screening as ambassadors enjoy immunity.\n\n“Sometimes, they will screen your children. The other countries allow their serving ambassadors to serve while doing the agreement so that if the outgoing ambassador leaves this week, another ambassador will come in next week because the appointing country does not have control over agreement.”New ambassadors may be announced this week\n\nHowever, Vanguard gathered that barring last-minute changes, President Tinubu may announce new ambassadors this week.\n\n“The list has been submitted. Security operatives have carried out background checks on the nominees and gave some of them a clean bill of health,” a presidency source said.\n\nAsked what is responsible for the delay and when new ambassadors would be appointed, Mr. Alkassim Abdulkadir, the Special Assistant to the Minister of Foreign of Affairs, told Vanguard on phone: “The appointment of ambassadors is the prerogative of the president. When appointed, they represent Nigeria and policies of the government of Nigeria.\n\n“The list of political and career ambassadors for appointment has been compiled and sent to the president. We are waiting for the president to forward the list to the National Assembly for screening and confirmation.”\n\nRecalled ambassadors’ve been paid passages\n\nOn claims that some recalled ambassadors were still being owed their AIEs, Abdulkadir said: “To the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any unpaid passages. All outstanding passages have been paid.”However, while some ambassadors said they had been paid, others said they were yet to be paid.\n\nOne of those who claimed he had not been paid, said: “The request for payment of passages is there but I am yet to be paid. It is a small amount, ranging from N2million to N4million, depending on the number of dependents.”\n\nNo appointments made — FG\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a warning to the public, urging them to disregard a fake list of ambassadorial nominees circulating on social media.\n\nThe Ministry, in a statement by its spokesperson, Kimiebi Ebienfa, clarified that no ambassadorial appointments have been made.\n\nIt emphasised that the appointment of ambassadors is solely the responsibility of the President.\n\nThe statement reads: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform the general public to kindly disregard the fake list of ambassadorial nominees which is currently in circulation on some social media platforms.\n\n“The ministry wishes to state unequivocally that the appointment of ambassadors is the prerogative of Mr President, and no such appointments have been made in that regard. The purported list should, therefore, be discountenanced.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2024/12/how-non-appointment-of-ambassadors-is-hurting-nigeria-envoys/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-22.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 00:34:47","author":"Idowu Bankole","authors":["Idowu Bankole"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":271586352,"title":"India flags concern over trade lines, potential Chinese product dumping in Oman FTA talks","text":"New Delhi: India has raised concerns that China could use Oman to dump goods into the Indian market, even as talks on a free trade agreement (FTA) with the West Asian nation have resulted in an agreement on over 200 trade lines, two people aware of the matter said.However, Oman wants to expand the agreement to about 500 trade lines, but Indian, it is understood, are not in favour of the move.Talks on the long-pending trade agreement, officially known as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), were completed in March. the agreement has hit a deadlock as Oman has requested revisions to India’s market access offer for specific products.Also read | Department of Commerce welcomes resumption of FTA talks between India, UK\"The West Asian country remains firm on its demand for market access to a range of additional products, which cannot be included in the list under the agreed terms of reference,\" the first person mentioned above said, requesting anonymity.The proposed pact aims to eliminate duties on key products, including petroleum, textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and iron and steel, thereby fostering trade ties and economic cooperation.Third export destinationWhile Oman is India’s third-largest export destination among Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, more than 80% of Indian exports to Oman attract an average 5% import duty.Oman’s import duties range from 0% to 100%, along with other specific duties.A 100% duty applies to certain meats, wines, and tobacco products.The FTA is also expected to help Oman diversify its economy away from oil exports by granting preferential access to Indian goods and services.\"India sees an immediate benefit from finalizing the FTA with Oman in the establishment of manufacturing units dedicated to exporting green products,\" the second person mentioned above said.Also read | India and Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union to start FTA talks soon\"This move is aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM),\" the person added, referring to the looming EU tax on embedded carbon emissions in products such as steel and aluminium.

So it was a surprise when they opted to take something of a U-turn this week.\n\nUnlike the satirical route, like they went with on President-elect Donald Trump winning the election, as my colleague Bob Hogue wrote about, for this week's elephant in the room--President Joe Biden's pardoning son Hunter-- the writers reached back to resurrect one of the long-running program's funniest characters--\"Church Chat\" host, the Church Lady. If you aren't familiar with it (not every reader is a Gen Xer or older, after all), the school marm-esque, holier-than-thou, Christian talk show host character sits down with several guests from either politics or entertainment/pop culture.\n\nOh yeah, and by the way (couldn't resist!), former SNL castmate Dana Carvey, who's been portraying Biden this season, played the character during the 1986-1990 seasons. (I think the only other appearance was for \"Saturday Night Live\"s 15th anniversary special in May 2016.)\n\nSNL Alumnus in the Spotlight:\n\nAs I mentioned, SNL, after nearly four years, has finally included Hunter Biden in a sketch. \n\nThe Church Lady's \"program\" this time is a \"year in review\" for 2024, with the usual mix of hot topics predominating. And while the part with Yankees free agent Juan Soto was slightly funnier than the mean-spirited bit on former GOP congressman Matt Gaetz (played by cast regulars Marcello Hernandez and Sarah Sherman, respectively), it was the third guest who won the most laughs.\n\nListen for the two rounds of cheering/applause from the audience--one that is likely cued by a sign, and the second one of delight in recognition of who is playing Hunter, former cast member and actor/comedian, David Spade.\n\nNow, for my money, Spade truly brings it here, drawing genuine laughs with his take on \"Hunter\" (a very tone-down character for someone who is known for playing things up as brash and...loud).\n\nIt's also great to see Carvey flourishing in his guest gig at 30 Rock, and getting more of a leash to take part in sketches beyond just Biden.\n\nThis might not be of interest to everyone, but I think it makes a nice bonus: What's cool about this sketch is that both Carvey and Spade dropped veiled hints that the Church Lady might appear, during their \"Fly on the Wall\" podcast this week. (Warning: During the podcast (linked above), the duo delves into some adult topics/sometimes uses coarse language.)\n\nAnd sure, they did throw out a tone deaf, unfunny joke about President-elect Trump at the end, but as The Church Lady might say to whichever member of the woke cast wrote it, \"We like ourselves, don't we?\"\n\nYou can watch the full sketch below:\n\nRead related: MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart Offers Most Comical Reason Yet Why Hunter Biden Pardon Was 'Justified","url":"https://redstate.com/beccalower/2024/12/08/snl-takes-a-jab-at-hunter-biden-as-former-cast-member-surprise-visit-with-dana-carveys-church-lady-n2182963","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/44/7c451b30-572d-4926-9281-6927f4acee19.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-09 00:10:48","author":"Becca Lower","authors":["Becca Lower"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.242},{"id":271584172,"title":"Trump extols the power of tariffs, reiterates threat to impose them on Canada during NBC interview","text":"Donald Trump is reiterating his threat to impose steep tariffs on Canadian goods if the federal government doesn't take action on border security — and a former official from his first administration says the U.S. president-elect isn't bluffing.\n\n\"I'm a big believer in tariffs. I think tariffs are the most beautiful word....

The president-elect joked about the saga in his NBC interview.\n\n\"In fact, [Trudeau] flew to Mar-a-Lago within about 15 seconds after the call,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president-elect also said he told Trudeau that Canada has to \"close up\" its border and that \"drugs are pouring in at levels never seen before.\"\n\n\"And I said to the president of Mexico and to Justin Trudeau, if it doesn't stop, I'm going to put tariffs on your country at about 25 per cent,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's threat is 'serious,' says former official\n\nKen Cuccinelli, a former official in the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first administration, said the president-elect's tariff threat is \"very serious\" given the issues at hand.\n\n\"And I think one of the things that people around the world know about Donald Trump is that he will follow through with things like this,\" Cuccinelli said in an interview on Rosemary Barton Live that aired Sunday.\n\nWhen asked what he thinks can be done to protect the Canada-U.S. border, Cuccinelli said that he \"wouldn't expect the president to give the prime minister a checklist.\"\n\nThe goal isn't \"zero illegal crossings,\" he added.

After all, he wants the United States to be important, to be great. The transatlantic partnership makes America also greater. Sometimes people say we are the only beneficiaries, but that's not true. \n\n“If you look at the map of the world and the sheer dimension of challenges, there are very good reasons for the United States of America to need Europe and the European part of the transatlantic partnership.\"\n\nThe former German chancellor also spoke at length about Russian president Vladimir Putin who she accused of not understanding the “boom of freedom”.\n\nMs Merkel said that Russians “do not have a good life under his leadership” and she wished for them “a democratic and prosperous future.”\n\nShe reminisced: “I very often thought about how we can bring democracy to Russia.\n\n“For example, the privatisation pursued by the United States, where certain shares were given to everyone, allowing people to participate in wealth. Most people at the time, however, used it to make quick money and then spent the money or gave the shares away. This led to a huge concentration of property rights, which actually prevented the development of a proper middle class, perhaps with smaller businesses, for example, to thrive.”\n\nLooking at the war in Ukraine and the wider problems of Putin’s agressive foreign policy, she said it was because he had been angered by the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia’s diminished power after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nMs Merkel noted: “Putin is somebody who, as a president, was seen by the Russians to lead them out of chaos, out of this superiority through the oligarchs, the fact that the economy was collapsing by transitioning it to a market economy. \n\n“They wanted people to get their wages, to work against inflation, where not everything is eaten up by 50 to 60 percent of inflation. And Putin, and I think that's something that he was actually quite clear about from the beginning, this incredible sentence that he said, the worst event to him of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union. And I said, quite frankly, 'I thought Nazism and National Socialism was the worst event of the 20th century'?. \n\nShe went on: “He wanted to turn Russia into an important power again. That was what he was after all the time. And I think he didn't know that much about economy, about economic prosperity. So very quickly, he resorted to restoring this strength with methods he had learned as a KGB agent. He was actually able to domesticate, if you like, the oligarchs, to tame them.

The world is waiting!”\n\nAppearing on Meet The Press, on NBC News, Sky News’ US partner, he was asked if he was actively working to end the near three-year-old conflict, and replied, “I am.”\n\nMr Trump restated that he was open to reducing US military aid to Ukraine. Asked if the country should prepare for possible cuts in US aid, he said: “Possibly.”\n\nSimilarly, he again warned the US could quit NATO if other member states failed to increase their contributions but said: “If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO.”\n\nAsked if he would consider pulling the US out of the alliance if that wasn’t the case, he responded: “Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.”\n\nHe wouldn’t confirm if he had spoken to Russia’s leader since winning the election in November because he said he didn’t want “to do anything that could impede the negotiation”.\n\nThe former president’s call for an immediate ceasefire goes further than anything incumbent president Joe Biden has said.\n\nIt’s his clearest effort so far to resolve one of the world’s major crises before taking office on 20 January and contrasts with the Biden administration, which has made a point of not being seen to press Kyiv for an immediate truce.\n\nMr Trump’s latest intervention comes the day after he held talks with both the Ukraine president and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron in Paris.\n\nThe trio joined other world leaders in the city for the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral after the devastating fire of 2019.\n\nMr Zelenskyy described his weekend discussions with Mr Trump as “constructive” but on Sunday he warned in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years”.\n\nA workable peace with Russia must be underpinned by “effective peace guarantees”, he said, adding that Ukrainians “want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land”.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Moscow’s oft-stated position that it is open to talks with Ukraine.\n\nRead more:Assad given asylum in RussiaTrump praises ‘fantastic’ Prince WilliamFirst mass at rebuilt Notre-Dame\n\nWashington has been increasing support to Ukraine and on Saturday, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin announced nearly $1bn (£784m) more in weapons.\n\nIn a separate social media update on Sunday, Mr Zelenskyy claimed Kyiv has so far lost 43,000 soldiers since the invasion began in February 2022, while a further 370,000 have been injured.\n\nWestern officials have said the past few months of grinding positional warfare in eastern Ukraine have meant record losses for both sides, with tens of thousands killed and injured each month.","summary":"Donald Trump has urged Vladimir Putin to reach an immediate settlement to end the war in Ukraine, saying it was the Russian president&#8217;s &#8220;time to act&#8221;.

And it paid off: 85% of the congressional candidates supported by the industry won their races. One crypto executive told 60 Minutes the success was not just because of the enormous amount of money the industry spent on ads. It was also because people they described as \"crypto voters\" turned out to cast their ballots.\"I think those who don't believe there are passionate people about crypto are not paying attention to how significant this industry is already, today,\" said Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, whose cryptocurrency XRP is one of the largest in the world.Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are not controlled by a country or financial institution. They run on a blockchain, a secure, decentralized virtual ledger that keeps track of every transaction.Crypto-backed super PAC Fairshake likely wouldn't exist if not for SEC Chair Gensler's actions, Ripple CEO saysIndustry research shows that people who own cryptocurrency tend to be young, racially diverse, and see cryptocurrency as a way to gain more freedom over their financial lives. Overall, they agree that the industry needs clearer regulations and want candidates who are open to emerging technologies.The voter base is growing and, apparently, up for grabs: While they support policies favorable to the industry, cypto voters don't have a unified position on which party will best deliver them. Most industry research shows crypto owners are at an almost even split between support for the Republican and Democratic parties. To help them make sense of which candidate to back, the advocacy organization Stand With Crypto assigns politicians grades based on statements they've made about the industry. President-elect Donald Trump received an A grade. After calling bitcoin \"a scam,\" in 2021, Trump has since embraced the industry. In September, he announced his new cryptocurrency business, a new crypto platform called World Liberty Financial. This week, Trump announced he will appoint former PayPal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his \"White House A.I. & Crypto Czar,\" a move that highlights Trump's desire to boost the crypto industry.John Reed Stark, a former chief of internet enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, is critical of crypto. He told 60 Minutes he owns no cryptocurrency but understands those who do. \"They have a mammoth distrust of financial institutions. And they love the edginess of the culture,\" Stark said. \"And I think those people do vote. And I think that's another aspect of where these crypto PACs just executed a brilliant strategy, because they really tapped into that.\"Crypto cash helped propel allies to victory during the 2024 election. Here's how it might impact Washington.Stark said the appeal of cryptocurrency traces back to the financial crisis and the lack of trust in institutions. But he maintains that cryptocurrency is dangerous.\"I think it's fair to say, 'I don't trust institutions.' I don't either,\" Stark said. \"But that doesn't mean let's put a worse one in place.\"Whether or not voters knew the ins and outs of crypto is up for debate. The industry was not overt in making a crypto connection in its ads, regardless if they were for or against a candidate. For example, Democrat Rep. Katie Porter in California had criticized cryptocurrency mining in a letter she co-signed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a known crypto skeptic. When Porter then ran for Senate during this year's primary, every negative ad attacking her was funded by crypto, according to the Washington Post. Some of those ads simply called her a \"a fake,\" a \"liar\" and a \"bully.\"Overall in this year's election, the crypto industry backed 29 Republicans and 33 Democrats. The biggest crypto industry super PAC that financed these candidates is called Fairshake, which was started, in part, by Ripple.Big crypto spent big money to reshape the political landscapeFairshake spent $131 million on ads supporting pro-crypto candidates this election cycle, and it already has another $103 million to spend on pro-crypto candidates in the mid-term elections in two years. But none of the television ads that Fairshake put out and paid for this year mentioned crypto, including those against Porter.Ripple CEO Garlinghouse told 60 Minutes that, even if Fairshake did not directly mention crypto, the commercials were still educating voters. Stark was not so sure. \"All of these elected officials were very clear in their supporting of crypto,\" he said. \"Whether people understood that or not, I don't know.\"The video above was produced by Brit McCandless Farmer and edited by Scott Rosann.","summary":"A leading cryptocurrency executive told 60 Minutes crypto's success was not just because of the enormous amount of money the industry spent on ads.

Mystifying to some and mesmerizing to others, they're used for transactions and as high-risk investments with potentially high rewards. At least 17 million Americans own crypto, and how the industry should be regulated in the U.S. has been the subject of much dispute. With an important piece of legislation now before Congress, perhaps it's no surprise that big crypto companies were among the top donors in this past election. And since the election, the price of Bitcoin has hit record highs. It isn't clear whether the crypto industry will get Congress or the incoming Trump administration to craft the regulation or the legitimacy that they seek. But they've been investing a whole lot of their own cash to get something….In the final months of a hotly contested race for a Senate seat in Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno received $40 million of positive ads from a political action committee known as a super PAC.The ads didn't mention cryptocurrency at all, but they were paid for by crypto companies. and they helped Moreno defeat Democrat Sherrod Brown…… the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and an outspoken critic of crypto.Crypto-backed super PAC Fairshake likely wouldn't exist if not for SEC Chair Gensler's actions, Ripple CEO saysMargaret Brennan: In a close election that kinda money makes a huge difference, particularly in the end of a cycle. Do you think you tipped the scales?Brad Garlinghouse: Do I think that putting that amount of money in the Ohio election had an impact? Absolutely. Brad Garlinghouse is the CEO of a company called Ripple, whose cryptocurrency XRP became the third-largest in the world this past week. Ripple and two other companies contributed $144 million to super PACs that supported pro-crypto Republicans and Democrats. Brad Garlinghouse: Do I think we had an impact to elect a Democratic senator in Michigan-- Elissa -- Slotkin? Yes, absolutely. Do I think we had an impact in Arizona? A Democratic senator in Arizona, Gallego, absolutely. Overall, crypto companies contributed one-third of all direct corporate contributions to super PACs. Of the 29 Republicans and 33 Democrats the industry backed in congressional races, 85% won.Brad Garlinghouse: It's incredible.Margaret Brennan: So you see this election as a major victory?Brad Garlinghouse: For sure.Margaret Brennan: But some people will look at that and say, \"You teamed up and bought an election.\" Brad Garlinghouse: At the end of the day, voters voted. We-- we-- we educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates.Margaret Brennan: But you helped supercharge the candidates with the money in the coffers, right, on whatever it is--Brad Garlinghouse: We absolutely did.Margaret Brennan: --they wanted to talk about.Brad Garlinghouse: That's absolutely right.Margaret Brennan: So, in your mind, is the message for any lawmaker looking to run for office that they have to take your industry seriously? Fear your industry?Brad Garlinghouse: I think all citizens should want people in Congress, in the Senate and the House, who are going to look to how do we use technologies in ways to benefit citizens. But the best news for the crypto industry came at the top of the ticket.Crypto cash helped propel allies to victory during the 2024 election. Here's how it might impact Washington.Margaret Brennan: Before this cycle, in June of 2021, Donald Trump was saying, \"Bitcoin seems like a scam.\" Do you understand what happened with that transformation?Brad Garlinghouse: I didn't have a front-row seat to that. I think it's clear that Donald Trump embraced crypto and crypto embraced Donald Trump.Three weeks before the election, Trump announced the launch of a new digital coin that he had a financial stake in. Margaret Brennan: Is that a conflict of interest in your point of view?Brad Garlinghouse: Whether or not it's a conflict of interest, the voters have knowingly said, \"We want this person to be our president. The voters have spoken more so than I have.Trump's Cabinet picks have had very positive things to say about crypto. Here's what his choice for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Fox Business News…Bessent on Fox Business News: \"Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay\"Perhaps most significantly, this past week Trump selected a new head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Paul Atkins – a former SEC commissioner who's done some consulting for crypto companies, is expected to take a very different approach than Biden-era Chair Gary Gensler, who filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto companies. Last year, Gensler told the House Financial Services Committee ….Gensler: \"I've never seen a field that's so non-compliant with laws written by Congress\"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the SEC's approach was the main reason his company and two others created the biggest industry super PAC, called Fairshake.Brad Garlinghouse: People are like, \"Wh-- why did-- why did these companies come together and organize and say, 'This matters'\"? And-- it-- it's a reaction to a war on crypto.Margaret Brennan: So if the-- if there had been a different SEC chair than Gary Gensler--Brad Garlinghouse:I'm not sure Fairshake would exist.Margaret Brennan: Really?Brad Garlinghouse: I'm-- absolutely.In response, an SEC spokesperson said: \"any amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense or influence peddling pales in comparison to the savings lost by crypto investors to frauds and failures.\"John Reed Stark: It was definitely a war on crypto.John Reed Stark, former chief of internet enforcement at the SEC, says he owns no cryptocurrency and has never worked for the industry. Like Garlinghouse, he believes voters have given President-elect Trump a mandate to govern.John Reed Stark: As far as these election results are concerned, the clear mandate is the SEC needs to lay off crypto And that's exactly what's gonna happen.But that doesn't mean this former SEC official thinks the agency's actions were wrong.Who were the 2024 election's \"crypto voters\"?John Reed Stark: crypto is a scourge. It's not something that you want in your society. It has no utility. it's just pure speculation. Remember, there's no balance sheet to crypto. There's no financial statements. Margaret Brennan: You're talkin' about SEC filings. There's no public disclosure mandate.John Reed Stark: Exactly. Nothing. But also there's no audit, inspection, examination, net capital requirements-- no licensure of the individuals involved. And there's no transparency into it. that creates real systemic risk, not just risk for investors But the other part that people don't really talk about enough are the dire externalities that are enabled by crypto.Margaret Brennan: What do you mean?John Reed Stark: Every single crime you can conceive of is easier to do now because of crypto, especially ransomware, human sex trafficking—sanctions evasion, money laundering. North Korea is financing their nuclear weapons program using crypto.Sam Bankman-Fried's conviction for fraud at one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world is a case study of what can happen without proper oversight. Based in the Bahamas, the FTX exchange collapsed in 2022, imperiling $8 billion of customer assets, much of it beyond the reach of U.S. regulators. Margaret Brennan: There were crimes there. There was fraud there.Brad Garlinghouse: I view that as not t-- dissimilar than if we say Bernie Madoff went to jail, that doesn't make every hedge fund manager-- a criminal.Margaret Brennan: Of course--Brad Garlinghouse: The-- there's a lotta good actors in crypto.Ripple's CEO says his company employs 900 people and has been working with regulated financial institutions to create a faster and cheaper way for people to send money overseas. XRP is the digital currency it uses to do that. But Ripple also sold the digital currency XRP to investors, and XRP now trades on exchanges, where people can buy or sell it in the hope of making a profit.Margaret Brennan: So the SEC sued your company in December of 2020. That was the tail end of the Trump administration. Why?Brad Garlinghouse: Well, their allegation was that Ripple and our sales of XRP represented the sale of an unregistered security. Margaret Brennan: A security like a stock or another asset class?Brad Garlinghouse: Correct.Garlinghouse says Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC in court, arguing that the digital currency XRP shouldn't be subject to the agency's registration and disclosure requirements, as if it were a stock offering.Brad Garlinghouse: I went to Harvard Business School. I think I'm reasonably intelligent about something like, \"What is a security?\" So never once had I considered the possibility-- that, \"Okay, maybe XRP's a security.\"John Reed Stark: I've read every case. I've read every motion. And judges have said over, and over again that these are securities. And they haven't said it like, \"This is a close call.\" They said, \"This is an obvious call.\"Brad Garlinghouse disputes that. He also argues that existing securities laws don't fit well with the new technology, and Congress needs to draft new rules for these new digital assets.Brad Garlinghouse: We haven't been asking to be deregulated. We've been asking to be regulated. So we have been saying, \"Hey, look, just give us clear rules of the road.\"Margaret Brennan: So w-- what was your strategy with putting money to work in the election? Was it to then go write those rules of the road that you want written?Brad Garlinghouse: No. Our-- our goal has been to simply get rules written. I mean, the-- the good news is there was–Margaret Brennan: I mean, not just any rules.Brad Garlinghouse: Well, th-- there was-- a bill passed this summer-- in the House, bipartisan support called FIT21.Margaret Brennan: Uh-huh.Brad Garlinghouse: it was a Republican bill. Seventy-one Democrats supported it.FIT21 tries to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets. While the SEC will still play a role, the legislation gives more responsibility for regulating cryptocurrencies to the CFTC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees futures markets for everything from gold to pork bellies…and already has some jurisdiction over bitcoin.John Reed Stark: the SEC is about-- maybe ten times the size of the CFTC. The SEC's mandate is one of investor protection. They have legions of attorneys who go out and do these inspections, examinations, and audits. The CFTC is more about the integrity of the marketplace. I don't blame the crypto industry for wanting to be under the CFTC. It's a much easier regulatory regime.Margaret Brennan: It had bipartisan support, and it passed the House.John Reed Stark: Doesn't surprise me at all that it has the support it has because--Margaret Brennan: Why?John Reed Stark: It doesn't pay for a member of Congress or the Senate, whoever you're talking about, doesn't pay for them to be (laugh) anti-crypto. There's no-- there's no one that's gonna give them contributions because of thatLawmakers from both parties told us crypto firms will not escape scrutiny, since there are consumer protections in the bill. And while it's not clear whether republican leaders will reintroduce FIT21 in the new Congress, there is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to plug regulatory gaps and prevent confusion in a market that already exists.Brad Garlinghouse: Where is the United States better served? Are we served by creating clear rules of the road and having this industry thrive here at home? Or should we push it offshore where people are less protected?Margaret Brennan: But even some of the big financial names on Wall Street have been skeptical of crypto. Jamie Dimon called it pet rock Brad Garlinghouse: There are big skeptics I think anytime a new technology, a new industry-- emerges. The counter to what you're describing is the most successful ETF ever in the United States--Margaret Brennan: Exchange-traded fund.Brad Garlinghouse: --was the Bitcoin ETF. The Bitcoin ETF went live I think in January of this year, and attracted more assets in-- in a f-- s-- faster amount of time than any ETF ever before.Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, are like mutual funds. Offered by well-known investment firms and big banks, they make it easy for people to invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies without directly buying it themselves. Even Jamie Dimon's bank offers clients investments in these assets he once described as pet rocks. John Reed Stark: Am I surprised that these big banks have gotten into the crypto space? No, because there's huge amounts of money to be made in fees. Margaret Brennan: Do you think that everyday people who want to make money in the crypto space understand the risk that they assume?Brad Garlinghouse: I think many people understand it's a volatile market. And I think many people, you know, choose to participate. Many people choose to participate in the gambling market, also very risky. Should we, as-- a government, tell people how they should and shouldn't use the-- their hard-earned money?With the value of Ripple's XRP currency up more than 300% since the election, Brad Garlinghouse recently announced the company was putting another $25 million into the industry super PAC Fairshake. With that donation, Fairshake already has $103 million to spend on pro-crypto candidates in the mid-term elections two years from now.Produced by Andy Court.

Of the 29 Republicans and 33 Democrats the industry backed, 85% won. Garlinghouse sees it as a major victory.\"People are like, \"Why did these companies come together and organize and say, 'This matters'?\" Garlinghouse said. \"And it's a reaction to a war on crypto.\"A war on crypto Garlinghouse said the Securities and Exchange Commission's approach to the crypto industry inspired Ripple and two other companies to form Fairshake, an industry super PAC, in 2023. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who will step down from his post on Jan. 20, led the federal government's crackdown on the crypto industry. As SEC chair, Gensler filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto companies.Crypto-backed super PAC Fairshake likely wouldn't exist if not for SEC Chair Gensler's actions, Ripple CEO saysThe SEC sued Ripple in December of 2020 at the tail end of the Trump administration — before Gensler was chair — alleging that its sale of the cryptocurrency XRP represented the sale of an unregistered security. Garlinghouse said Ripple has spent more than $150 million fighting the SEC in court, arguing that the digital currency XRP shouldn't be subject to the agency's registration and disclosure requirements as if it were a stock offering. \"I went to Harvard Business School.

In response, an SEC spokesperson said: \"any amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense or influence peddling pales in comparison to the savings lost by crypto investors to frauds and failures.\"What was behind the SEC war on cryptoJohn Reed Stark, the former chief of internet enforcement at the SEC, says he doesn't own any cryptocurrency and has never worked for the industry. He thinks the SEC will take a much less combative approach towards crypto in the new Trump administration, but he doesn't think the SEC's actions during the Biden administration were wrong.\"Crypto is a scourge.

Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who has done some consulting work for crypto companies, is expected to take a very different approach than Gensler. Though he's no fan of crypto, former SEC official John Reed Stark believes voters have given Trump a mandate to govern..\"As far as these election results are concerned, the clear mandate is the SEC needs to lay off crypto,\" Stark said. \"And that's exactly what's going to happen.\"Trump's Cabinet picks, including Scott Bessent, his choice for Treasury secretary, have had very positive things to say about crypto. In September, Trump announced that he would be involved in a new cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial. Three weeks before the election, Trump announced the launch of its new digital coin, which Trump has a financial stake in. Asked whether this was a conflict of interest, Garlinghouse replied,\"Whether or not it's a conflict of interest, the voters have knowingly said, 'We want this person to be our president.' The voters have spoken more so than I have.\"Regulatory changesGarlinghouse said the strategy of putting money to work in the election was to get rules written. He argues that existing laws don't fit well with cryptocurrencies, and Congress needs to adopt new legislation governing digital assets. \"We haven't been asking to be deregulated. We've been asking to be regulated,\" he said. \"So we have been saying, 'Hey, look, just give us clear rules of the road.'\"Big crypto spent big money to reshape the political landscapeOver the summer, FIT21, a Republican bill with bipartisan support, passed in the House. FIT21 seeks to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets. While the SEC would still play a role, the legislation gives more responsibility for regulating cryptocurrencies to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which oversees futures markets for everything from gold to pork bellies and already has some jurisdiction over Bitcoin.The SEC is a much larger agency than the CFTC with a different mandate, Stark said. He said the SEC focuses on investor protection, while the CFTC is more focused on marketplace integrity. \"I don't blame the crypto industry for wanting to be under the CFTC,\" Stark said. \"It's a much easier regulatory regime.\"It doesn't surprise Stark that the bill passed in the House with bipartisan support. \"It doesn't pay for a member of Congress or the Senate, whoever you're talking about, doesn't pay for them to be anti-crypto,\" Stark said. \"There's no one that's going to…give them contributions because of that.\"Lawmakers from both parties told 60 Minutes that crypto firms will not escape scrutiny, since there are consumer protections in the FIT21 bill. While it's not clear whether Republican leaders will reintroduce FIT21 in the new Congress, there is bipartisan agreement that something must be done to plug regulatory gaps and prevent confusion in a market that already exists.","summary":"Crypto companies contributed a third of all direct corporate contributions to super PACs this election, supporting dozens of candidates.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brad-garlinghouse-crypto-election-politics-60-minutes/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/06/1514de46-7026-457c-a892-12ec6aa1d5ce/thumbnail/1200x630/a67a12f3d2625e06765167a1908586d0/crypto-breakout-article.jpg?v=d633d0331cc96a4353754b3de830df72","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/12/08/2393913411636/3390059_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-09 00:00:13","author":"Aliza Chasan,Margaret Brennan","authors":["Aliza Chasan","Margaret Brennan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":271585642,"title":"Trump calls for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and says a US withdrawal from NATO is possible","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump on Sunday pushed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine, describing it as part of his active efforts as president-elect to end the war despite being weeks from taking office.\n\n“Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community.\n\nAsked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” if he were actively working to end the nearly 3-year-old Ukraine war, Trump said, “I am.”\n\nHe refused to say if he had spoken to Putin since winning election in November. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. It also marks Trump wading unusually deeply into efforts before his Jan. 20 inauguration to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.\n\nTrump made his proposal after a weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders in Paris, where many world leaders gathered to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. None of the advisers traveling with him appeared to have expertise on Ukraine.\n\nKyiv would like to close a deal, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.”\n\n“I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!” Trump added. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.\n\nZelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but has given no further details.\n\nZelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”\n\n“When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land,” he said Sunday in a post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Trump’s post by repeating Moscow’s long-standing message that it is open to talks with Ukraine. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader.\n\nThat decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, warned there was no such thing as a quick fix to ending Russia’s war with Ukraine.\n\n“What I’m worried about is this kind of flawed idea that Putin can be placated, right, that Putin will come to some kind of a deal,” McMaster told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n“I think it’s really important for President Trump to adhere to his instinct in this connection … peace through strength,” McMaster said, adding, “How about give them what they need to defend themselves, and then saying to Putin, ‘You’re going to lose this war?”’\n\nWhile Trump has said before that he would like to see a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, his proposal Sunday was framed as a direct appeal to Russia. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.\n\nBoth Trump and President Joe Biden pointed this weekend to Russia’s disengagement in Syria, where the Russian military largely moved out of the way while Syrian rebels overthrew the country’s Russian-allied president, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russia’s resources.\n\nBiden said at the White House on Sunday that resistance from Ukraine had “left Russia unable to protect its main ally in the Middle East.”\n\nThe Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce. Ukraine’s allies fear a quick deal would be largely on the terms of its more powerful neighbor, potentially forcing damaging concessions on Ukraine and allowing Russia to resume the war again once it has built back up its military strength.\n\nTrump portrays himself as up to making fast deals to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have frustrated many of the Biden administration’s own mediation efforts.\n\nThere is no prohibition on incoming officials or nominees meeting with foreign officials, and it is common and fine for them to do so — unless those meetings are designed to subvert or otherwise affect current U.S. policy.\n\nThe Logan Act bars private citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.\n\nIn the NBC interview taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued U.S. participation in the Western military alliance as a given during his second term.\n\nTrump has long complained that European and the Canadian governments in the mutual-defense bloc are freeloading on military spending by the U.S., by far the most powerful partner in NATO. NATO and its member governments say a majority of countries in the bloc are now hitting voluntary targets for military spending, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.\n\nAsked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.\n\n“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he said.\n\nBut if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the alliance. Trump responded, “Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.”\n\nTrump expressed the same openness when asked if Ukraine should brace for possible cuts in U.S. aid. “Possibly,” he said.\n\nU.S. arms and other military support are vital to Ukraine’s efforts to fend off invading Russian forces, and Biden has been surging assistance to Ukraine before leaving office.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday announced nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine. Austin spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Sunday about the status of the war and U.S. military backing, the Pentagon said.\n\nRussian forces kept up their grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, taking the village of Blahodatne, according to a statement Sunday by Russia’s defense ministry. If confirmed, that gain would bring Russian forces a step closer toward capturing the town of Velyka Novosilka and disrupting a key logistics route for the Ukrainian army, military analysts said.\n\nKozlowska reported from London.

Mike Lee, R-Utah., took NBC News to task for \"selectively omitting\" a key part of the 14th Amendment in a question about birthright citizenship during an interview with President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday. Trump was asked about a number of changes he intends to implement once he assumes office during a sit down released on NBC’s \"Meet the Press,\" including his plan to end birthright citizenship. Under the 14th Amendment, someone born in the U.S. is granted citizenship regardless of whether their parents are citizens. Trump confirmed that he intends to end the policy \"on Day One,\" calling it \"ridiculous.\" NBC host Kristen Welker pushed back, arguing that the 14th Amendment \"states all persons in the United States are citizens. Can you get around the 14th Amendment with executive action?\" she asked. DONALD TRUMP ON FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY: ‘HE INVADED MY HOME’ Trump said he was open to using executive action, reiterating that the U.S. is \"the only country has it\" and \"we have to end it.\" Lee shared a clip of the exchange on X later Sunday, rebuking the NBC host for omitting six critical words from the 14th Amendment in her question to Trump. \"All persons born … in the United States, *and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,* shall be citizens of the United States,\" Lee wrote on X, highlighting the missing words in asterisks. \"Those words matter,\" he added. The senator continued to break down the issue in a lengthy 12-part thread. \"Congress has the power to define what it means to be born in the United States ‘and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,'\" he wrote. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \" While current law contains no such restriction, Congress could pass a law defining what it means to be born in the United States ‘and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,’ excluding prospectively from birthright citizenship individuals born in the U.S. to illegal aliens. \"Those who suggest Congress is somehow powerless to limit birthright citizenship ignore important constitutional text giving Congress power define who among those ‘born in the United States’ is born subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' \"It bothers me that@MeetThePress, long revered as America’s leading Sunday political news program, has become so one-sided,\" he continued. \"In this instance, @MeetThePress seems to try to render a debatable matter beyond debate by selectively omitting key words from the Constitution, making it appear incorrectly that the Fourteenth Amendment proscribes any and all restrictions on birthright citizenship.\" NBC did not respond to Fox News Digital when asked whether the omission was intentional. Trump addressed a number of other topics during the wide-ranging interview, including his plan to restore the country's reputation globally, his thoughts on FBI Director Christopher Wray, and how he plans to unify a fractured country in his inaugural address.

Obama had said that was the “red line” that would have moved the U.S. to get involved. \n\n“Russia, because they are so tied up in Ukraine, and with the loss there of over 600,000 soldiers, seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years,” Trump wrote on X. “This is where former President Obama refused to honor his commitment of protecting the RED LINE IN THE SAND, and all hell broke out, with Russia stepping in…never much of a benefit in Syria for Russia, other than to make Obama look really stupid.”\n\nCritics say that Obama’s involvement in Syria was one of significant indecisiveness, weakness, and missed opportunities. They say the former president contributed to the prolonged conflict in the region— most notably the “red line.” \n\nIn 2012, Obama backed down after setting a “red line” regarding the use of chemical weapons in dictator Assad’s regime. He warned that such an attack would be a “game changer” and result in U.S. military intervention. A year later, Assad used chemical weapons against civilians in his country. \n\nHowever, Obama did not act immediately. Instead, he hesitated and sought congressional approval for a counterstrike, which never happened. This signaled to Assad that the U.S. failed to follow through on its threats. \n\nCritics also argue Obama’s failure in Syria led to the rise of ISIS and that his \"lead from behind\" approach allowed for the terrorist group to grow. \n\nDuring his time in office, Obama also provided U.S. military aid to rebel factions, which had ties to extremist elements, in an attempt to counteract Assad’s regime. Critics also argue that Obama’s Iran nuclear deal emboldened Tehran and allowed it to act with more freedom without punishment in Syria, undermining U.S. interests.\n\nTrump has promised not to get involved with Syrian forces once he assumes office. Trump withdrew American troops from the region during his first term in the White House.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/saraharnold/2024/12/08/trump-blames-obama-for-syria-conflict-n2648765","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/340/6a8f1249-d964-40b0-b222-69e7ec58f176.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:50:47","author":"Sarah Arnold","authors":["Sarah Arnold"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":271580518,"title":"The Hypocrisy Behind Criticizing Trump’s ‘Loyalists’","text":"Jen Psaki’s latest appearance on \"Meet the Press\" was another classic example and a true masterclass in irony and projection, as she managed to criticize Donald Trump for supposedly hiring “loyalists” to do his bidding with “plausible deniability\"—conveniently ignoring the track records of her own former bosses, Joe Biden and Barack Obama.\n\nHer rant is worth dissecting—not because it was insightful, but because it perfectly encapsulates the double standards that dominate modern political commentary.\n\nPsaki claimed Trump’s rhetoric about “retribution through success” was some sort of dog whistle for political revenge. “That’s not saying he’s not going to go after his political enemies,” she said, attempting to frame Trump’s remarks as veiled threats. \n\nBut curiously, this criticism was nowhere to be found when her former boss, Joe Biden, used his Justice Department to go after his political enemies\n\nBiden’s entire administration has been characterized by a divisive, partisan agenda, including using the Department of Justice to target parents at school board meetings to pursue bogus investigations and raiding Trump's home.\n\nRelated: Trump's Big Plan for Day One Will Really Trigger the Democrats\n\nPsaki didn’t stop there. She tried to dismiss Pam Bondi and Kash Patel as extremists who didn’t need Trump to tell them what to do because “they know what the direction is. He does not need to direct them. This is why he picked them. They have passed the loyalty test.” \n\nLet’s unpack this.\n\nFirst, the accusation that hiring people who share your worldview is somehow scandalous falls flat coming from someone who worked for Barack Obama—a president who prided himself on surrounding himself with loyalists like Susan Rice, John Clapper, John Brennan, Sally Yates, and, of course, Eric Holder, who openly bragged about being Obama’s wingman.\n\nObama’s White House was infamous for its echo chamber, where dissenting views were unwelcome. Similarly, Biden’s administration is loaded with longtime Democratic operatives and loyalists who spent decades toeing the party line and never had any intention of governing from the middle the way Biden promised he would during the 2020 campaign.\n\nPsaki’s dig at Kash Patel as someone sympathetic to QAnon is especially rich, considering Biden has allowed conspiracy theories about “white supremacy” and “domestic extremism” to justify federal crackdowns on political opponents. The administration doesn’t even pretend to apply its standards evenly.\n\nPsaki concluded by stating, “It’s more tone, not a difference in what he intends to do or what he wants.” It’s hilarious the way she pretends to be offended by Trump’s rhetoric, but has no problem with Democrats doing the exact same thing—so long as it’s wrapped in polished talking points.\n\n🚨PSAKI: Trump wants loyalists like Bondi and Patel in his admin so that Trump has “plausible deniability” when they target his political enemies:\"They know what the direction is. He does not need to direct them. They have passed their loyalty tests.\"Projection meters:… pic.twitter.com/TBp2BlISN7— Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) December 8, 2024\n\nThe selective outrage on display was stunning but not surprising. Psaki has been doing this kind of projection since she left the Biden administration for MSNBC. From prosecuting Trump on questionable charges to targeting January 6 protesters, pro-life advocates, and concerned parents, Biden’s administration exemplifies the very abuses she and the entire political left claim to fear.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/08/the-hypocrisy-behind-criticizing-trumps-loyalists-n4934949","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/337/5ac56256-558c-4637-9bda-f0804385518e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:46:48","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":271583296,"title":"Woman Has 13 Surgeries In One Year So She Could Look Like Her ‘Role Model’ Ivanka Trump","text":"A woman underwent 13 plastic surgeries in a bizarre attempt to resemble President-elect Donald Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, 43. Tiffany Taylor appeared on E! Network’s Botched to meet with top-notch plastic surgeons Paul Nassif and Terry Dubrow in 2017. She revealed that all her procedures were done in the past year, which left the doctors curious about her physical well-being, per Metro. \n\n\"I've had 13 surgeries, and I was so pretty before but I'm just more elegant now,” Tiffany said in the episode. She decided to go under the knife a few months after ending her marriage of 10 years and marked Ivanka as a 'role model for all women.' Firm in her resolve, Tiffany got two breast jobs, one nose job, cheek fillers, an eyelid lift, and liposuction on her stomach and buttocks. She also wanted to fix a bump on her nose immediately but the doctors declined the procedure because of her track record, having done her nose only four months ago. \n\n“Tiffany should give it time and wait to get any more surgery done, in say, four years!” Dubrow quipped referring to Donald’s presidential run in 2017. Nassif and Dubrow were also concerned about her anesthesia dosage and asked if it matched the frequency of her surgeries. “Were you put under anesthesia 13 times in the last year?” Dubrow inquired. Tiffany enthusiastically shared that it happened only three times, which led the experts to conclude that multiple operations were done at once. \n\nElaborating further, Nassif explained that plastic surgeons often perform multiple small procedures in one anesthetic duration. “But you can have up to five or six procedures at one time,” the doctor said, stressing “as long as it is safe.” Nassif also wanted to know what caused Tiffany to pursue the extreme transformation within a brief period.\n\nWhen pressed, Tiffany admitted that five months after her separation, she wanted to rejuvenate her appearance to look as much as like the former president’s daughter. “It is very common for people after a traumatic event or a break-up to come in and want to have plastic surgery,” Dubrow disclosed in the confessional. However, he advised that it was essential to assess such individuals before procedures to determine their purpose and expectations.\n\nIvanka's image has been rattled by numerous plastic surgery rumors, which surged after her November 2023 appearance during Donald's hush-money trial. She debuted a brand new look with a more defined jawline and chiseled nose, per the Irish Star.

Thompson (the committee’s chairman). “They deleted and destroyed all evidence.” \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/liz-cheney-responds-to-donald-trumps-threat-to-jail-jan-6-committee/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/GOKA7MYWUNDN7GR3C7MJLCEP3U.jpg?smart=true&auth=96c6e72b77413d8bef7628acfdcb63f8dc6cbb999d2f1d5b56db3b0ae833af31&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:40:45","author":"Yasmeen Hamadeh","authors":["Yasmeen Hamadeh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":271579888,"title":"Tim Walz's daughter Hope reveals her 'litmus test' for 'guys who follow Joe Rogan' on Instagram","text":"Tim Walz's daughter Hope reveals her 'litmus test' for 'guys who follow Joe Rogan' on Instagram\n\nREAD MORE: Rogan's explanation for why liberal media is losing audiences\n\nView the full results of the US election via our live-updating maps and charts\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:40 GMT, 8 December 2024 | Updated: 23:40 GMT, 8 December 2024\n\nThe daughter of Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz has shared her 'litmus test' when it comes to suitable dating partners and it concerns whether they follow a certain podcast. \n\nHope Walz, 23, who has almost 200,000 followers on TikTok explained how she now asks potential dates if they follow Joe Rogan on social media - and if they do, it's an instant 'red flag'.\n\n'A litmus test for me and my friends for like years now has been if the guy we're talking to follows Joe Rogan on Instagram, they're a red flag and we should probably stop talking to them,' Walz began. \n\n'And the times when they do follow him on Instagram and we haven't stopped talking to them, it's never ended well,' she explained.\n\nRogan officially endorsed Donald Trump on the eve of the election, a move Trump’s team touted as a major win in the final hours of their campaign last month, so it is perhaps no surprise loyal listeners to the podcast may not tick all the boxes of Walz's ideal date.\n\n'I just want to say that I stand by that. It's literally never failed us and at this point it's like the first thing we do when someone starts talking to a new person,' Walz explained in her 90 second video. \n\n'If they follow him we're like, yeah this person probably isn't a great person and probably our values don't align so we're gonna move on from that. And honestly it's worked out well for all of us.'\n\nWalz explained that there had 'been some heartbreak' by sticking to the rule but that for the most part it works.\n\nThe daughter of Kamala Harris' running mate Tim Walz, Hope Walz, 23, has shared her 'litmus test' when it comes to suitable dating partners and it concerns whether they follow Joe Rogan\n\nHope Walz is getting off a campaign plane with her father Governor Tim Walz for a stop on the campaign trial\n\nJoe Rogan officially endorsed Donald Trump on the eve of the election, a move Trump’s team touted as a major win in the final hours of their campaign last month \n\n'There's been some heartbreak in there because of it or at least some disappointment but it truly is a litmus test and I got you ladies. You should start doing it,' Walz urged.\n\n'I very much stand by that. He's questionable and unprofessional in my opinion,' she said before directing her message directly at Rogan. \n\n'I don't know how you have the largest podcast in the world and are able to just lie and put out misinformation and straight up lies on your platform,' Walz said.\n\nMany of Walz followers praised her for sharing such advice. \n\n'That sinking feeling when they mention something they heard on Joe Rogan’s podcast,' shared one woman in the comments. \n\n'My favorite is when you express your disapproval and then they try and find an episode to show you and it makes it worse,' shared another. \n\n'Asking them how they feel about Taylor Swift also works like a charm (or just mentioning her in general),' added a third. \n\nBut there were also plenty who didn't agree with with Walz' suggestions. \n\nHope Walz got to know the vice president as her family while campaigned furiously for the Democratic presidential ticket after her father, Minnesota 's governor, was picked as Harris' running mate in August\n\nThere were also plenty who did not agree with Walz' suggestion\n\n'The whole Walz family are just a bunch of retarded weirdos, aren't they!?' wrote one.\n\n'This child has been brainwashed and successfully indoctrinated.

Isn't that what canceling is?\"\n\n \"No,\" Levi insisted. \"For coming out and voting for Trump? I mean, listen, I have yet to see what the ultimate effects of all that are gonna be. I already had multiple jobs that I was in the process of shooting or that I have yet to shoot, and none of those have been compromised.\"\n\n He continued, \"None of my producers or any of the studios behind those films or projects have called and said, 'Hey listen this is a line too far, and we can't have you associated with the project anymore.' We're all still full steam ahead on those. How it ultimately plays out in the future? I don't know.\"\n\n That said, the Harold and the Purple Crayon actor noted that he has been busy filming and has yet to discuss the matter with his team. \"They might say, 'Hey listen, we've had some phone calls with some people and they don't wanna work with you anymore.' I don't know.\"\n\n As for Levi being \"canceled,\" Maher replied, \"I could've sworn that already happened.\"\n\n Levi, a longtime supporter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr who endorsed Trump in September, has made headlines in recent years for sharing controversial opinions, including his criticism of the SAG-AFTRA strike, which he later walked back. Prior to that, two months before the release of Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Levi shocked fans with his response to a tweet asking if Covid-19 vaccine maker Pfizer posed \"a real danger to the world.” Levi responded, “Hardcore agree.”\n\n Want more movie news?

His comment came less than a month after Creel died from a rare and aggressive form of cancer on Sept. 30 at age 48. \n\n Among those who criticized Levi's comments was Tony award-winning Broadway actor Norbert Leo Butz, who slammed the actor for using Creel's death to promote an anti-vax agenda. “Really tried to give you the benefit here. Made it halfway through, which was hard as hell,” Butz wrote of Levi's hour-long livestream. “But was utterly heartbroken, as he would have been, that you felt the need to use his life and legacy to promote this awful platform.”\n\n Laura Benanti, who shared the stage with Levi for the 2016 Broadway revival of She Loves Me, echoed this sentiment while discussing the actor on a recent episode of the That's a Gay Ass Podcast, \"To use [Creel's] memory for his political agenda and to watch him try to make himself cry until he had one single tear, which he did not wipe away,\" Benanti said. \"I was like, 'F--- you forever.'\"\n\n In the same conversation, Benati confessed that working with Levi was unpleasant. \"Everyone was like, 'He's so great,' and I was like, 'No, he's not.' He's sucking up all the f---ing energy in the room. He wants to mansplain everybody's part to them.\"","summary":"\"I hope I haven't been canceled yet.

He was 52. \n\nPemble died Thursday in Minneapolis surrounded by friends and family, according to his friend Mike Moe, who helped care for him in the final weeks of his fight against cancer.\n\nKnown for bringing stories alive with his camera, Pemble epitomized the best of television news traditions, casting a curious and compassionate lens onto the lives of the people and communities whose stories he told.\n\nHe joined the AP in 2007 in New York before moving to Prague in 2011 to help launch AP’s first cross-format operation combining photography, text stories and video. He enhanced Eastern European news coverage, creating distinctive stories highlighting the region’s culture and society.\n\n“Adam was an incredibly talented and passionate journalist and an empathetic storyteller. He had this amazing ability to get anyone to talk to him on camera, which I attribute to the Midwestern charm he embodied throughout his life.” said Sara Gillesby, AP’s Director of Global Video and Pemble’s former manager in New York when he joined the AP. “He was the best of us.”\n\nPemble was born in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, in 1972 and grew up in Minneapolis. After graduating with a degree in mass communications from Minnesota State University Moorhead, he started his journalism career in 1997 at KVLY, a television station in Fargo, North Dakota, and later worked at WCCO in Minneapolis.\n\n“He had the skills of the old-school camera people to meet a deadline and turn a beautiful story,” said Arthur Phillips, a cameraman who worked with Pemble at WCCO. “But he had a calling for greater things.”\n\nMoving to New York, Pemble covered some of the biggest stories in the city, including the trial of Bernie Madoff, interviews with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and with then-real estate developer, now U.S. president-elect, Donald Trump.\n\nHe went to Haiti to cover the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, where he captured shocking images of devastation. A few weeks later he was in Vancouver, covering the Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his transfer to Prague, Pemble quickly became the go-to video journalist deployed to the biggest news events in Europe, interviewing government leaders, covering violent protests, the aftermath of terror attacks and numerous national elections across the continent.\n\n“An inquiring mind, a keen eye and a healthy skepticism for those in power who tried to spin away from the truth all combined to make Adam’s stories as rich in colour as he was in character,” said Sandy MacIntyre, former AP head of global video. “Time and again he was asked to do the impossible and without fail he delivered the exceptional.”\n\n”But more than all of that, he was the colleague and friend you wanted by your side because if Adam was there we knew we were going to be the winning team.”\n\nAs civil unrest rocked Ukraine in 2014, Pemble reported from Kyiv and later Donetsk, where he covered the first Russian-backed demonstrations before spending weeks in Crimea during Russia’s annexation of the strategic peninsula.\n\nHis video reports included the last remaining Ukrainian sailors loyal to Kyiv, who had finally abandoned their ship and came ashore. With the Russian national anthem playing from a car in the background, his final shot showed two distraught sailors heckled as they walked away.\n\nPemble returned to Ukraine following Russia’s invasion of the country in 2022. Among his many assignments was filming the exclusive March 2023 AP interview by Executive Editor Julie Pace with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a train shuttled them across Ukraine to cities near some of the fiercest fighting.\n\n“Adam showed up to every assignment with enthusiasm, creativity and commitment to his work and his colleagues. He loved what he did, and so many of us at AP are better for having worked alongside him,” Pace said.\n\nWhen not deployed overseas, Pemble set his camera’s gaze on his new home in the Czech Republic, offering insight into the traditions and unique stories of Eastern Europe. From Christmas carp fishing at sunrise to graffiti artists in Prague to the intimate story of a Slovak priest challenging the celibacy rules of the Catholic Church, he brought his unmistakable style.\n\nHe worked with a traditional large broadcast camera in an era where many video shooters shifted to smaller, lighter cameras. He always put himself in the right place to let reality unfold like “an old school analog painter in an often fast and furious digital age,” former AP cameraman Ben Jary recalled.\n\nPemble’s interest in visual storytelling led to experimenting with new technologies, including aerial videography. In 2015, he was the first major news agency camera operator to film live drone footage when reporting on the migration crisis in the Balkans.\n\nAn avid gardener who planted trees and chilis on his rooftop in Prague, he was adventurous in the kitchen and especially proud of his vegan “meatloaf,” friends said. He loved a seedy dive bar as much as a Michelin restaurant and foods as varied as charcoal choux pastry with truffle creme and his favourite road trip junk food, Slim Jim’s jerky and Salted Nut Rolls.\n\nPemble’s wit, wisdom, energy and positivity enriched the lives and experiences of those around him, friends and colleagues recalled.\n\n“If someone asked me to see a picture of quiet strength and courage, dignity and grace, and most of all kindness, I would show them a picture of a man for all seasons,” said Dan Huff, a Washington-based AP video journalist, “I would show them a picture of Adam Pemble.”","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/national-news/adam-pemble-ap-journalist-whose-compassionate-lens-brought-stories-to-life-dies-at-52-7694591","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241208091228-20241208091228-6755adc9620ea49c08d746c9jpeg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:37:47","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.595},{"id":271581722,"title":"Trump calls for immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and says a US withdrawal from NATO is possible","text":"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump on Sunday pushed Russian leader Vladimir Putin to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine, describing it as part of his active efforts as president-elect to end the war despite being weeks from taking office.\n\n“Zelenskyy and Ukraine would like to make a deal and stop the madness,” Trump wrote on social media, referring to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nIn a television interview that aired Sunday, Trump also said he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the United States out of NATO. Those are two threats that have alarmed Ukraine, NATO allies and many in the U.S. national security community.\n\nAsked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” if he were actively working to end the nearly 3-year-old Ukraine war, Trump said, “I am.”\n\nHe refused to say if he had spoken to Putin since winning election in November. “I don’t want to say anything about that, because I don’t want to do anything that could impede the negotiation,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s call for an immediate ceasefire went beyond the public policy stands taken by the Biden administration and Ukraine and drew a cautious response from Zelenskyy. It also marks Trump wading unusually deeply into efforts before his Jan. 20 inauguration to resolve one of the major global crises facing the lame-duck Biden administration.\n\nTrump made his proposal after a weekend meeting in Paris with French and Ukrainian leaders in Paris, where many world leaders gathered to celebrate the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral after a devastating fire. None of the advisers traveling with him appeared to have expertise on Ukraine.\n\nKyiv would like to close a deal, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin.”\n\n“I know Vladimir well. This is his time to act. China can help. The World is waiting!” Trump added. He was referring to mediation efforts by China that many in the West have seen as favoring Russia.\n\nZelenskyy described his discussions Saturday with Trump, brought together by French President Emmanuel Macron, as “constructive” but has given no further details.\n\nZelenskyy cautioned that Ukraine needs a “just and robust peace, that Russians will not destroy within a few years.”\n\n“When we talk about an effective peace with Russia, we must talk first of all about effective peace guarantees. Ukrainians want peace more than anyone else. Russia brought war to our land,” he said Sunday in a post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Trump’s post by repeating Moscow’s long-standing message that it is open to talks with Ukraine. Peskov referenced a decree by Zelenskyy from October 2022 that declared the prospect of any talks “impossible” as long as Putin was Russia’s leader.\n\nThat decree came after Putin proclaimed four occupied regions of Ukraine to be part of Russia, in what Kyiv and the West said was a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nTrump’s former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, warned there was no such thing as a quick fix to ending Russia’s war with Ukraine.\n\n“What I’m worried about is this kind of flawed idea that Putin can be placated, right, that Putin will come to some kind of a deal,” McMaster told “Fox News Sunday.”\n\n“I think it’s really important for President Trump to adhere to his instinct in this connection ... peace through strength,” McMaster said, adding, “How about give them what they need to defend themselves, and then saying to Putin, ‘You’re going to lose this war?”’\n\nWhile Trump has said before that he would like to see a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, his proposal Sunday was framed as a direct appeal to Russia. The quick responses from Ukraine and Russia demonstrated the seriousness with which they regarded the idea from the incoming American president.\n\nBoth Trump and President Joe Biden pointed this weekend to Russia’s disengagement in Syria, where the Russian military largely moved out of the way while Syrian rebels overthrew the country’s Russian-allied president, as evidence of the extent to which the Ukraine war has sapped Russia’s resources.\n\nBiden said at the White House on Sunday that resistance from Ukraine had “left Russia unable to protect its main ally in the Middle East.”\n\nThe Biden administration and other supporters of Ukraine have made a point of not being seen to press Ukraine for an immediate truce. Ukraine’s allies fear a quick deal would be largely on the terms of its more powerful neighbor, potentially forcing damaging concessions on Ukraine and allowing Russia to resume the war again once it has built back up its military strength.\n\nTrump portrays himself as up to making fast deals to resolve conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that have frustrated many of the Biden administration’s own mediation efforts.\n\nThere is no prohibition on incoming officials or nominees meeting with foreign officials, and it is common and fine for them to do so — unless those meetings are designed to subvert or otherwise affect current U.S. policy.\n\nThe Logan Act bars private citizens from trying to intervene in “disputes or controversies” between the United States and foreign powers without government approval. But the 1799 statute has produced just two criminal cases, none since the 1850s and neither resulting in a criminal conviction.\n\nIn the NBC interview taped Friday, Trump renewed his warning to NATO allies that he did not see continued U.S. participation in the Western military alliance as a given during his second term.\n\nTrump has long complained that European and the Canadian governments in the mutual-defense bloc are freeloading on military spending by the U.S., by far the most powerful partner in NATO. NATO and its member governments say a majority of countries in the bloc are now hitting voluntary targets for military spending, due in part to pressure from Trump in his first term.\n\nAsked whether he would consider the possibility of pulling out of NATO, Trump indicated that was an open question.\n\n“If they’re paying their bills, and if I think they’re treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I’d stay with NATO,” he said.\n\nBut if not, he was asked if he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the alliance. Trump responded, “Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.”\n\nTrump expressed the same openness when asked if Ukraine should brace for possible cuts in U.S. aid. “Possibly,” he said.\n\nU.S. arms and other military support are vital to Ukraine’s efforts to fend off invading Russian forces, and Biden has been surging assistance to Ukraine before leaving office.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday announced nearly $1 billion more in longer-term weapons support to Ukraine. Austin spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart Sunday about the status of the war and U.S. military backing, the Pentagon said.\n\nRussian forces kept up their grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, taking the village of Blahodatne, according to a statement Sunday by Russia’s defense ministry. If confirmed, that gain would bring Russian forces a step closer toward capturing the town of Velyka Novosilka and disrupting a key logistics route for the Ukrainian army, military analysts said.\n\n- By Ellen Knickmeyer and Joanna Kozlowska, The Associated Press","summary":"While Trump has said before that he would like to see a quick ceasefire in Ukraine, his proposal Sunday was framed as a direct appeal to Russia.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2024/12/trump-calls-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-ukraine-and-says-a-us-withdrawal-from-nato-is-possible.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/24YSK4OWDNHWHIRCQZN7YX47NQ.jpg?auth=74a484430e683ff37fca01d21e479dad0468e24889260bba75c35d5516e38baa&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:37:17","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.25},{"id":271578646,"title":"Aus Post reveals last days for Xmas deliveries","text":"Warning: contains TV spoilers-\n\nThe value of Bitcoin hit its long-awaited milestone of US$100,000 ($156,000) on Thursday December 5. \n\nThat was also the day that the 9th episode of TV series, The Day of the Jackal was released, in which the Jackal actually kills the fictitious tech billionaire Ulle Dag Charles, known as UDC.\n\nThe irony in the coincidence of these two events is beautiful. \n\nThe Jackal is paid $100 million by other rich people to kill UDC because he had written software that would expose all their financial secrets.\n\nBitcoin is the token attached to a peer-to-peer electronic cash system designed not so much to expose the secrets of the world’s rich, but to make permanent, public records of their transactions and cut out financial institutions. \n\nThe software was, and remains, subversive – designed during the Global Financial Crisis and published in October 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nMaybe he feared getting bumped off by an assassin, but for whatever reason Nakamoto has never surfaced and may not even exist. But anyway, the world’s rich elite didn’t need to kill him – they made his creation their tool instead.\n\nSo much so, that the proximate reason Bitcoin’s price went to US$100,000 was that having donated $135 million to Donald Trump’s re-election campaign, the crypto industry persuaded him to appoint hedge fund manager, crypto fan and deregulator Paul Atkins as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nOutgoing SEC head, Gary Gensler, launched dozens of lawsuits against crypto exchanges, declaring that cryptocurrencies are securities and must be regulated as such.\n\nTrump’s pick as Treasury secretary, another hedge fund manager, and billionaire, Scott Bessent, is also crypto fan.\n\nThe two men charged with making the government more efficient, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, are big bitcoiners. \n\nMusk’s Tesla has US$1 billion worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management has announced that it will start “integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios of everyday Americans”.\n\nAnd finally, the standwithcrypto.org website has worked out that 298 pro crypto candidates have been elected to US Congress, versus 134 who are anti crypto.\n\nDo all these plutocrats understand what they are promoting? Have they read Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 white paper describing a system for “two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party” (ie a bank)? Unlikely. \n\nWhat they know is that crypto caught regulators napping like Uber and Airbnb so, as Gary Gensler says, it’s the unregulated wild west, and there’s nothing like a frontier for making money through scams and tax evasion.\n\nAnd they know it’s a public gambling chip that keeps going up in price because the supply is fixed, causing mass FOMO (fear of missing out).\n\nBut the weird thing is that the purpose of bitcoin and most cryptos is like the mission of Ulle Dag Charles, the Jackal’s unfortunate target – that is to democratise finance and bring down the rich.\n\nBitcoin is a self-perpetuating decentralised ecosystem not controlled by anyone in which developers contribute to the code for free, while miners validate transactions and secure the network and turn electricity into bitcoins to get paid. \n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation is a non-profit organisation established in 2012 to support and promote it, but it doesn’t control the protocols, blockchain or the mining process, which are set and can’t be changed. \n\nThe system is incredibly sophisticated, but no more so than many other cryptos – it just has first mover advantage, big time. \n\nFor example, TRON, the crypto invented by Justin Sun – the bloke who bought the banana taped to a wall for US$6.2 million ($9.4 million) worth of TRON tokens a couple of weeks ago – is (according to its website) “dedicated to accelerating the decentralsation of the Internet via blockchain technology and decentralised applications”.\n\nNearly all the cryptos have similar high-minded purposes to do with decentralisation and disintermediation using peer-to-peer blockchains and smart contracts to empower ordinary people. Most are run by not-for-profit foundations and staffed by idealists, if not actual socialists.\n\nThey just happen to also have tokens attached to them that people are playing pass the parcel with.\n\nAnd it is no coincidence that crypto is booming in parallel with artificial intelligence on the stockmarket: AI is the other way in which people are betting on a distant future they can’t predict, but are excited about.\n\nWith both crypto and AI there is a “model shift” taking place in thinking about the economic foundations of money and work.\n\nA lot of people – including me – believe that we are in the early stages of a fundamental change to the way those things – and society as a whole – operates.\n\nBut for crypto tokens to be worth what people are paying for them, a lot of financial institutions must go out of business.\n\nAnd for the bubbling AI stocks – and therefore the sharemarket as a whole – to be worth what people are paying for them, a lot of working people have to lose their jobs. \n\nThere might be enough in extra productivity from AI being used alongside humans, but I doubt it. Certainly, the profits needed to justify current share prices won’t come from fancier search engines that answer questions instead of linking us to websites.\n\nAre the 19,790,000 bitcoins that have been mined so far worth US$2 trillion? Is AI leader Nvidia worth US$3.55 trillion?\n\nI have no idea; no one knows. That’s the thing about both crypto and AI – you can’t value them in that normal way based on forecasts for the next few years, it’s a much longer game than that. Or rather, you can if you want, and therefore don’t touch them.\n\nSomething similar was happening in the 1990s when everyone thought it was different that time, and that didn’t go well. \n\nBut then it did go well, and the internet did actually work and tech businesses that survived the 2000 crash made heaps of money, and still do.\n\nOh, and the other reason Bitcoin is $100k is that it’s divided into 100 million pieces called satoshis; there is no other asset in existence divided into so many tiny, very cheap, bite-sized pieces. \n\nSo you don’t have to sell your house to invest in a bitcoin – you just buy a few million satoshis.\n\nBut if we just quoted the price of satoshis – 0.1c – instead of bitcoins, it wouldn’t be anywhere near as exciting, or newsworthy.\n\nAlan Kohler writes weekly for The New Daily.

We’re going to look at individual cases,” Trump said.\n\nThe comments – Trump’s most detailed on the issue of pardons since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in November’s presidential election – will likely add to already high expectations for broad action once he is sworn in to office on January 20.\n\n“He continues to put out the public message closer and closer to what the J6 community is asking for, which is clemency for all of the January 6ers,” Suzzanne Monk, a long-time advocate for defendants charged in the riot, told Reuters.\n\nHopes among January 6 defendants and their supporters for broad-based clemency have grown in the past week after President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, marking a reversal from his pledge not to interfere with his son’s criminal cases.\n\nBiden said Hunter deserved a pardon because he was the victim of political persecution, an argument Trump will likely use to justify mass pardons. Some Biden critics said his decision would lessen the political cost for Trump.\n\nIn what has been billed as America’s largest criminal investigation, at least 1572 defendants have been charged in the January 6 attack. Crimes range from unlawfully entering restricted grounds to seditious conspiracy and violent assault.\n\nMore than 1251 have been convicted or pleaded guilty and 645 have been sentenced to prison, with punishments ranging from a few days to 22 years, according to the latest data from the Justice Department.","url":"https://www.thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/us-news/2024/12/09/donald-trump-january-6-pardons","image":"https://wp.thenewdaily.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1614306603-13136736-3x2-xlarge.jpg?resize=1200%2C630","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:33:47","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.338},{"id":271578328,"title":"Syrian rebels topple President Assad, prime minister calls for free elections","text":"Syrian rebels declared President Bashar al-Assad's ouster after seizing control of Damascus on Sunday, ending his family's iron-fisted rule after more than 13 years of civil war in a seismic moment for the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamist rebels also dealt a major blow to the influence of Russia and Iran in the region, key allies who propped up Assad during critical moments in the conflict.\n\nIran's embassy was stormed by Syrian rebels following their capture of Damascus, Iran's English-language Press TV reported on Sunday.\n\nSyria's army command notified officers on Sunday that Assad's rule had ended, a Syrian officer who was informed of the move told Reuters.\n\nBut the Syrian army later said it was continuing operations against \"terrorist groups\" in the key cities of Hama and Homs and in Deraa countryside.\n\nAssad, who had crushed all forms of dissent, flew out of Damascus for an unknown destination earlier on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments.\n\n\"We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison,\" the rebels said, referring to a large jail on the outskirts of Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands.\n\nThe Syrian rebel coalition said on Sunday it is continuing work to complete the transfer of power in Syria to a transitional governing body with full executive powers.\n\nKeep Reading Chikurubi prison falling apart Chinese threats on The Standard condemned News in depth: Secret grave exposes Chinese ‘cartel’s’ identity fraud scam, fraudulent schemes Surface Wilmar’s plant 75% complete\n\n\"The great Syrian revolution has moved from the stage of struggle to overthrow the Assad regime to the struggle to build a Syria together that befits the sacrifices of its people,\" it added in a statement.\n\nThousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting \"Freedom\" from a half century of Assad family rule, witnesses said.\n\nThe collapse followed a shift in the balance of power in the Middle East after many leaders of Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, a lynchpin of Assad's battlefield force, were killed by Israel over the past two months. Russia, Assad's other key ally, has been focused on the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe pace of events has stunned Arab capitals and raised fears of a new wave of regional instability.\n\nIt marks a turning point for Syria, shattered by years of war which has turned cities to rubble, killed hundreds of thousands of people, and forced millions abroad as refugees.\n\nStabilising western areas of Syria captured in the rebels' advance will be key. Western governments, which have shunned the Assad-led state for years, must decide how to deal with a new administration in which a globally designated terrorist group - Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - looks set to have influence.\n\nThe United States will continue to maintain its presence in eastern Syria and will take measures necessary to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East Daniel Shapiro told the Manama Dialogue security conference in Bahrain's capital on Sunday.\n\nHTS, which spearheaded the rebel advances across western Syria, was formerly an al Qaeda affiliate known as the Nusra Front until its leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani, severed ties with the global jihadist movement in 2016.\n\n\"The real question is how orderly will this transition be, and it seems quite clear that Golani is very eager for it to be an orderly one,\" said Joshua Landis, a Syria expert and Director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\nGolani will not want a repeat of the chaos that swept Iraq after U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. \"They are going to have to rebuild ... they will need Europe and the U.S. to lift sanctions,\" Landis said.\n\nHTS is Syria's strongest rebel group and some Syrians remain fearful it will impose draconian Islamist rule or instigate reprisals.\n\nCountries like the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, both close U.S. allies, see Islamist militant groups as an existential threat, so HTS may face resistance from the regional powers.\n\nIn a conference in Manama, Anwar Gargash, the diplomatic advisor to the United Arab Emirates president, said a main concern for that country is \"extremism and terrorism.\"\n\nHe said Syria is not out of the woods yet, adding that he did not know whether or not Assad was in the UAE.\n\nGargash blamed Assad's downfall on a failure of politics and said he had not used the 'lifeline' offered to him by various Arab countries before, including the UAE.\n\nA Syrian Air plane took off from Damascus airport around the time the capital was reported to have been taken by rebels, according to data from the Flightradar website.\n\nThe aircraft initially flew towards Syria's coastal region, a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect, but then made an abrupt U-turn and flew in the opposite direction for a few minutes before disappearing off the map.\n\nReuters could not immediately ascertain who was on board.\n\nTwo Syrian sources said there was a very high probability that Assad may have been killed in a plane crash as it was a mystery why the plane took a surprise U turn and disappeared off the map according to data from the Flightradar website.\n\nAs Syrians expressed joy, Prime Minister Mohammad Ghazi al-Jalali called for free elections so Syrians can choose who they want.\n\nBut that would require a smooth transition in a country with complex competing interests, from Islamists to groups with links to the United States, Russia and Turkey.\n\nSyrian rebels, for example, said they have started an attack on U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces in the northern Syrian town of Manbij, according to a statement posted on Sunday but dated Dec. 7 (Saturday) on X by the Ministry of Defense of the Syrian Interim Government.\n\nJalali also said he had been in contact with rebel commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani to discuss managing the transitional period, marking a notable development in efforts to shape Syria's political future.\n\nSyria's civil war, which erupted in 2011 as an uprising against Assad's rule, dragged in big outside powers, created space for jihadist militants to plot attacks around the world and sent millions of refugees into neighbouring states.\n\nThe frontlines of Syria's complex civil war were dormant for years. Then Islamists once affiliated with Al Qaeda suddenly burst into action, posing the biggest threat to Assad.\n\nIsrael, which has severely weakened the Iran-backed groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, will likely celebrate the fall of Assad, another of Iran's key regional allies. But the prospects of an Islamist group ruling Syria will likely raise concerns.\n\n\"Assad is gone. He has fled his country. His protector, Russia, Russia, Russia, led by Vladimir Putin, was not interested in protecting him any longer,\" U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump posted on X.\n\n\"Russia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success.\"\n\nRelated Topics","url":"https://www.newsday.co.zw/newsday/index.php/international/article/200036018/syrian-rebels-topple-president-assad-prime-minister-calls-for-free-elections","image":"https://cdn.thestandard.co.zw/images/newsday/uploads/2024/12/djMZP8TJNvIFFnQ2FC6HsGvTeAp7a3J2FMgyz5we.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:31:47","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zw","sentiment":0.062},{"id":271578278,"title":"Exclusive | ‘Only game in town’: Spain’s Arancha Gonzalez says China, EU can thrive despite Trump 2.0","text":"Arancha Gonzalez served as Spain’s foreign minister and is dean of the Paris School of International Affairs, Sciences Po. She was a United Nations assistant secretary general and executive director of the International Trade Centre, the joint trade development agency of the UN, and the World Trade Organization. This interview first appeared in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here.\nYou served as foreign minister during the transition from the presidencies of Donald Trump to Joe Biden. With the former president returning to the White House next year, there are still legacies from Trump’s previous foreign policy. What is the biggest concern for the European Union?\nWe’re going to face three big challenges: trade tariffs, hostility towards climate change and the most important for Europe, which is the desire expressed by the incoming president to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.\nAnd this [Ukraine war] is probably seen from Europe as the most consequential one. First, as Europeans, we believe that this conversation should be with Ukraine and not on Ukraine. And it should be with Europeans and not against Europeans.\nFor Europeans, the manner in which this conflict is addressed will be the bar of deterrence vis-a-vis Russia, and we do not want this bar to be too low. But more importantly, I think this is a very important question for the [Asia-Pacific] region because it will also be a test of the credibility of the United States as an ally to many countries in this region.\nHow will the tariffs and climate issues that you mentioned in Trump’s coming presidency affect the EU?\nIt is pretty clear that there will be tariffs, and that they will be applied to every economy in the world. They will be tougher on China, and they will disrupt the economy. I think they will bring no clear benefits to the US because the problems of the US do not have to do with tariffs.\nThe problems of inequality in the US will not be solved through tariffs. It should be solved through social safety nets. Until this is done, there will continue to be an increase in inequalities in the US, which tariffs will not prevent.\n\nI have the impression that president-elect Trump sees climate as an ideological issue. But climate change is not an ideological issue. It is about risk management. We in Europe have understood that this is a risk that we need to manage, and we have put in place measures to decarbonise our economies and obviously, we are moving very fast forward.\nBut this is not enough. We need the rest of the world to continue to do so. I am heartened by the fact that many businesses in America and many states in America have understood that the fight against climate change is not only important from a risk management point of view, but it is also a source of growth for jobs. So I am confident that they will also have a say in the domestic debate in the US.\nHow do you anticipate China-US relations will evolve over the next four years under Trump’s next administration?\nI see two camps. I see the camp of the China hawks in the appointments that Trump has made, and I see others that are a bit more friendly towards China because they are doing business in China. Take the case of Elon Musk.\nSo whom will the president-elect listen to? It is an open question. What we know is that the overall sentiment in the US towards China is negative. The US is afraid of China’s rise. We all know that China will not sit still if the US takes action against China, which is why I think we should all work to make sure that we do not destabilise the global economy. We should try to manage the relationships and differences that may exist in an adult manner as much as possible.\nTrump thinks everything is negotiable. He has no limits for his deal-making. He thinks that everything is up for sale or buying. So it depends on the price that he asks, and it depends on what China is ready to transact. Beijing will have made its calculations. They will be prepared. They will be ready to respond if attacked.\nGiven your assessment, how will the EU position itself in the China-US rivalry, and how will Brussels engage with Beijing?\nThe problem of the EU is not Donald Trump. It is Europe’s ability to take its future into its own hands.\nThe EU needs to integrate further in the areas where it is still fragmented: energy, technology, defence and capital markets. The EU should invest more in its defence given the unpredictability of the incoming US administration, which will also impact Nato.\nThe EU now needs to find the political will to strengthen its own hand. It’s the only game in town for the EU.\nThe EU is conscious of the place that China has in the world, especially in the world economy. It understands that China is a systemic actor in the world, and that ensuring financial stability, fair trade, reduction of emissions or the fight against pandemics requires working with China. So this is why the EU has very clearly said it considers China to be a partner, a competitor and a rival. The EU has been very honest about this. China and the EU can maintain these three-pronged approaches.\n\nWe will find a lot of difficulties with the incoming US administration, which is more protectionist, but the question is whether Europe and China will decide to go that route too, or whether they will keep the stability of their existing trade relations.\nThis is not only between China and the EU but also between other countries, including the Asia-Pacific region. If we respect the rules of the game among ourselves, that will give us more strength.\nIt will be a test. If the US unilaterally imposes tariffs on the rest of the world, then maybe the rest of the world decides not to do this against each other. China and the EU will be essential for this [possibility].\nHow do you evaluate current trade relations between the EU and China in view of the EU’s concerns about overcapacity, which has cast a long shadow over bilateral trade and investment?\nTrade relations could be better. We should always strive for better. From Europe, we see an imbalance in the Chinese economy that concerns us. China’s investments are being made to generate productive capacity, in excess of what its domestic market can absorb, and it is ending up in the international markets.\nAnd if we assume that the US will be less open to China in the future, the concern is: will this overcapacity end up in the European Union? This is not only a concern for the EU – other countries around the world share these concerns.\nBut at the heart, it is a decision on the Chinese side about its own growth model. The model we see is that Chinese citizens save disproportionately compared to what they consume. Domestic consumption is subdued; it does not contribute enough to the growth of the country, which then disproportionately relies on exports for its own growth.\nI think part of the question is: why is the Chinese consumer so reluctant to consume? Part of the answer is because China has weak social safety nets. It has a weaker healthcare system, pension system, education system – elements that make the Chinese consumer be very conservative.\nThere may be an interesting dialogue to be had between the EU and China, just to share experiences of how one can build stronger safety nets at home that give comfort to the consumer, so that it can ignite consumption and then rely less only on exports as a means to boost the economy domestically.\nThe US-China trade war started in January 2018. China is disputing through the World Trade Organization an EU move to impose extra tariffs on EVs. How close are China and Europe to a trade war, and what are the potential outcomes?\nI see a fundamental difference between the China-US situation where the first Trump administration – and Biden maintained them – essentially imposed discriminatory tariffs on China in disregard of WTO rules, and the measures adopted by the EU against China which have always sought to respect WTO rules. It is protectionism versus fair trade.\n\nEurope opened an investigation against Chinese exports of EVs and found that they were being unfairly subsidised, which led to the imposition of tariffs. China is in its right to contest this decision in the WTO. It shows that differences in views can be addressed within the framework of established procedures rather than “shooting from the hip”. Now, both sides have a chance to find a negotiated outcome. If they do not, tariffs will remain for as long as the unfair subsidies remain.\nThere seems to be a mutual perception between Europe and China of each being a potential disrupter of the international trading system. How should organisations like the WTO and the International Trade Centre navigate these challenges?\nIf, as announced, incoming president Trump imposes tariffs on global trade, we will see major disruptions on trade. Europe and China will have to make a strategic choice: join and amplify the chaos or contribute to stabilising the situation, working together and with other trading partners around the world. Working to preserve the WTO. For the latter, both would need to play by the rules.\nSo, isn’t the EU’s “de-risking” strategy towards China another major concern in bilateral economic ties?\nLet us say that China is de-risking from the EU too. The dual circulation is no less than a de-risking strategy. China has realised that it has to be more selective about its engagement with the rest of the world.\nThe EU also has understood that this is a world where trade is weaponised, and power and rivalry weigh over efficiency and the economy. The EU has to be careful about it.\n“Once bitten, twice shy” is what we have also experienced with EU trade, whether it is energy, trade or critical raw materials being weaponised.\nDoes it mean that the EU is less open? No, the EU has not closed its markets, but it is more selective about where to engage and how to engage. The EU is doing exactly what China is doing, which is managing its trade relations in a more careful manner. I think this is the right strategy.\nGermany’s investment value in China grew in 2023, which shows that the point is not to disconnect from China. Europe is not disconnecting from China. Europe is better at managing the risks that an excessive reliance on a single product, or in a single country, can bring to its economy.\nNearly three years after Russia invaded Ukraine, how does the EU currently perceive China’s role and its growing ties with Russia?\nFor the EU, Beijing’s move towards Russia is an important concern. We do not see the Ukraine war, only a European war. We see Ukraine war as a test of what [in the world] can go wrong. Because it means countries are allowed to invade other countries freely.\nWhen we see North Korean soldiers fighting on the Russian front against Ukraine, we see that there is a linkage between those theatres. It is not just the European conflict. It is a conflict that now connects the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.\nIt is important to explain this and to ensure everyone understands that when the rules of the game are not respected in Europe, the rules will not be respected anywhere else in the world. And that worries us, and we do not want that.\nFinnish President Alexander Stubb once suggested “one phone call from President Xi Jinping would solve this [Ukraine] crisis”. Do you believe China holds such a significant role in this matter, and what can Brussels expect Beijing to do?\nCountries are free to do what they want. But what we have been saying to China, is that for us, it is important to ensure that international law is respected. We are telling countries what would make for a better relationship with the EU, and I think it is fair to do that.\nIt is not for the European Union to tell President Xi Jinping what he has to do. But if Xi thinks that the relationship between China and the EU is a valuable one, using his capacity to influence [Russian] President Vladimir Putin would be very valuable too.\nWe are saying this because we think that what is happening in Ukraine is not just a European problem. It is symptomatic of what can go wrong internationally. It happened to Ukraine. It can happen anywhere else in the world.\nBeijing is also concerned about Nato’s close cooperation with its Indo-Pacific partners. Could this source of tension escalate into a security flashpoint between China and the EU?\nIt is very clear – the centre of gravity of Nato is the North Atlantic region. But there are risks that we have also identified, for example, risks to freedom of navigation. This is a big issue for us, because we [Europe] are a big trading continent, and we have identified this as being a concern that other countries in this region share. So we exchange with those countries.\nIs this anti-China? No, it is pro-freedom of navigation. For a continent that relies on two-thirds of its growth from international trade, it is pretty clear that that is a concern that we have.\nIt is important to understand what is driving the collaboration of the EU and Nato, first and foremost, is our security in the Atlantic, and our security and capability to respond to the attacks that we are receiving from Russia, directly into Ukraine, and indirectly, cyberattacks, sabotage of major infrastructure, disinformation campaigns that we are also suffering from Russia. So that is how we see Nato.\nBut we also see other risks. We’ve put this on the most recent strategy that Nato adopted in Madrid last year, where we see threats to cybersecurity, threats to navigation, terrorism and climate change. These are also important for us to manage together in the alliance and with partners around the world.\nSince Beijing exempted visa requirements for most European countries, there seems to have been an increase in European tourists, especially students, to China. Can these people-to-people exchanges help improve mutual understanding?\nI think for the future, a big part of stabilising the relationship between Europe and China will be to make sure that we understand each other, our students can study in both jurisdictions, our businesspeople can travel freely, our tourists can move back and forth, that is how we build resilience in our relationship.\nAs the dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po in France, I value the partnerships we have with many Chinese universities, especially after the commitment to student exchanges agreed during President Xi’s visit with [French] President Emmanuel Macron.\nThe education exchanges and student exchanges are at the heart of our project for the next few years. I do hope that we keep these people-to-people exchanges, because they are important in helping each side understand the other and therefore build resilience, especially when the political levels sometimes find it more difficult.\nDo flourishing people-to-people exchanges help to make China a friendlier environment for foreigners?\nThe Covid-19 pandemic was a turning point for the presence of foreign students and foreign businesses in China. We’ve seen a decrease in the numbers. It probably had to do with a desire by students and foreign Europeans living in China to be closer to their families in Europe, given the prolonged period of Covid-19 restrictions. But the situation has not really gone back to what it was.\nSo in my view, this is an area where what should be done is to improve people-to-people relations, which again, is the bedrock of renewing relationships.\nSpain has abstained from a vote to impose an extra EV tariff. It would be severely impacted if an investigation revealed that the EU’s pork exports to China violated trade rules. Does this suggest Spain will have its own pragmatic approach to China relations?\nSpain is an example in the EU of a country that relies a lot on international trade for its growth, whether it is trading goods or trading services. Therefore we want to make sure that trade relations with major trading partners, including the US and certainly including China, are as smooth as possible.\nSecondly, because China is a big trading partner for Spain, Spain wants trade to be conducted under fair trading conditions.\nThirdly, if there is no alternative, Spain generally supports Europe taking protective measures, but the preference is for open markets with rules of the game.\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said during his meeting with Xi Jinping in September that Spain wants to work constructively for closer China-EU relations. What can Spain do to achieve that goal?\nSpain and China have a pretty decent cooperation record. We trade with each other. We invest in each other. Probably there are a little bit more Chinese investments in Spain than Spanish investments in China. There are lots of spaces on the cultural side too.\nBy and large, we have relatively solid, constructive approaches. Can we have more? Probably, yes, which does not mean that we do not tell each other things that we think need to be improved in the relationship, for example, fairness in trade, and freedom of navigation.\nBut we generally tend to say those things privately rather than trumpeting them publicly, because we believe this is perhaps a more conducive way of doing that. We do not shy away from saying the things to each other that we do not like.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3289171/only-game-town-spains-arancha-gonzalez-says-china-eu-can-thrive-despite-trump-20","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/03/8aebc5b0-a87f-4dbe-b526-16bf016ca19f_a983847a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-08 23:30:47","author":"Zhao Ziwen","authors":["Zhao Ziwen"],"language":"en","source_country":"hk","sentiment":-0.06}]}
