Speaking at the Brookings Institution, Biden reflected on his economic legacy as his term concludes, while challenging President-elect Trump to maintain Democratic policy gains.\"I signed the American Rescue Plan, the most significant economic recovery package in our history, and also learned something from Donald Trump,\" Biden said. \"He signed checks for people for $7,400 ... and I didn't. Stupid.\"— Breaking911 (@Breaking911) Biden highlighted strong economic data, including job creation, infrastructure investments, and a declining inflation rate, but lamented public perception of the economy, which he said had been overshadowed by inflation spikes in 2022. He framed the current economic conditions—unemployment at 4.2% and record-high new business applications—as benchmarks for the next administration.However, Biden warned Trump against adopting policies such as broad tariffs and tax cuts, which he argued could harm economic stability. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed these concerns at a Wall Street Journal summit, cautioning that tariffs could increase costs for American consumers.Biden also criticized Project 2025, a policy framework from the Heritage Foundation aimed at restructuring the federal government. Calling it \"an economic disaster,\" he urged Trump to reject the plan.The president concluded by emphasizing the importance of building on current economic momentum. \"President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history,\" Biden said.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-regrets-leaving-name-off-pandemic-relief-checks-like-trump-did-says-he-was-stupid/articleshow/116192160.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116192151/116192151.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 01:16:02","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":272137850,"title":"Premier David Eby promises to press the 'reset' button with B.C. business","text":"B.C. Premier David Eby said B.C. will slay its record-setting deficit of $9 billion through growth and sound fiscal planning, not \"harsh austerity cuts\" or \"under-funding services\" as he reached out to business leaders to make a case for investment in physical and social infrastructure. \n\nEby made these comments while speaking in Vancouver Tuesday, (Dec. 10), at an event hosted by the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, which has previously raised concerns about B.C.'s fiscal direction.\n\nThat tension surfaced during the opening of the informal question-and-answer session between Eby and Fiona Famulak, chamber president and chief executive officer. \n\n\"We don't always agree, but we can always have — and we always do have — candid and frank conversations, and I know you are always up for tough questions, because you always answer them,\" Famulak said. \"What you have just said minutes ago, a lot of good things have been said.\" \n\nEby acknowledged relations could be better.\n\n\"So my commitment is that you will find a government that is hoping, with your support, to hit reset on this relationship, to move forward with the tariff threat that we are facing in a unified way, with the massive opportunity in this province to deliver it for British Columbians and that four years from now...we can look back and go, 'man, we did a lot of good work together.'\" \n\nEby's prepared remarks touched on a range of subjects, including tomorrow's meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well as provincial and territorial leaders to discuss threatened tariffs of 25 per cent on all Canadian goods by incoming-president U.S. Donald Trump.\n\nBut if a singular theme ran through Eby's speech, it was his promise to reform permitting for natural resource projects. \n\nHe pointed to yesterday's announcement that his government would free nine new wind energy projects from the required environmental assessments. He then added that those projects would go through a singular rather multiple permitting windows. \r\n\r\nEby said these changes will help get these projects off the ground three to five years faster than otherwise in framing them as the first of many changes to speed up permitting in various areas.\n\nOne of the central sectors concerned about permitting is the mining sector.\n\nMore to come...","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/news/premier-david-eby-promises-to-press-the-reset-button-with-bc-business-7699423","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/todayinbc/2024-december/eby_business.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 01:09:02","author":"Wolf Depner","authors":["Wolf Depner"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.168},{"id":272137846,"title":"About 1 in 8 Canadians think Canada should become 51st American state: poll","text":"President-elect Donald Trump mockingly referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the governor of the “Great State of Canada” on his social media account early Tuesday. \n\nTrump said in a taunting post on Truth Social it was a “pleasure to have dinner” with Trudeau at his Mar-a-Lago estate and that he looks forward to seeing the “governor again soon” to talk tariffs and trade, the “results of which will be truly spectacular for all.”\n\nTurns out, some Canadians think that’s not such a bad idea.\n\nA new Leger poll suggests 13 per cent of Canadians would like the country to become the next U.S. state.\n\nThe demographic breakdowns show there’s higher support among men, at 19 per cent, compared with only seven per cent of women.\n\nConservative party supporters came in at 21 per cent, while one in 10 Liberal voters said they were in favour of the idea. The People’s Party of Canada showed the highest level of endorsement among the federal parties, at 25 per cent, while the NDP was the lowest at six per cent.\n\nA full 82 per cent of respondents said they were opposed to the idea. People in the Atlantic provinces, women and Canadians over the age of 55 were least likely to support it.\n\n“I’m not shocked,” said Andrew Enns, executive vice-president of central Canada at Leger. While it’s not a question he’s polled on before, since it’s not normal for U.S. presidents to openly muse about snatching up bordering countries as new states, the survey results follow some familiar patterns.\n\n“Women have, for quite some time, whenever Donald Trump’s name has come up, expressed a much stronger opposition to the individual,” he said. “But again, we are talking about fairly small (support). In the Prairies, for example, it’s still less than 20 per cent that would say, yes, they’d be open to joining the United States.”\n\nLeger surveyed 1,520 people between Dec. 6 and Dec. 9, and the results do not have a margin of error since online polls aren’t considered truly random samples.\n\nThe survey was also done before Trump made his post on Tuesday. Enns said he suspects Trump doubling down on the comments will further shrink the already limited public support by pushing the joke past the point of comfort.\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller expressed dismay when reporters asked him about it ahead of a federal cabinet meeting Tuesday.\n\n“It sounds like we’re living in an episode of South Park,” he said. “I don’t think we should necessarily look on Truth Social for public policy.”\n\nThe provocative 1999 South Park animated film notably featured a song called “Blame Canada!” about Americans scapegoating their northern neighbours for their own domestic problems.\n\nMiller and other cabinet members have written off Trump’s comments as anything but serious.\n\n“Clearly, he’s joking,” Defence Minister Bill Blair said Tuesday. “We’re a sovereign nation.”\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc attended Trudeau’s surprise dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, which came soon after the president-elect threatened to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imports unless Canada beefs up its border.\n\nLeBlanc has insisted Trump was only teasing when at the dinner he suggested he could make Canada the 51st U.S. State.\n\n“The president was telling jokes,” LeBlanc said a week ago. “The president was teasing us. It was, of course, on that issue in no way a serious comment.”\n\nTrump later shared a seemingly AI-generated image of himself standing on a mountain ridge with a Canadian flag planted in it, with the caption “Oh Canada!”\n\nTrudeau has not matched that tone, warning in a talk on Monday that the steep tariffs Trump is bandying about would be devastating for the Canadian economy. He described Trump’s approach as an attempt to destabilize negotiating partners by introducing a bit of chaos.\n\nTrudeau blew past the TV cameras on his way into Tuesday’s cabinet meeting without stopping to talk to reporters.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, meanwhile, deflected questions about whether she thinks Trump is serious about taking over her country.\n\n“That is a question, really, for the president-elect,” she said.","url":"https://www.vicnews.com/national-news/about-1-in-8-canadians-think-canada-should-become-51st-american-state-poll-7699832","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241210101220-20241210081220-0d8680fdd858b52530f5941c03ff854634ac9307d2923851285ee0271602ccdf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 01:09:02","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":272137894,"title":"Pete Hegseth, Trump Defense secretary pick, gains GOP support on Capitol Hill","text":"Dec. 10 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees made the rounds Tuesday on Capitol Hill, where his Defense secretary choice Pete Hegseth appeared to gain ground with several key Republicans.\n\nHegseth has been meeting with senators to rally support for his nomination as he faces accusations -- which he has repeatedly denied -- of sexual misconduct, excessive drinking and financial mismanagement at a veterans nonprofit organization.\n\nSen.

Many of the names are familiar ones, and their roles are varied in nature. \n\nIncluded among them is Andrew N. Ferguson, who has been appointed to serve as the next Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n\n\"I am pleased to appoint Andrew N. Ferguson to be the next Chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Andrew has a proven record of standing up to Big Tech censorship, and protecting Freedom of Speech in our Great Country. Sworn in as a Commissioner on April 2, 2024, he will be able to fight on behalf of the American People on Day One of my Administration,\" Trump's statement began. \n\nSuch a statement also noted that he served as Solicitor General of the Commonwealth of Virginia. \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country’s History,\" Trump's statement concluded. \"CONGRATULATIONS ANDREW!\"\n\nThere's also Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host whom Trump described as someone who has been \"a close friend and ally\" and for \"many years,\" who has been appointed to be the next ambassador to Greece. \n\n\"Her extensive experience and leadership in law, media, and politics along with her sharp intellect make her supremely qualified to represent the United States, and safeguard its interests abroad,\" Trump's statement continued. \"Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation.\"\n\nJacob Helberg will also be the next Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment. \n\n\"In this role Jacob will be a champion of our America First Foreign Policy. He will guide State Department policy on Economic statecraft, promoting America’s Economic security and growth, and American technological dominance abroad,\" Trump explained in his statement. Like many other picks, Trump also emphasized Helberg's commitment to being \"AMERICA FIRST!\"\n\nThere's also another ambassador position that was announced on Tuesday, as Tom Barrack, a lawyer, will be the ambassador to Turkey. \n\n\"Tom successfully managed a global private equity firm. He is a well respected and experienced voice of reason to a wide range of thought leaders in both political and business circles,\" Trump's statement mentioned.\n\nThen there's Mark R. Meador, who has been nominated to be a Commissioner on the FTC. He's described as having experience in the legal world and on Capitol Hill. \n\n\"Mark Meador is a partner at Kressin Meador Powers LLC, a boutique antitrust law firm. He previously served as Deputy Chief Counsel for Antitrust and Competition Policy to Senator Mike Lee, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. Mark has also worked as an antitrust enforcer at both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, and in private practice at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP,\" Trump's statement mentioned in part.\n\nTrump also announced two roles for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), including another Republican House member, Rep. Dan Bishop of North Carolina. While Trump picking Republican House members for his administration has caused some chatter, given how narrow the Republican majority is, Bishop had already retired to run for Attorney General of North Carolina, a position he ran unsuccessfully for against Democrat Jeff Jackson. \n\nBishop has been nominated by Trump to serve as the Deputy Director of OMB, with Russell Vought having been announced as the nominee last month to once again serve in the role he held during the first Trump administration. \n\nTrump had many positive words for Bishop, noting in part that \"Dan has been a tireless fighter for our MAGA Movement in the House of Representatives on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees. Dan will implement my cost-cutting and deregulatory agenda across all Agencies, and root out the Weaponized Deep State.\"\n\nAnother name for Tuesday night is Ed Martin, who will serve as Chief of Staff for OMB. He previously served as Chief of Staff to Gov. Blunt in Missouri. \n\n\"Together with Phyllis Schlafly, they co-wrote 'The Conservative Case for Trump,'\" Trump pointed out about Martin. \"Ed has served as Chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, and RNC member. Ed is a winner who will help Make America Great Again!\"\n\nIt's been another busy week for such announcements to do with Trump's second term, including to do with the OMB. On Monday, Trump announced that he had tasked Mark Paoletta with returning to serve in his administration once more, as the General Counsel of the OMB.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/rebeccadowns/2024/12/10/trump-announces-more-picks-n2648866","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/337/1ddae7b5-9e30-4b1b-b37c-d50293efe5a5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 01:06:02","author":"Rebecca Downs","authors":["Rebecca Downs"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.379},{"id":272137246,"title":"Nippon Steel pledges $5,000 worker bonus after U.S. Steel acquisition","text":"Nippon Steel Corp. pledged Wednesday to pay $5,000 to each United States Steel Corp. employee as a one-time \"closing bonus\" if the Japanese steelmaker is permitted to complete its controversial acquisition of the American firm.\n\nThe announcement comes as U.S. President Joe Biden is reportedly planning to formally block the $14.1 billion buyout on national security grounds, possibly this month.\n\n\"We hope that this bonus demonstrates Nippon Steel's long-term commitment to sharing the success of U.S. Steel and providing a more secure future for employees, their families, and communities,\" Takahiro Mori, representative director and vice chairman of Nippon Steel, said in a statement.\n\nThe proposed deal is currently under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which examines whether international transactions involving domestic firms could negatively impact U.S. national security.

Chris Smith to Military: Please Shoot Down One Of These Drones And Find Out What It IsClose \n\nRCP White House correspondent Phil Wegmann speaks with Washington bureau chief Carl Cannon about covering the final weeks of the Biden administration, Monday on the RealClearPolitics podcast.\n\nWegmann got the chance on Sunday to ask President Biden directly about the status of American journalist Austin Tice, who has been held in Syria for many years, after the president's statement about the very rapid collapse of the Assad regime in that country.\n\n\"In a gaggle after Biden\u0019s remarks, I asked whether the White House would direct the armed services to mount an operation to rescue him. Biden\u0019s answer was that they first need to figure out where he was,\" Wegmann recalled. \"I think they\u0019re working overtime to bring Austin Tice home.\"\n\n\"Regarding Syria, they see recent developments as corroboration of their efforts. They say Iran cut and ran because it couldn\u0019t sustain its war with Israel due to U.S. support. They also claim Russia pulled out of Syria because of U.S. efforts in Ukraine. In their minds, this is bittersweet confirmation of the outgoing president\u0019s foreign policy.\"\n\n\"In the final days of the Biden administration, you see a president who has receded from center stage,\" Wegmann also said.\n\n\"Some Democrats are complaining that he has given the spotlight to Donald Trump. We saw this when the president-elect was at Notre Dame, and a number of G7 leaders were very eager to speak with him, almost treating him as if he were already president. We also saw this when the Canadian Prime Minister traveled not to Washington last week, but to Mar-a-Lago,\" he reported.\n\n\"With Biden, his focus now is very clearly on one thing: reestablishing the peaceful transfer of power and then riding off into the sunset. He's getting his ducks in a row, finishing what unfinished business he can without Congress, and he's ready to exit center-stage.\"\n\n\"It was striking that Emmanuel Macron invited Trump to France for a ceremony commemorating the rebuilding of Notre Dame at a moment when all these world leaders are trying to build their own relationships with Trump.

I think it’d be an economic disaster for us and the region,” Biden said in his speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington, referring to a conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration.\n\nCoughing frequently because of a cold, Biden said US consumers would pay the price for the tariffs that Trump has vowed to slap on US neighbors Mexico and Canada and on Asia-Pacific rival China.\n\nTogether they are the three biggest US trading partners.\n\n“I believe this approach is a major mistake,” Biden added.\n\n– Shadow president –\nThe White House had touted Biden’s speech as a “major address on his economic legacy” as the 82-year-old looks to the history books with less than six weeks left in office.\n\nBiden dropped out of the 2024 race against Trump in July due to concerns about his age and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Trump comfortably defeated at the November polls.\n\nTrump’s inauguration is not until January 20 but he has already become something of a shadow president, making pronouncements on the economy and foreign policy and being feted by world leaders.\n\nBiden has meanwhile kept a relatively low profile since the November 5 election, but he came out swinging in defense of his own record in front of an audience of economists.\n\nHe contrasted his “middle-out, bottom-up economic playbook” with what he called Trump’s failed promise of “trickle-down economics” in which tax cuts for the wealthy are supposed to boost incomes across the board.\n\nBiden also touted achievements including the US economy’s recovery from the Covid pandemic and his huge investments in green technology and industry.\n\n“President-elect Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history, which is the envy of the world,” said Biden.\n\nBut the departing president said he regretted not signing his own name to Covid stimulus checks sent out to Americans, like Trump had done.\n\n“I also learned something with Donald Trump. He signed checks for people for 7,400 bucks,” he said. “And I didn’t — stupid!”\n\nBiden ended his speech with a broader plea for US leadership in a troubled world, even as Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to take a more isolationist stance.\n\n“If we do not lead the world, what nation leads the world? Who pulls Europe together? Who tries to pull the Middle East together?”he said.","url":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/donald-trumps-economic-plan-will-be-disaster-biden-says/","image":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Trump-and-Biden-1000x600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:48:02","author":"Opinion Nigeria","authors":["Opinion Nigeria"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.279},{"id":272135560,"title":"Trump mocks Trudeau amid tariff threat, calls him &#8216;Governor of the great state of Canada&#8217;","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday mocked Canada’s Justin Trudeau as the “governor” of a state, rather than prime minister of the giant US neighbor.\n\n“It was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada,” posted Trump on his Truth Social platform shortly after midnight.\n\n“I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all!”\n\nTrump’s jibe follows reports that he suggested making Canada the 51st US state during discussions with Trudeau in Florida, which followed threats to impose huge trade tariffs when he takes office in January.\n\nThe report from Fox News said Trump told Trudeau that if Canada could not withstand his threatened 25 percent tariff on all Canadian imports, then it should be absorbed into the United States.\n\nThe idea has long been joked about and Trump has a habit of provocative statements, especially on social media, that can be read as jokes or bluster.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump repeatedly discussed buying Greenland from Denmark.\n\n“Why are we subsidizing these countries?” Trump said in a televised interview that aired Sunday, referring to Mexico and Canada.\n\n“If we’re going to subsidize them, let them become a state,” he told NBC.\n\nPublicly, Trump and Trudeau said their meeting at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago estate went well.\n\nTrump accuses top US trading partners Canada and Mexico of not doing enough to stop the flow of illegal migrants and drug trafficking.\n\nHe has threatened tariffs against both countries, despite both being part of a trilateral free-trade agreement with the United States.\n\nAfter the Florida dinner, Trump said it was “a very productive meeting,” while Trudeau said he had an “excellent conversation.”","url":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/trump-mocks-trudeau-amid-tariff-threat-calls-him-governor-of-the-great-state-of-canada/","image":"https://www.opinionnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Trump-Trudeau-1000x600.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:48:02","author":"Opinion Nigeria","authors":["Opinion Nigeria"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.245},{"id":272137266,"title":"Making a $1 billion investment in US?

Critics argue the plan violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires thorough environmental reviews of major projects.Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, called the proposal “blatantly illegal” and accused Trump of prioritizing corporate polluters. “This is another example of Trump selling out America to the highest bidder,” she said. Alexandra Adams from the Natural Resources Defense Council added, “What if someone wants to build a waste incinerator next to Mar-a-Lago or a coal mine next to Bedminster? Community impacts matter.”Push for permitting reformDespite the controversy, Trump’s push underscores bipartisan interest in overhauling permitting processes. Energy analyst Kevin Book noted that permitting delays often hinder billion-dollar projects across sectors. “The substance here is real. Trump is serious about permitting reform,” Book said.A bipartisan proposal led by Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso aims to streamline approvals for energy and mineral projects, but its future remains uncertain. Critics like Rep. Raul Grijalva argue the plan prioritizes oil and gas companies while undermining environmental protections.“Drill, baby, drill”Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, hinted at sweeping deregulation under Trump’s leadership, dubbing his second term a potential “golden age of regulation-cutting.” “He’s ready to move heaven and earth to bring money into the US,” Miller said at a Wall Street Journal conference.While the plan energizes Trump’s base, its legal hurdles and political implications set the stage for fierce debates in 2025. Environmental groups, lawmakers, and industry leaders are bracing for the next chapter of America’s energy policy.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/making-a-1-billion-investment-in-us-trump-promises-fast-track-permits-but-there-are-hurdles/articleshow/116191299.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116191617/116191617.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:47:22","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.43},{"id":272138572,"title":"Trump picks Kimberly Guilfoyle and Tom Barrack as ambassadors to Greece and Turkey","text":"President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would nominate former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle and his longtime billionaire friend Tom Barrack to serve as ambassadors to Greece and Turkey respectively.

He now runs xAI, an OpenAI competitor, and has emerged as a close advisor in Trump's transition team.\n\nTrump has chosen him, along with former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to head a task force aimed at slashing government spending and regulations. \n\nFriar, who previously led social media firm Nextdoor and joined OpenAI six months ago as its first CFO, said the company has seen huge demand for its video generation tool Sora, which was released earlier this week. \n\nAccount creation has been suspended since then, and Friar didn't offer a specific timeline for when it would resume.\n\n\"Some of it is just we need capacity, but a lot of it is also we want to be measured...it's only available to a very small selection of people today, because we want to listen and learn,\" said Friar, adding the company is taking a different release approach for Sora from ChatGPT. \n\n\"There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly moving safety first as well.\"\n\nBesides video generation, she said she also anticipates more AI agent products that can handle day-to-day tasks to be released in the new year, with foundation models gaining better reasoning capabilities.\n\n\"I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us,\" she said.\n\nThe fast-growing startup is also working on developing a new dynamic with its largest investor and tech partner, Microsoft. \n\n\"We think about it ... in terms of helping each other grow, but also recognizing that diversification is a good thing as well, in terms of growing the whole industry,\" Friar added.\n\nDespite the controversy over its governance restructuring and the recent exodus of executives, OpenAI continues to experience rapid expansion, she said. \n\nFriar said the company sees a \"re-acceleration\" in ChatGPT user growth, which surged to 300 million weekly active users from 200 million in August this year, attributing it to the launch of new reasoning models such as o1.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/openai-cfo-friar-says-she-trusts-musk-prioritize-national-interest-4799651","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--zOdYXhzr--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-12-11t004049z_2_lynxmpekba00l_rtroptp_3_reuters-next.jpg?i","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11

Nearly every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has either a shield law or court recognition of qualified privilege for sources, but no federal law is in place.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed the PRESS Act in January. An attempt to pass the PRESS Act via unanimous consent in the Senate failed on Tuesday.\n\n\"This investigation highlights the need for a reasonable, common-sense law to protect reporters and their sources,\" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Executive Director Bruce Brown said in a statement. \"It's time for Congress to pass the PRESS Act, which has overwhelming bipartisan support, to prevent government interference with the free flow of information to the public.\"\n\nAlthough the report details years-old rules-dodging, its contents are particularly relevant since former President Donald Trump will return to the White House in just over one month.\n\nThe president-elect has pledged to jail journalists who do not name confidential sources on stories he believes to have national security implications, and he has suggested that the threat of prison rape would make them talk.\n\nAnd Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has said he wants to \"come after\" journalists \"who lied about American citizens.\" He has also said that the federal government should be rid of \"conspirators\" against Trump.\n\n\"Using the Justice Department as a way to find leakers in the federal government is of great concern, and it's something that we should be aware of as he comes into office again,\" CPJ's Jacobsen said.\n\nThe Trump administration isn't the only one that has gone after government leakers. The Obama administration engaged in what CPJ described as an \"aggressive war on leaks.\"\n\nUsing journalists to target leakers is an issue that has spanned both political parties, according to Jacobsen. But it's also \"an issue that both parties can ultimately fix together,\" Jacobsen said, including with the PRESS Act.\n\nThe department also went after the records of two members of Congress and 43 congressional staffers, according to the report.\n\nThe congressional staffers were targeted because they had accessed classified information, even though doing so was part of their job responsibilities, the report said.","url":"https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-ignored-some-policies-when-seizing-reporters-phone-records-watchdog-finds/7896172.html","image":"https://gdb.voanews.com/8DE06862-87C1-4607-B4FD-C43D422D509B_w1080_h608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:30:03","author":"Liam Scott","authors":["Liam Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"et","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":272133288,"title":"Items to Buy Before Trump's Presidency","text":"Last week, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he’ll impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods — starting on the first day of his presidency. \n\nSteep across-the-board tariffs on imports — effectively, a fee on foreign products brought into the country — have long been part of Trump’s plan to bring jobs back to American manufacturers.

Sharp tariff proposals could cause prices of apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods to spike “significantly” next year, according to the National Retail Federation. \n\n“Trump’s proposed tariff policies, especially at higher rates, would disproportionately harm middle- and low-income Americans while failing to deliver meaningful economic benefits,” said Monica Morlacco, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Southern California.\n\nAnalysts estimate a $1,700–$2,600 annual reduction in after-tax income for the typical U.S. household, with lower-income families facing the most significant relative losses, Morlacco said. \n\n“This is because tariffs function as a regressive tax, disproportionately impacting households that spend a higher share of their income on goods,” she said. “For the median household, this would represent a 4.1% decline in after-tax income.” \n\nWhile tariffs aim to promote domestic industries, Morlacco said that they tend to act as indirect taxes on consumers, with limited effects on employment.","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/brittanywong/what-items-you-should-be-buying-before-trumps-tariffs?open_comments=on","image":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-12/9/21/campaign_images/3e646214bda1/these-are-the-items-experts-are-recommending-peop-3-819-1733779314-8_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:30:02","author":"Brittany Wong","authors":["Brittany Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":272133064,"title":"Premier David Eby promises to press the 'reset' button with B.C. business","text":"B.C. Premier David Eby said B.C. will slay its record-setting deficit of $9 billion through growth and sound fiscal planning, not \"harsh austerity cuts\" or \"under-funding services\" as he reached out to business leaders to make a case for investment in physical and social infrastructure. \n\nEby made these comments while speaking in Vancouver Tuesday, (Dec. 10), at an event hosted by the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, which has previously raised concerns about B.C.'s fiscal direction.\n\nThat tension surfaced during the opening of the informal question-and-answer session between Eby and Fiona Famulak, chamber president and chief executive officer. \n\n\"We don't always agree, but we can always have — and we always do have — candid and frank conversations, and I know you are always up for tough questions, because you always answer them,\" Famulak said. \"What you have just said minutes ago, a lot of good things have been said.\" \n\nEby acknowledged relations could be better.\n\n\"So my commitment is that you will find a government that is hoping, with your support, to hit reset on this relationship, to move forward with the tariff threat that we are facing in a unified way, with the massive opportunity in this province to deliver it for British Columbians and that four years from now...we can look back and go, 'man, we did a lot of good work together.'\" \n\nEby's prepared remarks touched on a range of subjects, including tomorrow's meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as well as provincial and territorial leaders to discuss threatened tariffs of 25 per cent on all Canadian goods by incoming-president U.S. Donald Trump.\n\nBut if a singular theme ran through Eby's speech, it was his promise to reform permitting for natural resource projects. \n\nHe pointed to yesterday's announcement that his government would free nine new wind energy projects from the required environmental assessments. He then added that those projects would go through a singular rather multiple permitting windows. \r\n\r\nEby said these changes will help get these projects off the ground three to five years faster than otherwise in framing them as the first of many changes to speed up permitting in various areas.\n\nOne of the central sectors concerned about permitting is the mining sector, which has touted 17 critical mineral mining projects. Famulak cited these concerns when she quoted a mining executive as saying that it \"'takes 12 to 15 years to give a mine a green light in this province (but) we can put a person on the moon in eight.'\"\n\nEby pointed to the heightened potential of the critical mineral sector following China's decision to limit rare earth exports to the United States during his prepared remarks and promised \"significant\" reductions in wait times without being specific when Famulak asked him whether government is looking to halve timelines. \"So specifically on mining, we have committed to work with the sector to deliver guaranteed timelines for a permit review and decision,\" he said. \n\nEby also reached to the business community in other ways. He touted the business credentials of B.C.'s Finance Minister Brenda Bailey -- \"she comes from among you\" -- and B.C.'s Jobs Minister Diane Gibson and reiterated campaign promises to review business regulations in consultation with the business community, as well as administration at the health authorities to ensure \"administration doesn't suck up\" resources slated for front-line support. \n\nEby also said government is having \"conversation\" with B.C. Ferries about its administration and noted that government has issued a hiring freeze on the administrative side of the public sector with some exceptions around permitting. \n\n\"There is absolutely work for us to do around the administration of government services and ensuring that that is right-sized for the work that's actually out there,\" he said. \n\nBut Eby also defended B.C.'s record when it comes to creating private-sector jobs, while framing the growth of public sector jobs as investments that ultimately also benefit business.\n\n\"You are right, we have created a lot of public sector jobs,\" he said. \"(These) are child care workers, nurses, doctors, health science professionals, long-term care facility workers,\" he added. \"(We) are desperate for teachers, educational assistants -- this is essential infrastructure. If the hospital doesn't work for your employees, your staff can't get a child care space, if there (are) schools full of portables and there's actually not a teacher...you are going to have a hard time recruiting. Your businesses aren't going to be successful. The province isn't going to be successful.\" \n\nUltimately though, Eby appeared to have hit the right tone. \"We have to do more to unlock B.C.'s potential,\" he said during his remarks. \n\n\"I like your words, unlocking the potential, the economic potential we have,\" Famulak said during the question-and-answer session. \"Let's do it and I think everybody in this room would agree with that.\"","url":"https://www.saanichnews.com/news/premier-david-eby-promises-to-press-the-reset-button-with-bc-business-7699423","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/todayinbc/2024-december/eby_business.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:27:02","author":"Wolf Depner","authors":["Wolf Depner"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.141},{"id":272133080,"title":"About 1 in 8 Canadians think Canada should become 51st American state: poll","text":"President-elect Donald Trump mockingly referred to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the governor of the “Great State of Canada” on his social media account early Tuesday. \n\nTrump said in a taunting post on Truth Social it was a “pleasure to have dinner” with Trudeau at his Mar-a-Lago estate and that he looks forward to seeing the “governor again soon” to talk tariffs and trade, the “results of which will be truly spectacular for all.”\n\nTurns out, some Canadians think that’s not such a bad idea.\n\nA new Leger poll suggests 13 per cent of Canadians would like the country to become the next U.S. state.\n\nThe demographic breakdowns show there’s higher support among men, at 19 per cent, compared with only seven per cent of women.\n\nConservative party supporters came in at 21 per cent, while one in 10 Liberal voters said they were in favour of the idea. The People’s Party of Canada showed the highest level of endorsement among the federal parties, at 25 per cent, while the NDP was the lowest at six per cent.\n\nA full 82 per cent of respondents said they were opposed to the idea. People in the Atlantic provinces, women and Canadians over the age of 55 were least likely to support it.\n\n“I’m not shocked,” said Andrew Enns, executive vice-president of central Canada at Leger. While it’s not a question he’s polled on before, since it’s not normal for U.S. presidents to openly muse about snatching up bordering countries as new states, the survey results follow some familiar patterns.\n\n“Women have, for quite some time, whenever Donald Trump’s name has come up, expressed a much stronger opposition to the individual,” he said. “But again, we are talking about fairly small (support). In the Prairies, for example, it’s still less than 20 per cent that would say, yes, they’d be open to joining the United States.”\n\nLeger surveyed 1,520 people between Dec. 6 and Dec. 9, and the results do not have a margin of error since online polls aren’t considered truly random samples.\n\nThe survey was also done before Trump made his post on Tuesday. Enns said he suspects Trump doubling down on the comments will further shrink the already limited public support by pushing the joke past the point of comfort.\n\nImmigration Minister Marc Miller expressed dismay when reporters asked him about it ahead of a federal cabinet meeting Tuesday.\n\n“It sounds like we’re living in an episode of South Park,” he said. “I don’t think we should necessarily look on Truth Social for public policy.”\n\nThe provocative 1999 South Park animated film notably featured a song called “Blame Canada!” about Americans scapegoating their northern neighbours for their own domestic problems.\n\nMiller and other cabinet members have written off Trump’s comments as anything but serious.\n\n“Clearly, he’s joking,” Defence Minister Bill Blair said Tuesday. “We’re a sovereign nation.”\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc attended Trudeau’s surprise dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, which came soon after the president-elect threatened to impose a 25 per cent tariff on imports unless Canada beefs up its border.\n\nLeBlanc has insisted Trump was only teasing when at the dinner he suggested he could make Canada the 51st U.S. State.\n\n“The president was telling jokes,” LeBlanc said a week ago. “The president was teasing us. It was, of course, on that issue in no way a serious comment.”\n\nTrump later shared a seemingly AI-generated image of himself standing on a mountain ridge with a Canadian flag planted in it, with the caption “Oh Canada!”\n\nTrudeau has not matched that tone, warning in a talk on Monday that the steep tariffs Trump is bandying about would be devastating for the Canadian economy. He described Trump’s approach as an attempt to destabilize negotiating partners by introducing a bit of chaos.\n\nTrudeau blew past the TV cameras on his way into Tuesday’s cabinet meeting without stopping to talk to reporters.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, meanwhile, deflected questions about whether she thinks Trump is serious about taking over her country.\n\n“That is a question, really, for the president-elect,” she said.","url":"https://www.saanichnews.com/national-news/about-1-in-8-canadians-think-canada-should-become-51st-american-state-poll-7699832","image":"https://www.bpmcdn.com/f/files/shared/feeds/gps/2024/12/web1_20241210101220-20241210081220-0d8680fdd858b52530f5941c03ff854634ac9307d2923851285ee0271602ccdf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:27:02","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":272133530,"title":"Marc Andreessen says he's spent 'half' his time at Mar-a-Lago since the election, weighing in on tech and economic policy","text":"Marc Andreessen said in a recent podcast appearance that since Election Day, he has spent roughly \"half\" his time at Mar-a-Lago discussing policy issues with President-elect Donald Trump.Speaking with Bari Weiss for an episode of her \"Honesty\" podcast, the venture capitalist and vocal Trump supporter said he's \"not claiming to be in the middle of all the decision-making\" but is trying to help shape policy in a second Trump administration.\"I've been trying to help in as many ways as I can,\" Andreessen said. \"Trump brings out a lot of feelings in a lot of people.

California law generally prohibits cooperation but makes exceptions for those convicted of certain violent crimes.\n\n“We will not allow our local resources to be used for actions that separate families, harm community trust, or divert critical local resources away from addressing our most pressing challenges,” said Nora Vargas, who joined two other Democrats on the board of supervisors to approve the policy.\n\nJim Desmond, the lone dissenter, said the policy protects people convicted of violent crimes, recounting the shooting death of 32-year-old Kate Steinle in San Francisco in 2015 and other high-profile attacks committed by people in the country illegally.\n\n“These tragedies are preventable but sanctuary laws allow them to happen by allowing illegal criminals back into our communities instead of into the hands of ICE, said Desmond, a Republican.\n\nSan Diego County, with 3.3 million residents and its location on the U.S. border with Mexico, is one of the more prominent local governments to ramp up protections for people in the country illegally. At the same time, some states and counties are gearing up to support Trump’s deportation efforts.\n\nICE has limited resources to carry out the mass deportations that Trump wants. Thus, it will rely heavily on sheriffs to notify it of people in their custody and hold them temporarily, if asked, to allow federal officials time to arrest them on immigration charges.\n\nTrump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has singled out San Diego as a place where the incoming administration’s plans are complicated by “sanctuary” laws, a loose term for state and local governments that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He said Sunday on Fox News Channel that that laws denying ICE access to county jails “put the community at risk.” In contrast to San Diego, Homan plans to meet with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has expressed interest in collaborating.\n\nThe policy brings San Diego in line with seven other counties in California, including Los Angeles, the nation’s largest, which recently adopted a policy that goes beyond state law, Vargas said.\n\nVargas said “a loophole” in state law that allows sheriffs to work with ICE under limited circumstances for people convicted of violent crimes had resulted in the county transferring 100 to 200 people a year to immigration authorities. ICE will now need a judge’s order to get help from the county.\n\nSan Diego County Sheriff Kelly Martinez took issue with Vargas’ use of “loophole” to describe state law. While she didn’t take a position on the new county policy, she noted that California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has blocked efforts to further restrict cooperation with ICE. \n\n“While protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants is crucial, it is equally important to ensure that victims of crimes are not overlooked or neglected in the process,” Martinez said.","summary":"San Diego raises bar to work with immigration officials ahead of Trump’s deportation efforts  The Associated Press","url":"https://apnews.com/article/san-diego-county-trump-deportation-sanctuary-ee8603c35d2ee6700d1eda22139bcf88","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/dc4fa52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5543x3118+0+289/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F23%2Fe4%2Ffa3bc61053e6b4f673d9f43e13fa%2F8ff1e697489747bba652c24163b90ca2","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:26:00","author":"Elliot Spagat","authors":["Elliot Spagat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":272132870,"title":"Here's Why This HHS Post Has People Counting Down the Days Until January 20","text":"We're now 41 days away from January 20, with President-elect Donald Trump once more taking office in just over a month.

In a heartfelt speech, she addressed the Trump family dynamics, and the unusual relationship she shares with Melania Trump, and conveyed her appreciation for the family’s support over the years.\n\nAccording to reports, she said, \"I just want to thank your wonderful father, Donald, and the beautiful Melania and all the family for holding so close to Tiffany throughout the years. It's been a bit of a ride for everyone, but the warmth you all share is what holds this family together.\" The mention of Melania as ‘beautiful’ and the acknowledgment of family bonds, raised eyebrows for many for its unconventionality. Maples and Melania, who are uniquely tied through their relationships with Donald, have occasionally been spotted together in seemingly amicable settings, such as a Mar-a-Lago dinner and Easter celebrations, as reported by Irish Star.\n\nThe two women share notable similarities. Both are former models with a shared passion for philanthropy— Maples through her several initiatives, and Melania through her Be Best program. Maples, a proud mother often shares updates about Tiffany online. Similarly, Melania is protective of her teenage son, Barron Trump. \n\nMaples met Donald in 1985 while he was still married to his first wife, Ivana Trump. What began as a secret friendship evolved into a highly publicized affair, culminating in a dramatic confrontation with Ivana during a holiday in Aspen. Maples recalled, “She couldn’t pronounce my name, but she was asking me if I was Moola or whatever…and she just asked if I was the one who had been loving her husband for years…I didn’t want to scream…I have a happy marriage. I am very happy. Stay away from him! Stay away from us!” She later revealed, “It was obvious [Ivana] wasn’t happy…” The fallout led to Donald’s divorce from Ivana in 1992. Maples and Donald’s relationship continued amid a media frenzy, and in 1993, they welcomed their daughter, Tiffany, as reported by People magazine.\n\nLater that year, they married in a lavish ceremony at the Plaza Hotel, attended by 1,000 guests. However, their marriage lasted only three years. The couple separated in 1997, citing differences in their parenting approaches and worldviews. Despite a contentious divorce, which included disputes over their prenuptial agreement, Maples walked away with $1 million and later auctioned off her engagement ring to fund personal endeavors. Over time, the two reconciled, maintaining a friendly relationship and even celebrating holidays together.

'Name the time and place, Mr. President, I'll be there.'","text":"WASHINGTON — Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on Tuesday took President-elect Donald Trump up on his dare to Democrats to work with him to lock in legal status for “Dreamers” and, with the clock ticking, he pushed President Joe Biden to do more to protect immigrants from Trump’s threats of mass deportations.\n\n“Name the time and place, Mr. President, I’ll be there,” Durbin said at a hearing he called to throw a spotlight on Trump’s mass deportation plans.\n\nDurbin is in his last weeks as the Judiciary Committee chair, with Republicans taking control when the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. With Trump’s looming threats for mass deportations potentially having an enormous impact on the Chicago area — and obviously beyond — Durbin held a hearing Tuesday morning titled “How Mass Deportations Will Separate American Families, Harm Our Armed Forces, and Devastate Our Economy.”\n\nThe point of the hearing was for Democratic senators to take advantage, in the waning days of their party’s control of the White House and Senate, of their ability to put the case against mass deportations to the public. The Republicans were not moved.\n\nSenate Democrats’ urgent plea to Biden\n\nBefore the hearing Durbin and other Senate Democrats, including Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, released a letter to Biden with an urgent plea to take decisive action before it is too late. Trump’s incoming border czar, Tom Homan, in Chicago on Monday seemed to salivate at the chance to make Chicago a national example in the Trump crackdown.\n\nThe senators said in their letter, “We write now because the window to secure and finalize your administration’s policies is closing rapidly. We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families.”\n\nRefresher on Dreamers and DACA\n\nDurbin is the father of the “Dreamer” movement, having first introduced the “Dream Act” — the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act — in 2001. Dreamers are immigrants brought to the U.S. as youths into the country illegally, through no fault of their own. Under former President Barack Obama, “Dreamers” got some temporary protections under what became known as “DACA,” short for the program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. When Trump was president the first time, he tried to end the DACA program.\n\nWhat Biden can still do, and how Trump could undo it\n\nThe senators asked Biden to issue executive orders to extend what is called Temporary Protected Status to people from eligible countries, as designated by Biden. The senators also wanted Biden to “expedite the processing of benefit requests” for DACA recipients; install safeguards to let DACA holders travel to another country; and “prioritize adjudication of pending asylum claims.”\n\nExecutive orders come and go. Trump can void Biden’s executive actions with his own pen.\n\nWhat Biden did on Tuesday\n\nThe last item on the senators’ list — “finalize the rule providing automatic extensions for those with work permits and prioritize work permit processing” — happened on Tuesday.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced what is called a “final rule” to permanently increase “the automatic extension period of employment authorization and employment authorization documentation from up to 180 days to up to 540 days for eligible non-citizens who file a timely request to renew their work authorization.”\n\nThis work permit rule has been in the works for some time. Unlike an executive order, it takes a lot of time to revise a rule.\n\nWhat the White House told me\n\nAs of Tuesday, it’s not clear yet what more Biden will do on the immigration front. Meanwhile, there is a fear that once Trump takes office, “Dreamers” could be swept up in mass deportations.\n\nWhat Trump said about Dreamers and Durbin’s reaction\n\nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday, Trump seemed to open the door to making a deal to give “Dreamers” safeguards.\n\n“I will work with the Democrats on a plan. And if we can come up with a plan, but the Democrats have made it very, very difficult to do anything. Republicans are very open to the Dreamers,” Trump said.\n\nDurbin said he watched Trump’s “Meet the Press” interview. And though Durbin has many reasons to be skeptical when it comes to Trump and immigration — he had a front row seat to Trump’s first White House term — Durbin knows something about the art of the deal. So he is taking Trump up on his dare. \n\nSaid Durbin, “He said some positive things from my point of view, and he really challenges, on the Democratic side, to work with him when it came to the Dreamers. I accept the challenge. Name, the time and place, Mr. President, I’ll be there.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/12/10/dick-durbin-donald-trump-dreamer-deal","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7ee288/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1104x630+48+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F19%2Fdd%2F657251e0467ca017d204af41388b%2Ffacebo","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:13:52","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":272131280,"title":"Mysterious Sightings of 'Massive' Drones Over New Jersey Spark Call for 'Limited State of Emergency'","text":"New Jersey residents have been reporting mysterious nighttime drone activity since November“It’s not two or three a night, it’s 30 or 50 a night,\" one Oak Ridge resident told WNBCNew Jersey State Sen. Jon Bramnick is calling for a limited state of emergency \"banning all drones\" until there is an explanation behind the sightings\n\n Reports of unidentified drones in northern and central New Jersey since last month have prompted a state senator to call for action as some residents call the sightings a little \"menacing\" and \"creepy.\"\n\n “The State of New Jersey should issue a limited state of emergency banning all drones until the public receives an explanation regarding these multiple sightings, New Jersey State Sen. Jon Bramnick, who represents Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union counties, wrote in a Monday, Dec. 9, post on X.\n\n Bramnick’s suggestion comes amid accounts of mysterious nighttime drone flights over parts of New Jersey since November, according to NJ.com. \n\n Nancy Read, a resident of Mendham, told the outlet that she had seen the drones during the evenings near the Randolph Regional Animal Shelter.\n\n “One is stationery, the others are in and out of the tree line,” Read said. “It’s strange. They’re out there for hours, never during the day.”\n\n Kat Dunbar, of Bedminster, recalled seeing what at first appeared to be a UFO while driving home with her children. Later on, she realized they were drones when they started flying low over her home and have returned every night since. \n\n “In the last week, it became a little bit of a menacing and, like, creepy thing,” Dunbar told The New York Times.\n\n “I’m not a conspiracist by any means,” she added, “but I don’t love the idea of massive drones patrolling where I live.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Phil Doyle told NBC affiliate WNBC that he had seen dozens of drones fly over his home in Oak Ridge.\n\n “One goes over and then another,” Doyle said, the news station reported. “It’s not two or three a night, it’s 30 or 50 a night. They have lights on them so you can see them.”\n\n “Why are they suddenly here? What’s the basis for these drones suddenly appearing?\" Doyle said. \"They’ve been around for a while and now we are getting all this activity, so who’s behind it?”\n\n The string of reported drone sightings has prompted authorities to investigate the matter, but the source of or reason behind the drone flights (and the extent of them) is still unknown — though New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has said “there is no known threat to the public at this time.” \n\n The activity raised additional concerns because of the drones' nearness to a military installation and President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf course, according to ABC News.\n\n It also prevented a helicopter from picking up an injured patient in Somerset County, local officials said, NJ.com reported.\n\n On Thursday, Dec. 5, Gov. Murphy wrote in a statement that he had spoken with authorities on the matter, including U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. \n\n “Yesterday I convened a briefing with @SecMayorkas, senior officials from @DHSgov, @NJOHSP, and @NJSP, and members of our congressional delegation to discuss reported drone activity over parts of North and Central New Jersey,” Murphy wrote.\n\n “We are actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners on this matter,” he added.\n\n Other law enforcement agencies have responded too, including the Florham Police Department, who wrote in a Wednesday, Dec. 4, Facebook post: “While we currently have no evidence or information to indicate these drones pose an imminent threat at this time, their presence appears nefarious in nature.”\n\n In a statement shared on Tuesday, Dec. 3, the Morris County Prosecutor's Office said “there continues to be no known threat to public safety” from the drone activity,” adding that law enforcement agencies from Morristown and Somerset counties are aware of the situation. \n\n Meanwhile, the FBI’s Newark office said in an advisory that “witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft.

None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nThere are also pending charges related to the fake electors scheme in state and federal courts in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. Federal prosecutors investigating Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot in Washington, DC, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nElectors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, allow their electoral votes to be split between candidates.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver them to then-Vice President Mike Pence before he was to certify Joe Biden’s presidential election victory.\n\nIn the amended complaint filed Tuesday, prosecutors said the majority of the 10 electors explained to investigators that they were told they were only needed to sign the alternate elector certificate indicating that Trump had won only to preserve his legal options if a court changed the outcome of the election in Wisconsin. A majority of the electors told investigators that they did not believe their signatures on the elector certificate would be submitted to Congress without a court ruling, the complaint stated.\n\nAdditionally, a majority of the electors said that they did not consent to having their signatures presented as if Trump had won without such a court ruling, the complaint said.\n\nTroupis filed four motions to dismiss the charge against him ahead of Thursday’s hearing and before the amended complaint was filed. He argued in one that having Republican electors meet and cast their ballot was done to preserve their legal options in case the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Trump’s favor in a lawsuit challenging the Wisconsin vote. No crime was committed by that action, therefore the complaint must be dismissed, Troupis contends.\n\nThe Wisconsin charges were brought by Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat. They were filed in June, five months before Trump carried Wisconsin in November. Trump also won the state in 2016, but lost it in 2020.\n\nThe fake elector efforts were central to a 2023 federal racketeering indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But special counsel Jack Smith moved to drop that case last month, acknowledging that Trump’s return to the White House will preclude attempts to federally prosecute him.\n\nTrump was also indicted in Georgia along with 18 others accused of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 presidential election there. Trump is trying to get that case dismissed, arguing that state courts won’t have jurisdiction over him when he returns to the White House next month.\n\nChesebro and Roman were among those indicted along with Trump in Georgia. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges there. He has also pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges in Arizona related to the fake electors scheme in that state, including conspiracy, fraud and forgery.\n\nLast year, Chesebro pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with Georgia prosecutors. He is now trying to invalidate the plea after the judge in September tossed out the charge to which he had pleaded guilty.\n\nChesebro was one of four people to plead guilty in the Georgia case in the months following the indictment.","summary":"Each charge carries a possible maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $10,000 fine.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-felony-charges-wisconsin-electors-b2662234.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/04/16/ecfb1f253781405da42145cb2f6c5ffc.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:13:05","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":272130294,"title":"Items to Buy Before Trump's Presidency","text":"Last week, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he’ll impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods — starting on the first day of his presidency. \n\nSteep across-the-board tariffs on imports — effectively, a fee on foreign products brought into the country — have long been part of Trump’s plan to bring jobs back to American manufacturers. The last time he was president, he put tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, aluminum and steel. President Joe Biden increased some of Trump’s China tariffs, adding stiff levies on electric vehicles, solar panels and other products from the country.\n\nLooking at the new proposed tariffs, many economists predict that Trump’s plans will likely make inflation worse, and increase costs for U.S. businesses and consumers alike. Sharp tariff proposals could cause prices of apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods to spike “significantly” next year, according to the National Retail Federation. \n\n“Trump’s proposed tariff policies, especially at higher rates, would disproportionately harm middle- and low-income Americans while failing to deliver meaningful economic benefits,” said Monica Morlacco, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Southern California.\n\nAnalysts estimate a $1,700–$2,600 annual reduction in after-tax income for the typical U.S. household, with lower-income families facing the most significant relative losses, Morlacco said. \n\n“This is because tariffs function as a regressive tax, disproportionately impacting households that spend a higher share of their income on goods,” she said. “For the median household, this would represent a 4.1% decline in after-tax income.” \n\nWhile tariffs aim to promote domestic industries, Morlacco said that they tend to act as indirect taxes on consumers, with limited effects on employment.","url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/brittanywong/what-items-you-should-be-buying-before-trumps-tariffs","image":"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-12/9/21/campaign_images/3e646214bda1/these-are-the-items-experts-are-recommending-peop-3-819-1733779314-8_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:10:03","author":"Brittany Wong","authors":["Brittany Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":272130708,"title":"DC Edit | Will RBI tweak inflation focus?","text":"The appointment of Sanjay Malhotra as the new RBI governor continues the long-standing tradition of IAS officers heading the Central bank, a quasi-autonomous body that decides the country’s monetary policy. Of 26 governors who headed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) since 1935, only eight were economists and 18 were ICS or IAS officials who served at the finance ministry. Mr Malhotra took over the charge of RBI from Shaktikanta Das — the second longest serving governor after Sir Benegal Rama Rau’s stint of seven years and 197 days — at one of the most critical times in Indian history. He is faced with a difficult choice that almost all governors in the last 20 years have confronted — whether to focus on inflation or economic growth. Some governors focused on economic growth in their belief that growth will ultimately take care of inflation. Some exclusively focused on keeping inflation under control because price rise will transmit faster and affect the poor. Under Shaktikanta Das, the RBI remained focused on fighting inflation, even if it meant sacrificing some economic growth. The latest GDP data showed that India’s growth declined more than anticipated, which would warrant a nudge through boosting consumption by lowering interest rates. If RBI opts for easy monetary policy, it will have to deal with inflation — traditional nemesis — and strengthening of the dollar. If the dollar turns attractive because of US President Donald Trump’s policy, India needs to keep interest rates elevated to maintain the interest rate arbitrage. Otherwise, the easy dollars that entered India will follow back, putting pressure on foreign exchange reserves. Traditionally, people have unrealistically high expectations from RBI’s monetary policy. In a complex economy, the role of Central banks to either control inflation or boost economic growth has considerably diminished. Without a supportive fiscal policy, monetary policy alone cannot do much. One needs to, therefore, watch as to how Mr Malhotra will perform this balancing act. @font-face {font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:roman; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face {font-family:Calibri; panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:swiss; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-unhide:no; mso-style-qformat:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:10.0pt; margin-left:0cm; line-height:115%; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:11.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}.MsoChpDefault {mso-style-type:export-only; mso-default-props:yes; font-size:10.0pt; mso-ansi-font-size:10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; mso-font-kerning:0pt; mso-ligatures:none;}div.WordSection1 {page:WordSection1;}","summary":"","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/dc-comment/dc-edit-will-rbi-tweak-inflation-focus-1845707","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/12/10/1871171-aa-3612996.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:10:00","author":"DC Comment","authors":["DC Comment"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":272132630,"title":"Why 'ideological and policy disagreements' are expected in Trump’s Cabinet: analysis","text":"As Donald Trump continues to make filling his Cabinet one of his first priorities, a number of the controversial picks were once publicly critical of the president-elect. \n\nMiami Herald reports several political experts spoke with McClatchy News about what this could mean for the incoming president.\n\nVanderbilt University political science professor David Lewis said, \"The addition of these old rivals — many of whom have strong personalities — could have several effects on the incoming administration.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Palpable shift': MAGA 'pressure' campaign may save one of Trump’s nominees\n\nHe added, \"These are not shrinking violet kinds of people, and they do have different views from one another.

The new Congress will give Trump and Republicans the opportunity to pass major legislation without the need for any Democratic support under a process called \"reconciliation.\" But whether the GOP will try to link all of its top priorities together in a single package early next year or split major issues across two, smaller bills is a major subject of debate among top Republican leaders. The House’s top tax writer, Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, R-Mo., is warning fellow Republicans against breaking the agenda up into two bills, in which border security and energy policy would come in the first and an extension of Trump's 2017 tax cut law could come in the second. Delaying the tax legislation risks jeopardizing it, Smith and his allies warn, so they want one sweeping package. “My goal is to make sure we’re successful on making sure Trump’s tax cuts are made permanent and extended. That is my No. 1 focus. And I believe the best strategy to get that is to do one large bill,” Smith told reporters just off the House floor Tuesday. “People above me will make the decision, but I’m telling you: I know how to get votes. I’ve been very successful getting votes. I know the House on tax policy better than anyone else,” Smith continued. “If they want to give me the best opportunity to pass the president’s tax plan, make it all in one bill.” Smith spoke just hours after incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who has been pushing for the two-bill strategy, publicly made his case for it. “In my view, it makes sense to move quickly on things we know we can do quickly — border, defense, energy,” Thune told reporters. “And then come back with another package that would address some of the savings that can be achieved through reductions in cost in various agencies and bureaucracies and government programs and then also deal with the expiring Trump tax cuts in a package later this year.” “But I think we can do both,” Thune said. “We’ve got an opportunity to have a couple of different chances at a reconciliation package that would achieve all those objectives.” Asked by NBC News on Tuesday whether it would be wiser to do tax cuts in the first package, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that Republicans are still deciding the “sequence” and that he plans to discuss reconciliation when he sees Trump this weekend at the Army-Navy football game. Reconciliation allows Congress to pass party-line policies involving taxes and spending with majority votes, bypassing the Senate's 60-vote requirement for legislation. But with just 53 seats in the Senate and 220 in the House next year, nearly every Republican will need to agree for it to succeed. Johnson said he didn’t need to be reminded of the political debacle in 2017 when Republicans spent seven months of Trump's first year in office trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act through reconciliation and came up empty. “We’re having lots of thoughtful discussions about the best play call. ... What we’re deciding right now is the sequence of how we run those plays,\" Johnson said. “And it’s really important. The House and the Senate have different calculations on how that’s done, but we all have exactly the same priorities,” he said, emphasizing securing the border and staving off tax hikes when some of the Trump tax cuts expire at the end of next year. Trump indicated Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that there would be two bills. “We have a lot of other things. I have tax cuts. You know, we’ll be submitting in either the first or second package to Congress the extension of the tax cuts,” he told moderator Kristen Welker. “So that might very well be in there. Or, or it’ll come sometime after that.” But Trump has communicated to lawmakers through his two point people on reconciliation — incoming White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller and Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought — that he wants to tackle border security within his first 30 days and leave tax cuts until later, according to a Republican source familiar with the discussions. Underneath the division are multiple obstacles for Republicans. First, Senate rules restrict reconciliation bills to matters of taxes and spending. That means regulatory provisions or tougher asylum laws could be stripped out. Second, Republicans have a paper-thin House majority of 220-215, with no realistic hope of winning Democratic votes. That is likely to shrink further in the early part of Trump’s presidency with the resignation of Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and the expected resignations of Elise Stefanik, of New York, and Mike Waltz, of Florida, who are expected to leave for jobs in the Trump administration. Corralling nearly every Republican vote will be a daunting task under any circumstance. If one or both packages are projected to add substantially to the debt, it could create a vote-count problem for House GOP leaders. Conversely, if the GOP breaks up the bills and uses its most valuable “pay-fors” on the first package of border and energy items, it could leave fewer options to limit the deficit impact of the second bill, creating problems securing the votes for it. Rank-and-file Republicans are also divided over the best approach. Conservative Rep. Warren Davidson, of Ohio, said he wants one package for fiscal year 2025 and another for 2026. But former House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, of Arizona, is pushing for one sweeping reconciliation package, saying he’s worried Republicans might not even get a crack at a second one later in the year because of unforeseen circumstances. “We should be doing the biggest reconciliation package you possibly can conceive of the first time around. I’m not sure you even get the second reconciliation package,” Biggs told NBC News on Tuesday. Asked what would prevent the GOP from getting to a second bite at the apple, Biggs said: “Well, for one thing, you had 30 extra votes in 2017 that you don’t have today.” Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said, “One bill is better than two,” adding that he, Biggs and Johnson were all freshman lawmakers in 2017. And Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he’s “standing with Jason,\" meaning Smith, the Ways and Means chair, and prefers a single package. “I don’t fear doing one package at all, but I think we ought to do it immediately,” Walberg said in an interview. \"I think the American people voted that way: They wanted border control, and they want tax cuts.” Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., a Ways and Means Committee member, said he doesn’t feel strongly about either approach, predicting that Republicans will find enough savings by cutting “waste and reckless spending over the last four years” during the Biden administration. “Two versus one? I can understand the rationale behind that. You want to get a win upfront,” Murphy said. “I can see both sides. I don’t have a particular preference at this point.”","summary":"Top Republicans are divided over the best strategy to advance border, tax, energy and other core components of President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda through reconciliation next year.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/top-republicans-split-strategy-move-trumps-2025-agenda-rcna183692","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/241210-john-thune-jason-smith-2-up-split-3x2-ac-650p-4c8b99.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:07:31","author":"Julie Tsirkin,Sahil Kapur,Scott Wong","authors":["Julie Tsirkin","Sahil Kapur","Scott Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":272129446,"title":"Assisted dying: MPs voice their concerns","text":"11th December\n\nA few days ago, I detailed some of the potential flashpoints when the committee gets underway. Now members of parliament have been writing in their local papers about the assisted dying bill and their concerns, suggesting Kim Leadbeater will have an even busier time in the new year.\n\nNorth Cotswolds Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown writes: “Given the enormous implications that will follow the bill, I sincerely hope the government will take it over so that both the House of Commons and House of Lords will have time to give this important bill the scrutiny that it deserves.” Intriguingly, he doesn’t mention that he abstained, having always voted against similar bills in the past.\n\nHe does say he wants full details of the cost implications for the NHS and the courts; “The fact the doctors will have to certify that the person is of sound mind means that they may wish to appear at the hearing in person. \n\n“There may be disagreement amongst family members and there will have to be an appeal mechanism if the judge rejects the application. There are therefore resource implications on the NHS and criminal justice system.” And like many MPs, he’s concerned with the state of palliative care.\n\n“I will continue to raise the problem of funding hospices, which is currently very variable, often relying on donations.”\n\nClaire Young, a Liberal Democrat representing Thornbury and Yate, a seat near Bristol, writes: “Many have said that the focus needs to be on palliative care instead. For me, it is not an either-or situation.\n\n“We should be improving end of life care, but that does not mean people should be denied choice.\n\n“I still have some concerns, specifically around the role and criteria for proxies.”\n\nThis is a worry I haven’t heard before—a proxy is someone who can sign an application on behalf of a patient who can’t do it themselves. They have to be someone who has known the patient for at least two years and who is well-regarded in the community. \n\nA proxy cannot be a family member or a beneficiary of the patient’s will. \n\nRossendale and Darwen MP Andy MacNae, who also voted for the bill and describes himself as a strong supporter, says the vulnerable are already at risk of being pressured.\n\n“Coercion happens now, but in the dark, away from any due process. The rich can travel abroad to skirt legislation, but the poor do not have that choice. On the other hand, this proposed bill is not a perfect solution to the problems we have.”\n\nHe tells LancsLive his concerns include clarity of prognosis, the risk of doctor shopping, assessment of capability, awareness of palliative care and risk of coercion. He continues: “I have been consistently hearing that medicine is not an exact science. Doctors can do their best to predict when someone might die, but they cannot know this with absolute certainty. We need to give more thought to how this will work in practice.\n\n“We must ensure that people cannot simply go to one doctor after another until they find someone willing to sign off on their assisted dying when they have been refused for legitimate reasons.\n\n“Doctors are not lawyers. Mental capacity as currently defined in law is a complex term that does not necessarily take account of any mental illness or depression.\n\n“My fear is that doctors will struggle to properly ascertain if patients do have mental capacity.\n\n“If people have the option to choose assisted dying to end a painful and distressing death, they must also be aware of the ways these symptoms can be tackled through palliative care. I am not convinced this proposed bill will currently ensure this.”\n\nAll this doesn’t necessarily mean Leadbeater should be worried. But it does mean there’s a lot of work still to do before she can sure of winning the final vote in the spring.\n\n10th December\n\n“I get asked regularly to kill people. Patients ask me all the time: ‘Please, can you kill me? Please, can you end my life? I’m sure you do it secretly, come on.’ The question I always ask is, ‘What would have to change in your life for you to not want to die right now?’ There is always an answer, and I can nearly always improve that thing.” \n\nDr Natasha Wiggins is an expert in palliative care, and definitely knows what she’s talking about. “I’ve seen thousands of people die,” she says. “Actually, the majority of deaths are very ordinary. They are quiet, they are peaceful, they are dignified. I feel really worried, actually, that the way death from a terminal illness was represented in the debate, in the media, in the rhetoric, is as a screaming, drowning, horrific act. For most people, it’s not.” \n\nWhen she criticises the Leadbeater bill I sit up and take notice, not only because of her stream of job titles but because she is warm and funny, passionate and thoughtful and I can imagine her being a great comfort to people in their final days. So what are all those jobs?\n\n“I’m a consultant in palliative medicine and the clinical lead for palliative care and end-of-life care—two distinct but often interconnected areas—for an integrated trust that covers both the acute hospital and community services in the southwest of England.\n\n“In addition to this, I chair the regional clinical ethics committee and sit on the board of trustees for the Association for Palliative Medicine (APM), where I’m also part of the executive team. Within the APM, I contribute to the Resource Council, particularly focusing on the ReSPECT form, which is the UK’s updated approach to Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) forms.\n\n“I also lead a significant digital project across the southwest, aimed at linking up individuals’ wishes during the last year of life, ensuring that all relevant organisations can access and communicate these preferences effectively.\n\n“I wear many hats in my role, but today, I’m speaking primarily from a clinical perspective, bringing my hands-on experience to this discussion while also representing the APM.”\n\nThis interview is part of a series about palliative care, which has been in the spotlight since the vote on assisted dying in the Commons at the end of last month.\n\nFirst, I ask her what she makes of the bill.\n\nNW: I feel anxious. I think that’s my overriding emotion when I think about the bill. I feel anxious for my patients and their families, and I feel anxious for my colleagues, and I feel anxious for the whole hospice movement. \n\nI’m NHS-employed, and so I have the luxury of not worrying about where my next pound is going to come from. But I know that my hospice colleagues are very anxious. \n\nI have gone through this bill letter by letter, I’ve gone through it with a fine-tooth comb and spoken to several MPs about it—we met with Kim Leadbeater, and we talked extensively about it. When I listened to the debate, I was really surprised to see how many people probably hadn’t read it, based on the questions they were asking and the things they were saying. \n\nWhen you think about what Kim is saying, and when you think about what people who are pro assisted dying are saying about the bill—about reducing distressing deaths—and then you think about the distressing death examples they’re giving, the first thing I feel is that it’s a gross misrepresentation of the majority of deaths that I see. \n\nFor the very, very small percentage where they do have a catastrophic experience, that is wholly unpredictable. If a patient suddenly goes into bowel obstruction or, very rarely, vomiting faeces [as was mentioned by one MP in the debate] I can say, having seen thousands of people die, that I’ve seen that happen once. It’s completely unpredictable. \n\nSo the bill as it stands is either going to completely miss those people, because it’s unpredictable, or, what’s more likely, you’re going to have a lot of people dying earlier than they would have done—with some missing Christmases, weddings, or experiences with loved ones—out of fear of something happening that would never happen to them. \n\nWhen I think about the bill, I think it’s wrong on many levels. \n\nMM: Is your attitude to the bill different to your attitude towards assisted dying? \n\nNW: I think there’s been a real assertion—especially on social media—to label anybody against assisted dying, particularly anyone who works or is involved in palliative care, as a sort of religious zealot who’s for the sanctity of life at all costs. \n\nI’m not. Morally, I feel differently about assisted dying. I recognise that autonomy is very important to many people. But this bill and this process are not sufficient. \n\nThis is state-sanctioned suicide—and I know lots of politicians have tried to use euphemisms to sweeten the taste—but this is suicide. This is somebody prematurely ending their life, being helped by others. It is assisted suicide. \n\nWhen you think about state-sanctioned suicide, we mustn’t think about the most privileged; we must think about the least privileged. How we, as a society, treat our most vulnerable is how we must be judged, and this does not save, support or protect our most vulnerable. \n\nMM: Could any bill do that? I must say, personally I don’t know. I’ve changed my mind substantially on the bill. I mean, I’ve got Parkinson’s. I am one of the presenters of Movers and Shakers, a podcast about Parkinson’s, and we all felt as though it probably wouldn’t extend to us, and it should do. I was in favour of something like “unbearable suffering” in the bill. But having listened to the debate, the fears there, and talked to disabled people in particular, I don’t know how you deal with those fears. \n\nPeople on my Facebook account have talked about bin wagons coming around picking up the disabled, leading to a final solution in this country. Even if that’s ridiculous—which I think it is—it’s a genuine fear, and I don’t know how you deal with that. \n\nNW: I think one of the things this whole debate has thrown up is the lack of understanding around what palliative care can and does do. Maybe that’s our fault—maybe that’s our fault for having terrible PR. I mean, we don’t have enough funding to deliver the care, let alone pay for a PR company to support us. \n\nBut you need something like this to focus on it. This has shone a spotlight on it. \n\nWhat people often think palliative care is—and even a lot of healthcare professionals think this—is that we come along, hold someone’s hand, and give them a bit of morphine in the last few days of life. But there’s a really important reason why many departments separate palliative and end-of-life care as two separate things. \n\nPalliative care is about helping people live until they die. Actually, the national picture now is about focusing on the last 1,000 days, asking, “What is stopping you living your best life for as long as possible?” \n\nA lot of my job is asking, “What matters to you? What’s important to you? You want to hold your grandson? Okay, why can’t you? Oh, your arm is painful. Right, let’s sort out the pain in your arm so you can hold your grandson. What’s stopping you having a great day? Oh, you’re sleeping badly? Why? Restless legs? Let’s fix that and let you have a great day.” \n\nThat’s what we do every day, up and down the country. \n\nWhen someone gets towards the end of their life, absolutely, we start changing the focus, supporting their energy levels. But the dying part is a really small part of what palliative care does. \n\nThis idea that people’s choice is either assisted suicide or dying in agony is such a horrific picture. I feel so cross that people have used that to win an argument, playing on fears and distress to win a debate and then used it as moral high ground. It’s just... it’s not true. \n\nMM: The hospice movement says people don’t want to die in hospital and don’t want to die in the back of ambulances as a rule. Do you agree with that? What do you think about that? \n\nNW: I think, as a clinician working in a hospital and being really proud of the palliative and end-of-life care that we deliver in hospital, I don’t always agree that every death in hospital is a bad death. For some people, that is the right place. \n\nWe have patients in our hospital who could go home—we can organise for them to go home—and they say, “No, I’m happy here. I feel safe here. Things feel good here. I know the team.” That’s not a bad death; that’s right for them. \n\nWhat isn’t right is when people want to be at home, they don’t want to be in hospital, they don’t want to be in an ambulance, they don’t want to be in A&E, but because the social care isn’t right, or because there isn’t the community palliative care support available, they do end up coming into hospital. They do end up dying on the tarmac in an ambulance because there’s a queue out the door. That is wrong. \n\nIt’s shameful that in a country that invented modern palliative care, we are still in that situation. But that is largely because the social care system isn’t fit for purpose. The majority of patients that come in are there because their families are on their knees; they cannot care for somebody at home. We have either not had the time or don’t have the funding to put in the social care that we need, particularly at night. \n\nMM: There’s no sign, is there, realistically, of a more coherent approach coming?\n\nNW: I mean, not that I can see. I don’t work in government. I would really hope that the 10-year plan acknowledges that health and social care are inexorably linked. \n\nThis horrific term “bed blockers”, which I think is monstrous—these are human beings who need care and support—comes from the idea that someone is in an acute hospital bed when all they need is care. \n\nMM: One of our members of Movers and Shakers went on TV and said exactly what you’re warning about. He said something like, “If you’ve got Parkinson’s, the likelihood is you’re going to have a horrible, long death.” We got some complaints from followers and supporters, but I just wondered... his argument, and mine when I started with this, was that whether or not it’s inevitable or just a marginal possibility, unbearable suffering should be considered as a category rather than... you know. The point being, I’m not sure you can say someone with Parkinson’s will die within six months of a terminal illness. What are your thoughts on this?\n\nNW: I think partly we are notoriously bad at prognosticating. Prognostication is the ability to estimate how long someone has left before they die and, on the whole, we’re terrible at it. \n\nThe closer you get to the end, the easier it is to estimate, but I’m talking about days or short weeks closer—not six months. From my perspective, as someone who took part in one of the studies and was identified as being in the top one per cent for accuracy in prognostication, I would find it almost impossible to look at someone and say with confidence, “You have less than six months,” or, “You have more than six months.” I just couldn’t do that. \n\nSo I don’t know where Kim Leadbeater thinks they’re going to find all these clinicians who will confidently say, “You have less than six months,” when someone’s life is at stake in that answer. \n\nWhen I think about suffering, I often think of something called the “Calman gap”. The Calman gap is the space between expectation and reality. Often, when I meet someone for the first time, their suffering is high, and their Calman gap is large.\n\nThis is especially true for people who have had control over their lives, who are used to being in charge, and who don’t feel they are at the mercy of others. For those people, the idea of being vulnerable, dependent on others or out of control feels terrifying and completely unacceptable. \n\nIf assisted dying suddenly becomes an option and funding is diverted from palliative care to assisted dying—as has happened in other countries—then how many of those patients won’t get the chance to say, “Actually, this is the thing causing my suffering, and this is what I need to improve it”? \n\nOver time, what initially feels unacceptable becomes acceptable. When I see patients who last week were saying, “I know you could kill me if you wanted to; why don’t you?” and now they’re planning a holiday because they’re sleeping better, their pain is under control, or their breathlessness has improved, I see why my job is so rewarding. \n\nThat’s why we do this job. \n\n9th December\n\nOne of Donald Trump’s most powerful—and most loyal—political allies, Mike Johnson, has attacked the assisted dying vote in the House of Commons as “a sad and shameful day for the English-speaking world”.\n\nGiven Trump and Elon Musk’s outspoken criticism of Labour it will hardly make the job of British diplomats any easier, but the real question is whether the president-elect will act at home to please his evangelical supporters.\n\nJohnson, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, broke with convention to criticise the domestic policy of a foreign country on a “point of personal privilege”, telling a news conference: “Any society that rejects that truth about life as a gift from our creator and adopts a culture of death is a society that is in the process of crumbling. So-called assisted death endangers the weak and marginalised in society, and it corrupts medicine, and it erodes our obligations to family. And I hope and pray that the people of the United Kingdom will work through democratic means and reverse that legislation.” \n\nNobody should be surprised by this: long before he tried his hand at politics Johnson was a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a conservative Christian legal advocacy group. As he told a Baptist paper, “I’ve been out on the front lines of the ‘culture war’ defending religious freedom, the sanctity of human life, and biblical values, including the defence of traditional marriage, and other ideals like these when they’ve been under assault.”\n\nThis included not only opposing gay marriage but defending anti-sodomy laws, leading to a fellow Republican calling him a “despicable bigot of the highest order”. \n\nOfficially, the Louisiana congressman is second in line to the White House succession, after the vice president JD Vance. Despite being a relatively obscure figure before his rapid elevation, he now wields significant power as the leader of the Republican majority in the House. Unlike the nonpartisan speaker of the Commons in the UK, the role in the US is deeply political, akin to a watered-down prime minister in terms of legislative influence.\n\nIt was therefore inevitable that reporters asked Johnson whether he would pursue a federal ban on assisted dying in the 10 states (plus Washington, DC) where it is currently legal. Johnson’s response was cautious but suggestive:\n\n“I suspect we’ll have conversations about that. We don’t have any legislation planned at the moment. But it’s going to have to be part of the dialogue going forward because as that trend continues, I think we need to stand out for the respect for life.”\n\nHowever, any immediate federal push appears unlikely. But it is far more likely that Maga supporters will try to outlaw assisted dying in individual states. While it remains illegal in 40 states by default, some are taking further steps. Last month, West Virginia amended its constitution to explicitly prohibit participation in “medically assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing”. Although this change does not alter its legal status, it is symbolically significant, making future reversals more difficult.\n\nAustin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science, has warned against underestimating these efforts. “In the wake of the presidential election, some people may be tempted to think that Trump and his cronies’ desire to tell people what they can and cannot do with their bodies is just a problem for women seeking abortions or transgendered citizens. They should think again.”\n\nIt is yet another area where Trump personally probably has no strong feelings, but he will need to pump up his base ahead of the midterms in 2026. If he wants to know what evangelicals want, Speaker Johnson is the man to tell him, so watch this space.","url":"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/a-good-death/68805/assisted-dying-mps-voice-their-concerns","image":"https://media.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prod/images/gm_preview/1ed72186aca6-leadbeater.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:04:45","author":"Mark Mardell","authors":["Mark Mardell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":272126754,"title":"Trump&#8217;s Tariff Plans May &#8216;Derail&#8217; US Inflation Progress &#8211; Yellen","text":"US President-elect Donald Trump’s proposals to impose sweeping tariffs on imports could counter earlier efforts to cool inflation, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday, warning that consumer prices could rise.\n\nHer comments at the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit come as Trump has vowed broad tariffs of at least 10 per cent on all imports, and higher rates on goods from China, Canada and Mexico.\n\nImposing broad-based tariffs could “raise prices significantly for American consumers and create cost pressures on firms” which rely on imported goods, Yellen said when asked about Trump’s plans.\n\nShe cautioned that this could weigh on the competitiveness of certain sectors and increase costs to households.\n\n“This is a strategy I worry could derail the progress that we’ve made on inflation, and have adverse consequences on growth,” she said.\n\nBut she defended efforts by President Joe Biden’s administration to impose targeted tariffs on Chinese goods to counter unfair trade practices by Beijing.\n\nShe has previously raised concern over China’s industrial overcapacity — which risks a flood of underpriced goods into global markets and could undermine the development of key US industries.\n\nOn Tuesday, Yellen also expressed regret that the United States has not made more progress on the country’s deficit, saying she believes it “needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates.”\n\nShe stressed the importance of an independent Federal Reserve too, saying that countries perform better economically when central banks are allowed to exercise their best judgment without political influence.\n\nTrump has said that he would like “at least” a say over setting the Fed’s interest rate.\n\n“I think it’s a mistake to become involved in commenting on the Fed and certainly taking steps to compromise its independence,” said Yellen.\n\n“I believe it tends to undermine the confidence of financial markets and, ultimately, of Americans in an important institution,” she added.\n\nYellen noted that she has spoken with Trump’s Treasury chief nominee, billionaire hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, congratulating him on his nomination.","url":"https://www.channelstv.com/2024/12/10/trumps-tariff-plans-may-derail-us-inflation-progress-yellen/","image":"//www.channelstv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Donald-Trump__TopshotUsVotePoliticsTrump-6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:03:34","author":"Tom Jones Usen","authors":["Tom Jones Usen"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.078},{"id":272130540,"title":"Kimberly Guilfoyle picked by Trump to be ambassador to Greece","text":"Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Court TV anchor and Fox News host who became a staunch advocate for Donald Trump, has been chosen by him to be the next U.S. ambassador to Greece.

This decision comes amid increasing financial pressures stemming from significant legal liabilities and penalties related to various lawsuits.\n\nDuring an interview with a national broadcaster, Trump stated his commitment to not accepting any salary, highlighting that this is a gesture not seen since the time of George Washington. He emphasized the principle behind his choice rather than seeking acknowledgment for this decision.\n\nWhile Trump had previously made headlines by claiming to donate his taxpayer-funded salary during his first term, questions remain about the actual fulfillment of that promise. Reports suggest that the amounts donated were relatively minor compared to his total income during his presidency, leading some critics to label these donations as more symbolic than substantive.\n\nCurrently, Trump's financial landscape appears troubled, primarily due to a series of adverse court rulings that have resulted in substantial debt obligations. Recent disclosures indicate that he may owe upwards of $346 million, with estimates suggesting potential liabilities exceeding $455 million. Among these debts are substantial payments mandated by court decisions related to defamation and fraud cases.\n\nOne particularly notable ruling requires Trump to pay approximately $354.9 million in damages, exacerbating his financial difficulties. His legal team has communicated that meeting the required financial guarantees for these judgments is currently unfeasible.\n\nDespite these challenges, reports from financial analysts suggest that Trump's overall net worth remains considerable, estimated at around $5.6 billion as of early November 2024. This figure marks a significant increase compared to previous years, with much of his wealth attributed to his real estate holdings and investments in his social media company. However, the volatility of these assets poses a risk to his financial stability.\n\nMarket fluctuations and legal costs pose ongoing risks to Trump's financial health. Should he fail to meet his legal obligations, he could face severe consequences, including potential property seizures. Legal experts have indicated that, based on recent filings, Trump's liquid assets may not be sufficient to cover his mounting legal expenses.\n\nAs Trump navigates these complex financial challenges, his decision to forgo a presidential salary has sparked discussions about the implications of wealth and public service, particularly in the context of his previous claims about philanthropy and corporate responsibility. The unfolding situation will undoubtedly continue to attract attention as the administration progresses.","url":"https://themunicheye.com/trump-declines-presidential-salary-amid-financial-challenges-6782","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:03:30","author":"Article Collated/edited/curated, Or Written In-House, By The Munich Eye","authors":["Article Collated/edited/curated, Or Written In-House, By The Munich Eye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"de","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":272126032,"title":"Naked' Robbie's moment of audition madness","text":"Billionaire property tycoon Nick Candy has pledged to donate a “seven-figure” sum to Reform UK after resigning his Conservative Party membership to become MP Nigel Farage’s new treasurer.\n\nCandy, who is married to pop singer Holly Valance, posed for pictures alongside Farage in Westminster on Tuesday (British time) after it was announced he would take over as chief fundraiser in the new year.\n\nThe anti-establishment Reform UK party has been buoyed by a series of defections from the Conservatives, including former minister Andrea Jenkyns, and described Candy’s appointment as its “latest coup” as it prepares for British local elections in May.\n\nCandy joined Reform UK alongside former Conservative MP Aidan Burley on Tuesday, with Farage suggesting the Conservatives faced “death by a thousand defections”.\n\nAsked if he was giving any money himself, the businessman, who previously poured hundreds of thousands into Conservative coffers, said “of course” he would give “seven figures” to Reform.\n\nX-owner Elon Musk expressed an interest in Candy’s appointment, prompting questions about whether the tech entrepreneur would make a donation after reports he was prepared to give tens of millions of pounds to Reform UK.\n\nFarage has repeatedly insisted he knows nothing about a potential contribution from Musk.

At its best, this change might restore employment services to the deeply flawed state they occupied a few years ago – bad, but no longer actively cruel.\n\nWhile Watt’s exasperation with his department’s dysfunction is clear, the initiative stops short of the bold reform needed to transform the system.\n\nStill, the announcement raises an intriguing question: could there still be a glimmer of common decency left in Australian politics?\n\nThe long road back from dysfunction\n\nThe Albanese government inherited an employment services sector riddled with inefficiency and punitive practices, cultivated over years of Coalition neglect and mismanagement.\n\nDespite early promises of transformation, Labor’s approach has thus far been marked by timidity. T\n\nhe complaints mechanism is a welcome correction, but it’s a modest one. It addresses symptoms rather than causes, aiming to bring accountability to a system that often feels designed to punish rather than support those it purports to serve.\n\nFor unemployed workers navigating this labyrinth of indignity, the new service might offer a lifeline. It could also incentivise providers to improve their performance, at least on the surface. But even with these changes, the core structure of employment services remains deeply flawed.\n\nA truly transformative approach would involve rethinking the entire model—shifting from a focus on compliance and box-ticking to one that genuinely empowers unemployed workers with skills, opportunities, and dignity.\n\nBroader context of government inertia\n\nThis initiative comes at a time when the Albanese government faces mounting criticism for its failure to deliver on a progressive agenda.\n\nHousing affordability remains a crisis. Punitive unemployment policies persist. Social welfare systems continue to reflect a transactional, dehumanising approach. In these areas, Labor’s policies often feel indistinguishable from the Coalition’s, undermining its promise of transformational governance.\n\nWatt’s exasperation is understandable, but he is just one minister in a government that seems paralysed by the fear of offending powerful interests.\n\nAustralian politics often appears more focused on strategic career moves and appeasing Rupert Murdoch than on addressing the systemic issues facing the country. This preoccupation with “4D chess” leaves voters disillusioned, especially those most affected by policy failures.\n\nRisk of falling into Dutton’s trap\n\nThis inertia leaves the Albanese government vulnerable to exploitation by Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and the Liberal-National Coalition.\n\nIn preparation for the 2025 federal election, Dutton seems to be borrowing heavily from Donald Trump’s playbook—exploiting economic dissatisfaction and stoking cultural anxieties.\n\nLabor’s inability to deliver on its promises provides fertile ground for these tactics.\n\nDutton could easily ask Australians Trump’s infamous question: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?”\n\nFor many, the answer might be “no.” Rising cost-of-living, housing unaffordability, and stagnant wages mirror the disillusionment that propelled Trump’s rise in the United States.\n\nCombined with Labor’s missteps – like the ill-conceived proposal to ban social media for under-16s – Dutton has plenty of material to weaponise against the government.\n\nA sliver of hope\n\nThe new complaints mechanism, modest as it is, represents a flicker of something rarely seen in Australian politics: responsiveness to those most often ignored. It’s a reminder that even incremental reforms can make a difference.\n\nIf Watt’s exasperation with his department spreads to other ministers, it might ignite a broader push for meaningful change.\n\nFor now, however, the initiative feels like a bandage on a festering wound. The Albanese government has an opportunity to build on this momentum, but it must act decisively.\n\nWithout bold reforms that address systemic issues, Labor risks alienating its base and leaving the field open for a Dutton-led Coalition to exploit economic and cultural frustrations.\n\nWatt’s announcement is a step in the right direction, but it’s just that – a step.\n\nRestoring employment services to “less terrible” is hardly a vision for transformative governance. Yet, it hints at the possibility that some in government are still willing to fight for decency and accountability.\n\nWhether this spark ignites meaningful reform or fizzles out in the broader malaise of Australian politics remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, the Albanese government stands at a crossroads: embrace the courage to govern boldly or risk being outflanked by an opposition ready to capitalise on discontent.\n\nDavid O’Halloran lectures in Work and Labour Market Theory at Monash University.

Last Wednesday, the French government collapsed over a budget battle, and Marine Le Pen’s National Party pushed a no-confidence vote that passed with 331 votes (well over the 288 votes required), which could force a new election there within 60 days. As a result, a minority coalition is ruling France and President Macron is constantly fighting with Ms. Le Pen’s National Party, which has the most seats in Parliament. President Macron has not declared a new election, so he is now effectively a lame duck. In a nationwide address last Thursday evening, Macron refused to step down, saying, “The mandate you gave me is for five years, and I will exercise it fully.”\n\nHere are the most important market news items and what this news means:\n\n- Assuming that the eurozone chaos persists, do not be surprised if the euro “breaks a buck” against the U.S. dollar. The fact that the eurozone is now in a recession and the European Central Bank (ECB) will be slashing key interest rates is undermining the euro. In fact, a Bloomberg survey is now forecasting that the ECB will cut its key interest rate to 2% by next June (currently the key ECB interest rate is 3.25%). As European interest rates decline, it should also trigger a big rally in U.S. Treasuries that should also encourage the Fed to cut key interest rates.\n\n- The consensus is that the fall of Syria’s Assad after 50 years of rule is that Iran and Russia’s influence is waning. There is clearly a leadership vacuum in the Middle East, so it will be interesting what countries establish diplomatic relations with Syria’s new leader.\n\n- Although the chaos in South Korea has not spread to other Asian nations, this unrest should continue to prop up the U.S. dollar. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol escaped impeachment after imposing Martial Law for six hours to suppress opposition protests. Naturally, the martial law imposition has ignited opposition groups, so President Yoon Suk Yeol has lost the support of the vast majority of its citizens.\n\n- Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had emergency brain surgery in Sao Paulo. President Lula is awake and recovering, but only time will tell if he fully recovers. Lula has been a big proponent of boosting China’s influence and encouraging trading in Chinese yuan versus the U.S. dollar on international transactions. Naturally, China has invested heavily in Brazil, so Lula has effectively become a Chinese puppet. In the event that Lula is replaced, it will be interesting if the next President continues to promote China yuan versus the U.S. dollar, especially in light of the fact that Donald Trump proposed 100% tariffs on the BRICS countries that are undermine the U.S. dollar’s influence.\n\n- China opened a probe into Nvidia that it broke anti-monopoly laws. My comment is that of course Nvidia is a monopoly, which is why it has fat operating margins. The technology curbs between the U.S. and China have escalated under the Biden Administration, so it will be interesting if Trump 2.0 modifies these technology restrictions between the U.S. and China. In the meantime, Nvidia is a great near-term buy.\n\n- The National Bureau of Statistics in China announced that its consumer price index rose 0.2% in November, down from 0.3% in October. Economists were expecting consumer prices to rise 0.5% in November, so a weak economy is clearly suppressing consumer inflation in China. Even more interesting is that China’s producer price index (PPI) declined 2.5% in November compared to a 2.9% decline in October. China’s PPI has declined for 26 straight months, so deflation is rampant in China due to its domestic real estate crisis, a shrinking population and lackluster manufacturing activity. Eventually, the U.S. should start importing Chinese deflation on goods, despite higher tariffs.\n\nOverall, the U.S. has a huge economic advantage compared to every other large or advanced nation. It is clear that under Trump 2.0 President-elect Trump intends to exploit this clear U.S. advantage to negotiate better trade deals and impose matching tariffs on uncooperative countries.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/a-strong-dollar-reflects-american-leadership-5774050?cmt=1","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/12/10/id5773856-Syrians-celebrate-fall-of-Assad-regime.jpg-LSedit-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:01:38","author":"Louis Navellier","authors":["Louis Navellier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.179},{"id":272124940,"title":"Final House Report on Trump Assassination Attempts Says Butler Shooting Was ‘Preventable’","text":"A would-be assassin’s attempt on President-elect Donald Trump’s life at a Butler, Pennsylvania, campaign rally was enabled by “preexisting conditions and leadership failures” within the U.S. Secret Service, a House task force has found.\n\nThe panel was tasked with investigating the July 13 shooting and a second assassination attempt against Trump that took place on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach golf club in Florida.\n\nWhile the task force said it received enough intel to conclude that the first incident was “preventable,” lawmakers noted in their final report that several federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Secret Service failed to produce requested documents relevant to their inquiry.\n\nThe Department of Justice, FBI, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) “provided limited cooperation in certain areas of the Task Force’s investigation,” states the report, which the panel released on Dec. 10.\n\nLawmakers noted that the FBI never provided them with a comprehensive log of evidence or made critical witnesses available for testimony concerning the July shooting. The bureau also declined to respond to repeated requests for digital analyses of the deceased shooter’s devices.\n\nThe ATF, meanwhile, was unhelpful with the inquiry, lawmakers said, aside from making two subpoenaed employees available for testimony at the last minute.\n\n“ATF also refused repeated requests for document production and only after previously noted subpoenas were issued did it make a production of only 40 pages available to the Task Force,” the report states. “This represented only a small fraction of the information sought by the Task Force.”\n\nOther outstanding requests include documents and communications concerning the FBI’s identification of the shooter and the cleaning of the crime scene, and all intelligence concerning the threats Trump was facing around the dates he was targeted, among others.\n\nNonetheless, the task force concluded that events that transpired that day showed “how properly executed protective measures can foil an attempted assassination.”\n\nA Secret Service agent sweeping the course spotted the barrel of a rifle poking through the foliage and fired in that direction, sending the suspect running.\n\n“The special agent’s quick response and decision to discharge his firearm in the direction of the threat prevented a potentially lethal or other dangerous scenario from occurring,” the task force determined.\n\nIn their final report, lawmakers issued a series of recommendations to prevent such failures from occurring again. Those suggestions included implementing counter-surveillance at all outdoor events, sharing threat intelligence with the relevant authorities, reviewing agency protocols for sweeping golf courses, and reducing the number of Secret Service protectees, among others.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/final-house-report-on-trump-assassination-attempts-says-butler-shooting-was-preventable-5774181","image":"","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-11 00:01:38","author":"Samantha Flom","authors":["Samantha Flom"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":272125062,"title":"[LIVE Q&A 12/11 at 10:30AM ET] Trump’s Plan to End Exploitation of United States | Live With Josh","text":"Dec-10-2024\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is alleging that other countries have been exploiting the United States, and that this exploitation will soon come to an end.
