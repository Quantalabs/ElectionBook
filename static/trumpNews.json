Harris, in a statement posted Saturday on the social media platform X, cited reports that Trump’s campaign aides created an altercation with a cemetery staffer and proceeded to take photographs and film the former president, including at the graves of Afghanistan war veterans, after being warned about rules at the site. “Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,” Harris said, calling Arlington a “solemn place where we come together to honor American heroes … not a place for politics.” The original incident stemmed from Trump’s and Republicans’ continued criticism of President Joe Biden and now Harris for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the invitation of some family members of service members killed during the withdrawal, Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt. Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss. They were among 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans who died in an Aug. 26, 2021, bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport. Trump’s campaign was warned about not taking photographs before an altercation at the cemetery, according to defense officials. Officials have said since that an Arlington employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. The Trump campaign has since lashed out at Pentagon officials, with a top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, referring to military spokespersons as “hacks.” Trump campaign officials say it had permission to bring someone to take video. Since Biden ended his reelection bid, Trump has been zeroing in on Harris and her roles in foreign policy decisions. He has specifically highlighted the vice president’s statements that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision on Afghanistan. Biden’s administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover. Harris on Saturday alluded to Trump’s history of picking fights with veterans and repeated allegations that he has “called our fallen service members ‘suckers’ and ‘losers’ and disparaged Medal of Honor recipients.” “This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,” Harris said. “I will always honor the service and sacrifice of all of America’s fallen heroes. … And I will never politicize them.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump “disrespected sacred ground”&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris criticizes Trump for using Arlington visit for political gain and disrespecting hallowed site first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/harris-criticizes-trump-for-using-arlington-visit-for-political-gain-and-disrespecting-hallowed-site/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/wb-bS6dhvsCYcI6YopPX1wjODPI=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/ORUJZTHIBFHDTCKE77EUK72BFY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 23:50:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":255360872,"title":"Kamala provokes Trump to make surprising statement on recurring election issue","text":"Kamala Harris provoked Donald Trump into reversing his position on abortion, it has been revealed, with the former president suddenly embracing the practice by blasting out a rather surprising statement on social media. ‘My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,’ Trump declared in a recent post on his Truth Social platform. The latest twist from Trump exemplifies his vacillating position on the pivotal topic. The man who once called himself ‘the most pro-life president’ has also been evasive, saying the issue should be determined at the state level. But after the Democratic National Convention, Trump was privately ‘bothered by Ms. Harris’s assertions that a second Trump term would further imperil abortion rights,’ according to the New York Times. Trump had also been vexed by other speeches at the DNC, which linked him with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint that promises to further restrict reproductive measures, the Times said. After watching Harris’ speech on August 23, Trump was so angry that he delivered the statement about his future administration affording women their reproductive rights – a declaration that the New York Times observed ‘sounded as if it could come from the head of Planned Parenthood.’ Asked to make a comment by the New York Times, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the former president, said that he ‘has long been consistent in supporting the rights of states to make decisions on abortion.’ She added that presidential candidate has ‘been very clear that he will not sign a federal ban when he is back in the White House.’ But this is only the latest chapter in the long and complicated history Trump has with abortion, an issue he routinely waffles on. In 1999, Trump, then 53, told NBC’s Meet the Press that he was ‘very pro-choice.’ By 2011, however, he had changed his stance and told attendees at a conservative conference that he was ‘pro-life.’ When he first ran for president in 2016, he further heightened his opposition to abortion, telling MSNBS host Chris Matthews that he would be in favor of punishments for women who received the operation. The former president understands that abortion is an incredibly invidious and delicate issue. According to the New York Times, in 2022, when the Supreme Court was on the verge of overturning Roe v. Wade, Trump told allies that the ‘move would hurt his party.’ The Republicans’ lackluster performance in the midterms seemed to bear out the former president’s prediction. ‘Mr. Trump has been privately emphatic with advisers that in his view the abortion issue alone could kill their chances of victory in November,’ the New York Times reported. As a result, Trump’s views on reproductive rights have oscillated wildly in recent months, much to the chagrin of some social conservatives. Erick Erickson, the founder of the conservative website RedState, told the New York Times: ‘It almost seems to me like this is improvisational politics.’ He continued: ‘There’s not really a plan- he’s “Live at the Improv,” which is a problem for this.’ Trump further frustrated social conservatives by adopting a more progressive line on IVF, or in vitro fertilization. This week, he declared that he would make the expensive procedure free for Americans, which the New York Times noted would be ‘an initiative that would put him to the left of many Democrats.’ The former president has further distanced himself from the issue by reportedly ordering the party to tone down abortion language at the Republican National Convention. Earlier this spring, Trump told his advisors that he was leaning toward endorsing a 16-week national abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, according to the New York Times. However, he reportedly reversed course after looking over some polling and started saying that abortion was something that should be decided at the state level. However, the former president has repeatedly voiced his objection when state’s have ruled too harshly on the abortion question. He has denounced Florida’s 6-week ban, calling it a ‘terrible mistake,’ and during an interview with NBC on Thursday. He added that women in Florida needed more time in order to determine whether or not they wanted an abortion. This prompted outcry from some conservatives, including those at the National Review, where they published an article entitled ‘Trump Stabs Florida Pro-lifers in the Front.’ In an effort to clean up the situation, Ms. Leavitt told the New York Times that the former president ‘simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short.’ On Friday, Trump revealed that he would vote no on the measure that would preserve the six-week ban in Florida. As the final weeks of the presidential campaign grind on and Trump tries to regain some of the losses he has incurred since Harris took over for President Joe Biden, he will face the immense challenge of winning over new voters while placating his base.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris provoked Donald Trump into reversing his position on abortion, it has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala provokes Trump to make surprising statement on recurring election issue first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-provokes-trump-to-make-surprising-statement-on-recurring-election-issue/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-How-Kamala-agitated-Trump-into-making-shock.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 23:46:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":255359894,"title":"Anuel AA’s support for Trump and appeal to Latino voters in Pennsylvania","text":"Celebrity endorsements in an election year are hardly a new phenomenon. But former President Donald Trump’s appearance alongside Puerto Rican reggaeton star Anuel AA forms part of a larger emerging pattern in his campaign’s outreach to voters of color — and signals the campaign might see an opportunity in battleground Pennsylvania. After greeting the former president on the tarmac, Anuel AA, born Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago, endorsed Trump during his rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on Friday, telling Puerto Ricans to “stay united” and to “vote for Trump.” “I don’t know if these people know who the hell you are, but it’s good for the Puerto Rican vote. Every Puerto Rican is going to vote for Trump right now. We’ll take it,” Trump told several thousand attendees at the campaign rally while introducing the rapper. While the immediate crowd might not be familiar with the star, his magnitude as a reggaeton and rap artist likely won’t be lost on the likely target audience: young Puerto Rican voters and battleground state Latino voters at large. The 31-year-old rapper is a frequent feature on smash hits with artists like Bad Bunny — and a major artist in his own right with a social media following millions-strong to show for it. But the rapper’s appearance and brief remarks may also be part of a larger Trump campaign effort to court artists of color to engage voters in a new way. Trump has garnered the support of several notable Black artists — including rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black — and others like Sexxy Red have signaled their support for the former president in interviews. At a rally in the Bronx earlier this year, Trump brought up two local fixtures of the growing drill music scene: Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow. Even though Puerto Ricans who live on the island — despite being U.S. citizens — can only vote in presidential primaries and not in the general election, they can still influence relatives on the mainland. Pennsylvania, a state that doesn’t often first come to mind as a battleground with a sizable Latino vote, is home to the third-largest Puerto Rican diaspora community in the country (roughly 500,000 Puerto Ricans strong) after thousands fled the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Puerto Rican and Latino support for President Joe Biden proved crucial in cementing his successful 2020 campaign in the Keystone State, while over 60% of Latino voters nationwide broke for Biden over Trump, according to exit polls conducted at the time. Now, both sides of the ticket may see a path to victory in strengthening their margins in these growing diaspora communities. Earlier this summer, the Trump campaign opened a “Latino Americans for Trump” office in Reading, Pennsylvania, inviting former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuño to deliver remarks at its opening in both English and Spanish. Even Vice President Kamala Harris, before launching her own presidential bid following Biden’s decision to no longer seek re-election, took her first official trip to the island and toured housing developments made possible through $140 billion of infrastructure funding from the Biden-Harris administration. While the influence of any celebrity endorsement is hard to gauge, Anuel AA wading into the election on Trump’s behalf is significant — even if just as a pop culture moment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCelebrity endorsements in an election year are hardly a new phenomenon.

According to exit polls, Donald Trump won men by 8 percentage points (53% to Biden’s 45%) but lost women by 15 points (42% to Biden’s 57%)—a huge 23-point gender gap. That was before Trump’s largely handpicked Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion, and before the Democratic Party nominated a dynamic woman candidate to face a tired, grumpy Trump in 2024. The result: The latest Quinnipiac University poll has Vice President Kamala Harris winning women by 21 points (58% to Trump’s 37%), and Trump winning men by 18 points (57% to Harris’ 39%)—a yawning 39-point gender gap. That gap is on the larger side among recent polls, though. Emerson College’s recent swing-state polls show the difference in most states hovering around 20-25 points (much like it did in 2020), but pollsters might struggle to account for the recent massive increase in voter registration among women. There is a tsunami brewing among women voters. So what’s Trump doing about it? Making things worse for himself. Let us count the ways that the Trump campaign and conservatives have wooed women in the past two days. This Washington Post headline from Thursday kind of says it all: “Vance tells Harris to ‘go to hell’ for cemetery criticism she didn’t give.” Yes, telling successful, powerful women to go to hell is always a winner. Ladies love it when men attack them with that kind of language. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, already dug the ticket into a hole thanks to his bizarre obsession with a woman’s breeding status. You’d think he would be trying to mitigate that damage. Then there’s this from Mediaite also on Thursday: “‘Beyond Disgusting’: Radio Host Slammed For Calling Kamala Harris Power Hungry ‘Since The Moment She Got Up Off Her Knees’” Erick Erickson, the conservative radio host in question, is not a huge Trump fan. He is also self-righteously pious, but his supposed religiosity didn’t prevent him from saying something vile about our country’s first woman vice president. “Kamala Harris has done nothing but climb the ladder of power since the moment she got up off her knees in front of Willie Brown,” Erickson spewed. Attacking Harris’ short-lived relationship with the former San Francisco mayor is a common refrain in current right-wing discourse as frustration mounts with conservatives’ inability to land any real blows on her soaring campaign. Which voters are these Trump surrogates trying to sway with these kind of crass and sexist attacks? Yet, instead of backing off, they’re getting positive reinforcement from none other than Trump himself. On Truth Social, one noxious user posted an image containing a photo of Hillary Clinton and Harris as well as the comment “Funny how blowjobs impacted their careers differently…” Trump then shared the post with his followers on the site. And on Wednesday, CNN anchor Pamela Brown said it made her “stomach feel sick.” Moves like that amplify Trump’s sick, debased behavior in ways that, once again, won’t be helping him win votes. This also happened: They can’t help themselves, can they? And then there’s this week’s Arlington National Cemetery disgrace, where Trump and his team staged a campaign photo op in violation of federal law. And when a female cemetery official tried to stop them, she was literally shoved aside. “An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,” the U.S. Army said in a statement. Unfortunately, she is too terrified of Trump’s goons to press charges. But it all adds up politically. Trump is struggling to win a key demographic, but he can’t escape his own misogynistic impulses, nor the sexism at the root of his base. And the more momentum Harris builds, the uglier those attacks will be, perpetuating a vicious cycle that will serve Trump poorly through Election Day.","summary":"In 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was the beneficiary of a massive gender gap that propelled him to the White House.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Sean O'grady For Mailonline Published:23:57 BST, 31 August 2024 |Updated:23:57 BST, 31 August 2024 e-mail View comments Giovanni Pernice reportedly tried to call Amanda Abbington during the BBC's probe into claims of off-camera misconduct towards her on Strictly Come Dancing. The actress, 50, was paired with Italian ballroom specialist Giovanni, 33, for the long-running BBC show's 21st series in 2023, but abruptly withdrew just five weeks into the competition. Giovanni has since been suspended while a BBC probe is conducted over claims of off-camera misconduct made by Abbington, 50, and two other former celebrity dance partners. According to The Sun, Giovanni phoned Amanda just weeks after it emerged the investigation team were trying to find the footage of their rehearsals. A source said: 'Giovanni tried to call Amanda a few weeks ago. Nobody knows why. Giovanni Pernice reportedly tried to call Amanda Abbington during the BBC's probe into claims of off-camera misconduct towards her on Strictly Come Dancing The actress, 50, was paired with Italian ballroom specialist Giovanni, 33, for the long-running BBC show's 21st series in 2023, but abruptly withdrew just five weeks into the competition 'They've not spoken since she quit the show, so for him to call out of the blue, especially with an inquiry taking place, is very odd. 'Amanda didn't want to speak to him and blocked his number. She wants nothing to do with Giovanni.' The insider added that Amanda told her team Giovanni tried to contact her and they passed it on to the BBC executives in charge of the inquiry. Noting Giovanni hasn't tried to contact her since, the source said Strictly producers just want to move on from the scandal. MailOnline has contacted representatives for Giovanni Pernice and Amanda Abbington for comment. Amanda previously said she would 'cry and vomit' after returning home from rehearsals with Giovanni. Speaking to The Times, Abbington claims she has since received death threats from fans of the Italian dancer, whose long-term future on Strictly remains uncertain. She said: 'I've had the worst experience. The show was tough and horrible, but the aftermath of it I was not expecting. It's been really brutal and it just hasn't stopped. A source said Giovanni phoned Amanda just weeks after it emerged the investigation team were trying to find the footage of their rehearsals The insider said: 'They've not spoken since she quit the show, so for him to call out of the blue, especially with an inquiry taking place, is very odd' 'It's been awful, just relentless. Death threats and rape threats for just standing up for something that I thought was wrong.' The actress also admitted she would become nauseous after completing rehearsals with Pernice, a fan favourite who had appeared on Strictly for eight years prior to his suspension. Read More Strictly's scandal-hit year: All of the drama from beloved BBC show as it reaches 20th anniversary Amanda's husband Jonathan Goodwin, a former escapologist who was left paralysed in 2021 after a TV stunt went horribly wrong, also corroborated her claim of physical sickness. She added: 'He'd go, 'Yes, you would come home and you'd vomit, you'd cry, and you'd think you were not good enough. You were a shadow, a shell.'' The investigation that began with accusations against Giovanni has since widened after more complaints surrounding the hit show. It has heaped further turmoil on Strictly, which is deemed to be the jewel in the Corporation's crown and is still watched by more than ten million people. Sources have told the Mail that the accusations have prompted bosses to extend the inquiry to look at other matters, and individuals, involved with the dance series as they prepare for its 20th anniversary. It means that Giovanni, who has already let his frustrations at the investigation be known, faces an even longer wait for an outcome after three former dance partners, including Amanada, instructed lawyers to make 'serious complaints' about his conduct. It also threatens to damage Strictly, the BBC's biggest Saturday night success story since The Generation Game. A television source told the Mail: 'This investigation is no longer just solely about Giovanni but other, more wider issues. The show has been going for 20 years and the whole veneer of Strictly is so sparkly and lovely, of course there will always be people who feel hard done by. The insider added that Amanda told her team Giovanni tried to contact her and they passed it on to the BBC executives in charge of the inquiry 'Amanda's complaints have started something massive, it has opened the door for others to come forward about things they haven't been happy with. 'It is all a big headache for the BBC, it is about to celebrate a massive milestone with its 20th anniversary. 'Having the Giovanni complaint has been a big enough issue, but now it looks like there is more to be scrutinised and looked into.' Sources close to Giovanni say that he fully expects to be exonerated. Insiders say also that the widened inquiry will now present the Sicilian star as possibly being a 'small fish' in Strictly's potential downfall. He quit the show following claims by Amanada, star of Sherlock and Mr Selfridge, that he bullied her in training, claims which he denies. In May it was revealed that she had instructed London law firm Carter Ruck to represent her against the BBC. The BBC refused to comment on the matter but it did confirm in a statement that more than one complaint has been made. Fellow dancer Graziano Di Prima has since been sacked by the show following similar claims of inappropriate behaviour towards TV personality Zara McDermott, with whom he was paired in 2023. Confirming his departure on Instagram, Graziano wrote: 'I deeply regret the events that led to my departure from Strictly. My intense passion and determination to win might have affected my training regime. 'While respecting the BBC HR process, I acknowledge it's only right for the sake of the show that I step away. I am saddened that I wasn't allowed to offer a quote to the online news stories, and I take on board the sensitivity of the situation. 'There's more to this story that I am unable to discuss at this time, but I am committed to being strong for my family and friends. I wish the Strictly family nothing but success in the future.'

JD Vance. On Thursday, an Army spokesperson said an Arlington National Cemetery official was \"abruptly pushed aside\" while interacting with Trump's staff during a wreath-laying ceremony event Monday. The ceremony honored service members killed by ISIS-K terrorists Aug. 26, 2021, during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The U.S. Army said in a statement the employee was making sure that Trump's team was \"made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds.\" Trump claimed he took photographs with families of service members who had requested them. \"[President] Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent,\" Trump said during a speech in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Friday. \"And then they tell me that I used their graves for public relations services, and I didn’t.\" TRUMP IMPERSONATES ELON MUSK TALKING ABOUT ROCKETS: ‘I’M DOING A NEW STAINLESS STEEL HUB’ In a statement posted on Facebook Saturday afternoon, Harris accused Trump's team of disrespecting service members. \"As Vice President, I have had the privilege of visiting Arlington National Cemetery several times,\" the statement from the Democratic presidential nominee said. \"It is a solemn place; a place where we come together to honor American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service of this nation. It is not a place for politics. \"And yet, as was reported this week, Donald Trump’s team chose to film a video there, resulting in an altercation with cemetery staff,\" Harris added. \"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt.\" Harris claimed the incident was \"nothing new\" from Trump and accused the former president of \"call[ing] our fallen service members ‘suckers’ and ‘losers’ and disparage[ing] Medal of Honor recipients.\" \"This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,\" Harris added, before promising to \"never politicize\" service members. TRUMP-MUSK INTERVIEW: 5 BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO THE US BORDER CRISIS The statement was met with swift backlash from Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance, who suggested Harris \"get off social media.\" \"President Trump was there at the invitation of families whose loved ones died because of your incompetence,\" Vance wrote on X. \"Why don’t you get off social media and go launch an investigation into their unnecessary deaths?\" Karoline Leavitt, who served as an assistant press secretary during the Trump administration, also criticized Harris on social media. \"Kamala Harris bragged about being the last person in the room with Joe Biden when they decided on their terrible Afghanistan withdrawal plan,\" Leavitt wrote. \"Kamala’s stupidity led to one of the most embarrassing events in American history and 13 brave US soldiers being killed. \"She has never said their names. She has never reached out to their families,\" Leavitt added. \"For this alone, Kamala does not deserve to be elected.

The legal move comes a day after North Carolina’s board of elections voted 3-2 to deny Kennedy’s request to remove his name from the ballot. The board has a Democratic majority, and the vote was along party lines. According to the board’s executive director, Karen Brinson, North Carolina has already printed 1.73 million ballots in over 60 counties, and special ballots have already been prepared for overseas military members and the disabled. Kennedy suspended his presidential campaign on Aug. 23 and endorsed former President Donald Trump. He pledged to remain on the ballots in states not likely to be competitive while removing his name from ballots in states that will be.

The ruling came from Sarasota County Circuit Judge Hunter Carroll on Friday, who dismissed Truth Social’s arguments for a temporary injunction. \"Truth Social, officially known as Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.

Because Donald Trump is the controlling owner, he and the board view Trump Media as Trump's company. So, will Trump now ask the board for an exemption to sell some of his locked-up shares before the September unlocking date? He is allowed to do so.

Those disgruntled shareholders holding low cost or free stock may not take their time liquidating their deteriorating stockholdings. Current shareholders: Be sure you want to hold The new danger now is that the price will start sinking toward a fundamental-based level. Because that fundamental level is in the low single digits, the risk of hanging on looks significant. Why the single digits? Because the fundamentals are so low: Price per share: $19.50 Book value per share: $1.78 Cash per share: $1.77 Revenues per share: $0.03 Earnings per share: $(0.43) Quarterly revenue growth for 2nd quarter 2024 vs 2023: (30)% To improve those fundamentals is a hefty challenge. Not only does Trump Media need to shift revenue growth to positive, but it also must do so very significantly. In addition, it needs to control expense growth to become profitable. Accomplishing those heavy tasks, if possible, will take time, and there are no current fundamental improvements to show new investors as proof of such a capability. Therefore, something must happen to attract new investors when the unlocked selling is in full force, and that means the stock must become cheap enough to appeal to speculators. Without fundamental support, technical indicators must provide interest. The current, multi-week decline might provide short-term opportunities, but probably not until all the shares are unlocked and the unknown selling effect becomes visible. The graph below provides the picture of the stock's recent moves and the notable barriers that lie beneath. The question is, over the next three weeks, will those barriers provide support or will selling outweigh buying and push the price further down. (As I have described before, I believe the $17.50 barrier is an important emotional barrier because reaching that price means all the 2024 excitement and expectations are completely washed out.) Steady decline headed for Sept. 20 unlocking with multiple barriers below John Tobey The bottom line - Short-term speculation in the face of unknown adversity is high risk When the September 20 floodgates open, Trump Media stock selling will ramp up.

But the military said the staff member had \"acted with professionalism\" and it condemned the incident as \"unfortunate.\"Trump spoke at length at a rally Friday night about the cemetery incident and Afghanistan and said it was families of fallen troops who asked to have their picture taken with him.\"I said 'Absolutely.' I wasn't doing it for -- I don't need publicity, I get a lot of publicity. I would like to get a lot less publicity,\" Trump said in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.Trump blamed the White House for the criticism he is drawing. \"Joe Biden killed those young people because he was incompetent. And then they tell me that I used their graves for public relations purposes. And I didn't. And I'll tell you what, it was a disgrace,\" Trump said.Trump has made criticism of the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a keynote of his campaign, arguing that he would have managed it better.He visited the cemetery with families of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the last, chaotic hours of the US withdrawal.Trump's relationship with the military has long spawned controversy.While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while he was president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff.Harris's blunt response Saturday appeared to underline her determination to take the fight directly to Trump in what is shaping up to be a bruising presidential election. Trump has repeatedly mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance and racial identity, while the Harris campaign has replied that the former president is \"weird,\" an aspiring dictator, and \"out of his mind.\" Harris earlier faced withering criticism over the cemetery incident from Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance.Apparently responding to a mistaken report that Harris had already reacted to the visit, Vance accused her of feigning outrage and said, \"She can go to hell.\"\"Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing,\" he later told the Washington Post.At that point Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit. Kevin Carroll, who served as a senior aide to Trump's homeland security chief John Kelly, voiced scathing criticism of Trump's behavior in an opinion piece published Friday in The Guardian newspaper. \"The photo of a grinning Trump giving a jaunty thumbs-up over these patriots' graves is an indelible image of narcissism risen to the point of sociopathy,\" Carroll wrote.","summary":"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Saturday that her Republican rival Donald Trump \"disrespected sacred ground\" at a US military cemetery during a contentious pre-election visit.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/harris-trump-disrespected-sacred-ground-us-military-cemetery-1851089","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1858322/democratic-presidential-candidate-kamala-harris-said-her-republican-rival-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 22:12:07","author":"Brian Knowlton","authors":["Brian Knowlton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":255358726,"title":"Patrick Mahomes wishes pregnant wife Brittany happy birthday after Trump support social media controversy","text":"Patrick Mahomes didn't let a week of backlash against his wife for expressing support for Donald Trump through an Instagram post stop him from celebrating her birthday with an Instagram post himself.

He uses these really gross, really sexist, often racist and sexual-in-nature attacks. It does two things: It panders to his base and gets them riled up, and two, it seeks to create chaos around him and he can move into whatever space that is,” she said. “So the more that we see this movement by the Harris campaign, the more we see this enthusiasm, the more he is pushed to these all-time new lows.” JD Vance, Trump's running mate, justified the misogynistic remarks about Harris.

That role belongs to a bookish, little-known policy adviser named Blas Nuñez-Neto. A data-driven technocrat, Nuñez-Neto has helped engineer Biden’s pivot toward tougher border enforcement and sweeping restrictions on asylum — moves that contributed to a nearly 80 percent drop in illegal crossings since December. The transformation is shoring up one of Democrats’ biggest vulnerabilities ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election and potentially defusing a top-polling issue for Republican nominee Donald Trump. After three years of record crossings, the U.S.-Mexico border is quieter and more controlled today than at any point since late 2020, before Trump left office. Nuñez-Neto pulled that off by steering the administration back to a border policy framework Democrats used to embrace more easily, according to current and former administration officials. The formula: Be generous and welcoming to immigrants seeking to come lawfully, but stingy and firm with those who don’t. The White House declined to make Nuñez-Neto available for an interview. Biden officials said the administration’s border policy moves have been shaped by senior White House officials and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whom Nuñez-Neto worked for before being promoted to the White House in June. In a statement, White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández said Biden “believes it is a false choice to say we have to walk away from being an America that embraces immigration in order to secure our border.” “We must enforce our laws at the border and deliver consequences to those who do not have a legal basis to remain in the United States, and we must expand lawful pathways,” Fernández Hernández said. Nuñez-Neto’s policy approach embodies the political calculus that while most Americans remain favorably disposed toward immigrants, few things erode the welcoming spirit faster than an out-of-control border. The growing U.S. economy needs workers, too, and immigrants help offset declining U.S. birth rates. But how they arrive matters. Relying heavily on the president’s executive powers to grant entry using an authority known as parole, the Biden administration has been allowing nearly 75,000 migrants to enter each month through legal channels. Republican critics denounce those pathways as a “shell game,” arguing the administration is facilitating mass migration through doors that should not be opened in the first place. But the expansion — paired with the most severe restrictions on asylum eligibility at the border from a Democratic administration in decades — has corralled the disorder. Trump has largely ignored the change, displaying at his rallies a chart that shows record illegal crossings during Biden’s first three years and cuts out data showing the 2024 decline. He continues to label Harris, his Democratic opponent in the upcoming election, as the “border czar,” though she never held such a role. Biden tasked Harris with leading the administration’s plan to reduce Central American emigration by promoting investment and job creation, not to deal with immigration enforcement at the southern border. That task - arguably one of the least-desirable in a Democratic administration - would become Nuñez-Neto’s. A change in direction The Argentine-born Nuñez-Neto was working on border security issues at the Rand Corporation in early 2021 when DHS policy adviser David Shahoulian — one of the few voices in the administration urging tougher measures at the border — recommended him for a job. He became chief operating officer for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Trump’s rhetoric and harsh policies in the White House had galvanized immigration advocacy groups and many Democrats against enforcement and the very idea of deterrence as an element of border security. Biden loosened restrictions, fueling a perception that the border was more open even as officials — including Harris — told would-be migrants “do not come.” Shahoulian soon left the administration in frustration. In late 2021, Nuñez-Neto took over his role shaping border policy at DHS. More than a year later, as the administration ended the pandemic-era Title 42 border restrictions, Biden officials increasingly sought help from Mexico, Panama and other nations in the region to help contain migration and cooperate with U.S. policies. Nuñez-Neto took on a second role as DHS’s top international envoy. He became a major diplomatic asset: a bilingual U.S. official capable of explaining policy to Spanish-language media and speaking directly to Latin American officials. Nuñez-Neto developed an especially close partnership with Roberto Velasco, the top official at Mexico’s Foreign Ministry for North American affairs, according to current and former senior officials from both nations. Mexican authorities this year have arrested record numbers of migrants traveling through the country toward the U.S. border, a crackdown that Biden officials credit with sharply curtailing illegal crossings. Angela Kelley, a senior adviser at DHS until June 2022, said the Biden administration has worked to craft a careful balance of incentives and penalties — carrots and sticks. She had been a longtime advocate for asylum seekers, and worked to resist Trump’s policies. Nuñez-Neto was laser-focused on border crossings, checking enforcement data daily. “He’s more of a sticks guy, given his background,” said Kelley, now chief policy adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Nuñez-Neto was promoted to the White House as the president announced strict new emergency measures that have upended decades of asylum law, closing the border when crossings are high and essentially barring access to U.S. courts for migrants who enter the country illegally. The restrictions were made possible by a breakthrough agreement Nuñez-Neto helped negotiate with Velasco and other senior Mexican officials. It allows the United States to return large numbers of non-Mexican migrants back across the border — a crucial tool for agencies that have struggled to send deportees to Venezuela and other nations whose relations with Washington are strained. As the deterrence policies took shape, the number of migrants released into the United States with a pending asylum claim — the procedure decried as “catch and release” — plummeted. It was Nuñez-Neto, not someone from Harris’s team, who fielded questions about the measures from reporters and on Capitol Hill. “Those of us who follow the inside baseball of immigration know he’s the person that has become the de facto border czar,” said one policy adviser close to the administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe informal conversations with top officials. Nuñez-Neto has done so with a quiet, disciplined manner that is the stylistic opposite of swaggering Trump-era border officials. Some immigration advocates and activists have come to view him with scorn, as a border-cop-in-sheep’s-clothing who speaks of migrants sympathetically while orchestrating the kind of crackdown immigration hard-liners have only dreamed of. The sharp drop in illegal crossings has allowed the Harris campaign to go on offense. She blames Trump for sinking a bipartisan Senate bill last winter that would have provided billions in new funding for more border agents, detention capacity, deportation flights and other enforcement tools. She has called for Congress to pass the bill, and says she would sign it into law if she’s elected. But several of its toughest provisions — in particular the emergency asylum restrictions — are already in place. A young immigrant in Washington Nuñez-Neto was 11 and living in an apartment in the nation’s capital when he met Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, after winning an essay contest that asked sixth-graders how to make Washington a “special city for special people.” “Nobody is perfect,” wrote Nuñez-Neto, who had arrived in the country 2½ years earlier, according to a Washington Post article about the event in 1986. “But everyone is special. I could be more special by encouraging people and never saying bad words.” After graduate school Nuñez-Neto worked at the Congressional Research Service and then as an aide to Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), specializing in border security. He was hired as an adviser to the CBP commissioner in 2015, when record numbers of Central American families and unaccompanied minors had started streaming across the border in Texas, catching the Obama administration off-guard. The U.S. enforcement system had been primarily designed to contain mass migration by adult laborers, not families and children requesting humanitarian protection. But their right to do so is broadly protected under U.S. asylum law. Gil Kerlikowske, the CBP commissioner during Obama’s second term, said Nuñez-Neto became a trusted aide as the administration grappled with the problem. “We traveled all over the world together,” Kerlikowske said in an interview. “He was brilliant. His experience and knowledge are astronomical.” At one point during a trip to Poland, where U.S. officials were speaking with European border police about soaring numbers of asylum seekers, Nuñez-Neto urged Kerlikowske’s team to visit Treblinka, the site of a Nazi death camp. Kerlikowske said it was a sign to him of how seriously Nuñez-Neto took U.S. responsibilities to ensure migrants seeking U.S. refuge aren’t deported to face persecution or death. Rewriting the rules At DHS and then the White House, Nuñez-Neto has spent much of his time trying to subdue the forces that were set in motion during Biden’s first months in office. The low point came in fall 2021, when thousands of mostly Haitian migrants crossed the border near Del Rio, Tex., and set up a squalid camp on the banks of the Rio Grande. Just weeks after Biden’s chaotic troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the administration was suddenly facing a humanitarian crisis on U.S. soil. Many of the migrants had been living for years in Brazil and Chile before seizing the opportunity to make the dangerous journey north. “It was a huge wake-up call for all the countries along the route,” said former Biden immigration adviser Katie Tobin, who left the White House in February. “That was when we started negotiating a hemisphere-wide approach.” Tobin led the development of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, signed in 2022 by the United States and 21 other countries. It became the framework for a more collaborative model that treats migration as something to manage rather than simply repress. When Ukrainians started surging over the border after Russia’s invasion, Nuñez-Neto, Tobin and other Biden officials negotiated a deal with Mexico that allowed them to apply to enter the United States legally. When Venezuelan migration jumped, they developed a similar accord. Mexico made clear it would cooperate on tighter enforcement but wanted the United States to expand legal channels. The United States now offers nearly 1,500 appointments a day along the southern border to asylum seekers who register with the CBP One mobile app. Up to 30,000 citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela can apply each month to enter the United States legally with a financial sponsor. Nuñez-Neto and other Biden officials are restrained when describing the decline in illegal crossings. They have seen the numbers can spike quickly in response to changes in U.S. enforcement. And they recognize the strategy they’ve crafted rests on a wobbly foundation of fragile international accords and disputed executive actions that are facing challenges in federal court. “We are making progress,” said Fernández Hernández. “But long-term, the only lasting solution is for Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and pass the bipartisan border deal.”","summary":"A data-driven technocrat, this little-known adviser has helped engineer Biden’s pivot toward tougher border enforcement and sweeping restrictions on asylum — moves that contributed to a nearly 80 percent drop in illegal crossings since December.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-08-31/biden-border-policy-advisor-migrant-crossings-decline-15035227.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/k5gj4p-31082024bidenborderpolicyadvisormigrantcrossingsdeclinephotos01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/31082024bidenborderpolicyadvisormigrantcrossingsdeclinephotos01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:47:33","author":"Nick Miroff","authors":["Nick Miroff"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.026},{"id":255358920,"title":"Jude Law Battles Neo-Nazis in Real-Life Thriller ‘The Order’","text":"Modern domestic terrorism may have reached its peak with the January 6, 2021, insurrection in which members of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other white-nationalist groups attempted to aid Donald Trump’s quest to overthrow the presidential election, but its roots run far deeper. The Order, Jason Kurzel’s unnerving based-on-real-events drama, recounts one of the earliest skirmishes in the battle between law enforcement and hate groups intent on sowing civil disorder, focusing on an early 1980s organization that sought to instigate a race war. Featuring a standout performance by Jude Law as an FBI agent determined to prevent a tragic massacre, it’s a history lesson that compensates for a lack of breakneck thrills with ominous timeliness. As with Kurzel’s prior true-crime effort, 2021’s Nitram, The Order—premiering on Aug. 31 at the Venice Film Festival, after which it’ll appear at the Toronto International Film Festival—is a story about disaffected young white men traversing empty landscapes stained with hate and violence that fester and spread in the dusty sunlight. Moreover, it’s about children whose corrosive hearts and minds are unpredictable to strangers and unfathomable to parents, such that when Law’s Terry Husk visits the home of a suspected neo-Nazi, the young man’s father laments, “You think you have control over who they'’e going to be, but the truth is, you don’t. You try to protect them—that’s the best you can do. But you can't live their life for them.” Working from a script by Zach Baylin (based on Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt’s 1989 non-fiction book The Silent Brotherhood), Kurzel once again immerses himself in a world of rage and madness that’s scary precisely for being so clandestine. Husk rolls into Coeur D’Alene, Idaho in 1983 to man an FBI office that the local sheriff says hasn’t been operational in years. A quiet and uneventful outpost is ostensibly what Husk craves, in part because—as indicated by an early phone call home—it’s a final chance for him to reconnect with the estranged wife and daughters who’ve yet to relocate with him. Later conversations let slip that Husk previously worked undercover with the New York mafia and the KKK, and the wear and tear of those assignments is visible in his bleary eyes, downturned mouth, and slumped shoulders. Sporting a mustache surrounded by stubble that seems to epitomize his character’s haggard condition, Law oozes weariness. Nonetheless, he isn’t simply exhausted; he’s deeply angry and forlorn. In a superbly interior turn, the actor evokes the cause-and-effect relationship between Husk’s fury and misery, as well as his unextinguishable desire to fulfill his law-and-order mission—even at the expense of those he holds dear. Though The Order doesn’t press this point too heavily, the same can be said about Bob Mathews (Nicholas Hoult), a white supremacist whose gang is carrying out a string of daring crimes, beginning with a bank robbery that nets them close to $50,000. Husk learns about this incident and other bombings and stick-ups perpetrated by Mathews only after he asks the sheriff about the white-power flyers about town and gets some intel from officer Jamie Bowen (Tye Sheridan). According to Bowen, the flyers aren’t the sole thing being manufactured by the bigots; they’re also printing counterfeit bills. Thus, an investigation is born, and initially points the duo in the direction of the man who told Jamie about this fake-money scheme, whom The Order has already depicted being executed by Mathews’ henchmen. Hoult’s baddie is a true-believer who’s splintered off from his mentor, and he and his acolytes quickly become bolder and more lethal, as evidenced by their June 18, 1984, execution of Jewish radio DJ Alan Berg (Marc Maron)—a horrific slaying that ultimately earns the perpetrators David Lane (Phillip Forest Lewitski) and Bruce Pierce (Sebastian Pigott) hundreds of years behind bars. Kurzel ably establishes Mathews’ ethos, ruthlessness, and tangled relationships with his wife Debbie (Alison Oliver) and his pregnant mistress Zillah (Odessa Young). However, as with some of Husk and Bowen’s sleuthing (which is aided by Jurnee Smollett’s FBI agent Joanne Carney), it occasionally feels as if key connective tissue is missing from his tale. The Order isn’t confusing but it can be more than a tad wispy, including with regards to its heist and shootout sequences, which are frustratingly perfunctory. No matter the director’s evocative visuals– including a handful of propulsive shots from the corners of cars’ bumpers—the material is rarely exciting. Fortunately, it is often movingly morose, especially as Husk and Bowen start putting the pieces of this puzzle together, most of them having to do with The Turner Diaries, the infamous 1978 neo-Nazi novel that—as it did for many who followed in his wake, including Timothy McVeigh—functions as Mathews’ blueprint for tearing down contemporary American civilization and erecting a new white-nationalist world order. This despicable tome and its caustic influence are central to The Order’s story and atmosphere, and casts the proceedings as not simply a terrifying saga in its own right, but a prelude to the greater domestic calamities to come. Whereas Hoult’s Mathews is a generic (if vile) right-wing extremist who’s committed to preserving a rural, traditional, Caucasian way of life, The Turner Diaries proves the film’s genuine villain. As Husk and Bowen track Mathews across the Pacific Northwest, The Order becomes narratively diffuse, such that a late tragedy is rendered a relative afterthought. Trying to remain faithful to the historical record while simultaneously adding a few writerly flourishes—such as paralleling Husk and Mathews as kindred spirits—Baylin’s script splits the difference, thereby shortchanging everything. Still, as a primer on a formative phase of the United States’ white nationalist movement, as well as an eye-opening look at the means by which hateful rhetoric (spoken and written) inevitably begets brutal action, Kurzel’s latest is at once illuminating and chilling. Moreover, courtesy of Law, it exudes both a burning desire to call attention to this scourge—and to do something about it—as well as a dejected fear that, perhaps, the rot has already grown so severe and deep that nothing short of amputation will fix it.","summary":"Vertical EntertainmentModern domestic terrorism may have reached its peak with the January 6, 2021, insurrection in which members of the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and other white-nationalist groups attempted to aid Donald Trump’s quest to overthrow the presidential election, but its roots run far deeper.\n\nThe Order, Jason Kurzel’s unnerving based-on-real-events drama, recounts one of the earliest skirmishes in the battle between law enforcement and hate groups intent on sowing civil disorder, focusing on an early 1980s organization that sought to instigate a race war.

This is a man who has called our fallen service members “suckers” and ‘losers’ and disparaged Medal of Honor recipients,” Harris claimed. Trump has long denied making the “suckers” and “losers” comments cited in a 2020 story in The Atlantic. The US Army claimed Trump campaign staff members “ abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery official who tried to prevent staffers from capturing the former president participating in the ceremony on camera, according to federal law. There is no law against snapping photographs in the national ceremony, but a cemetery spokesperson told The Post that “federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign.” Section 60 holds the gravesites of the latest casualties to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, including three of the 13 US troops who were killed by an ISIS-K suicide bomber at the Kabul International Airport in August 2021. “Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” an Army spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. The Gold Star families of the 13 fallen soldiers killed during the withdrawal released a statement on Wednesday denying that they had trampled on Section 60 regulations and thanked Trump for “honoring our children and their fallen brothers and sisters.” “On the three-year anniversary of the Abbey Gate Bombing, the president and his team conducted themselves with nothing but the utmost respect and dignity for all of our service members, especially our beloved children,” they said.

Taylor Hoover, one of the three fallen service members buried at the military cemetery, told The Post that it was not a campaign event and that they had personally invited Trump to attend. The Trump campaign claimed the cemetery employee who interfered was “suffering from a mental health episode” and that there was “no physical altercation as described.”","summary":"“It is not a place for politics,” Harris said in lengthy a statement posted on social media Saturday afternoon.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/31/us-news/kamala-harris-blasts-donald-trump-over-arlington-national-cemetery-photo-op-political-stunt/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88675119.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pI0KLc55-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:43:51","author":"Patrick Reilly","authors":["Patrick Reilly"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":255356990,"title":"Harris steers clear of race, gender despite historic bid","text":"Kamala Harris is aiming to make history as America’s first Black and South Asian woman president — but she has not leaned into the prospect. Instead, Harris has steered well clear of mentioning race and gender during speeches, rallies and the first press conference of her lightning campaign. The 59-year-old Democrat has also refused to engage with Republican rival Donald Trump and his allies when they have tried to bait her by questioning her racial identity and making sexist attacks. Rather, Harris seems to be focusing on the broader excitement over her replacing President Joe Biden as candidate, and on issues like the cost of living that she believes voters care more about. Her reluctance to rely on her trailblazing status as a selling point was on full display when she and her running mate Tim Walz gave their first interview to CNN on Thursday. Harris was asked about a photo circulating of her grand-niece watching her Democratic National Convention speech in Chicago, which went viral as a symbol of the breaking of racial and gender barriers in America. But Harris was not biting. “I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” Harris told CNN. Harris was equally dismissive when asked about Trump’s inflammatory accusation that she leaned into her Black identity for political gain. “Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please,” she said with a laugh. ‘Precious time’: One reason for her approach is that Trump’s attacks are so far merely drawing attention to her history-making status, rather than damaging her, said Jesse J. Holland, an assistant professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University. “Why spend your precious time talking about things when your opponent’s doing it for you — and perhaps not successfully?” Holland told AFP. Harris is also helped by the fact that she is already a known quantity as the first ever Black, female and South Asian vice president, even if voters are still getting used to her as a presidential candidate. She has not shied away from talking about her background as the daughter of a Jamaican-born father and an Indian-born mother. She began her convention speech with a heartfelt tribute to her mother, a “brilliant, five-foot tall brown woman who taught her children to ‘never complain about injustice, but do something about it.'” But going further and explicitly ramming home a message on race and gender is not necessarily a vote winner across the board.","summary":"Kamala Harris is aiming to make history as America&#8217;s first Black and South Asian woman president &#8212; but she has not leaned into the prospect.

Lam characterised bilateral ties with China as a “top priority” and described his trip as “the affirmation of the Party and the Vietnamese government to value the relation[ship] with China”. The joint statement said the two ruling parties were carrying out a historic mission while striving for people’s well-being, national development and peace, reaffirming their commitment to deepen their comprehensive strategic partnership and building a China-Vietnam community with a shared future. During Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Hanoi in December, the two sides signed a series of cooperation documents in areas including infrastructure, trade and security, as well as reaching a historic milestone when they announced a China-Vietnam strategic community with a “shared future”, a recurring reference that potentially suggests Hanoi has aligned itself with Beijing’s vision. In December, Vietnam expressed its support for China’s Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilisation Initiative, saying these programmes were aimed at protecting common interests of all mankind, promoting peace and creating a better world. Hanoi has now agreed to step up cooperation within these frameworks, which could be seen as a diplomatic win for China. Lam’s pursuit of closer ties with China echoes that of his late predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong, who in February exchanged Lunar New Year greetings with Xi and wished for healthy development in the bilateral relationship to benefit the people and contribute to peace and stability. Earlier this month, Lam vowed not to make any changes to Vietnam’s foreign policy, and focus on advancing the country’s socioeconomic development goals. His trip to China shows he hasn’t strayed from that pledge. Soon after Lam’s election as party general secretary, US President Joe Biden sent a congratulatory message, expressing his and Vice-President Kamala Harris’ desire to work with him on advancing bilateral relations. But Washington’s message came as the Biden administration rejected Vietnam’s request to classify it as a market economy, despite upgrading bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership last September and hailing Hanoi’s “progress in [making] significant market-based economic reforms”. The rejection dealt a blow to Vietnam’s “bamboo diplomacy”, which seeks to balance ties between the US and China. The US decision could have prodded Vietnam into strengthening economic ties with China. However, the move is unlikely to inflict any significant damage to US-Vietnam relations, given that it enjoys a large trade surplus with the United States, at almost US$105 billion in 2023 and around US$56 billion for the first half of this year. China is Vietnam’s second-largest export market with bilateral trade amounting to about US$172 billion. However, its trade deficit with China rose by more than 56 per cent to over US$32 billion in the first five months of 2024, signalling the importance of the US as Vietnam’s largest export destination. Meanwhile, China is increasing its investments in Vietnam. Last year, it invested about US$4.5 billion in the Southeast Asian country, according to Vietnam’s Foreign Investment Agency, up 77.6 per cent from 2022. In the first seven months of 2024, Chinese investments in Vietnam surged more than sevenfold. Prior to the China-US trade war, many labour-intensive, low-valued-added industries had moved from China’s coastal areas to Vietnam. The trade war has provided Vietnam with an opportunity to take advantage of its geographic location and lure Chinese companies to relocate their production facilities and invest in advanced industries such as electronics and automotive components to help advance its economy and become a technological power. And not only does Vietnam seek to learn from China’s high-speed rail networks and link up with large Chinese development strategies, it also believes China has a key role to play in regional and global development. This was arguably reflected in Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh’s remarks during June’s World Economic Forum conference in Dalian, Liaoning province. Underlining China’s “important role” in the world’s development, he vowed to work with Beijing to build a “community with a shared future.” He also recalled a quote from Vietnamese revolutionary Ho Chi Minh to “congratulate China, thank China and learn from China”. Vietnam’s proximity to China, territorial disputes in the South China Sea, large deposits of rare earth minerals estimated at about US$3 trillion and its potential as an option for the US “friendshoring” strategy have sharply raised American interest in the region. Yet, by signing new deals with China, agreeing to deepen cooperation in defence and security, boost economic, trade and investment cooperation, and attempting to resolve territorial disputes, Vietnam is charting its own policy in a bid to make ensure it doesn’t miss the boat to become the world’s factory. US Undersecretary of State Uzra Zeya’s trip to Vietnam last week to “highlight the strength and dynamism of the US‐Vietnam relationship” seems to underscore an urgency within the Biden administration to ensure Hanoi does not get too close to Beijing. Vietnam’s “bamboo diplomacy” appears to be working, for now. However, that might all change should Donald Trump, who opened an investigation into Vietnam’s trade practices as president, return to the White House and test this diplomacy with his harsh rhetoric and punitive tariffs.

And this audience certainly was friendly. At this week’s “Joyful Warriors” summit in Washington, D.C., members of the three-year-old conservative organization attended a seminar on the history of Marxism and a session on abolishing the Department of Education—led by a contributor to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. They packed their tote bags full of pamphlets about “wokecraft” and the “toxic culture” in public schools. They wore bejeweled TRUMP hats and glittering American-flag pins. They stood in awe of a painting depicting Kamala Harris devouring the bloody corpse of a bald eagle. But right now, both Trump and Moms for Liberty are struggling to be relevant and relatable to American women. “The more popular you get, the devil will work harder on you,” Jessica Caiazzo, a member from Oahu, Hawaii, told me yesterday with a shrug, when I asked about the group’s combative reputation. Beelzebub has certainly been punching the clock. A Google search for Moms for Liberty in the past year would have yielded stories about not just significant election losses of candidates endorsed by the group, but a rape allegation, a ménage-à-trois scandal, and an ill-considered Adolf Hitler quote. Thanks to these developments, Moms for Liberty has lost momentum—something it has in common with Trump’s campaign in recent weeks. With Biden’s exit from the presidential race, the mantle of older, less coherent candidate has fallen on Trump. He has also spent the past few days fending off criticism that he is insufficiently pro-life, while simultaneously combating the perception that he and his running mate, J. D. Vance, are a threat to women’s rights. Moms for Liberty’s national summit, which was held just a few blocks from the White House, was slightly smaller this year, with some 600 attendees, compared with the roughly 700 who attended the group’s 2023 gathering in Philadelphia. That year had an impressive lineup of speakers, including not only Trump but also Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, and Ron DeSantis. The event also attracted major protests from progressive activists and some elected Democrats. This year was much quieter. Trump aside, the headliners were B-list: the former Democratic representative turned MAGA missionary Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, The Blaze’s Glenn Beck, and the actor Rob Schneider, of Deuce Bigalow fame. A hyped “March for Kids” evolved into a lackluster indoor assembly this morning. No protesters bothered to show up this week. But at least the Moms had Trump—though they seemed to want to keep him reined in, rather than give over their platform to one of his two-hour stream-of-consciousness monologues. His appearance last night was structured as a conversation with Tiffany Justice, one of the group’s co-founders—and she was not afraid to cut him off. Trump “reined in” is relative, and the conversation still meandered. Topics included: his daughter Ivanka (she could’ve been “a great ambassador to the United Nations … nobody could compete with her rat-tat-tat!”), his hit TV show The Apprentice (“It’s sort of Survivor with the asphalt-jungle aspect”), how he as president would treat transgender children (“Think of it: Your kid goes to school, and comes home a few days later with an operation”), and his recent visit to Arlington National Cemetery to highlight service members killed during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan (“These people were killed by Biden as far as I’m concerned”). At one point, Justice asked Trump to give members advice on running for office. “I always say, ‘Don’t do it!’” he replied. The crowd laughed, but Justice looked panicked: “No, run for office! We want you to run for office!” The group, after all, now needs all the energy and participation it can get. When Moms for Liberty was founded in Florida by Justice, Tina Descovich, and Bridget Ziegler in 2021, in direct response to pandemic school closures, it came in hot. Across the country, group members disrupted school-board meetings and helped vote out moderate and liberal officials. In 2022, roughly 47 percent of candidates endorsed by Moms for Liberty won their election, according to a Brookings Institution analysis. But by the following year, that number had shrunk to 33 percent (though Moms for Liberty disputes these figures). The same year, group members were photographed posing with Proud Boys, and one chapter leader quoted Hitler in a newsletter. Late last year, news broke that Ziegler’s husband, the chair of the Florida Republican Party, had been accused of rape by a woman with whom the couple had allegedly had a three-way sexual encounter. Last week’s GOP primary elections in Florida were not a great sign for the group’s 2024 progress: Six of its endorsed candidates lost, three won, and five went into runoff elections. In two counties where Republican voters outnumber Democrats two to one, four Moms for Liberty candidates were sent packing. These setbacks were a sharp reversal of the group’s earlier success. “If you have a low profile, you can get a relatively small number of people to vote for your candidates, and you can actually flip school-board seats,” given the low turnout in such elections, Jon Valant, the director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at Brookings, told me. “What happened to [Moms for Liberty] is that, as people got to know them a bit better and the scandals started occurring, the brand grew more toxic.” The group’s initial complaints about coronavirus closures caught the public mood at the time, but the Moms’ focus soon evolved into efforts to remove from schools books seen as progressive or subversive and to restrict lessons on sexuality and the legacy of slavery in America—issues, Valant said, that are far less popular. For candidates to have the Moms for Liberty brand attached now is “probably doing them just as much harm as good.” The upcoming presidential election is poised to have the largest gender gap in history, and given his deficit with women voters, Trump is probably glad to appear in front of any enthusiastic female audience. But last night, he didn’t mention any of his latest attempts to get women to support the Republican ticket. He did not, for example, reassert his rather frantic promise that he “will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” nor did he attempt to clarify his position on a Florida abortion amendment after his apparent flip and subsequent intense pressure from pro-life leaders. Trump also neglected to repeat his offhanded pledge earlier this week to make IVF treatment free for all Americans, a response to accusations that he and Vance oppose the practice. Of course, the Moms for Liberty didn’t need to hear any of that. These members love Trump no matter what. To them, he is Goldilocks on abortion—not too prohibitive, not too permissive, but somewhere just right. “He literally just said no to federal [restrictions], and if you are a true Republican or even a libertarian, the government should not rule you and tell you what to do,” Caiazzo, the member from Hawaii, told me. Trump is “saying his truth,” another attendee, Jennifer White of Round Rock, Texas, told me. Like Trump, she said, “I am pro-life, but I do understand and I do have compassion about rape and incest and a mother’s life.” Plus, White added, maybe Vance has a point about childless women. Kamala Harris “has never birthed a baby,” she said. “I have a hard time with people who may not have children who want to parent my children.” Onstage, Trump would have kept talking about his troubled interaction at Arlington cemetery, but right around 10 p.m., Justice wisely interrupted him. “Sir, thank you for loving the American people, and thank you for working to make America great again,” she said, beaming at him. Moms for Liberty has said it plans to spend more than $3 million in key battleground states ahead of the presidential election. And although the organization typically endorses only school-board candidates, Justice told Trump last night, “I wanna tell you personally, sir, that I endorse you for president of the United States.” The room erupted in cheers, Trump looked pleased, and the two began to dance to a Trump favorite, the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” The women in the audience were happy to see them side by side. But these aren’t the women Trump needs to win over.","summary":"Way behind in polls of female voters, the GOP nominee found an audience that liked him with Moms for Liberty.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/08/donald-trump-moms-for-liberty/679683/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8xpJ2bJVbkGSzMYavRfKGoiT8zo=/0x53:2496x1353/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/08/AP24244078608264/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:23:00","author":"Elaine Godfrey","authors":["Elaine Godfrey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0},{"id":255360044,"title":"Trump, special counsel duel over next steps in Jan. 6 prosecution","text":"The special counsel’s office and Donald Trump outlined dueling visions Friday for how the former president’s 2020 election obstruction case should proceed in D.C. federal court, with Trump’s attorneys proposing a schedule that would extend pretrial arguments into next year and neither side pushing for resolution before the November election. In a joint filing Friday night, both sides previewed legal wrangling that is likely to drag the case out deep into 2025 or beyond. The filing came after U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan requested a proposed plan for how to resolve legal issues in the case after the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 along ideological lines that presidents are absolutely immune from prosecution when carrying out their core constitutional powers. The ruling prompted special counsel Jack Smith this week to seek a superseding indictment in the case, removing elements of the original indictment that might run afoul of the Supreme Court’s guidance. It will be up to Chutkan to determine what acts laid out in the indictment can still be prosecuted. Although the Supreme Court determined presidents had broad immunity, it said they could still be prosecuted for private conduct or for official acts under certain exceptions. Whatever Chutkan decides could face higher-level court review. In Smith’s revised indictment, prosecutors kept the same four counts of plotting to subvert the results of the election that Trump was charged with in August 2023. But the special counsel dropped some allegations that the high court said intruded on core executive-branch powers and sharpened others that the justices said might be prosecutable as the actions of a candidate for president, rather than an officeholder. Prosecutors with Smith’s office did not outline a specific timetable on which they thought the case should proceed. But they said Chutkan should tackle “first and foremost” whether Trump might be immune from allegations in the new indictment and whether evidence that prosecutors plan to use at trial may be off-limits to the government. Prosecutors said they are ready to submit an opening brief “promptly” that would detail why Trump’s private conduct as a candidate is prosecutable, and make a case for why even some of his official conduct as president should not be shielded. Smith’s office said Chutkan should resolve immunity questions all at once before or at the same time as Trump’s other challenges. That is because the outcome of her decisions about what allegations and evidence the government may use could affect her rulings on Trump’s other claims, and because rendering immunity decisions one at a time could give the defense repeated opportunities to appeal, paralyzing the case, prosecutors argued. Trump’s attorneys, meanwhile, said they would move to dismiss his revised indictment, arguing that even the new grand jury that recently returned it was exposed to immunized conduct. They proposed only one action before Election Day on Nov. 5, filing a challenge to Smith’s appointment as special counsel. U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon in Florida had thrown out a separate case over Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified materials, ruling that Smith was unlawfully appointed — a decision criticized by outside experts as breaking with precedent. Smith has appealed. Trump’s attorneys proposed a Dec. 2 hearing on that claim in the D.C. case. Separately, his defense proposed by Dec. 13 to file its challenge to the indictment and to two obstruction counts in it. Their schedule extended into January 2025, noting the possibility of spring and fall hearings that year “if necessary.” Chutkan has set a hearing Thursday to discuss the way forward in the case — the first before the trial judge in the case in Washington since October 2023. Trump is not expected to attend in person but may participate by video teleconference, said a court official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.","summary":"The dueling plans reflect changes to the indictment and case, after the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 along ideological lines that presidents are immune from prosecution when carrying out their core constitutional powers.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2024-08-31/trump-special-counsel-jan-6-prosecution-15034995.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/d9brdf-ap24239707952537.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP24239707952537.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:17:54","author":"Spencer S.

Two years later, Joe Manchin was reelected to his senate seat as a Democrat in the Mountain state. Today, Justice is a Republican poised to flip that seat and maybe the Senate itself. No state better represents the anachronistic Democratic Party of the 20th century than West Virginia, nor has any state retained so many of these dinosaurs for so long. But that seems about to change as the new Democrats abandon the center. WEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR BLAMES POLITICS FOR SUDDEN BANK AUCTION OF $50M RESORT AMID KEY SENATE BID I was invited to breakfast at a Chick-fil-A with about eight or nine guys ranging from their 20s to early 50s who meet up to talk about theology mainly, and a little politics. Aside from my confusion as the only Roman Catholic present as to the detailed intricacies of Annabaptist belief, I was struck by the fact that 25 years ago at least half these guys would have been Democrats. Thirty-five years ago, they all would have been. This was blue, union, West by God Virginia back then. It featured the kind of conservative Democrat who you just don’t see much of anymore. One of the men I met was a new pastor at a local church who only moved to the Eastern Panhandle about a month ago. Frocked, he gave the blessing over our meal, as loud as you like in the middle of a fast-food restaurant, and it was great. Nobody thought it strange at all. The good pastor was from Mississippi and was asked by one of the fellas how he felt about the Confederate battle flag being removed from the state flag back in 2020. He had supported the decision at the time, on the basis of, why give offense? But then he saw how slippery that slope had become with the toppling of Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt statues, just as Donald Trump had warned of. But he had more to say, \"Yes, there is racism, I saw it, it's real, but it diminishes with every generation.\" The newcomer was pronouncing exactly the kind of nuance that the West Virginia Democrat had long embodied. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The last ticket topper for the party of Jefferson and Jackson to win West Virginia in a presidential race was son of the south Bill Clinton in 1996. The 2000 election was razor-thin. Since then, the Old Dominion’s younger and victorious sibling is not a swing state, but a weird, centrist senator state, and according to the guy who invited me, Jim Justice might just keep it that way. \"He used to be a Democrat,\" my buddy said, \"Do you think he could be a GOP version of Joe Manchin?\" I parried. \"Yeah, I do,\" he replied. \"You think Manchin could've beaten him if he ran?\" I persisted. \"No, but it's closer,\" he said. West Virginia is not a swing state, but it borders Pennsylvania and Virginia, and the people you meet here might out Herod Herod in terms of embodying the swing state mentality. Who gets the job done is the question. It's why Maryland Republican Larry Hogan is tied for the Senate seat next door in blue crab cake country.

I love fracking, I frack in my own backyard right next to the chili peppers Walz can’t eat.\" But her party, and its arrogance and elitism, may have already closed the door on these once-Democrat West Virgnians, and their swing-state cousins.

Aside from the topics he covered, one aspect of his interview struck out. Fans were quite responsive to the interview — as well as Trump's trademark interview attire. He was wearing his trademark long red tie, but it went down to below his stomach. The true reason for the lengthy tie wasn't made public until the publication of former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie's memoir, Let Me Finish. According to his book, Trump seemed to believe that wearing a lengthy tie makes one's physique seem thinner. The Guardian reported that apparently, Trump had also encouraged Christie to wear longer ties to look slimmer when they met during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign. The online community has been abuzz over Trump's lengthy red tie for what seems like an eternity. There is even an X (formerly Twitter) page devoted to the real estate mogul's ties, complete with all the associated memes. Additionally, one thing that stands out about Trump's tie collection is that most of his ties are in the color red. What's worth noting is that the red tie, which originated in the 1980s with corporate attitudes, is a powerful symbol, according to a 2017 article by Racked. However, the colors of Trump's ties aren't always the deciding factor. A very Freudian perspective on the length of those ties was also stated by a few publications. The HuffPost also developed their examination of the lengthy 'ties' before Christie's book was released. According to the outlet, the tie (and its length) is clearly associated with the size of the... masculine body. An exceptionally long tie, therefore, would represent a man's wish to project an unnaturally masculine image of himself, as it could be perceived as a phallic symbol. On the other hand, if one wants to seem young, a bowtie would be the way to go. After all, little boys often don bow ties when they are initially dressed in more formal attire. The article also included some analysis and said that Trump purposefully adjusted his tie style to make his tie seem longer. This might be done to highlight his lower physique or to hide his larger-than-desired midsection. Nevertheless, Trump's tie length has been the target of much ridicule during his administration. Some remarks made on X at the time include, \"WHY IS TRUMP'S TIE SO LONG? Is that normal? It's really bothering me.\" Another critic mocked his tie and added, \"Trump's tie is a good 6 inches too long. It's touching the chair when he sits down. How does this continue to happen?\" One more critique of Trump's fashion added, \"As it’s claimed Donald Trump wears long ties to make himself look thinner, experts say not ordering a thousand Big Macs will have the same effect.\" Yet another reviewer stated, \"Trump is not fooling anyone. We all know he wears his ties extra long so he doesn't look fatter than he already does!!!\"","summary":"Donald Trump&#39;s clothing choices once sparked controversy and exposed a new side of the former president.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/when-trumps-weird-outfit-meant-to-make-him-look-slimmer-in-stephen-colbert-interview-fell-flat","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/712778/uploads/590daa30-677f-11ef-9763-1fa2f22f6ab6_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Priyanka Pandey","authors":["INQUISITR","Priyanka Pandey"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":255356660,"title":"Jude Law on the hunt for white supremacists in new film","text":"Jude Law's latest movie at the Venice Film Festival, a true story of white supremacists plotting a race war, is one that \"needed to be made now\", its star said Saturday. \"The Order\", directed by Australian director Justin Kurzel, stars the British actor as a gruff FBI agent in the Pacific Northwest confronted with a splinter group of the Aryan Nations which is building a militia to wage war on the American government. \"Sadly, the relevance I think speaks for itself,\" Law told journalists ahead of the movie's premiere Saturday. \"It felt also like a piece of work that needed to be made now. It's always interesting looking back but it's also interesting finding a piece from the past that has some relationship to the present day,\" said the actor. The film -- one of 21 competing for the top Golden Lion prize at the prestigious festival -- is based on the real-life group of the same name which operated in Washington and Idaho in 1983-1984 under its leader Robert Mathews. \"What amazed me was that it was a story I hadn't heard of before,\" confessed Law, known for a string of leading roles including \"The Young Pope\" and \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\". The threat from violent, extremist far-right groups is in the forefront this year after a summer of anti-immigrant violence and riots in Britain, the worst since 2011. There are also concerns of a repeat of the January 6, 2021 Capitol Hill attack -- whose rioters included white nationalists and other extremist groups -- if former U.S. President Donald Trump loses the election in November. The 40-year-old true story provided the filmmakers with a way to \"have a conversation with today's politics\" given that the film is about \"an ideology that’s incredibly dangerous and how it can quickly take seed,\" said director Kurzel. Kurzel, whose most recent \"Nitram” won a 2021 Best Actor award at Cannes for actor Caleb Landry Jones, has called his latest film \"a manhunt into the depths of that hate, a foreshadowing of a divided America, a warning shot of what has been and what may come.\" That hate is seen straight away at the top of the film when a Denver radio talk show host berates a caller who has been goading him for being Jewish. \"You're too inept to get by in the world so you try to curtail the enjoyment of others,\" says host Alan Berg, who will later become a victim of The Order as part of their quest for racial purity. Meanwhile, the group has been robbing banks and printing counterfeit money to build its army against the state. FBI agent Terry Husk (Law) makes a connection between \"White Power\" flyers going up in town and the robberies and armoured car heists, realising he is up against a dangerous splinter group with Butler as its young, charismatic leader, played by Nicholas Hoult. With a young sheriff deputy Jamie Bowen (Tye Sheridan) at his side, Husk begins tracking the elusive leader, who has in his sights far more serious crimes, from attacks on government institutions to assassinations. \"What was shocking to me and I think to all of us here was there were so many comparisons and I think so many things within the film were the seed and the germination of today and many of the challenges we face,\" said Kurzel of his latest film. \"I think we live in a time now that was reflected in the film where there is division and there’s a lot of conversation about the future and ideologies,\" he said. The Order's leader Mathews, who died in a fire in a stand-off with law enforcement officers in December 1984, had a particular ability of \"speaking to the disenfranchised, those who feel invisible, who are unheard,\" said Kurzel. \"That voice... can very dangerously start to exploit that vulnerability. I think that’s a timeless thing.\" © 2024 AFP","summary":"Jude Law's latest movie at the Venice Film Festival, a true story of white supremacists plotting a race war, is one that &quot;needed to be made now&quot;, its…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/jude-law-on-the-hunt-for-white-supremacists-in-venice-film","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/8e/b9/648979de2bb020baadc14e968a82b1901422/8eb9648979de2bb020baadc14e968a82b1901422/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:14:15","author":"Alexandria Sage,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Alexandria Sage","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.289},{"id":255356684,"title":"Harris calls Trump cemetery visit disrespectful, political stunt","text":"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Saturday over a visit he made to soldiers' graves at Arlington National Cemetery that was later used in campaign video footage. \"It is a solemn place; a place where we come together to honor American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service of this nation. It is not a place for politics,\" Harris wrote in an X post. The vice president weighed in five days after Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony on Monday honoring the 13 service members killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. He also visited Section 60 of the Virginia cemetery, which the military considers hallowed ground. Federal law and Pentagon policies do not allow political activities in that section, but Trump's campaign took videos and used them in advertisements as he battles Democrat Harris in a close race for the White House. Trump's visit drew criticism from some veterans and soldiers' relatives. The U.S. Army on Friday defended a cemetery employee who was pushed aside at Section 60, saying she acted professionally and was being unfairly attacked. \"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,\" Harris wrote. Trump vice presidential pick JD Vance and press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded to Harris' post with their own that referenced the Afghanistan pullout and accused Harris of being insensitive to the servicemembers who died there. \"Why don’t you get off social media and go launch an investigation into their unnecessary deaths?\" Vance wrote. Trump used the third anniversary on Monday of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan to try to pin the chaotic pullout under President Joe Biden on his vice president. Harris, 59, became the Democratic nominee in the Nov 5 presidential election after Biden, 81, pulled out of the race in July. The vice president's response to the Trump cemetery visit may give a clue to how she would handle the topic in their upcoming Sept 10 debate. Harris referred to Trump's history of insulting military veterans. \"This is nothing new from Donald Trump. This is a man who has called our fallen service members 'suckers' and 'losers' and disparaged Medal of Honor recipients,\" she wrote. Trump once said the late Senator John McCain, a former Republican presidential candidate, was not a war hero even though he spent years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam after being shot down while a Navy pilot. Trump referred to fallen World War One veterans as \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" according to his former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general. It was unclear whether such incidents would sway the veterans vote. In an April report, the Pew Research Center found that military veterans favor the Republican Party. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Republican presidential rival Donald Trump on Saturday over a visit he made to soldiers' graves at Arlington National Cemetery that was later…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/harris-calls-trump-cemetery-visit-disrespectful-political-stunt","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2a/c4/92b655eb9ba49c1c05d119ba06ca64cdfd30/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:12:04","author":"Doina Chiacu,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Doina Chiacu","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.321},{"id":255355636,"title":"Donald Trump suggests he’ll support ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana in Florida","text":"Former President Donald Trump signaled support Saturday for a ballot measure in his adopted home state of Florida that would legalize recreational marijuana — but demanded lawmakers craft legislation that would also public toking. Trump characterized the passage of the ballot measure, known as Amendment 3, as a foregone conclusion, questioning the need to criminalize pot given its legal status elsewhere. “Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters, so it should be done correctly,” the Republican presidential candidate wrote on Truth Social. “We need the State Legislature to responsibly create laws that prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat run Cities.” The former president said his stance on Amendment 3 is part of his campaign’s law and order platform, insisting criminalizing cannabis will “ruin lives & waste Taxpayer Dollars [by] arresting adults with personal amounts of it on them.” “No one should grieve a loved one because they died from fentanyl-laced marijuana,” he added. Trump did not say explicitly how he would vote on the ballot measure, but his seeming endorsement puts him at odds with a number of other Republican lawmakers who oppose legal pot in the Sunshine State, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. On Wednesday, DeSantis slammed the marijuana legalization initiative as “bad policy and even worse constitutional law.” Public polling shows a majority of Florida voters back legalizing cannabis, although the ballot measure will at least 60 percent support to pass under state law. The initiative legalize the possession and purchase of up to three ounces of marijuana by adults 21 or older for recreational use.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump hinted his support for a ballot measure in his home state of Florida that would legalize recreational marijuana.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/31/us-news/donald-trump-suggests-endorsement-of-legal-weed-in-florida/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88668398.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mtebru6C-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:06:23","author":"Matthew Sedacca","authors":["Matthew Sedacca"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":255356376,"title":"Trump \"Disrespected Sacred Ground' At US Military Cemetery: Kamala Harris","text":"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris said Saturday that her Republican rival Donald Trump \"disrespected sacred ground\" at a US military cemetery during a contentious pre-election visit. Trump's presence at the hallowed Arlington National Cemetery -- intended to provide a campaign boost ahead of the November 5 vote -- has instead mushroomed into a public dispute consuming the candidates and the military. \"Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,\" Harris said of Monday's incident at the cemetery near Washington, where Trump defied the rules and posed for photos with relatives of US service members killed in Afghanistan. In one image, he is standing with family members of a fallen Marine, posing among headstones while grinning broadly and giving a thumbs-up. \"If there is one thing on which we as Americans can all agree, it is that our veterans, military families, and service members should be honored, never disparaged, and treated with nothing less than our highest respect and gratitude,\" Harris wrote on X. 'Abruptly pushed aside' On Thursday, the US Army issued a rare statement confirming that a cemetery staff member had been \"abruptly pushed aside\" after asking Trump's team to stop filming in a burial section for those killed in recent wars, where photography for political purposes is banned. Trump's campaign team has gone on the offensive by describing the employee as a \"despicable individual\" and claiming she was suffering a mental health episode. But the military said the staff member had \"acted with professionalism\" and it condemned the incident as \"unfortunate.\" Trump has made criticism of the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the US retreat from Afghanistan a keynote of his campaign, arguing that he would have managed it better. He visited the cemetery with families of some of the 13 service members killed in a 2021 bombing in Kabul during the last, chaotic hours of the US withdrawal. Trump's relationship with the military has long spawned controversy. While often touting his support for the armed forces, he privately mocked the war dead while he was president and did not want to be seen near military amputees, according to his former chief of staff. Harris's blunt response Saturday over the cemetery incident appeared to underline her determination to take the fight directly to Trump in what is shaping up to be a bruising presidential election. Trump has repeatedly mocked Harris's name, intelligence, appearance and racial identity, while the Harris campaign has replied that the former president is \"weird,\" an aspiring dictator, and \"out of his mind.\" Harris earlier faced withering criticism over the cemetery incident from Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, who has launched a series of fierce attacks against the vice president. Apparently responding to a mistaken report that Harris had already reacted to the cemetery visit, Vance accused her of feigning outrage and said, \"She can go to hell.\" \"Don't focus on Donald Trump showing up to grieve with some people who lost their children. Focus on your own job. Don't do this fake outrage thing,\" he later told the Washington Post. At that point Harris had not publicly mentioned the cemetery visit.

Biden sat near a blue umbrella wearing a black hat and Philadelphia Eagles T-shirt while talking on the phone and waving at the cameras on Saturday. The First Lady appeared relaxed with the sleeves of her white dress rolled up and hair tired back in a gray baseball cap. The 81-year-old president, who vowed he was committed to seeing out the remaining months of his term, has been facing criticism for spending so much time at the beach. ‘Who is running the country?’ Texas congressman Wesley Hunt said on X on Thursday. ‘Joe Biden is on his second vacation in two weeks and Kamala Harris is preparing for her first interview in 40 days.’ Biden arrived in Rehoboth Beach on Sunday after spending a week at an 8,000-acre ranch in Santa Ynez, California. The couple – along with their children and grandchildren – stayed at a California ranch owned by Democratic donor billionaire Joe Kiani. The property sits about three hours north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara wine country. Kiani has been a major donor to Biden’s campaigns and a friend to the family. Hunter Biden paid a visit to the $50 million vineyard property last year. Dubbed the ‘Kiani Preserve,’ the 8,000 acres has its own private vineyard, donkeys and a cattle herd. However, the White House has defended Biden’s two-week break, saying he is in charge and running the country from his vacation locations. ‘The president is on vacation, but you can never unplug and from a job like that. Nor does he try to,’ National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday in a zoom briefing with reporters. ‘He’s very much in command,’ he noted of Biden. He pointed out Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as proof the president is working. He’ll be in Rehoboth until Monday, when he joins Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh for a campaign event. Biden is on his 114th visit to Delaware spanning all or part of 328 days, according to journalist Mark Knoeller who tracks presidential travel. That is much more when compared to Donald Trump at a similar point in office: he spent 51 visits and 240 days at either of his estates in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, or Bedminster, New Jersey. Biden will hit the road next week, heading to Wisconsin on Thursday to talk about his administration’s push to lower costs for Americans. Wisconsin in a critical battleground state for Democrats in the 2024 election. Biden is no longer on the ballot but can talk about what he and Kamala Harris have done to help the country. During his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Biden said he was acting for the good of the country, and that he was ‘going to be working like hell’ before his term ended. He added that serving as Commander-in-Chief has been the ‘honor of my lifetime’ and that he has ‘a lot to do’ in his last five months in office. ‘I’ve got a lot to do – I intend to get it done,’ he said. Biden exited the presidential race on July 21 after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump, which led to concerns about his mental abilities. ‘Over the next six months, I’ll be focused on doing my job as president,’ Biden said in his July 24 Oval Office address.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden was spotted with First Lady Jill Biden on the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden goes back to the BEACH for the second weekend in a row, despite promising to work hard at the DNC. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-goes-back-to-the-beach-for-the-second-weekend-in-a-row-despite-promising-to-work-hard-at-the-dnc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Biden-returns-to-the-BEACH-for-second.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:02:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":255355622,"title":"6 Million Viewers Watch CNN Interview With Harris And Walz","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Minnesota Gov.

Asked by Bash about policy shifts she’s made on issues including fracking, Harris said her “values have not changed” and she said she would include a diversity of opinion in the White House should she be elected in November. \"You mentioned the Green New Deal,” Harris told Bash. “I have always believed, and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension, the globe, around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example.

It could give Harris a chance at history","text":"by Errin Haines for The 19th With 70 days to go until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is now within striking distance of becoming America’s 47th president. For some, the moment seemed implausible just over a month ago — and that was not lost on Harris as she accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president. “America, the path that led me here in recent weeks, was no doubt unexpected,” Harris told voters Thursday, the final night of the Democratic National Convention. “But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys.” In record time, Harris has gone from running mate to candidate, from overlooked to undeniable as the Democratic Party’s standard bearer. The circumstances of Harris’ historic run, like the 2024 election cycle, have been unconventional, a combination of luck — good and bad — preparation, and an unprecedented political climate. Now, for the second time in less than a decade — and the second time ever — a woman is at the top of the ticket for a major American political party. Biden’s decision to drop out, thrusting Harris into the campaign and allowing her to ride a wave of joy and momentum, has created a situation singular in American politics. For many reasons, this couldn’t have happened any other way: In an electorate that has never made a woman president and only once gone for a non-White presidential candidate, many are suddenly excited about a candidate who’s a woman of color, in part because she holds both of these identities. The unusual nature of the race is a positive, said Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president and the first woman to win a major party’s nomination. “A short campaign, a dramatic exit and entrance … I think all of that works to her advantage, because it captured the imagination of people,” Clinton said. “The country is certainly paying attention to her. It’s a real tribute to her and the way that she just leapt onto the scene, took control of it, showed how effective she was from the very beginning.” Clinton’s path to the nomination was not entirely normal, either. Like others who have run for president, she was a former senator and secretary of state, but unlike others, she was a former first lady. And she emerged as her party’s pick after a contentious 2016 primary election where questions around her “likeability” dogged her candidacy. While vice presidents have often gone on to seek the top job, Harris’ path is unique. She did not have to wait eight years after a failed primary bid to run again. She didn’t face off against Democrats for the nomination, a process that often can push candidates to the left, a potential liability in a general election, and open them up to intense scrutiny from the press. Instead, Democrats got clarity: a choice that is not only about deciding whether to vote for the woman, but whether or not they will support their party’s nominee. That Harris is running a campaign lasting 107 days — and not the traditional race that lasts more than a year and includes an open primary contest with potential challengers — has unique advantages and pitfalls. Democratic strategist Karen Finney pointed out that the first 48 hours, with Harris also doing the work of calling delegates and donors, was critical to setting a tone and ensuring a smooth process. But, she added, the shorter timetable means Harris doesn’t have a lot of room for error. “There are people who wouldn't have been able to step up that quickly and continue to win the day,” Finney said. “But also, you don’t have a lot of time to recover from missteps.” The collapsed timeline doesn’t give the candidate time to overthink or the country time to fall into sexist patterns, which both have done in the past. And in the weeks since Harris has been his opponent, Trump has struggled to define her, his traditional playbook of racial and gendered attacks falling flat. “Donald Trump, for better or worse, has been quite good at getting things to stick to people,” said Prairie View A&M University political scientist Melanye Price. “The longer he repeats the things he says, the more likely it is that somehow, that starts to seep into the narrative of the nation. The less time he has to figure out how to effectively campaign against her, the better it’s going to be for her and more likely it’ll be that those on the fence voters won’t have time for his toxicity to metastasize.” Harris and her campaign have also been on offense, fighting on ground she has defined with her messaging, shaping her own narrative and vision through her campaign events and at the convention. Still looming on the election schedule for Harris are two potential political challenges: a presidential debate currently scheduled for September 10 and her first sit-down press interview, which her campaign has said will happen by the end of August. Those working to help elect Harris, who have already been collaborating and strategizing but who now have a new candidate and fresh energy, see the rushed calendar as a plus. “It’s kind of like there’s this sense of urgency that forces everyone to see that we have to dig deep for these next 10 weeks, that we have to go now,” said Stefanie Brown James, co-founder and executive director of CollectivePAC, which works to elect Black candidates at the local, state and federal level. “We’re seeing people want to know who this person is that’s causing all this excitement? What does she stand for? That’s something we can’t sleep on, and it’s going to take every ounce of us working every day for the next 10 weeks for us to be successful.” In many ways, the story of Harris’ unlikely journey is one not just of 107 days, but of the last four years, and about how far the candidate and the country have come. Much of that evolution happened behind the scenes, when the media paid less attention to a role that has been traditionally unimportant. But with a new opportunity to introduce herself, after a national reckoning on race, with women continuing to break barriers across society, could voters choose Harris to break what Clinton calls “the highest, hardest glass ceiling”? Harris is making the case for why she is ready to be president. Soon, the country will decide whether they believe she is ready.","summary":"by&nbsp;Errin Haines for The 19th\n\n\n\nWith 70 days to go until Election Day, Vice President Kamala Harris is now within striking distance of becoming America’s 47th president.\n\n\n\nFor some, the moment seemed implausible just over a month ago — and that was not lost on Harris as she accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for president.\n\n\n\n“America, the path that led me here in recent weeks, was no doubt unexpected,” Harris told voters Thursday, the final night of the Democratic National Convention. “But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys.”\n\n\n\nIn record time, Harris has gone from running mate to candidate, from overlooked to undeniable as the Democratic Party’s standard bearer.\n\n\n\nThe circumstances of Harris’ historic run, like the 2024 election cycle, have been unconventional, a combination of luck — good and bad — preparation, and an unprecedented political climate.

In his rant against President Joe Biden, he criticized him for enjoying some family time with First Lady Jill Biden over the past few days. Trump went on to slam Joe for sleeping in public on a beach in Delaware. He was unimpressed by the idea of public sleeping. However, internet users were quick to call out the irony, pointing out that Trump himself slept in the courtroom during his criminal hush money trial, as reported by HuffPost. Trump asked, “Who the hell wants to sleep, and who wants to sleep in public?” He added, “He’s sleeping! Do you think President Xi of China is at a beach sleeping? Do you think Kim Jong Un is sleeping, from North Korea, with his nuclear weapons all over the place?” However, several internet users mocked him as one X user said, \"This is an entirely new level of gaslighting. This man slept through his entire trial which was held in public.\" Another X user wrote, \"Is he talking like when he slept at his criminal trial and the sketch artist‘s drawings were posted all over international news?\" A third X user argued, \"Trump could golf all day every day when he was \"president\", the right wouldn't say a negative word about it. Biden takes any time at all off to rest and relax or for any reason at all, it's a major travesty as far as Republicans are concerned. So fucking sick of their shit!\" Another person chimed in and suggested, \"He just literally ranted about a minute on people sleeping. I don’t know Donald, maybe the way you’ve been looking and acting the last 3 weeks you look like you could use a nap on the beach.\" Trump is constantly attacking the president, even though he's no longer in the 2024 presidential race. A fifth person took a dig as he wrote \"Still obsessed with Pres. Biden, a part of his brain refuses to believe that Biden is not running anymore, which is the part that is not fearful. Because all the other parts are terrified of ‘The Prosecutor,’ so he keeps reverting.\" On the other hand, musician John Rich, a vocal Trump supporter, and Joe critic, felt that something was off with Joe. He analyzed the vacation photos showing the president relaxing on a beach chair. Taking to his X account, Rich wrote, \"Why is there no secret service around the President of the United States of America?? Is he the POTUS or not? Is the Commander In Chief of the most powerful military in history just sitting on a beach waving at passersby? With no security? C'mon man...something ain't right.\" Meanwhile, Biden was spotted at a beach in Rehoboth, Delaware, where he has a vacation home. It's been over 10 days since he was last in the Oval Office, even though he said he would keep working on policy during the final months of his presidential term, according to the New York Post.","summary":"“Who wants to sleep in public?” Donald Trump asks while taking a dig at President Joe Biden.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/internet-mocks-trump-for-his-ironic-rant-about-bidens-public-sleeping-new-level-of-gaslighting","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/713469/uploads/a7c89960-6779-11ef-8359-2d5dc52b89c4_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 21:00:01","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":255355398,"title":"In new documents filed for New York civil fraud appeal, Trump’s lawyers claim his business partners were ‘very pleased’","text":"Lawyers for former President Donald Trump filed two briefs with the Appellate Division First Department in New York, arguing that the civil fraud case prosecuted against Trump earlier this year was flawed, that there were no victims and that the case had passed the statute of limitations. The two briefs, filed late Friday night, included many of the same arguments Trump’s lawyers have made in the past in this case. “President Trump’s business partners were delighted with these transactions. They benefited enormously, making over $100 million in profits,” attorneys Cliff Robert and Alina Habba argue in a 46-page last-ditch attempt to prevent Mr. Trump from having to pay what they call the “egregious and unconstitutional” $485 million dollars civil fraud judgment. It’s the latest update in a months-long appeals saga that began after a judge ruled that Trump and members of his family had engaged in a scheme to improperly inflate his assets in financial statements, which allowed Trump to take advantage of favorable loan and insurance rates he may not have otherwise been entitled to. Habba and Robert argued, once again, that none of Trump’s business partners were deceived and, in fact, were paid back on time or early, “in stark contrast to today’s loan market, where defaults are at an all-time high.” As they forcefully did during the three-month trial, Robert and Habba disputed the court’s valuation of Mar-a-Lago at between $18 million and $27 million. The lawyers said the property is valued at over one billion dollars. They also said that the statements of financial condition that were at the center of state Attorney General Letitia James’ case against Trump underestimated the values of President Trump’s assets, arguing that his net worth is far greater than the statements reflect. In their filing last week, New York state lawyers urged the appeals court to uphold the nearly $500 million fine, arguing there is overwhelming evidence that Trump lied for years about his wealth and saying that his appeal is full of “meritless legal arguments” ignoring volumes of trial evidence showing that he and his co-defendants engaged in “fraud and illegality on an immense scale.” A separate brief filed by Trump’s attorneys relates to sanctions imposed on the trial attorneys who represented Trump, arguing that the trial court erred in imposing the sanctions against counsel for what they say were “good faith” legal arguments. “It is perfectly proper for an attorney to make arguments that a trial judge may disagree with in order to preserve same for appellate review,” argued attorney Brian Isaac in the brief. Oral arguments before the Appellate Court are set to begin on Sept. 26.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLawyers for former President Donald Trump filed two briefs with the Appellate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: In new documents filed for New York civil fraud appeal, Trump&#8217;s lawyers claim his business partners were &#8216;very pleased&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/in-new-documents-filed-for-new-york-civil-fraud-appeal-trumps-lawyers-claim-his-business-partners-were-very-pleased/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trumps-attorneys-argue-that-his-business-partners.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 20:58:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.529},{"id":255355928,"title":"Dua Lipa shares a passionate kiss with boyfriend Callum Turner as they enjoy an alfresco lunch during their romantic break in Ibiza","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Aug 31st 2024 10PM 16°C 1AM 15°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Duke of Sussex asks former aides to help plot RETURN from his US exile in first stage of 'rehabilitation' strategy: Prince's friends vow to help smooth path back and dub it 'Operation Bring Harry In From The Cold' Panic as film set inferno rages out of control yards from London's O2 Arena with explosions and thick smoke leaving locals fearing it a bomb had gone off: Fire brigade battle to bring blaze under control after 'pre-planned' stunt goes wrong Police launch investigation as three children and a man found dead at a home in Surrey Sir Keir Starmer's smoking ban could extend to vaping indoors - as doctors call for a ban on all flavoured vapes to make them less appealing to children A.N.

In the filing, Trump’s legal team laid out a detailed and extended timeline for the case, indicating their intention to file numerous additional motions and challenges. The defense team’s proposed schedule would push critical proceedings into January 2025, well after the 2024 presidential election. Smith, who has been leading the investigation into Trump’s actions to challenge the 2020 election results, did not propose a specific trial timeline in the filing. Rather, he emphasized that the decision on how to manage the case lies entirely with Chutkan. At the same time, he expressed the prosecution’s readiness to file its opening immunity brief “promptly at any time the Court deems appropriate,” while suggesting that Chutkan handle the various motions filed by Trump’s team concurrently to keep the case moving forward expeditiously. In a further bid to accelerate proceedings, Smith also pushed back on Trump’s proposal for a separate deadline and motions practice regarding discovery. Under Trump’s plan, as laid out in the joint filing, the first significant legal challenge would take place in late October, when his team intends to argue in a motion that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional and that the funding used to pay the special counsel’s team is illegal. “As a threshold matter, President Trump will move to dismiss the Special Counsel’s improper appointment and use of non-appropriated funds—issues that a Supreme Court justice describes as ’serious questions’ that ’must be answered before this prosecution may proceed,'” reads the filing. Meese and the scholars contend that the statutes cited by Garland do not authorize the appointment of a private citizen to wield extraordinary criminal law enforcement powers under the title of special counsel; arguing further that Smith’s lack of Senate confirmation and alleged improper appointment to the role of a federal officer mean that all actions taken by him against Trump should be declared null and void. Trump’s lawyers also suggested in the joint status report that the court should not begin addressing presidential immunity issues until December. This timing appears to be critical, as it would delay any substantial progress in the case until after the election. Smith’s superseding indictment, which was reworked in light of the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling, claims that Trump’s statements on social media calling on Pence to refuse to count the electoral votes that established President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election were unrelated to Pence’s official duties and instead amounted to Trump’s “personal” attempt to “unlawfully retain power.” Trump’s lawyers argue that Smith’s “improper” use of allegations relating to the former vice president in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling that extends presumptive immunity to communications between Trump and Pence are foundational to the superseding indictment and Chutkan should toss it entirely. After the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump is entitled to some immunity, the justices sent the case back to district court, leaving it up to Chutkan to decide how to apply the ruling to the case.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump has asked for an extended trial timeline in his Jan. 6 case, while also urging to judge to dismiss it entirely.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-seeks-extended-trial-timeline-in-high-stakes-jan-6-case-5716295","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/01/19/id5569479-layout-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 20:52:26","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":255357966,"title":"Conservative Moms, Charmed by Trump, Would Rather Avoid His Misogyny","text":"It didn’t look like a typical Trump rally.

It was the Joyful Warriors summit thrown by a bunch of agitated parents known as the Moms for Liberty, a conservative activist group that was founded during the Covid pandemic. The group, which has more than 130,000 members across the country, has become quite influential in Republican politics. Their parental preoccupations were made apparent by the programming and pamphleteering on display.

He also shared footage of himself grappling his opponent on the mat. The triumphant rapper captioned his post writing: 'REORG OPEN 2024 No Gi Gold! OSSSSSSSSS.' So good he is at the sport that UFC fighter Conor McGregor heaped praise on him last year after he bagged another gold medal at the English BJJ Open. Opening up about his love of jiu-jitsu back in 2022, Tinie said in an interview with Reorg Charity: 'I got into jiu-jitsu a couple of years ago and it is incredible but really tough. I had done other martial arts before and a bit of boxing, but this really takes it to another level. 'Nothing can quite describe what it feels like to have somebody spend five minutes trying really hard to choke you unconscious. But if you can get through that, you can get through anything. 'The vibe is great because everyone is focused on getting better and they are all helping each other out. It sounds strange – helping each other out and beating each other up. It is all part of the fun!'

Teesside-native Danny revealed he didn't realise his opponent would be the Peaky Blinders star, who is a fellow blue belt, until reaching the semi-final. He told LADbible of the 'surreal' experience: 'I did try my best, but he was just a lot stronger than me, I've got to admit. He's a strong guy and a talented guy, too. 'I've got the story to tell, the kids were there to watch - which was the main thing – and I got a bronze medal - so it's not at all a loss - and I lived to tell the tale.' And on having to 'tap out', he confessed: 'As soon as you know it's straight and it's on – if you don't tap, your arm is going to snap. It's as simple as that.'

We will make America SAFE again!\" One day earlier, he said he opposes another ballet initiative measure in Florida: Amendment 4, which seeks to change the state's ban on abortion from six weeks of pregnancy to around 24 weeks. Both measures require 60% of approval by voters in the Nov. 5 election for passage. The marijuana amendment would authorize 25 companies licensed by the state to sell pot to adults for recreational use and allow the possession of the substance up to 3 ounces. Medical marijuana usage already is legal in the state. With Trump's residence in Mar-a-lago in Palm Beach, Trump is eligible to vote on the two measures. \"Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters, so it should be done correctly,\" he wrote. \"We need the State Legislature to responsibly create laws that prohibit the use of it in public spaces, so we do not smell marijuana everywhere we go, like we do in many of the Democrat run Cities.\" The marijuana proposal is backed by Florida's medical marijuana industry. It is one of the largest in the country and brings in more than $2 billion in profits each year. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is against both ballot measures, launching a political committee called the Florida Freedom Fund to attack the legalization push and efforts to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. DeSantis helped launch the \"No on 3\" campaign in July, which released a statement saying that the initiative would lead to \"weed everywhere, every place, and in your face.\" Florida state Sen. Joe Gruters, a Trump ally and former state GOP chair, wrote on X: \"I am incredibly proud to have President Trump stand alongside us in our effort to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for simple possession of marijuana and to give Floridians the same individual freedom to choose safe, tested products that more than half the country already enjoys.\" Eighty-eight percent of Americans say marijuana should be legal for personal or medical use, according to a March study by the Pew Research Center. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, but 24 states and Washington, D.C., have passed legislation allowing recreational use. The issue also will be on the ballot in South Dakota and Nebraska in November. Only three states have approved the measure with at least 60%: New Jersey and Arizona in 2020, and Maryland in 2022. Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have approved medical marijuana use. Regarding the abortion issue, on Thursday Trump told NBC News that Florida's six-week ban is \"too short\" and declined to take a clear stance on a state ballot measure. But he face backlash from anti-abortion advocates. \"So I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks,\" he told Fox News. \"I've disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it, I disagreed with it. \"At the same time, the Democrats are radical, because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. ... So I'll be voting no for that reason.\" Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign said that Trump \"will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they are pregnant.\"","summary":"Donald Trump on Saturday said he supports a ballot initiative in his home state of Florida that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults 21 and older.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/31/Fla-Trump-back-recreational-marijuana-measure/5161725134377/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5161725134377/2024/upi/43a5300a01536628e0548baed1305b08/v1.2/Trump-backs-ballot-amendment-to-legalize-recreational-marijuana-in-Fla.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 20:40:04","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":255354754,"title":"Texas Newspaper Accuses Greg Abbott of 'Hurting Our Democracy'","text":"A Texas newspaper accused Governor Greg Abbott and other Republican officials in the state of \"hurting our democracy\" by claiming that there is widespread election fraud among noncitizen voters.Noncitizen voting fraud has become a national topic among Republicans, who claim, without sufficient evidence, that illegal immigrants are registering to vote in this year's election. The Republican-led House passed a bill, the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, in July, which would require those registering to vote to provide documentary proof of United States citizenship.On Monday, Abbott announced that Texas has removed over 1 million people from the state's voter rolls since September 2021. A majority of those removed were people who had died (over 457,000) and voters who had been placed on the suspense list (over 463,000), which is a compilation of voters who may have moved since they registered to vote.Over 6,500 people removed from voter rolls were noncitizens and, according to an op-ed published by The Dallas Morning News on Friday, roughly 1,300 of these noncitizens voted. While the number should be at zero, given that it is illegal for noncitizens to register to vote or to vote in elections, the number given is 0.1 percent of ineligible voters, which is statistically insignificant.\"Yes, voter rolls need to be checked and cleared regularly. But there is an inevitable lag that happens in the process,\" The Dallas Morning News' editorial board wrote. \"Creating alarm over the integrity of our electoral process is what is actually hurting our democracy.\"Newsweek has reached out to Abbott's office via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.Earlier on in the op-ed, The Dallas Morning News called out Abbott as well as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, both Republicans, for \"feeding the confirmation bias of a voter base that now believes American elections are stolen when their side loses,\" an apparent reference to claims made by members of the GOP, without any concrete evidence, that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against then-President Donald Trump.Paxton, meanwhile, launched an investigation last week into reports of possible illegal voter registration by noncitizens.Paxton's Election Integrity Unit has confirmed that nonprofits have been offering to help people register to vote outside Texas Department of Public Safety Driver License offices.The attorney general's office felt an inquiry was needed, given that all citizens are already given the opportunity to register to vote when renewing or being issued an identification card or driver's license.\"Texans are deeply troubled by the possibility that organizations purporting to assist with voter registration are illegally registering noncitizens to vote in our elections,\" Paxton said in an August 21 press release. \"If eligible citizens can legally register to vote when conducting their business at a DPS office, why would they need a second opportunity to register with a booth outside?\"Paxton's Election Integrity Unit also conducted multiple searches in Frio, Atascosa and Bexar Counties as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting during the 2022 midterm elections, his office announced last week.Newsweek has reached out to Paxton's office via email for comment on Saturday afternoon.Texas is the fifth most difficult state to vote in, according to the Election Law Journal. Senate Bill 1, which Abbott signed into law in 2021, made lying while registering to vote a state felony and required random audits of elections every two years, among other provisions.","summary":"The Texas governor has been criticized by The Dallas Morning News for causing alarm over noncitizen voting.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/dallas-morning-news-accuses-greg-abbott-hurting-democracy-noncitizen-voting-1947156","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2461978/abbott.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 20:35:56","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":255358694,"title":"Mark Cuban polls followers on preferring their kids to be like Trump or Harris: Trump wins in a landslide","text":"Dallas Mavericks minority owner Mark Cuban posed a question to his followers on X on Friday night in a now-lopsided poll. \"Who’s persona and character would you like to see young children grow up to have?\" Cuban wrote on a two-way poll with the two options being Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

However, the billionaire sports mogul once sided with Trump. Cuban has said he supported the former president when Trump initially launched his first presidential campaign in 2015. Cuban elaborated on his initial support of Trump during an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy on X on August 7. \"In 2015, I was like, ‘He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,\" Cuban said. \"A big part of that is I didn't think he had a chance. I just wanted to kind of screw things up in traditional politics, which I'm not a fan of.\" The \"Shark Tank\" host even said he would consider being Trump's running mate in the 2016 election in an interview with Business Insider in July 2015. \"I don't care what his actual positions are,\" Cuban also wrote of Trump in a post on his own social media app project \"Cyberdust\" in July 2015. \"I don't care if he says the wrong thing. He says what's on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years.\" Earlier this year, when Joe Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden were \"being given his last rites.\" \"If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,\" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

Trump took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to commemorate three years since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Messages reviewed by CBS News confirmed that the campaign was given direct permission by the families.However, the rules at Army National Military Cemeteries are dictated by federal law which prohibits any filming for partisan, political or fundraising purposes, according to Arlington National Cemetery media policies, even if there are requests by family members of the fallen. An Army spokesperson said all participants were made aware of the federal laws ahead of Monday's incident.\"An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside,\" the Army said. \"Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption.\"The incident was reported to the military police department by the Arlington Cemetery employee, who decided not to press charges. The Army told CBS News that it considers the matter closed. The Trump campaign's communications director, Steven Cheung told CBS News in a statement that there was \"no physical altercation\" and that they are prepared to release footage.\"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,\" the statement said.Republicans take aim at Harris, Dems want answersIn a post on X responding to Harris, Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance said: \"President Trump was there at the invitation of families whose loved ones died because of your incompetence.

Tom Cotton praised Trump, saying Gold Star families had every right to invite \"whomever they wanted to commemorate this solemn anniversary.\"\"The real scandal is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden condemned thirteen brave American troops to death and didn't even have the decency to call or meet with the Gold Star families to express their condolences,\" the Arkansas senator said in a statement released by Trump's campaign.In her own post on X, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt blasted Harris, blaming the vice president for the deaths during the withdrawal.\"Kamala's stupidity led to one of the most embarrassing events in American history and 13 brave US soldiers being killed. She has never said their names. She has never reached out to their families,\" she said. \"For this alone, Kamala does not deserve to be elected.

Liam and Noel Gallagher getting the band back together was just the start. Incredibly, in the same week that the Oasis reunion was announced, Prince William and Prince Harry were at the memorial for their uncle Lord Robert Fellowes, who was Diana’s brother-in-law. Oasis AND the Fab Four announcing a reunion tour on the same day? Not quite. The warring Windsors are not quite ready to take their old act back on the road. William and Harry were photographed together at the Queen’s funeral in 2022. But this week all the reports suggest the brothers sat apart at the memorial. Unlike Liam and Noel, there was no joint photoshoot. “They kept their distance,” said -someone who was there. But the fact that William and Harry were in the same church, paying their respects to their uncle — when Harry was not expected to attend the event — still feels significant. And coming so soon after reports that William did not want Harry at his Coronation feels like some small step to restoring the old fraternal bond that was so incredibly strong for so long. Is it too much to hope that one day William and Harry will bury the hatchet? And not in a ginger skull? Noel and Liam made it seem possible. There have been suggestions that Harry is keen on a reconciliation with the family he ran away from, and then -ratted on. The paperback of Harry’s autobiography Spare is being published without any salacious updates or indiscreet interviews to promote it. Mancus yobbus Harry could have easily -created another anti-royal media frenzy — if he had wanted to. Is that perhaps a tentative hand of friendship held out by a man who often looks so wretchedly unhappy in his new pseudo-royal life? A divorced rock star will always be in need of another £50million or so. But the Oasis reunion is not just about the money. I would bet my life that Noel and Liam watched the recent Blur reunion with a touch of envy and -bewilder- ment. Blur sold out Wembley — twice (the same as Bruce Springsteen). A two-hour concert film is being released in the cinema. The Gallagher brothers will have watched Blur’s renaissance and reflected: “But Oasis were better than Blur. But Oasis were bigger than Blur. What about us?” It was probably the first thing that Noel and Liam have agreed about for years. Their reunion is more than huge — it is historic. Oasis are the last of the great bands. Their tour feels like it could be the last majestic gasp of the guitar-based rock music that exploded a lifetime ago. Oasis 2025 has the gravitas of a David Attenborough wildlife documentary. See this exotic species now — Mancus yobbus — for we may never see their like again. And for Noel and Liam, that has to feel good. And if the Gallaghers can make up — despite the bad blood, despite the bitching, despite all the hurt feelings — can William and Harry do it too? Yes, under one condition. Some say the Oasis reunion was only made possible by Noel’s divorce from second wife Sara -MacDonald — who once described her brother-in-law Liam as “a fat t*t doing his tribute act, balancing a tambourine on his head”. But sharp-tongued Sara and her waspish social media posts are history now. And perhaps that suggests a way -forward for the warring Windsors. It is not impossible for -William and Harry to get their old beloved act back together again. But probably not while Harry is -married to Meghan. A reconciliation between her sons is what Liam and Noel’s mum, Peggy -Gallagher, always wanted. And — more than anything in the world — isn’t that what Diana would have wanted for William and Harry too? DON’T expect our joy-sucking socialist government to give a toss about three pubs a week closing down because the finger-wagging, left-wing prigs want to ban outdoor smoking.

A lot of people feel the same way about Angel Delight. And beans on toast. And Arctic Roll, Curly Wurlys, rice pudding, fish fingers, Wall’s Viennetta, jam roly-poly, sponge pud, toffee apples and Alphabetti spaghetti. A poll of 2,000 adults named all these treats as nostalgia-inducing foods that can transport us back to our childhood and bring back memories more profoundly than a photo.

But it’s not there, though everything else seems to be, including Wagon Wheels, eggs with “soldiers”, candyfloss, rhubarb and custard sweets and fairy cakes. Toad in the hole was pork sausages embedded in Yorkshire pudding. Just one bite would transport me to Billericay in the Sixties. And if ever I want inspiration for a seven-volume auto- biographical novel, I will not be reaching for a Curly Wurly. THE question journalists keep asking Ridley Scott, 86, is: Why doesn’t Russell Crowe appear in your sequel, Gladiator II? Anyone expecting Russell to show his face in -Gladiator II must have missed what happened to Maximus at the end of the first film. STROP TRUMP ABBA have instructed Donald Trump to stop using their music at his campaign rallies. And it’s not just one song – it’s Dancing Queen, Money, Money, Money and Winner Takes It All. Knock it off, Don! There’s only one blonde bombshell those songs need – and it’s Agnetha Faltskog. And has Trump seen the way Kamala Harris is shooting up the polls? If Don uses any banging Abba tune, it should surely be SOS. Who’s that old chap on Zoe’s arm? IT is strange to still hear Zoe Kravitz being routinely called “the daughter of Lenny Kravitz” – as if that is the thing Zoe is best known for. But Zoe is 35 now. She wrote and directed the glossy psychological thriller Blink Twice, a box office smash. As an actress she more than held her own with Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies. She was the best-ever Catwoman, in The Batman. It was heart-warming to see Zoe walked down the red carpet of the Blink Twice premiere on the arm of her funky old dad. But Lenny is 60 now. Are You Going To Go My Way was more than 30 years ago. It is about time to start calling Lenny “the father of Zoe Kravitz”. RAD TO WORSE EMMA RADUCANU tearfully crashes out of the US Open in the first round – a tournament she fabulously won as a teen – and the vultures immediately circle, tut-tutting about her lucrative sponsorship deals as if they were the reason for her slide in form. Emma should not be in tears or made to feel bad because she gets knocked out of a Grand Slam. She has time – years and years – to come back and become a Grand Slam champion again if she wants it badly enough. Whatever happens next, she is the most successful British women’s tennis player in our lifetime. And she is still only 21. Give the kid a break. GOOD ENOUGH FOR EU AS the Prime Minister hugged and kissed his way across Germany and France, we kept hearing that Brexit is about to be “betrayed”. What part of Brexit would that be? The part of Brexit that gave us back control of our borders? Or the part that secured a lucrative UK-US trade deal? I think it makes sense for Keir Starmer to want to reset our relationship with the EU. But here’s the thing, Keir – do they want to reset with us? Right now the UK generously allows EU citizens to stroll into our country in the same immigration line as the British. This act of courtesy is not reciprocated. If we go to the EU, we are herded into the “all other passports” line. Senior politicians do not queue at airports, and this grotesque unfairness seems to have escaped their notice. But if you had your holidays in Europe this summer, I would bet my last euro that you and your family noticed. We treat EU citizens as friends and cherished guests. The EU treats the Brits as undesirables. It would be common courtesy for the EU to extend to the UK the privileges we extend to them. Yes, let’s have a better relationship with the EU. We should all aspire to get on with the neighbours. But do our neighbours want to get on with us?","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/30190838/oasis-prince-william-harry-tony-parsons/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2021-60th-birthday-princes-william-885235989_ad51f9.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-31 20:24:48","author":"Laura Goddard,Tony Parsons","authors":["Laura Goddard","Tony Parsons"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.078},{"id":255357376,"title":"Melania’s plea for Trump to control his swearing flops as he tears into Harris at rally","text":"Melania Trump’s apparent plea to her husband Donald Trump to control his language fell on deaf ears on Friday night when he torched Kamala Harris saying that everything she touches turns to “s**t.” The former president and Republican nominee attacked the vice president’s record before a crowd in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, claiming she doesn’t “have any common sense” before noting that both his wife and Reverend Franklin Graham have asked him to not use “foul” language.

This is the closest the former president has come to taking a stance on the Florida ballot measure, which he will have the opportunity to vote for in November. When the billionaire first ran for president in 2016, he said there were good and bad things about legalizing the drug. \"Because in some ways I think it’s good [to legalize marijuana] and in other ways it’s bad,\" he told Bill O'Reilly during a 2016 appearance. \"I do want to see what the medical effects are.

Later that evening, after she had interviewed Republican nominee Donald Trump onstage, she made a point to say she was personally endorsing him for the presidency. Their talk show style chat was preceded by a “Trump, Trump, Trump” chant from the audience. The weekend’s gathering, drawing parent activists from across the country, has showcased how Moms for Liberty has moved toward fully embracing Trump and his political messaging as November’s election draws nearer. The group is officially a nonpartisan nonprofit that says it’s open to anyone who wants parents to have a greater say in their children’s education, yet there was little pretense about which side of the nation’s political divide it has chosen. A painting that was prominently displayed on an easel next to the security station attendees had to pass through before being allowed into the conference area showed Vice President Kamala Harris kneeling over a bald eagle carcass, a communist symbol on her jacket and her mouth dripping with blood. A Moms for Liberty spokeswoman said she hadn’t seen the gruesome painting and noted that the only official signage for the event included the group’s logo. The group’s enthusiasm for Trump is likely to benefit the former president this fall by solidifying a key part of his base — parents who share his views that the U.S. Education Department is bloated and ineffective, equity programs are distracting from academic fundamentals, vaccine mandates violate parental rights and schools that accept transgender children are putting other students in danger. But it’s much less clear how Moms for Liberty’s support for Trump and his agenda will affect races for local school boards, which have become some of the most contentious elections on many ballots since 2022, the year after the group was founded. Many communities where Moms for Liberty candidates took over a majority of the school board have been frustrated by their laser-like focus on removing books, questioning lessons around race and rejecting LGBTQ+ identities. A lack of progress toward academic improvement has in turn led to a counter movement among more moderate and liberal parents and teachers unions. Moms for Liberty says it won’t make an official endorsement in the presidential race, but it isn’t shying away from getting involved. The group’s founders recently wrote an open letter to parents warning that Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former high school social studies teacher, would be “the most anti-parent, extremist government America has ever known.” The group spent its first three years becoming synonymous with the “parents’ rights” movement in local school boards but recently has become more involved in national politics. It participated in the controversial conservative blueprint for the next Republican administration, Project 2025, as a member of its advisory board. The group also has invested more than $3 million in four crucial presidential swing states. The money has paid for advertising in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin, including messages critical of the Biden administration. Justice said the advertising has helped increase Moms for Liberty membership in those states and mobilized members who were not previously politically active to register to vote. “I think you’re going to see a lot of new voters who understand now that their vote and their voice matters,” she said in an interview. She added that as the group continues to endorse in local school board races, she is encouraged by Florida’s recent primary in which 60% of Moms for Liberty-backed candidates — some running for office for the first time — advanced to this fall’s general election. But countering those wins were undeniable losses for the group, among them two in heavily Republican Sarasota County, and two in Pinellas County, where a Moms for Liberty-backed candidate coasted to a school board seat two years ago. Those results come after conservative candidates struggled to gain traction with voters in local school board elections across the country last fall. In that election, Moms for Liberty said just 40% of its endorsed candidates won. Jonathan Collins, co-director of the politics and education program at Columbia University’s Teachers College, said parents’ rights candidates may be struggling around the country because they are focused on removing existing policies and classroom materials, rather than offering a clear, forward-looking plan to remedy pandemic learning loss. “They’re not getting beaten by people who are responding to the cultural attacks with their own cultural attacks,” he said. “They’re getting beat by people who are responding to the cultural attacks with very, very practical, hyperlocal ideas of school and district improvement.” Around the country, some school board members backed by Moms for Liberty or who carry out the group’s agenda have been recalled in recent months by community members who say their policies have caused chaos. In Woodland, California, north of the state capital, a school board member backed by Moms for Liberty members was recalled in March after she raised fears that children were coming out as transgender “as a result of social contagion ” during a school board meeting in 2023. In Southern California, a trustee with the Temecula Valley Unified School District Board of Education was recalled after he and two of his colleagues voted to reject a social studies curriculum because it included a history of the gay rights movement. And in Idaho’s heavily Republican panhandle, community members from across the political spectrum rose up to recall two right-wing members of their board last year who sought to root out critical race theory and institute a conservative agenda. Katie Blaxberg, a Pinellas County candidate who will run against the one remaining Moms for Liberty-linked candidate for that county’s school board this fall, said the “nastiness” and “divisiveness” of the group “isn’t conducive to any sort of good work.” But a group of more than 600 Moms for Liberty supporters exchanging phone numbers and listening attentively to slide presentations in Washington on Friday offered a different perspective. Gretchen Schmid, the chair of a Moms for Liberty chapter in Orange County, North Carolina, said her chapter helped advocate a new parents’ bill of rights law in her state. It passed last year after the Legislature, which is heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans, overrode the Democratic governor’s veto. Schmid said when parents used to call and ask schools to share information about assignments, they wouldn’t hear back, but now, “people are getting more responses.” On Saturday, Moms for Liberty’s four-day summit paused sessions during the day to hold a demonstration a mile away, organized by a coalition of more than 30 conservative groups. Donning yellow rhinestone visors, Rachel Mack and Sarah Recupero said they had made the drive from Florida to support the protection of all children, especially in sports. “I am definitely somebody who stands for the whole women-in-women’s sports and men-in-men’s sports,” Mack said. Several blocks away, those opposed to Moms for Liberty held a competing event, a Celebration of Reading, to counter book banning and advocate for a more inclusive environment for children. Heidi Ross traveled from Buckeye, Arizona, to volunteer for the event after seeing a post on Facebook about it. “I have a granddaughter who’s two, and I want her to grow up in a world where she can read whatever she wants to read and no one bothers her or makes a fuss about it,” she said. “So, I hopped on that plane, really for her and all children.” ___ Associated Press writer Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.
