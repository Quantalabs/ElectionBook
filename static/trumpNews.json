{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":6303,"news":[{"id":255065592,"title":"Outcome Revealed for First Capitol Breacher on Jan. 6","text":"The Kentucky man who was the first to breach the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6 and then joined a mob of rioters chasing a police officer up several flights of stairs will spend years behind bars. Michael Sparks, 47, was convicted in March of multiple felonies and misdemeanors in connection with the Jan. 6 attack. As Law&Crime reported at the time, Sparks climbed through a window smashed apart by convicted Proud Boys member Dominic Pezzola, who used a stolen police shield to break into the building. After Sparks landed inside the Capitol, law enforcement screamed for him to stop — but he charged ahead anyway, ignoring multiple orders to leave the building, prosecutors said. “Instead, he walked to the front of the ground and confronted the officer they had chased up the stairs. He yelled, ‘This is our America! This is our America!’ as he grew increasingly agitated,” a statement from the Justice Department notes. The sentence handed down Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, a Donald Trump appointee, was a mere four months less than the 57 months prosecutors had sought. It also comes after the most serious charge, obstruction of an official proceeding, was dropped after the Supreme Court found that the charge does not apply to accused Jan. 6 rioters who targeted Congress as it prepared to certify President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral win. The charges against Sparks, along with his trial and conviction, do not appear to have lessened his belief in the baseless conspiracy theory that the election results were fraudulent. “I am an American citizen who believes to this day that we are in tyranny,” Sparks told Kelly during the hearing Tuesday, according to NBC News reporter Ryan J. Reilly. Sparks reportedly added that he believes that the 2020 election was “taken from the American people.” Kelly told Sparks that he could believe what he wanted, but those beliefs didn’t give him the right to attack the Capitol. “I don’t really think you appreciate the full gravity of what happened that day and frankly the full seriousness of what you did,” Kelly said, according to the NBC report. Insisting that the events of Jan. 6 “just cannot happen again,” Kelly reportedly told Sparks that the rioters had interfered with a process “foundational to our country’s governance.” “What a dangerous precedent Jan. 6 set. What a Pandora’s box it opened,” Kelly said, according to NBC News. He also said that America had a “perfect score” for peaceful transfers of power before Jan. 6. “We can’t get that back,” Kelly reportedly said. “It’s gone.” Kelly’s sentence was above the recommended sentencing guidelines range of 15-21 months, the NBC report noted. Lawyers for Sparks had asked for a sentence of 12 months of home incarceration. “Mike can be redeemed,” his attorney wrote in his sentencing memo. “He is worthy of redemption.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nClockwise from left: Michael Sparks, the first rioter to breach the U.S.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Outcome Revealed for First Capitol Breacher on Jan. 6 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/outcome-revealed-for-first-capitol-breacher-on-jan-6/","image":"https://am22.mediaite.com/lc/cnt/uploads/2024/03/sparks-composite.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:45:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.52},{"id":255065484,"title":"Trump says he and Harris have agreed to Sep 10 TV debate","text":"\"Both candidates have publicly made clear their willingness to debate with unmuted mics for the duration of the debate to fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates - but it appears Donald Trump is letting his handlers overrule him.

This element of democratic adventurism has been an important aspect of the competitive methodology of electoral choice in the American polity ever since Barack Obama became the first black President of the USA in 2008. In an ironic twist it was the same factor of adventurous choice that led to the election of an irredeemable autocrat named Donald Trump as Obama’s successor. In spite of the fact that Trump used terminology that was profoundly anti-democratic as the core sentiment of his political vision in his campaign for office in 2016 the political system accommodated his worst attitudes to a surprising extent. As a consequence, although he conducted a deeply misogynistic campaign against Hilary Clinton, and actually failed to gain a popular majority he was able to claim victorious ascendancy through the deployment of electoral votes. In his response to Kamala Harris’s challenge to his effort to return to office Trump’s blustery abuse has made it plain that he expects to use the same tactic against her. It is clear that Donald Trump’s approach to political contest is based on personal conceit and opportunism, two elements of human behaviour which he is adept at deploying. Before he entered the political arena in 2015 this aspect of his personality had been successfully utilised in his career as a reality show host on television, and he transferred this success to the political arena by assuming that the electorate would succumb to his blustery blandishments. He was proven right in 2016 but after four years in power the insubstantiality of his presumptions had begun to be recognised by the average voter and he lost the attempt to hold on to power. However, his response to public rejection has been so vehement that he has provoked the worst instincts of public disenchantment in the American electorate. His response to Kamala Harris’s emergence has shown that he intends to use this emotion to provoke the adventurous spirit of American political sentiment to support and justify his most selfish attitudes. In confronting this reality Kamala Harris has adopted exactly the opposite formula of contestation by articulating a vision of governance based on common sense rather than bluster. Donald Trump on the other hand has chosen to accelerate his annoyance in response to Harris’s calm sense of sanity and good order in the hope that some irrational elements of the electorate will be inspired by his habitual bluster. The gravest danger that this situation poses is to the survival of a sane and stable order of democratic governance in America. While the sense of adventurous competitive choice might have encouraged diversity and change, as in the case of the election of Obama, it was the same spirit of adventure that led to the experimental selection of Donald Trump in 2016. The major challenge that has evolved from this conjunction of boisterous rhetoric and systematic decision-making is for common sense to become the motivation that ignites public sentiment as opposed to conceited bluster. It is however very dangerous to assume that the outcome of this interaction will always result in the best and most representative result for the electoral community. The eventual result of such adventurous contestation can lead to some of the most distressing results if the process is allowed to be manipulated by formal allies of the more opportunistic participant, and Donald Trump is clearly hoping to be able to take advantage of any such opportunity. In that case Kamala Harris’s team of supporters and the Democratic Party’s officials must be extraordinarily vigilant over the conduct of the forthcoming polls. They must campaign energetically in the so-called battleground states in the weeks before the elections with the effective objective in mind of mounting serious defence of controversial results after the elections, especially if Harris is declared victorious. In the days, weeks and months following the polls Donald Trump’s penchant for blustery rhetoric and manipulative conspiracy theories will be unveiled most vehemently if Kamala is declared the winner. If she loses the contest he will probably mount a boisterous verbal assault on her credibility in order to regale his supporters with proof of his superiority and to justify his dysfunctional victory. In such an event the ascendancy of his blustery character will be revealed in all its splendor and Kamala Harris’s attempt to consolidate the common sense view of earlier government decisions will be rubbished totally by the machinery of state led by Donald Trump. The unique element of this electoral competition is not only defined by the unusual origin of the Democratic Party’s candidate but also by the dangerous consequences that are threatened if she loses. For this reason, some knowledgeable observers have described the forthcoming contest as the most vital and controversial Presidential contest to take place in the USA for more than a century. In fact, this is one contest in which the adventurous perception of the electorate should be deployed in defence of the popular will rather than in defence of privilege. Kamala Harris has demonstrated the eloquence of common sense in only a few days while Donald Trump has for a long time exhibited the undeniable resilience of self-willed bluster. The American electorate now has a unique opportunity to demonstrate the relevance and true value of its adventurous decision making to preserving genuine democracy at the polls. · Barrett is a Jamaican-born Poet, Novelist and Journalist","summary":"&#160;The forthcoming election is&#160;one in which the adventurous perception of the electorate should be deployed in defence of the popular will rather than in defence of privilege, argues&#160;LINDSAY BARRETT The","url":"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/08/28/commonsense-vs-bluster-americas-unique-political-adventure/","image":"https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Kamala-Harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:35:35","author":"Adeyinka Salami","authors":["Adeyinka Salami"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":255065302,"title":"GOP Strategist Apologizes for Harsh Dig About RFK Jr.’s Voice on CNN","text":"Republican strategist Doug Heye apologized Tuesday for making a “joke” about Robert F.

The debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump is scheduled for September 10, in what will be their first-ever bout in the run-up to the Presidential election. But on Sunday, Trump took to social media and labeled ABC ‘FAKE NEWS’ asking, ‘Why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?’ Also while campaigning in Northern Virginia on Monday, Trump was asked again whether he should to the debate. He replied: ‘I think ABC really should be shut out. I’d much rather do it on NBC. ‘I’d much rather do it on CBS. Frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group. And certainly, I’d do it on Fox.’ In response, Kamala Harris’ campaign team released a video of Donald Trump speaking to Fox News, in which he rails against ABC and says doesn’t need to debate his rival as he has a lead in the polls, with chicken sounds added. The Kamala HQ team posted the video on X, asking: ‘You scared, Donald Trump?’ Trump tore into the network after 10pm on Sunday night in a post on Truth Social, where he gave bad reviews to the network’s weekend programming before raising the threat. ‘I watched ABC FAKE NEWS this morning, both lightweight reporter Jonathan Carl’s (K?) ridiculous and biased interview of Tom Cotton (who was fantastic!), and their so-called Panel of Trump Haters, and I ask, why would I do the Debate against Kamala Harris on that network?’ he wrote. He was referencing the network’s Jonathan Karl, who questioned Trump at the White House during his presidency. Then he went on to go after members of the network’s ‘This Week’ panel, including Donna Brazil, a member of the DNC who parted ways with CNN after hacked emails posted on WikiLeaks in 2016 revealed her shipping debate questions to the Hillary Clinton camp. ‘Will panelist Donna Brazil give the questions to the Marxist Candidate like she did for Crooked Hillary Clinton? Will Kamala’s best friend, who heads up ABC, do likewise. Where is Liddle’ George Slopadopolus hanging out now? Will he be involved. They’ve got a lot of questions to answer!!! Why did Harris turn down Fox, NBC, CBS, and even CNN? Stay tuned!!!’ Trump wrote. Stephanopoulos apologized in July after he was caught on video speaking to a passerby about President Joe Biden. ‘I don’t think he can serve four more years,’ the host said, days before Biden decided to get out of the race. Trump was at it again during an appearance at a shopping center filled with Vietnamese shops and restaurants in Falls Church, Virginia. ‘I think it’s disgraceful, and I think ABC is a disgrace,’ Trump said. ‘I think having Donna Brazile sitting on that panel, she’s the one that gave the answers and the questions to Hillary Clinton before a debate. I think ABC is really, should be shut out. I’d much rather do it on NBC. I’d much rather do it on CBS, frankly, I think CBS is very unfair, but the best of the group, and certainly I’d do it on Fox. I’d even do it on CNN,’ Trump said. He again complained about the ABC roundtable, saying the ‘hostility is crazy.’ Trump called Harris a ‘dummy.’ The two camps continue to haggle over the terms of the upcoming debate, the only one left that both sides have agreed to. Harris advisor Brian Fallon said both candidates should have their mics kept live throughout the broadcast. ‘Our understanding is that Trump’s handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own,’ he said in a statement. The Trump camp, meanwhile, says Harris wants a seated debate that allows for notes and opening statements. The Harris camp disputes this. ‘All three parties (Trump, Harris and ABC) have agreed to standing and no notes, and we never sought otherwise,’ said Fallon. Trump said he would ‘probably’ rather have the mics remain hot, but said ‘I think it should be the same,’ meaning the pre-negotiated rules without a hot mic should remain in place. Whatever Trump’s criticisms of the network, he may feel pressure to show up. Trump’s June 27 contest with Biden began the cascading events that forced the 81-year-old president to end his campaign. And next month he will confront a Harris campaign that is on the move after her political convention and a fresh fundraising haul. Harris has also turned around the race in ‘Blue Wall’ battleground states while evening the race in others. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have moved to ‘lean Democratic’, according to the latest NPR analysis out Monday, while while Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina have moved to ‘tossup’ status. Karl clashed with Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton on Sunday’s ‘This Week,’ after he blasted Kamala Harris for her past support of Mecicare-for-all. Cotton compared it to ‘taking away health insurance on the job for 170 million Americans.’ ‘What do you mean taking away health insurance? What are you talking about?’ Karl shot back. ‘I mean, that is not her position now,’ Karl continued. Harris has since walked back her position from the 2020 primary, and is now in line with the Biden administration on health policy. ‘How do you know that is not her position now?’ countered Cotton. Trump has threatened to bail out on debates in the past, including earlier this month, when he threatened to hold back from the ABC debate, preferring an earlier one on Fox that Harris has not agreed to.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris has taunted Donald Trump with chicken noises after he suggested&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; team taunts Donald Trump with &#8216;chicken sounds&#8217; following his threat to withdraw from &#8216;unfair&#8217; ABC debate in the coming month. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/kamala-harris-team-taunts-donald-trump-with-chicken-sounds-following-his-threat-to-withdraw-from-unfair-abc-debate-in-the-coming-month/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/27/13/88974277-0-image-m-277_1724760798691.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:29:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":255065354,"title":"Trump reindicted for resisting 2020 election peaceful transfer of power","text":"Trump reindicted for resisting 2020 election peaceful transfer of power Special counsel Jack Smith has filed to reindict former President Donald Trump's alleged criminal actions after the 2020 election.

Kennedy Jr. sawed the head off a whale and drove it home, daughter says","text":"It is a violation of long-standing federal law to collect parts from the carcass of a protected marine animal if there are still “soft tissues” attached. It becomes political intrigue if the collector was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the severed head of a possibly protected marine mammal streamed “whale juice” down the side of the family minivan three decades ago. On Monday, the political arm of the Center for Biological Diversity, a progressive environmental organization, called on federal authorities to investigate an episode, recounted by Kennedy’s daughter in a 2012 magazine article, in which she said Kennedy chain-sawed the head off a dead whale on a beach in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, bungee-corded it to their vehicle’s roof, and drove it five hours to the family home in Mount Kisco, New York. “It was the rankest thing on the planet,” Kick Kennedy, then 24, told Town & Country in the article, which described Robert Kennedy as someone who likes to study animal skulls and skeletons. The story recently resurfaced, including in an entertainment publication, The Wrap, on Sunday and in a New York Post article Monday. In a letter to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees marine protection, Brett Hartl, the national political director for the Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund, wrote: “There are good reasons why it is illegal for any person to collect or keep parts of any endangered species.” “Most importantly, vital research opportunities are lost when individuals scavenge a wildlife carcass and interfere with the work of scientists. This is particularly true of marine mammals, which are some of the most difficult wildlife species in the world to study.” Some species of whales, Hartl noted, are so rare that scientists can learn about them only through their carcasses washed ashore. Kennedy, he wrote, may have violated not only the Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) — two seminal marine conservation laws — but also the Lacey Act of 1900, a conservation law signed by President William McKinley that prohibits the transportation of illegally gathered wildlife, dead or alive, across state lines. Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for NOAA did not respond to a request for comment. The whale has now joined a baby bear, at least one emu and a worm whose deaths have been intimately associated with Kennedy, the independent presidential candidate — and environmental lawyer — who last week joined forces with former President Donald Trump’s campaign. The Center for Biological Diversity Action Fund has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Kennedy, 70, is a lifelong collector, trainer and handler of wild animals. At his home in Los Angeles, where he has been taming a pair of wild ravens, he also keeps a taxidermied turtle (a former pet) and a rare Sumatran tiger (a gift to his father). Other former pets include at least two emus, one of whom was killed by a mountain lion, the other by a family dog. This month, Kennedy acknowledged that he had left a dead bear cub in Central Park in 2014 because he thought it would be “amusing” — an admission that came ahead of a piece in The New Yorker that detailed the episode. Kennedy told Roseanne Barr that he found the dead bear and had planned to skin the bear and put the meat in his refrigerator, but instead staged it with a bicycle in Central Park. While some of his pursuits with wildlife have been merely curious, some may have skirted the line of the law. The North American Migratory Bird Treaty Act, for example, prohibits the “capture” of at least two species of ravens. New York law prohibits the “illegal possession” and the “illegal disposal” of a bear. In an interview Tuesday, Hartl said the whale incident, if true, would represent a “far worse” violation than the bear cub.

And in a new interview, Amy told how she's taking a positive outlook on life after coming through the other side, admitting she's no longer 'angry' at the disease. Speaking to Prima magazine on how her cancer experience has shaped her, Amy defiantly explained: 'Cancer has changed me forever. I’ll never take anyone or anything for granted, and I know my own self-worth now. You could maybe have walked over me in the past, but now I know my strength.' The dancer had found a lump in her breast the day before heading on honeymoon in May last year and after undergoing treatment, she was given the all clear this year.

The star is now looking forward to the future and can't wait to get back on the Strictly dancefloor later this year. On coming through the other side, she said: 'I’ve come through the other side, and I can’t be angry any more. I can’t change what’s happened, I can only move on. I have the rest of my life ahead of me and I can’t give it any more time than it has already taken.' Amy has also written a book Dancing In The Rain, about her experience, with the blonde beauty recalling how the process of writing her book was so important during her healing process as it gave her 'purpose'. She said: 'When you suffer from a chronic illness or cancer, there’s a weird sense that the world is spinning without you. Your normality is taken away and you lose a sense of purpose. I’m usually such a busy bee, but I was waking up every day and not doing what I love, so the book gave me purpose in what was a very lonely dark time.'

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and affects more than two MILLION women a year Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated? What is breast cancer? It comes from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts. When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding tissue it is called 'invasive'. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule. Most cases develop in those over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men, though this is rare. Staging indicates how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body. The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast-growing. High-grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated. What causes breast cancer? A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'. Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance, such as genetics. What are the symptoms of breast cancer? The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign. The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit. How is breast cancer diagnosed? Initial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours. Biopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer. If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest X-ray. How is breast cancer treated? Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used. Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumour. Radiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focused on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops them from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery. Chemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying. Hormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the 'female' hormone oestrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer. How successful is treatment? The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure. The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 71 means more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

A police officer who tried to subdue Michael Sparks with pepper spray described him as a catalyst for the Jan. 6 insurrection. The Senate that day recessed less than one minute after Sparks jumped into the building through a broken window. Sparks then joined other rioters in chasing a police officer up flights of stairs. Before learning his sentencing, Sparks told the judge that he still believes the 2020 presidential election was marred by fraud and “completely taken from the American public.” “I am remorseful that what transpired that day didn’t help anybody,” Sparks said. “I am remorseful that our country is in the state it’s in.” U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, who sentenced Sparks to four years and five months, told him that there was nothing patriotic about his prominent role in what was a “national disgrace.” “I don’t really think you appreciate the full gravity of what happened that day and, quite frankly, the full seriousness of what you did,” the judge said. Federal prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of four years and nine months for Sparks, a 47-year-old former factory worker from Cecilia, Kentucky. Defense attorney Scott Wendelsdorf asked the judge to sentence Sparks to one year of home detention instead of prison. A jury convicted Sparks of all six charges that he faced, including a felony count of interfering with police during a civil disorder. Sparks didn’t testify at his trial in Washington, D.C. In the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, Sparks used social media to promote conspiracy theories about election fraud and advocate for a civil war. “It’s time to drag them out of Congress. It’s tyranny,” he posted on Facebook three days before the riot. Sparks traveled to Washington, D.C, with co-workers from an electronics and components plant in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They attended then-President Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6. After the rally, Sparks and a friend, Joseph Howe, joined a crowd in marching to the Capitol. Both of them wore tactical vests. Howe was captured on video repeatedly saying, “we’re getting in that building.” Off camera, Sparks added: “All it’s going to take is one person to go. The rest is following,” according to prosecutors. Sparks’ attorney argued that the evidence doesn’t prove that Sparks made that statement. “Of course, both Sparks and Howe were more right than perhaps anyone else knew at the time — it was just a short time later that Sparks made history as the very first person to go inside, and the rest indeed followed,” prosecutors wrote. Dominic Pezzola, a member of the far-right Proud Boys extremist group, used a police shield to break a window next to the Senate Wing Door. Capitol Police Sgt. Victor Nichols sprayed Sparks in the face as he hopped through the shattered glass. Nichols testified that Sparks acted “like a green light for everybody behind him, and everyone followed right behind him because it was like it was okay to go into the building.” Nichols also said Sparks’ actions were “the catalyst for the building being completely breached.” Undeterred by pepper spray, Sparks joined other rioters in chasing Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman as he retreated up the stairs and found backup from other officers near the Senate chamber. “This is our America!” Sparks screamed at police. He left the building about 10 minutes later. Sparks’ attorney downplayed his client’s distinction as the first rioter to enter the building. “While technically true in a time-line sense, he did not lead the crowd into the building or cause the breach through which he and others entered,” Wendelsdorf wrote. “Actually, there were eight different points of access that day separately and independently exploited by the protestors.” But the judge said when and where Sparks entered the Capitol was an important factor in his sentencing. “I think it’s undeniable that the first person” to enter the Capitol “would have an emboldening and encouraging effect on everyone who was at least in your vicinity,” Kelly told Sparks. “To say it wasn’t a material, key point in the mob’s taking of the Capitol, I think, is just ignoring the obvious.” Sparks was arrested in Kentucky less than a month after the riot. Sparks and Howe were charged together in a November 2022 indictment. Howe pleaded guilty to assault and obstruction charges and was sentenced last year to four years and two months in prison. More than 1,400 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Approximately 950 riot defendants have been convicted and sentenced. More than 600 of them have received terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to 22 years.","summary":"A Kentucky man who was the first rioter to enter the U.S. Capitol during a mob’s attack on the building was sentenced on Tuesday to more than four years in prison.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/us-news/first-rioter-to-enter-capitol-during-jan-6-attack-sentenced-to-over-4-years-in-prison/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/michael-sparks-first-rioter-enter-88382915.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XhP2X54D-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:11:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.437},{"id":255065072,"title":"“Trump Offers ‘Piece of Presidential History’ with Knockout Suit Worn at Debate Under $1,500”","text":"ALTHOUGH Donald Trump may have pivoted to politics, he’s reminding supporters of his roots as a businessman with his latest sale. The candidate running for president as a Republican announced to his followers that he will be introducing a new set of trading cards. Customers who buy ,500 worth of these cards will also get a fragment of his suit as a bonus. “Back by popular demand, my TRUMP DIGITAL TRADING CARDS, Series 4: The America First Collection, is available RIGHT NOW, and I think you’ll love it!” he announced on Truth Social alongside a video of him talking in front of American flags. The collection includes 50 new digital trading cards that feature pictures of Trump dancing and posing in superhero costumes. He’s also pictured holding Bitcoins in some of the cards. There are multiple tiers of perks for those who purchase one of his digital trading cards. For those who buy 15 digital cards, a physical card will be sent in the mail along with a piece of Trump’s suit that he wore to debate President Joe Biden. “People are calling it the knock-out suit,” Trump said in the video. “I don’t know about that but that’s what they’re calling it.” He added that the suit marked a “piece of presidential history.” Each digital trading card is priced at $99, so supporters will have to purchase a total of $1,485 worth of digital cards to receive the physical card and piece of Trump’s suit. “This is something to give your family, kids, your grandchildren,” he added. Trump explained that those who purchase the $1,485 worth of digital cards will receive a small piece of the fabric he wore when he debated Biden. Five of those pieces will also be autographed by the former president. The second tier of prizes is for those who purchase 75 digital trading cards, a price point of $7,425. They will receive a piece of Trump’s suit, a physical card, and an invitation to join the former president for a gala at his private club in Jupiter, Florida. “We really have tremendous dinners with my collectors, we have a lot of fun together, we’ll have a great time,” he continued in the video. Supporters must put in their e-mail addresses to purchase the cards and can pay with cryptocurrency or their credit cards. “They call me the crypto president – I don’t know if that’s true or not but a lot of people are saying that, so don’t miss out,” Trump said. “We’re going to have a lot of fun, we’ll be talking about this for a long time,” Trump continued. Trump’s digital trading cards are a staple in his campaign. He previously sold The MugShot Edition cards in December after he was indicted on election interference charges in August 2023. Trump also included pieces of the suit he wore when he was arrested to those who bought 47 cards. His first round of digital trading cards was launched in 2022 and they sold out in less than a day. MORE ON THE SUIT Trump is cutting up the suit he wore to debate Biden as a prize for his digital card collectors. Trump and Biden debated one another on June 27, hosted by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Biden entered the debate with increasing fears of his age and mental fitness as Trump needed to prove his appeal to moderates. Biden failed to ease concerns he could beat Trump in November, and calls quickly came from Democrats for him to step aside. He stood firm in his intent to run and chalked up his debate performance to a “bad night.” Biden explained that he was exhausted from previously traveling for the anniversary of D-Day in France and the G7 meeting in Italy. “I don’t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don’t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,” he reiterated at a rally soon after in North Carolina. However, after multiple appearances in the press and a continued push on the campaign, Biden ended his bid for re-election on July 21 in a letter to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris quickly stepped in as the Democratic nominee and formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on August 22. ROUND 2? Even though Trump and Biden’s debate marked the beginning of the end of Biden’s re-election bid, Trump also made some blunders himself. Politifact tracked 15 false statements Trump made, while the New York Times cited 20 and another 21 that were misleading or lacked context. The Associated Press corrected 11 false statements from Trump and four from Biden. In comparison, Politifact pointed out three false statements from Biden, and the New York Times found zero. While Biden has dropped out of the race, Trump will have another chance to prove his debating skills against a new challenger. The debate has sparked back and forth between Harris and Trump since Harris launched her presidential campaign. After weeks of controversy, the two agreed to debate in the swing state of Pennsylvania moderated by ABC News on September 10.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nALTHOUGH Donald Trump may have pivoted to politics, he&#8217;s reminding supporters of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Trump Offers &#8216;Piece of Presidential History&#8217; with Knockout Suit Worn at Debate Under $1,500&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-offers-piece-of-presidential-history-with-knockout-suit-worn-at-debate-under-1500/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Trump-selling-pieces-of-‘knockout-suit-he-wore-at-debate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:08:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.133},{"id":255064974,"title":"Prosecutors Resubmit Charges That Trump Tried To Overturn Election","text":"Prosecutors on Tuesday filed a revised indictment of Donald Trump, pressing ahead with bombshell charges that he tried to overturn the 2020 US election after losing to Joe Biden.The superseding indictment retains the same four charges against Trump as in an earlier version but takes into account a recent Supreme Court ruling that a former president has broad immunity from criminal prosecution.The new indictment of the 78-year-old Republican White House candidate is 36 pages long, down from 45 pages previously, and removes material affected by the immunity ruling from the conservative-dominated top court.It retains the same core, stating that Trump lost in 2020 but \"was determined to remain in power\" and attempted to subvert the results.The Supreme Court ruled in July that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.This threw into doubt the historic prosecution of the ex-president.Trump referred to the new indictment as an \"act of desperation\" that was part of a \"witch hunt\" against him.\"The illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform.The new indictment comes three days before Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and lawyers for the former president had been set to file a schedule for pre-trial proceedings.Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, had also scheduled a status hearing for September 5 in Washington and it was not immediately clear if that would go ahead now, following the filing of the superseding indictment.Trump's lawyers have been seeking to delay a trial until after November's election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.Trump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by Trump supporters.Trump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise US voters with his campaign of false claims that he won the 2020 election.He was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but that was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.It will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.That and other pre-trial issues are expected to take months, making it unlikely the case will go to trial before the November 5 presidential vote.The new indictment drops references to Jeffrey Clark, a former senior Justice Department official who was one of six co-conspirators listed in the original indictment allegedly enlisted by Trump to press his false claims of election fraud.The Supreme Court, in its immunity ruling, said a president's communications with members of the Justice Department should be considered official acts.The remaining co-conspirators, who include Trump's former personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, \"were acting in a private capacity,\" the indictment said, \"to assist him in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power.\"Regarding the ruling on Trump's immunity, Supreme Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said that she was \"concerned\" about the July verdict, according to an interview released by CBS news on Tuesday.\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" she said.

In the GOP, bigoted attacks on Harris had gotten so bad a closed-door meeting needed to be convened by congressional Republican leaders to warn Republican lawmakers to stop with the race-baiting and misogyny—at least until they can reelect to the White House their race-baiter-and-misogynist-in-chief, Donald Trump. But right-wing “news” commentators have not gotten the memo that these attacks on Harris are out of touch and prone to backfire on white conservative America, which is why they’re still out here pushing sexist and, frankly, childish arguments about how Harris “slept her way to the top” even though she has held elected offices for most of the time she has been in the public eye. Anyway, recently, Fox News host Jesse Watters demonstrated that some of these MAGA pundits just can’t help themselves as he manages to be appallingly sexist as hell—possibly on accident. Watters insisted that if Harris became president, the Joint Chiefs of Staff “would have their way with her” in the Situation Room. “What is her foreign policy? This is where the president has his most impact,” Watters said Monday during an episode of Fox’s The Five. “We don’t know who she is. We don’t know what she believes. She’s gonna get paralyzed in the Situation Room while the generals have their way with her.” Now, Watters will likely pretend he didn’t intentionally make a meeting between the POTUS and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sound like a bad date with Bill Cosby, or that he would have ever used that kind of suggestive language when discussing a male candidate. But even Watters’ conservative MAGA-Karen co-panelists, Dana Perino and Jeanine Pirro, gave Watters a “What in the Law & Order SVU is going on here?” look and chided him for his weird observation. “Figuratively, again. Have their way with her, control her—not in a sexual way,” Watters said in an effort to clean up his absurdly sexist faux pas. Again, the crazy thing is this was probably Watters’ best attempt at being inoffensive. His remarks were about as jarring as they were when he mocked Black Democratic co-host, Harold Ford Jr., by insisting he is “white” and then questioning his racial identity on live air just so he could make some white and fragile point about the “White Dudes for Harris” political action group. Watters’ bigotry was arguably more blatant when he was spreading around the racist white nonsense that Trump would attract more Black voters after his mugshot had gone viral, or when he let his true white nationalist colors show when he insisted Barack Obama lacks “American perspective” because his “father has roots in Africa.” Anyway, plenty of folks on social media clocked the inherently misogynistic language Watters chose to describe Harris’ hypothetical meetings with policy officials, including Kerstin Emhoff, the ex-wife of Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff. “There are many things to worry about, but Kamala being manhandled in the situation room is not one of them,” Kerstin tweeted. One thing right-wing pundits need to worry about regarding a Kamala Harris presidency is how they’re going to get through the next four years at least without continuing to make their networks look like a cross between a Klan rally and a campaign to turn America into The Handmaid’s Tale. Or maybe they can just finally learn to read the room.

They say they can’t abide by Kamala Harris’ position on the war in Gaza. If I understand their view correctly, they believe that voting for the Democratic nominee is voting for genocide. I have already explained why I think third-party candidates who are seeking the presidency are scammers. They can’t win. They know they can’t win. And they know they are lying to people when they say they can. But I want to address something else: that third parties give the impression that voting is the only tool of democratic politics. It isn’t. Small democratic politics happens continuously. It’s all around us. It is the force by which normal people are able to make the world a better place. It happens when we voice opinions about this or that issue. It happens when we give money and time to important causes. It happens when together we decide matters of right and wrong. Wherever there are Americans who are arguing over history, ideas, interests, resources and the law, there is also democratic politics. Because democratic politics is a feature of the American condition, it is larger than electoral politics, which is to say, elections and voting. Democratic politics is so normal as to be invisible, but electoral politics comes around only occasionally, every two years for congressional elections and every four for presidential ones. Because electoral politics is recurring, not ongoing, it gets our attention, and because it gets our attention, we tend to think it’s more important. Americans shouldn’t forget that democratic politics is part of the air we breathe, but unfortunately, we do. And when we forget, I think we become susceptible to ideas that are fundamentally anti-democratic. In the case of third parties, we become susceptible to the idea that we must vote for third party candidates, or not vote at all, if or when the major parties espouse policies that we believe are unconscionable. When it comes to America’s military support of Israel, and Israel’s devastation of the Palestinian people, this appears to be the most common question: How can I get Kamala Harris to change America’s stance – or, if you will, how can I get her to stop supporting genocide – when supporting her gives her reason not to change? Not only is this question common, it appears to be persuasive among young Americans who have little or no feeling for US-Israeli relations. In fact, Kamala Harris struck a new balance at her acceptance speech. By “new,” I mean she put more and better emphasis on the side of the Palestinians than Joe Biden has so far. After describing the horror of the Hamas attacks nearly 10 months ago, Harris said: “What has happened in Gaza … is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. “The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.” Young people don’t know much, but their ignorance isn’t the problem. The problem is the lessons the rest of us teach them. Somehow, we are teaching them to think that voting is the only means of exercising their democratic power and that the choices on Election Day are their only choices. As a consequence, we are teaching them to see third parties as an expansion of choices when the truth is they are the illusion of it. You throw away a vote and you throw away possibilities and hope. Voting for Jill Stein or any third-party candidate in protest of the Democratic Party’s position on Gaza is going to yield nothing. Third-party candidates, no matter what they say, can’t win. If there’s no winning, there’s no power, and without power, you get nothing for your vote. Nothing, except perhaps victory for the Republican nominee. The immediate impact of third-party candidacies is taking votes from one of the other two presidential candidates. As things stand right now, a vote for Jill Stein is a vote for Donald Trump. But they take more than your money, time and vote. They take your hope. They convince supporters that the system is rigged in favor of the major parties. (It isn’t.) Then, when they lose, and they always lose, the loss seems to prove that third-party candidates were right. Supporters either keep throwing away their votes by sticking with third parties or they throw away their hope by refusing to vote at all. Whenever I write about third parties, I risk being accused of shilling for the Democrats. What I’m actually doing is shilling for democratic politics. I’m reminding people of the choices they already have. If young voters fully understood their true democratic power, rather than seeing it as reduced beyond recognition to one day every two to four years, they might not be so attracted to third parties and their false promises. Third-party candidates want you to believe that your choices are limited and that the system is impossibly rigged against you. They want you to believe that because then, you will need them. In that sense, they are demagogic. They are anti-democratic. Fortunately, there are good people, and good young people, who are refusing to learn bad lessons. They are reminding us that elections are just one of the many productive tools of democratic politics. They are remembering that their choices are not limited by parties but by the creativity they put into solving the problems of a democratic society. For example, one of the Connecticut delegates to the Democratic National Convention is Essam Boraey. He voted “present” in the roll-call vote for Harris’ nomination. He didn’t vote against her but he didn’t vote for her either. During President Joe Biden’s speech last Monday, he held up a banner demanding the US “stop arming Israel.” Though he declined to be interviewed by local news media, his vote and protest made headlines throughout the state. He honored his conscience while seeming to leave room to pressure the party. Swaranjit Singh is another delegate from Connecticut who seems to understand. He has called for a ceasefire, but in his interview with the Connecticut Post, he said: “At least [Harris] included Palestine in her remarks, and the struggle of people … and self-determination, which is big. How are we going to reach that? It’s going to be a lot of work. First thing we have to do is elect her and keep the conversation going.” That’s the way to do it.","summary":"Now that Robert F Kennedy Jr has dropped out, some of his voters appear ready to move their support over to Jill Stein, the Green Party’s candidate.

But communists needn’t fear the Hollywood blacklist 2.0. Such hypocrisy is par for the course in a town that seems to get all of its political opinions from Aaron Sorkin screenplays. The ones looking over their shoulders on film and TV sets these days are conservatives. Or, in the case of Cheryl Hines, the conservative-adjacent. Hines is a registered Democrat, like her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. But now that RFK Jr. has bowed out of the 2024 presidential race and backed Donald Trump, Hollywood has pretty much revoked the \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" alum's liberal privilege. It's not that Hines herself has endorsed Trump. Instead, her offense is in suggesting that Trump supporters like her husband may in fact have the country's best interests at heart, whether or not you agree with them. Cue the Hollywood Reporter, which uncorked a veiled threat at Hines: But despite the show of unity with her husband, Kennedy’s decision to align himself so closely with Trump will make for, at best, some awkward dinner table conversations at home; at worst, it may result in a full-scale shunning of Hines by the Hollywood establishment. Why would THR say that? It’s an industry bible and knows what goes on behind the scenes in La La Land. That’s why. The magazine understands that openly conservative stars like James Woods and Kevin Sorbo no longer work in Hollywood due to their beliefs. Both stars lost their respective agents due to political differences. The Oscar-nominated Woods is essentially retired from Hollywood films. Sorbo mostly works in self-produced features. The “Hercules” star cares more about freedom and dignity than echoing the industry’s mandated talking points. And for every loud and proud conservative like screen legend Jon Voight, there are many others (actors, screenwriters, crew members) who keep quiet for fear of professional retaliation. Conservative artists once met in private across Los Angeles under the moniker Friends of Abe. They networked, swapped discriminatory horror stories, and, sometimes, wept over the mistreatment. Or, as THR calls it, “shunning.” Hines’ full-scale shunning may already have started. Former “West Wing” star Bradley Whitford attacked Hines on social media. \"Hey @CherylHines, way to stay silent while your lunatic husband throws his support behind the adjudicated rapist who brags about stripping women of their fundamental rights. Gutsy. Great example for the kids. Profile in courage,\" Whitford wrote on X. Whitford more recently appeared in deranged dystopian fantasy series \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" a show he often cites as reflective of the right's intolerant, anti-women policies. And yet the outspoken feminist — who by all accounts ranks higher in the Hollywood pecking order than Hines — seems more than happy to bully a 58-year-old woman for having the \"wrong\" opinion. Punch down much, Bradley? Such hypocrisy is par for the course in a town that seems to get all of its political opinions from Aaron Sorkin screenplays. Perhaps the upcoming “Reagan” could have a used a rewrite from the \"American President\" scribe. Maybe then the film's marketers wouldn't have found their promotion of the film throttled by Facebook. But the Dennis Quaid-starring biopic dares to portray our country’s 40th president in a favorable light — and to offer work to Voight and Sorbo as well as other openly conservative stars like Nick Searcy and Robert Davi. Naturally, “Reagan,” which premieres August 30, was made outside the Hollywood ecosystem. That's the blacklist 2.0 for you. You won't hear any complaints from Whitford — or from most of his peers. Emmy winner Alec Baldwin did allow that such anti-conservative bias is “unfortunate” in an Instagram post. It’s notable that the high-profile Democrat keeps working despite a history of angry outbursts and an on-set accident in which he shot and killed the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins. Then again, Hollywood loves second acts. As long as you can still make somebody money, there are very few mistakes you can't come back from. Unfortunately for Cheryl Hines, being MAGA by association probably is one of them.","summary":"Hollywood celebrities took a break from cosplaying the ‘50s-era blacklist in “Trumbo” and “Good Night, and Good Luck” to start a new version.

Months before the Georgia State Election Board passed the rules, emails show a Donald Trump-supporter on the board solicited a wish list from conservative county election officials of the materials they would need. “Thank you all for agreeing to provide input on this proposed Rule for Certification Documents needed for Superintendents prior to certification,” Dr. Janice Johnston, the Georgia State Election Board member, wrote on May 12. “What documents and reports do you need to certify the election results?” The documents, obtained through a public records request, show specific election materials that Gwinnett County election board member David Hancock claimed he needed in order to certify results of the May 2024 primary. The materials he mentioned are reflected in the two controversial rules recently passed by Johnston and two pro-Trump colleagues on the State Election Board that give broad power to officials like Hancock to refuse to certify election results. One hundred years of Georgia case law has made clear that the duty of county election officials to certify results is a “ministerial” task, not a discretionary one, election experts and Democrats say. Still, election deniers like Hancock who serve in appointed roles as county election officials have demanded more power to refuse certification — power that has been granted in recent weeks by Johnston and two pro-Trump Republicans on the State Election Board. Refusing to certify results could prevent state officials from counting results in those counties in a timely manner — and potentially delay the results of the presidential election this November, Democrats and election experts warn. Certification refusals also lend credibility to false claims of widespread voter fraud that could aid the Trump campaign in their efforts to challenge the results of the 2024 election. With Democrats raising the alarm about certification refusals, Trump brought the issue further into focus when he praised Johnston and two other Republican members of the State Election Board at an Aug. 3 rally in Atlanta, calling them “pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory.” Hancock, an election denier who has repeatedly posted false information about election fraud and commented on the issue of certification, was appointed to his post by Gwinnett County Republicans in January. Officials like Hancock and others argue that intricate, detailed materials from voting machines and polling locations can help show proof of voter fraud. Despite acknowledging he only found a handful of errors in the results of the May 2024 primary, Hancock shared his enthusiasm for the new rules, one of which allows county election officials to deny certification of results if they decide a “reasonable inquiry” is necessary to investigate irregularities or fraud. “I am looking forward to moving this process along at the state level!” Hancock told Johnston in the May 26 email. The emails show Johnston corresponding with Michael Heekin and Julie Adams, GOP members of the Fulton County election board who have refused to certify results this year; Debbie Fisher, a Republican election board member in Cobb County who has also refused to certify results; and Bridget Thorne, an election denier who sits on the Fulton County Board of Commissioners. Hancock, Johnston, Thorne, Heekin, and Adams did not respond to questions for this story. Fisher declined to comment. The emails obtained Monday shed even more light on the deep coordination between Johnston and election deniers who serve as county election officials, as well as Hancock’s discussions with prominent Georgia election deniers Garland Favorito, David Cross, and Elizabeth Delmas, who is tied to the Constitution Party of Georgia. The emails also show Hancock discussing voter purges with his fellow Republican on the Gwinnett County election board, Alice O’Lenick, who has refused to certify results herself. “This confirms what we’ve suspected — Trump and his election denier allies are engaged in a conspiracy to subvert Georgia elections,” Lauren Groh-Wargo, CEO of the left-leaning voting rights advocacy group, Fair Fight, says in a statement. Democrats said the emails were evidence of continued coordination between Georgia election officials and election denial groups like Cleta Mitchell’s Election Integrity Network because Adams, the Fulton County election board member, received emails from Hancock and Johnston to an email address associated with her role at the Election Integrity Network. “If anyone needed further proof that Donald Trump’s ‘pit bulls’ for ‘victory’ are working in concert with his 2020 election denying attorney, Cleta Mitchell, here it is,” says Georgia Democratic Party Chair and U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams in a statement. “They’re determined to establish a new power of not certifying an election result should their preferred candidate lose — as Trump did in 2020.” While Hancock went on to certify the results of the May primary, the emails show how widespread and coordinated efforts to call results of elections into question have become in Georgia. In March, Hancock, Heekin, and Adams refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. In 2023, Fisher joined Republican election officials in several counties in refusing to certify election results. Adams is now suing with the help of the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute for more discretion to refuse to certify results — power that was granted in the past month thanks to two new certification rules passed by Johnston and two of her Republican colleagues on the State Election Board, Janelle King and Rick Jeffares. (Adams’ lawsuit remains pending.) Those certification rules are now the subject of a lawsuit filed Monday by the Democratic Party of Georgia and the Democratic National Committee, which called the rules not just outside the authority of the State Election Board, but possibly against Georgia law. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has also criticized the two certification rules passed by the State Election Board, saying that Johnston, King, and Jeffares engaged in “activist rule-making” that would “undermine voter confidence and burden election workers.” Also on Monday, Gov. Brian Kemp (R) appeared to react to calls from state Democrats to remove Johnston and fellow pro-Trump election board members King and Jeffares, when Kemp asked Attorney General Chris Carr (R) to determine whether the governor has the authority to remove members of the board. The emails obtained by Rolling Stone and American Doom further expose the involvement of local election denial officials like Hancock in the promulgation of the two controversial certification rules. On May 26, Hancock provided Johnston with a list of materials he was able to view before voting on certification. He had found only a few errors — and no apparent evidence of fraud. “So far the errors I have found only affect a few ballots,” Hancock wrote. Still, he demanded access to more materials. Cathy Woolard, a Democrat and former member of the Fulton County election board, is one of many Democrats who has said the “reasonable inquiry” gives election officials like Hancock too much discretion to refuse to certify results. “One of the problems with reasonable inquiry is that we have 159 counties that will interpret that differently,” Woolard tells Rolling Stone. “There are tens of thousands of documents that cannot be reviewed in time for certification and part of my concern is that reasonable inquiry will include removal of documents from the building for review by people who may not even understand what they’re looking at but can use that information to call election results into question.” At the top of Hancock’s list of materials he required for certification are “the number of votes cast at each precinct does not exceed the number of registered voters at each precinct.” That demand is at the core of the second rule the State Election Board passed in recent weeks, requiring that the numbers of votes cast and ballots line up before certification can proceed. Election experts told ProPublica that these numbers often don’t add up due to machine errors routine in polling locations with large populations, like in large cities where voters tend to skew toward Democrats. On Tuesday, ProPublica also reported that the rule was originally dismissed because State Election Board members thought it went against Georgia law, a potential illegality that Democrats claim in a lawsuit against the State Election Board filed Monday night. The controversy over certification comes as Republicans continue to pursue voter purges in Georgia and across the country — purges that Hancock and Johnston discuss in detail in the emails. Those discussions include Hancock’s claims that tens of thousands of Georgia voters are registered in other states. In the emails, Johnston is receptive to these claims, forwarding an email detailing 27,000 duplicate registrations she calls a “perfect match” because voters in multiple states had the same first, middle, and last names, as well as the same birth year and some similar address information. “Assuming this data is correct, the systemic problem is either a failure to detect duplicate registrations or a failure to remove duplicate registrations,” Johnston wrote. At a Gwinnett County election board hearing last week, Hancock and O’Lenick tried to remove more voters from voter rolls but were outvoted by the board’s Democrats in some cases. Democrats on the board said the challenges amounted to “disenfranchisement.” In an email to Johnston on Aug. 18, Hancock called the Democrats’ refusal to uphold some voter challenges in Gwinnett County a “travesty.” This story is being published in partnership with American Doom, a newsletter that focuses on right-wing extremism and other threats to democracy.","summary":"Emails show a Georgia State Election Board member worked with Trump supporters to write rules allowing counties to refuse to certify election results","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-how-georgia-officials-wrote-rules-deny-election-results-1235089385/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-state-election-board.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 00:00:00","author":"Andrew Perez,Justin Glawe","authors":["Andrew Perez","Justin Glawe"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.116},{"id":255064238,"title":"Crickets from Harris, Biden, Kamala’s tax cuts are really hikes and other commentary","text":"Gold Star families: Crickets From Harris, Biden On the third anniversary of Abbey Gate, “several family members of [the] fallen soldiers said that all they’ve gotten in the past three years is radio silence” from the Biden-Harris team, reports National Review’s Audrey Fahlberg. The president “never once reached out to any of our families. Kamala Harris has never reached out,” said Cheryl Juels, aunt of Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee; the only person who has reached out to our family over and over again — and all 13 families — is Trump.” The dad of Marine Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz: “I personally have never heard from Vice President Harris since Day One of her taking office.” And: “We haven’t heard anything from her at all,” said Alicia Lopez, mother of Marine Cpl. Hunter Lopez. “On the contrary, we have received multiple calls and messages from President Trump and his campaign.” Libertarian: Kam’s Tax Cuts Are Really Hikes Kamala Harris vows to cut middle-class taxes, but what’s known about her proposals suggests families will “face a tax hike in a Harris administration — albeit an indirect one,” warns Reason’s Eric Boehm. “Nearly all Americans would face a higher federal tax burden” if Harris follows through on “Biden’s plan for $5 trillion in tax hikes — including a $1.3 trillion increase of the corporate income tax.” Recall, “higher corporate taxes are passed along to consumers, employees, and investors in the form of high prices, lower wages, and lower investment returns.” Yet Donald Trump’s plan for new tariffs also “would cost Americans,” because: Whether you tax corporations or imports, those “taxes are paid by people in the end.” From the right: Durov’s a ‘Hero,’ Not a Villain Since Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in Paris Saturday, the West has somehow presumed him “guilty,” yet Durov,” roars Shaun Maguire on X, is actually a “hero.” He created “a platform that enabled citizens to communicate with each other transcending borders and autocratic regimes.” Indeed, “Telegram has played an essential role in many pro-democracy protests”; “Durov has been the enemy of autocratic governments his entire adult life. And many Western governments are rapidly descending towards autocracy, so Durov is now their enemy as well.” The charges against him “could be levied against any social media platform.” Alas, liberal values “are under attack in the West to a magnitude that very few people understand.” Elex watch: Dems’ Deceptive Kamala Portrait Democrats have “updated” Mario Cuomo’s adage that “you campaign in poetry” but “govern in prose,” argues The Wall Street Journal’s Gerard Baker: In campaigns, they “present themselves as a kind of idealized version of themselves as mainstream Americans,” seeking merely to bring “unity and compassion” to a nation in need of reform. “Once in office they act as if they have a mandate to remake a benighted country, to reorder an unjust system, to replace American exceptionalism with European social democracy, and to rewrite the nation’s values with the precepts of their cultural Marxism.” Think a President Kamala Harris would resemble the wholesome “Candidate Harris” depicted at last week’s convention? If so, “then it isn’t poetry you’ve been reading. It’s a fairy tale.” Gaza war: Hamas’ Tunnels Are Key The IDF’s rescue of a hostage from a tunnel in Gaza on Monday is “a moment for celebration,” notes Commentary’s Seth Mandel, but also “for a reality check”: The tunnels “remain operational and must continue to be a focus of the war.” Not only does Hamas hide hostages in them; without the tunnels, the terrorists “would be unable to rearm and resupply in perpetuity” across the Gaza-Egypt border, or Philadelphi Corridor. Handing the corridor to Hamas and Egypt means endless war, yet the Biden-Harris folks have been pressing Israel to abandon it. Sorry, but you “are either for Hamas rearmament or you are against it.” The tunnels are “the instruments of rearmament and hostage taking.

James Lankford (R-OK) told the Washington Examiner in a phone call Tuesday afternoon that he doubted $650 million of border wall funding that he and Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) proposed in the deal last winter, was still available, potentially rendering meaningless Harris’s sudden willingness to spend money on a border wall. “That February, when we were bringing this up, that’s what we had left — the $650 million,” said Lankford. “The assumption that $650 million is still sitting there, I doubt. I couldn’t tell you I know where it is, but I doubt that that is still sitting there ready to go at this point.” The revelation came after Axios reported Tuesday that a Harris campaign aide disclosed that she would support the bill’s hundreds of millions of dollars to fund more 18- to 30-foot-tall steel barriers at the southern border — projects that were funded by Congress during the Trump administration but not completed. Harris, once running as a liberal Democrat, has been ardently opposed to the border wall in the past. She claimed on multiple occasions while still serving in the Senate that she would block former President Donald Trump’s funding requests to construct new sections of border wall dismissing it as Trump’s “medieval vanity project.” However, the vice president’s 2024 campaign did not directly refute Axios’s Tuesday report indicating the vice president had flip-flopped on constructing a new border wall, and she has grown noticeably more hawkish on the subject of immigration since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket from President Joe Biden in July. At the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past week, Harris steadfastly blamed Trump and Republican lawmakers for killing the bipartisan border bill and vowed to, if elected in November, sign that bill into law while simultaneously advancing a legal pathway to citizenship for DREAMers. “I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you,” the vice president declared. “As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law.” However, Lankford voiced skepticism to the Washington Examiner that Harris had truly had a change of heart on border wall funding and noted that she and her team had never reached out to him at any time since last fall, including in the days since she stated at the Democratic National Convention last week that she would sign his border deal into law. “She’s definitely not reached out to me, nor anyone on our staff, on this,” said Lankford. Lankford said the bipartisan deal that he spent months brokering with Sinema and Murphy, as well as Biden administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, was likely not up for consideration any longer. “When you get into 2025, it’s a different moment,” said Lankford. “We have no idea what the border is going to be, and I have no optimism that President Harris would enforce the border any different than President Biden has. But at that point, you’re not going to just take a bill as-is and drop it into a new year and say that’s what it’s going to be.” At the time of the negotiations last fall and into February this year, the number of migrants apprehended by the Border Patrol for entering the United States from Mexico illegally hit an all-time high. Nearly 250,000 illegal immigrants were stopped at the southern border in December 2023, and the bill was drafted to deal with the historic border crisis at hand that has since dramatically changed in terms of demographics crossing. Republicans revolted at news that Harris was supportive of building more border wall and claimed her new position was nothing more than a political play that she would rescind post-election. “San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris’ fake promises to secure the border will never become reality,” said National Republican Congressional Committee press secretary Will Reinert in a statement. “The same Kamala who wanted to abolish ICE and decriminalize illegal border crossings will cave to House Democrats’ open-border demands.” A spokeswoman for Trump knocked Harris’s behind-the-scenes policy pivot as “preposterous.” “Kamala’s RECORD proves she is pro-open border. She called the wall ‘un-American,’ a ‘waste of taxpayer money,’ ‘medieval,’ and said it isn’t going to ‘stop’ illegal immigration,” said Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s campaign press secretary. “How much longer will the mainstream media allow Kamala Harris to hide and use staff to speak on her behalf?

Kamala Harris? After years of slamming former President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the southern border, Harris is subtly co-opting his message to sell herself as a border hawk. At her DNC speech, Harris pledged to bring back the border security bill killed in the Senate last year, which pledges hundreds of millions of dollars to expand the border wall, and sign it into law if elected. And she used photos of already-built sections of the wall in an ad touting her record as a “border-state prosecutor.” Harris hated the wall until about five seconds ago; in 2017, she called it a “stupid use of money” and vowed to “block any funding for it.” In 2019, she slammed the “medieval vanity project” and promised, “I’m not going to vote for a wall under any circumstances.” And of course she was border czar in an administration that literally sold off the not-yet-used wall-building material it inherited. But now she’s facing an electorate furious over the millions of illegal immigrants waved in by the Biden-Harris administration. In 2024, 35% of voters see the border crisis as the country’s No. 1 issue, and a majority of Americans (53%) support a border wall. So Harris wants to look like she does, too. That’s not the only MAGA idea she’s cribbed: She copy/pasted the “no taxes on tips” policy that Trump has been speaking about at rallies since June; she’s also proposed a $6,000 child tax credit, embracing an idea the left had been slamming Sen. J.D. Vance for. Meanwhile, nearly every day some Harris aide says (mostly anonymously — why?) the candidate no longer holds one or another past (on the record) position, whether it’s the fracking ban she’s long wanted or the major price controls she announced this month. Tuesday, top campaign aide Ammar Moussa blast-emailed the “news” that Harris doesn’t want to ban non-electric cars . . . though as proof she only cited Biden administration policies, without actually disavowing the bills Harris backed in the Senate to outlaw them as soon as 2035. Harris’ plan for winning in November sure seems to involve going MAGA. Or at least Trump-ifying just enough to convince Americans she has the cure for the ills that her administration caused. It’s all bull: Even if she dons a MAGA cap, all she has below it are the dysfunctional policies of the Biden-Harris years. Even with most of the media eager to help sell her supposed transformation, this Kameleon strategy is pure spin on a Biden 2.0 agenda.","summary":"After years of slamming former President Donald Trump's plan to build a wall along the southern border, Kamala Harris is co-opting his message to sell herself as a border hawk.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/opinion/kamala-harris-border-wall-pivot-copies-donald-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-copen7so9-1724801444745.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724787151&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:50:08","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":255065080,"title":"Jack Smith holds accomplices accountable in January 6th incident","text":"The special counsel’s team carefully avoided the U.S. Supreme Court’s efforts to weaken their prosecution of the Jan. 6 case by submitting a new indictment on Tuesday.

While the new filing eschews several earlier references to explicitly-verboten issues – topics and discussions which the nation’s high court ruled are subject to the novel and broad-reaching legal concept of post-presidential immunity for criminal acts created in their July 1, landmark opinion – there are also some key additions. In an early section of the superseding indictment, Smith looks to stake out territory that both precludes the use of “official acts” claims by the defendant, and which also serves as a warning to alleged co-conspirators that the Supreme Court’s ruling was not for them. The extent to which the special counsel’s arguments here actually inure to the government’s favor, of course, will be up to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan to determine – not to mention the likely inevitable second and third looks by reviewing courts up the line. “These co-conspirators included the following individuals, none of whom were government officials during the conspiracies and all of whom were acting in a private capacity,” the new indictment reads. The indictment goes on to list four “private” attorneys and one “private political consultant,” while notably excising Justice Department officials from the alleged conspiracy entirely. Indeed, elision is the name of the game for Smith and his office insofar as references to Trump’s discussions and interactions with members of the “Justice Department” are concerned writ large. Such deletions are seemingly expressly crafted to jibe with a section from the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling that says “Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.” While former DOJ officials may no longer have Smith’s would-be subpoenas on their mind the prosecutor drops and dangles a few more Damoclean hints to others within Trump’s orbit. “The Defendant continued his lies through the day of the certification proceeding on January 6,” the new indictment reads. “That morning, the Defendant gave a Campaign speech at a privately-funded, privately-organized political rally held on the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. During the speech, the Defendant used many of the same unsupported, objectively unreasonable, and publicly disproven lies to exhort the gathered crowd to march to the Capitol.” The superseding indictment also references Trump’s then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in the following highly-revised (added to) section about election subversion efforts in Georgia: On January 2, four days before Congress’s certification proceeding, the Defendant, his Chief of Staff-who sometimes handled private and others called Campaign-related logistics for the Defendant-and private attorneys involved in the lawsuit against Georgia’s Secretary of State called the Secretary of State. Again, the changes to the indictment veer toward referencing the allegedly “private” nature of services provided and actions taken. Despite the handful of relevant additions to the government’s narrative, the new grand jury’s post-immunity indictment contains nine pages less than the first indictment filed on Aug. 1, 2023. Same as it ever was, Trump stands accused of one count each of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the right to vote and to have votes counted.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThen President Donald Trump talks to White House chief of staff Mark&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jack Smith holds accomplices accountable in January 6th incident first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/jack-smith-holds-accomplices-accountable-in-january-6th-incident/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Jack-Smith-takes-co-conspirators-in-Jan-6-case-to-task.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:48:16","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":255064418,"title":"Trump selling pieces of ‘knockout suit’ he wore at debate for under $1,500 as he touts ‘piece of presidential history’","text":"ALTHOUGH Donald Trump may have pivoted to politics, he's reminding supporters of his roots as a businessman with his latest sale.

Trump and Biden debated one another on June 27, hosted by CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Biden entered the debate with increasing fears of his age and mental fitness as Trump needed to prove his appeal to moderates. Biden failed to ease concerns he could beat Trump in November, and calls quickly came from Democrats for him to step aside. He stood firm in his intent to run and chalked up his debate performance to a \"bad night.\" Biden explained that he was exhausted from previously traveling for the anniversary of D-Day in France and the G7 meeting in Italy. \"I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth,\" he reiterated at a rally soon after in North Carolina. However, after multiple appearances in the press and a continued push on the campaign, Biden ended his bid for re-election on July 21 in a letter to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris quickly stepped in as the Democratic nominee and formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention on August 22. ROUND 2?

A fact that Offerman made crystal today about Donald Trump once again on YouTube with a new version of his “Proud to Be a Kamala Man” song. Performed from the POV of a GOP voter who has had enough of Trump’s “cons and lies/ the rapes and rants,” the tune is a slicker mix of the song Offerman offered up on the virtual Comics for Kamala fundraiser earlier this month. “I am very enthusiastic to be supporting the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz,” Offerman says in an intro to the song and its video of Trump’s greatest fails. “For obvious reasons, there are a lot of Republicans who are suddenly very Kamala curious,” the actor who played a MAGA man in Ava DuVernay‘s Origins last year adds. “There are all these organizations of Republicans for Kamala, and it’s very exciting.” “Without further ado, let me offer you a song that’s from the point of view of one of these Republicans, one of these good citizens who formerly was a little bit, blinded by misinformation, who has now found their way to see clear to decency.” Hear and see Offerman’s “Proud to Be a Kamala Man” here The music of the self-described and tongue firmly cheek song may sound a lot like Trump fave Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA”, but the lyrics from Offerman and Mark Rivers are as anti-MAGA as you can get. With lines like ‘Cuz there’s no denyin’/Trump’s a f*cking d*ck” and “Kamala’s got momentum, and that lady she’s no quitter/Plus, she never hid nuclear secrets in the Mar-a-Lago shitter,” Offerman puts all his cards on the table – as you can hear above Having picked up almost 26,000 views in the past 10 hours since the new and improved “Proud to Be a Kamala Man ends with a “Donate Today KamalaHarris.com” slate. The fact that the Kamala song is still available online is a little odd. Offerman’s original and more low-fi version was posted on YouTube back in first week of August after the $530,000 raising Comics for Kamala event. It was quickly pulled down due to a “copyright claim from Greenwood Legacy Music.” In an election that has seen the former Celebrity Apprentice host’s campaign hit again and again by artists like Celine Dion and the Foo Fighters wanting the ex-POTUS not to use their music, the fact that ‘Proud to Be a Kamala Man” 2.0 has been taken down is surprising. Deadline reached out to reps for Greenwood, who performed over all four nights of the RNC back in July. Nothing yet. However, if and when we do get a response this post will be updated. And yes, using the description Democratic VP nominee Walz has popularised on the GOP ticket, there is a “weird” in there. Case in point: “And J.D. Vance looks like a baby’s butt underneath that creepy beard/So I’ll say it loud and I’ll sing it proud, those guys are f*cking weird.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNick Offerman may have played an authoritarian POTUS in Alex Garland’s Civil&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nick Offerman Mocks Donald Trump in &#8216;Proud to Support Kamala&#8217; Fundraiser Song first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/nick-offerman-mocks-donald-trump-in-proud-to-support-kamala-fundraiser-song/","image":"https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screen-Shot-2024-08-27-at-4.35.59-PM.png?w=300","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:44:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.178},{"id":255064554,"title":"New audio reveals JD Vance accusing childless left of ‘trying to brainwash the minds of our children’","text":"In the latest audio recording to resurface, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance can once again be heard going after women without children as somehow being harmful to other people’s kids. “So many of the leaders of the left, and I hate to be so personal about this, but they’re people without kids trying to brainwash the minds of our children,” Vance said at a 2021 Center for Christian Virtue forum, in audio unearthed by nonprofit Chicagoland radio station WCPT820. Vance, Donald Trump’s 2024 running mate, went on to slam American Federation of Teachers boss Randi Weingarten, insisting: “[S]he doesn’t have a single child. If she wants to brainwash and destroy the minds of children, she should have some of her own and leave ours the hell alone.\" The freshman senator, Yale-educated lawyer and former venture capitalist, first lobbed a widely derided slur about women who had never given birth during a 2021 interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson. He lamented that the US was under the control of “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Vance went on to slam Vice President and Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris, Transportation Secretray Pete Buttigieg, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a cabal “without children,” who shouldn’t be making decisions for others. “How does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance asked Carlson. Vance didn’t limit the “cat ladies” insult to women, either. Also in 2021, Vance took aim at economist Paul Krugman, tweeting: “Paul Krugman is one of many weird cat ladies who have too much power in our country. We should change this.” Vance has also argued that those without children should pay higher taxes and have diminished voting rights. His offensive remarks have been met with outrage along with people sharing their personal stories. Former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head in a 2011 assassination attempt, posted on X that she and astronaut husband Senator Mark Kelly, a VP shortlister before Harris chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, had tried and failed to conceive via IVF. “To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,” Giffords posted. Actress Jennifer Aniston also slammed Vance for his insensitivity to women struggling to conceive, posting to social media that she hoped Vance’s own daughter is “fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.” “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option,” Aniston said. “Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.” Vance responded and called Aniston’s take “disgusting.” At the Democratic National Convention earlier this month, Oprah Winfrey made a dig at Vance by saying that if a house was on fire that happened to belong to a “childless cat lady,” she’d still try to save her and her pet. On Sunday, Vance tried to walk back his comments, saying during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press: “I made a sarcastic comment years ago that I think that a lot of Democrats have willfully misinterpreted.” He said he had “a lot of regrets,” but that “a joke three years ago is not at the top 10 of the list.”","summary":"Republican vice presidential candidate made offensive remarks at a 2021 Center for Christian Virtue forum","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-kamala-harris-childless-cat-ladies-trump-b2602793.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/25/17/vance_mtp_august.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xPMau62d-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:37:39","author":"Justin Rohrlich","authors":["Justin Rohrlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":255063526,"title":"Special counsel reindicts Trump in election interference case after Supreme Court ruling","text":"Special counsel reindicts Trump in election interference case after Supreme Court ruling Special counsel Jack Smith has reindicted former President Donald Trump in the federal election interference case.

It was impressive learning about all the numerous obstacles and setbacks they encountered on their way to California from the Midwest, and their resolve and courage to continue their journey in spite of them. I worry for the future of our country when I contrast those experiences with some of our current university students. We see numerous reports of students who claim all sorts of words are “triggers” and might upset them or make them feel uncomfortable. They also need to have “safe spaces” where they can retreat from thoughts or ideas different from theirs. Note that the vast majority of these students are not military veterans who, based on personal experiences, suffer from PTSD, and actually deserve compassion and consideration from others.

The singer, 65, was first diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer in 2005 before getting the all-clear in 2006. But in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020. Last year, she shared the news that the cancer had spread to her brain, with two tumours discovered on the left side of her brain which left her struggling with her speech and balance. However, while the disease appeared to be stable in Linda's recent updates, her latest prognosis has revealed the devastating news that two of her largest tumours has grown in size, while further cancer spots have been found. In a new interview, Linda admitted she was left 'sobbing' as the doctor delivered the results, saying how she wished cancer would just 'leave her alone.'

But in 2017 she was diagnosed with a form of incurable secondary cancer in her hip, which spread to her liver in 2020 She told The Mirror: 'I sobbed when my consultant first told me. I know so many people are suffering and going through things, but I thought, just for once, could cancer just leave me alone? My heart sank.' Detailing how she suspected something was amiss beforehand, she said: 'I had feared something was wrong. My balance has been getting worse and my memory - my sisters have to prompt me when I get lost in the middle of a sentence.' Linda told how she was accompanied by sister Maureen and her MacMillan nurse at the appointment and immediately asked her consultant if the cancer had spread. After it was confirmed, she told how she then enquired straight away what the next course of treatment would be. The Nolans star is set to start on a new course of treatment on Wednesday which will include the life-extending breast cancer drug Enhertu - which is not currently available on the health service in England after its manufacturers and the NHS spending watchdog failed to reach an agreement on price. Linda said of the treatment: 'To be able to try a new drug is amazing, I just wish everyone could have this opportunity. To be able to try this is hope - it’s a plan B not everyone is being allowed. To take this drug away from women is to take away their hope.' But while Linda welcomes the new drug, the singer is dreading the side-effects after medics informed her it was a 'possibility' that she'll lose her hair - which will be the fifth time for Linda amid her years of chemotherapy. The brave star is trying to keep a positive outlook however as she insisted that she's 'ready to try anything', declaring that as she's done tis before, she can 'do it again'. In Linda's recent updates, her latest prognosis has revealed the devastating news that two of her largest tumours has grown in size, while further cancer spots have been found 'I sobbed when my consultant first told me. I know so many people are suffering and going through things, but I thought, just for once, could cancer just leave me alone? My heart sank' (pictured with sister Anne in August 2020) In April, Linda revealed that she's always 'keen to squeeze the most out of life' amid her cancer battle. Read More Coleen Nolan checks thoroughly for cancer every day after its tragic effect on her family In an interview she has told how her main focus is 'making memories' with her family and filling up her schedule with happy plans. She told The Mirror that since her birthday celebrations in February her and the family have had a stream of 'knees-ups' including her niece Amy's birthday, her sister Coleen's birthday and St Patrick's celebrations. Linda told the publication: 'The WhatsApps are flying. Like I said to my counsellor, it's a funny life in my head. Never mind tumours, it sometimes feels like I have worms wriggling in there. 'I'm constantly so keen to squeeze the most out of life; to make memories, to enjoy every second, and to ensure everyone enjoys their time with me. In April, Linda revealed that she's always 'keen to squeeze the most out of life' amid her cancer battle This week I'm realising perhaps I'm putting too much pressure on it all. Can you have too much fun? Nah. But life doesn't stop teaching you lessons, does it? And just when you think you have this cancer malarkey all figured out.' Just days ago, Linda's sister Coleen said it has become a daily ritual for her to check for signs of cancer everyday after the tragic effects the disease has had on her family. The Loose Women presenter, who is one if six sisters, candidly admitted she is terrified she will be the family member targeted by the disease next. Cancer has significantly affected the Nolan family after the sisters lost Bernie, 52, in 2013 after a three year battle with breast cancer. Meanwhile both Anne, 73, and Linda have also both battled breast cancer. Speaking to The Mirror Coleen opened up about the preventative measures she takes as she explained: 'We have had so much heartache... I'm always checking. I still have this thing when I think, \"What if I have missed it?\" Just days ago, Linda's sister Coleen said it has become a daily ritual for her to check for signs of cancer everyday after the tragic effects the disease has had on her family Cancer has significantly affected the Nolan family after the sisters lost Bernie, 52, in 2013 after a three year battle with breast cancer. Meanwhile both Anne, 73, and Linda, 65, have also both battled breast cancer In 2013, Bernie Nolan passed away after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, and despite being given the all-clear the disease returned in 2012 'Whenever I'm in the shower, I will have a good feel and check and if there is ever a time when I think \"I don't like that\", I will go to the doctor straight away. And they will say \"It's fine, it's a little cyst or an infection\". While Coleen hopes she doesn't get the disease, she explained that if she is unfortunate she wants to catch it early. Revealing how much she spends on health care, she admitted: 'My breast specialist is £225 a year. People say, \"It's all right for you, you've got money\". But you could probably spend that in a year on takeaways, down the pub or on cigarettes.' The TV star pays for regular appointments with a breast specialist, in addition to her NHS mammogram every two years.

The Harris campaign did not immediately return a request for confirmation about the ABC-hosted debate. The candidates campaigns clashed on Monday over the previously agreed-upon debate, with the vice president's team seeking a return to open microphones while Trump threatened to pull out entirely after suggesting the network was biased. In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said the rules for next month's debate will be the same as they were for the June CNN debate he had with President Joe Biden, whose poor performance led him to drop out of the 2024 race. \"The Debate will be 'stand up,' and Candidates cannot bring notes, or 'cheat sheets.' We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a 'fair and equitable' Debate, and that neither side will be given the questions in advance,\" Trump wrote. The CNN debate did not have a live audience. Trump's post did not mention that. Harris' campaign had said it wanted the broadcaster to keep the candidates' microphones on throughout the event, not muted when their opponent was speaking as in the last presidential debate. So-called \"hot mics\" can help or hurt political candidates, catching offhand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public. While Trump's team said it had already agreed to have closed microphones, Trump later told reporters that he preferred to have his microphone kept on. Trump's campaign has floated an additional debate on Sept. 4 on Fox News network but the Harris team rejected that.

It will be Broadcast Live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.” He added: “The Rules will be the same as the last CNN Debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden.” Also on Tuesday, Special Counsel Jack Smith unveiled a fresh indictment against the former president for his allegedly illegal attempts to reverse his 2020 election loss. The new Grand Jury indictment comes after the Supreme Court granted Trump some “immunity” from criminal prosecution for his “official actions in office.” Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 Republicans who worked for President George W Bush and senators John McCain and Mitt Romney have endorsed Harris for president over Trump. The vice president has clinched a seven-point national lead over her Republican rival, leading him 50 per cent to 43 per cent, according to a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll.","summary":"GOP staffers for George W Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney have endorsed vice president over former president Trump in November’s presidential election","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-interview-dr-phil-kamala-harris-news-b2602814.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/26/15/mic.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ycjnRWqF-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:20:47","author":"James Liddell and Alex Woodward,Oliver O'connell","authors":["James Liddell and Alex Woodward","Oliver O'connell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.005},{"id":255065524,"title":"Trump Responds to Jack Smith Filing Superseding Indictment: 'Should Be Dismissed'","text":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith for filing a superseding indictment with the same four charges Trump was originally charged with regarding alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the updated indictment as an effort by Smith to bring back “a dead” witch hunt, and added that the updated superseding indictment had “all the problems of the old indictment,” and “should be dismissed.” Trump’s post comes after a Washington, D.C. grand jury returned a superseding indictment with four charges: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. “In an effort to resurrect a ‘dead’ Witch Hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation, and in order to save face, the illegally appointed ‘Special Counsel’ Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote. Trump noted that Smith’s “Florida Document Hoax Case” had been dismissed, and the updated superseding indictment was “an attempt to interfere with the election.” In July, a Florida judge tossed out a documents case against Trump, ruling that Smith was not appointed constitutionally or in a lawful manner. “This is merely an attempt to INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION, and distract the American People from the catastrophes Kamala Harris has inflicted on our Nation, like the Border Invasion, Migrant Crime, Rampant Inflation, the threat of World War III, and more,” Trump added. The four charges are the same charges Smith had previously brought against Trump. In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity in July, some aspects of the indictment were taken out and changed. “The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,” Smith wrote in a court document.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump criticized Special Counsel Jack Smith for filing a superseding indictment with the same four charges Trump was originally charged with regarding alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\n\nThe post Trump Responds to Jack Smith Filing Superseding Indictment: &#8216;Should Be Dismissed&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/08/27/trump-responds-to-jack-smith-filing-superseding-indictment-should-be-dismissed/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Donald-Trump-and-Jack-Smith-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:15:37","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":255064206,"title":"Strictly's Kai Widdrington 'will NOT be paired with a celebrity partner in 2024 series' in latest blow to scandal hit BBC show","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Wednesday, Aug 28th 2024 1AM 14°C 4AM 13°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Pregnant Barbie actress Margot Robbie looks swell in unbuttoned white shirt as she enjoys sweet babymoon with husband Tom Ackerley in Sardinia 'It defies justice': Murder victim Zara Aleena's family tell of their horror as female prison worker, 33, is charged with having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the man serving 38 years for killing the law graduate Linda Nolan shares heartbreaking cancer update as she reveals her tumours have 'grown' after her treatment 'stopped working' Peloton's former billionaire CEO reveals he's 'lost all his money' and is selling his possessions - as he breaks his silence on Sex and the City debacle The tricks one driver used to slash an astonishing £18,601 off their car insurance... and how you can do the same Science shows this supplement really can slow down ageing and experts are excited.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Lily Jobson For Mailonline Published:00:10 BST, 28 August 2024 |Updated:00:14 BST, 28 August 2024 e-mail 23 shares View comments Kai Widdrington 'will not be paired with a celebrity partner' in the upcoming 2024 series, according to new reports. The professional dancer, 29 - who was paired with Angela Rippon in the 2023 series - is said to be 'gutted' over the decision made. The BBC have decided to bench the Strictly star, who split from girlfriend Nadiya Bychkova in June, in the latest blow to the scandal hit show. Although he was confirmed to be returning to the series, Kai has been forced to step down from the competition due to the small amount of female celebrities taking part. He will still take part in the group dances. In this year's line-up, only six women will compete against nine men - a first in the show's history. Kai Widdrington, 29, 'will not be paired with a celebrity partner' in the upcoming 2024 series, according to new reports The professional dancer - who was paired with Angela Rippon (pictured) in the 2023 series - is said to be 'gutted' over the decision made A source told The Sun: 'Kai has become the first casualty of this year’s male-heavy line-up. With so few female celebrities it was inevitable that some of the professionals would miss out on a pairing, but it’s a real blow that Kai is one of them. 'He had a great run last series with Angela and is a fan favourite. But, just like last year with Nadiya when she wasn’t given a partner, bosses have to look at a number of factors when choosing which dancer to pair with which celebrity. 'They look at everything from height through to chemistry tests to see who will work best together and it’s meant Kai has missed out. He will be part of the group dances alongside other males who haven’t been selected this year.' MailOnline have contacted Kai and Strictly Come Dancing for a comment. The male-heavy line-up follow a flurry of bullying allegations after Amanda Abbington and Zara McDermott spoke about their experiences in rehearsals. This year, Giovanni Pernice, 33, and Graziano Di Prima were on the receiving end of allegations they had mistreated their celebrity dance partners. Giovanni has vehemently denied any wrongdoing while Graziano, 30, initially confirmed and regretted his actions against Zara. The identities of the contestants competing in series 22 of Strictly, beginning in September, were unveiled from August 5. It comes after it was confirmed that a verdict on the Giovanni-Amanda Abbington row is expected to be announced within days. But the BBC have decided to bench the Strictly star, who split from girlfriend Nadiya Bychkova (pictured) in June, in the latest blow to the scandal hit show Although he was confirmed to be returning to the series, Kai has been forced to step down from the competition due to the small amount of female celebrities taking part (pictured with Angela last year) This year, Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima were on the receiving end of allegations they had mistreated their celebrity dance partners Giovanni has vehemently denied any wrongdoing while Graziano initially confirmed and regretted his actions against Zara The Strictly scandal erupted when Sherlock actress Amanda quit the show in 2023.

Tuesday’s indictment narrows the focus of the case, trimming away interactions Trump had with the Department of Justice. Still, the central charge remains the same: that Trump attempted to subvert the 2020 presidential election and overturn his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He has long claimed, falsely and without evidence, that widespread voter fraud marred the 2020 race. The reworked case, unfolding in Washington, DC, is one of four indictments Trump faces. He is the first US president to face and be convicted of criminal charges. Only one of the four cases, however, has culminated in a conviction: In May, Trump was found guilty of 34 charges of falsifying business records in New York. Even that verdict has been thrown into potential legal limbo as a result of the recent Supreme Court decision granting broad immunity to presidential actions. What was the Supreme Court’s decision? On July 1, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Trump v United States that all “official” presidential acts are entitled to “presumptive immunity” against prosecution. What counts as “official” acts, the court explained, goes beyond what falls within a president’s constitutional authority, marking a significant widening of executive power. The court’s decision made explicit reference to the events of January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the Electoral College vote. Referring to the Washington, DC, indictment, the court’s majority pointed to an example where Trump was accused of “attempting to enlist the Vice President” to “alter the election results”. Since interacting with a vice president is part of a president’s official duties, the court explained, “Trump is at least presumptively immune from prosecution for such conduct”. The Supreme Court currently has a conservative supermajority, with three of the judges appointed by Trump himself. The decision was issued along ideological lines, with the three left-leaning justices dissenting. How did the court influence Tuesday’s indictment? The court’s decision had an immediate impact on the Washington case, as well as the other indictments against Trump. Tuesday’s revised indictment shows how federal prosecutors, led by special counsel Jack Smith, intend to react to the ruling. The indictment has been slimmed down from 45 pages to 36, removing the references the Supreme Court singled out in its July decision. It also emphasises that the interactions detailed in the new version were with people who lie outside of the president’s official orbit. In naming Trump’s co-conspirators, for instance, the revised indictment explains none “were government officials during the conspiracies and all of whom were acting in a private capacity”. However, the central charges remain identical to the first version of the indictment: that Trump entered into a conspiracy to defraud the United States; to obstruct and impede an official proceeding; and to prevent legitimate votes from being counted. Trump faces four counts related to those criminal charges. “Each of these conspiracies — which build on the widespread mistrust the Defendant was creating through pervasive and destabilizing lies about election fraud — targeted a bedrock function of the United States government: the nation’s process of collecting, counting and certifying the results of the presidential election,” the indictment reads. How did Trump react? The reworked indictment triggered a flurry of reaction from Trump on his Truth Social account. “In an effort to resurrect a ‘dead’ Witch Hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation, and in order to save face, the illegally appointed “Special Counsel” Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me,” Trump wrote. He said the new version had “all the problems of the old Indictment”. He called for it to be “dismissed IMMEDIATELY”. The former Republican president is in the midst of a second re-election campaign, ahead of the November 5 presidential vote. He has repeatedly denounced the criminal charges against him as an attempt to derail his latest White House bid, an allegation he repeated again on Tuesday. “PERSECUTION OF A POLITICAL OPPONENT!” he wrote in all capital letters in a separate post. In a later missive, he referenced a 2022 decision from the Biden Justice Department that bars political appointees in the agency from participating in an election-related activities within 60 days of an upcoming vote. “It is DOJ policy that the Department of Justice should not take any action that will influence an election within 60 days of that election — but they just have taken such action,” Trump alleged, referencing the early-voting date in some states, instead of the official November 5 election day. For his part, Smith — the special counsel appointed to independently lead the Justice Department’s investigations into Trump — said that the newly revamped indictment reflected “the Government’s efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions”. Smith originally introduced the election interference indictment on August 1, 2023, after a grand jury voted to indict Trump for his actions during the 2020 election and its aftermath. It was the third of the four indictments to be announced. US District Judge Tanya Chutkan is expected to rule in the case, which is unlikely to reach trial before the November election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the criminal charges he faces.","summary":"Reworked indictment keeps the same charges but addresses a Supreme Court decision that broadens presidential immunity.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/27/special-counsel-jack-smith-issues-revised-indictment-in-trump-election-case?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24239739895636-1724799535.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:11:01","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":255062834,"title":"Deranged left-wing conspiracy theories that Trump staged assassination attempt are racking up millions of views","text":"Over a month after the attempt on former president Donald Trump’s life, left-wing conspiracy theories claiming that the shooting was staged still pervade social media on platforms like X — where they are racking up millions of views. Hashtags like “#Staged,” “#StagedbyTrump,” or “#StagedAssassinationAttempt” continue to see hundreds of deranged posts across social media daily — many of them posted by proudly anti-Trump and left-leaning accounts. One anti-Trump poster asks simply “Who else thinks the Trump campaign staged this?” with a video of the aftermath of the shooting. It has 8.4 million views and more than 20,000 comments — most of them agreeing with the premise. “The Real Story … Trump campaign hired the kid to fire into the crowd but avoid hitting Trump to stage a fake assassination attempt and then blame Democrats, possibly to start a civil war … They knew the kid wouldn’t survive to tell the story,” reads one image that’s been repeatedly reposted across X. “Facts,” wrote one the many users who reposted the image. Another common post shows video taken from behind the stage where gunman Thomas Crooks can been seen running across a rooftop outside of the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. The video claims Trump is following the shooter’s movement, and prepares a packet of fake blood to smear over his face once the gunfire rings out. “Watch him track the shooter and drop the red dye pack,” one poster wrote — though no such blood packet can be seen. Countless wild-eyed posts feature a Spirit Halloween listing for $12.95 fake blood packet that can be discretely stored behind your ear. “Fits snugly behind the ear, just slap with your hand to scare friends with the most realistic bloody ear ever!” the listing reads, with posters claiming Trump surely used such a product to fake his wound. Others have focused on Trump’s hat, claiming it was there that he stored a fake blood packet — and zerod in on a suited agent who collected the hat after Trump was whisked away by the Secret Service. Photos of Trump’s ear since the bandages have been removed also play a central role in the conspiracy theories — and are frequently paired alongside images of grisly ear wounds as supposed evidence that he wasn’t really shot. “What kind of assassination of an ex president allows you to straighten out your wig, scream for your shoe lifts and stand long enough for photos. Fake fake fake; not fight fight fight,” one X poster — who describes themselves as “woke AF” — wrote on Sunday. The FBI, however, has confirmed that Trump was in fact shot in the ear. “What struck former President Trump in the ear was a bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject’s rifle,” the agency said in a statement in July. That bullet came within an inch of a fatally striking him — and only missed because he happened to turn his head at the precise moment Crooks pulled his trigger about 130 yards away. A hero firefighter in the rally crowd was fatally struck but Crooks’ gunfire, and two more were seriously wounded. Crooks himself was shot dead by Secret Service snipers within moments of opening fire. X did not respond to requests for comment.","summary":"Countless wild-eyed posts feature a Spirit Halloween listing for $12.95 fake blood packet that posters claim Trump put behind his ear.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/27/us-news/left-wing-conspiracy-theories-about-trump-assassination-attempt-pervade-social-media-over-a-month-later/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/republican-presidential-candidate-former-88339872.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4OZeFluG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:06:57","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":255062518,"title":"Jack Smith's New Indictment Is 'Slick Move,' Former Trump Lawyer Says","text":"Special Counsel Jack Smith's decision to file an updated federal election subversion indictment against former President Donald Trump was a \"slick move,\" according to former Trump lawyer William Brennan.Smith filed a superseding indictment in the federal election case on Tuesday, accusing Trump of the same four felony counts that he was indicted on in August 2023. The new indictment has been retooled to comply with the Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.Brennan, who represented the Trump Organization in a tax fraud trial and the former president himself during his second impeachment trial, said during a CNN interview on Tuesday that Smith was smart to file an indictment that \"streamlines\" the charges against Trump.\"It's not uncommon for a prosecutor to do this,\" Brennan said. \"It's actually a smart move with the trouble that he's having with the now-former indictment. He now supersedes, he streamlines, and he tries to take that indictment further.\"\"It really is a smart move on Jack Smith's part,\" he continued. \"Whether it will survive is unclear right now, but it really is a slick move.\"Brennan said that Trump's current lawyers would likely argue that the new indictment was just a \"shined up\" version of the previous indictment while predicting that Smith's failure or success would hinge on the latest document not clashing with the Supreme Court ruling.\"I think that the former president's lawyers, who are all very competent, will file a motion saying, 'we've basically got the same old indictment shined up purportedly as something new,'\" said Brennan.\"It really probably will come down to whether or not what's remaining in the superseding indictment is outside the perimeters...of the Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity,\" he added. \"That's really where the rubber hits the road here.\"In response to a request for comment, Trump's office pointed Newsweek to a series of Truth Social posts from the former president denouncing the new indictment and demanding that the case be dismissed on Tuesday.Trump repeated familiar accusations that Smith was engaging in \"election interference\" by charging him with crimes while also claiming that the special counsel had been \"illegally appointed.\"\"In an effort to resurrect a 'dead' Witch Hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation, and in order to save face, the illegally appointed 'Special Counsel' Deranged Jack Smith, has brought a ridiculous new Indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump wrote.\"The whole case should be thrown out and dismissed on Presidential Immunity grounds, as already ruled unequivocally by the U.S. Supreme Court,\" he added. \"Smith rewrote the exact same case in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court Decision.\"Newsweek reached out to Smith's office via email for comment on Tuesday evening.The Supreme Court's decision, delivered in early July, did not grant Trump full immunity from prosecution. Instead, it gave any sitting U.S. president immunity when their alleged crimes were committed as part of specific official duties. The ruling did not give Trump or anyone else who has served as president immunity for unofficial acts.The superseding indictment is nine pages shorter than the original document. Likely due to the Supreme Court ruling, the new indictment removes all mentions of Trump allegedly attempting to pressure the Department of Justice to falsely declare that President Joe Biden's 2020 election win was the result of massive fraud.Trump is still facing felony charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against the rights of voters. The former president, convicted on 34 unrelated felony counts in New York in May, denies all wrongdoing.","summary":"Smith filed a retooled indictment in Trump's federal election subversion case on Tuesday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-smith-new-indictment-donald-trump-william-brennan-1945195","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2459160/jack-smith-trump-indictment-slick-move-brennan.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:03:36","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":255063224,"title":"Behind Donald Trump's Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. transition team announcement","text":"Behind Donald Trump's Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. transition team announcement Former President Donald Trump's campaign has announced that former progressive Democrat Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F.

De Armas and Affleck called things off in 2021. “Their friendship has been going on for a while, even before Ana,” the source told the outlet. “When Ben started seeing Ana in 2020 and chose to quarantine with her during Covid, Kick was less than thrilled.” Kick, 36, is the second oldest child to former presidential hopeful and current Donald Trump supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She previously dated Paul Simon’s son, Harper Simon, but the two ended things in 2014. Rumors that the two might be dating were sparked last week when they were seen various places like the Beverly Hills Hotel. A source even told Page Six that Affleck was Kennedy’s “celeb crush.” As for why Affleck might be interested in wooing a member of the Kennedy dynasty, another Page Six source has an idea. “Affleck would love nothing more than to be part of the Kennedy clan. It’s a dream for any Boston guy…I think he would rather have that than a billion-dollar, red-carpet glam life with J. Lo,” the source divulged. This rumored romance comes on the heels of Jennifer Lopez filing to end their two-year marriage last week.","summary":"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesDays after newly single Ben Affleck was rumored to have been seen with potential new flame Kick Kennedy, a spokesperson for the star is shutting the gossip down.\n\n“There is no truth to any of them.

The filing, which accuses Trump of leading a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election, comes just 10 days before the Justice Department's \"60-day rule\" would have taken effect and banned the filing of new charges against the Republican nominee for president. In Tuesday's new 36-page indictment, which has been reduced from the original 45 pages, Smith removed allegations that the Supreme Court determined were wrongly filed. Trump is no longer charged with trying to force election fraud investigations on the Justice Department or urging state lawmakers to choose fraudulent electors. Those interactions are immune from prosecution because they are considered official presidential acts. While prosecutors did not drop the four initial charges from the new indictment, they added more language that describes Trump as a \"candidate,\" and not president, while describing others as \"acting in their private capacity\" and not \"government officials.\" Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His legal team argues the former president was conducting legitimate inquiries about the possibility of election fraud. Throughout his current campaign, Trump has repeatedly claimed he is the victim of a government conspiracy to weaponize the law against him. Last month, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that a president is absolutely immune when executing his core constitutional powers and enjoys the presumption of immunity when performing official acts. With Smith's revised indictment, a new grand jury will hear the case. \"The superseding indictment, which was presented to a new grand jury that had not previously heard evidence in this case, reflects the government's efforts to respect and implement the Supreme Court's holdings and remand instructions in Trump v. United States,\" the special counsel's office said. Shortly after the indictment was filed Tuesday, Trump responded in a post on Truth Social, claiming Smith was trying to \"interfere with the election.\" \"In an effort to resurrect a 'dead' witch hunt in Washington, D.C., in an act of desperation, and in order to save face, the illegally appointed 'Special counsel' deranged Jack Smith has brought a ridiculous new indictment against me, which has all the problems of the old indictment and should be dismissed immediately,\" the former president wrote. Trump will not be required to make an in-person appearance for arraignment on the new indictment. In addition, the current case will not be tried before November's election. If elected, Trump could use executive authority to end the federal proceedings against him.","summary":"In response to a Supreme Court ruling granting broad immunity to presidents for official acts, special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday filed a new federal indictment against former President Donald Trump in the Jan. 6 case","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/27/special-counsel-revised-election-interference-indictment-Donald-Trump/9191724797621/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9191724797621/2024/upi/8fb32610caad0d5dcd4b6b60c5192ee8/v1.2/Trump-indicted-for-second-time-in-Jan-6-case-after-Supreme-Court-immunity-ruling.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 23:00:51","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":255063298,"title":"Letters: Commander-in-chief | Criticism to strength | Reintroduce reason | Attacking Gus | Israel support | Global status","text":"Trump is proven poor commander-in-chief An American president’s main duty — some say their only duty — is to protect the nation. Donald Trump has totally disqualified himself from ever being commander-in-chief. He has displayed open contempt for current service personnel, veterans and their families; reduced veterans’ aid; debased and ignored intelligence services; has an affinity for enemies; weakened alliances; and vowed to use the military to suppress dissent at home and to round up immigrants for deportation. Military personnel swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, not trample it. Put country ahead of partisan politics. William Briggs Morgan Hill Harris could turn criticism to strength Many people agree that Kamala Harris has an uphill battle against Donald Trump. There is less time for her to communicate her agenda. She promised an opportunity economy where everyone has an opportunity to compete and a chance to succeed. She has reclaimed the freedom mantle away from the GOP. Harris has promised to restore abortion rights and tackle gun violence, pollution and climate change. Two areas where she may be vulnerable are immigration and inflation. She mentioned that after the bipartisan bill on curtailing border crossings was ready, Trump asked GOP senators to reject it. Already, with the current policy of shutting down asylum acceptance, the border crossings have gone even lower than when Trump was in office. Since the last presidential election, food prices have gone up 26%. This is an area where her promise of investigating price gouging can be used. This is not price control. Mohan Raj San Jose GOP and independents can reintroduce reason Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is reaching out to voters in the middle who are not necessarily registered with her party. Maybe now is the time for reasonable, responsible Republicans and independents to join together and put forward their goals and program proposals and see if they can join in common cause with mainstream Democrats. Known conservatives, such as Condoleezza Rice and David Brooks, could serve as the starting point for such a coalition. This might have the further benefit of bolstering support for Republican candidates who are in swing districts. The next Congress, convening in 2025, will need more centrists than we have had in recent years. We must do whatever is needed to bring reason and agreement back into our political process. John Cormode Mountain View Attacks on Gus Walz hurt entire community Last Wednesday, Gov. Tim Walz accepted the Democratic nomination to be the next vice president. His family’s response was prominently featured, particularly his son Gus’ outpouring of love and pride for his father. Through tears while mouthing “that’s my dad,” Gus showed us all what family love looks like. Unfortunately, in our full-contact political world, some felt it necessary to criticize the beauty of a display we don’t see often, especially related to our political world. His parents understanding this could happen gave an interview in People magazine explaining their son’s conditions. Without this knowledge, I would still be writing this admonishing anyone attacking Gus. With this information, as a behavioral health professional, I would ask everyone in our community to understand what these attacks amount to: an attack on our own families and the decency and goodness of our special-‘power’ kids’ display of love. Go, Gus. David Mineta San Jose Harris must reconsider support for Israel Vice President Harris recently advised Americans to do something when they encounter injustice. In that spirit, I want to draw attention to the ongoing attacks by IDF forces in Gaza and settler violence in the West Bank. These acts of slaughter and starvation against innocent Palestinians are being carried out with weapons funded by billions of our tax dollars. I urge Harris to reconsider her pledge of unconditional support for Israel, which is responsible for these horrific killings and the suffering that makes life a living hell for Palestinians. Republicans are already accusing the administration of monumental hypocrisy, and such accusations will be impossible to defend if this anti-humanitarian policy continues. Jag Singh Los Altos U.S. must change view of ourselves in world After all the fluff and fizz of the DNC convention evaporates, our unwillingness to confront history’s latest genocide remains. What do we do amidst all that giddy self-delusion? We need to concentrate our efforts on showing the obsolete and unworkable nature of that constant refrain, “We are the prime mover and shaker of the world.” That thinking is over 30 years out of date. Our real movers and shakers, if they really love their grandkids, need to transition to our being an “indispensable nation,” not the “undisputed leader.” There is a real difference between the two. The former is reality-based while the latter is nostalgic thinking. Just look at how our corrupt and morally bankrupt position relating to the Gaza genocide is hastening our diminished status in the eyes of the world. Our continuation of this rancid self-adulation is a Shakespearean farce. The RNC has already achieved that much.

Sharing a post on the social media platform Truth, Trump said, \"I have reached an agreement with the Radical Left Democrats for a debate with Comrade Kamala Harris. It will be broadcast live on ABC FAKE NEWS, by far the nastiest and most unfair newscaster in the business, on Tuesday, September 10th, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" This comes after Trump suggested over the weekend he might cancel the debate amid a feud between the campaigns over the rules. Trump said on Truth Social he and Harris had reached an agreement to follow the same set of rules he and President Joe Biden did during the June 27 CNN debate, including no live audience and muted microphones when the candidates aren't speaking. \"The rules will be the same as the last CNN debate, which seemed to work out well for everyone except, perhaps, Crooked Joe Biden. The debate will be \"stand up,\" and candidates cannot bring notes, or \"cheat sheets.\" We have also been given assurance by ABC that this will be a \"fair and equitable\" debate and that neither side will be given the questions in advance (No Donna Brazile!).\" The Republican presidential candidate further stated that a third debate has not been agreed upon by the Radical Left. The post said, \"Harris would not agree to the FoxNews debate on September 4th, but that date will be held open in case she changes her mind or, Flip Flops, as she has done on every single one of her long-held and cherished policy beliefs. A possible third debate, which would go to NBC FAKE NEWS, has not been agreed to by the Radical Left. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\" Notably, Biden's halting and disjointed performance in his June debate with Trump at CNN ultimately led him to drop out of the presidential race. Harris entered the fray for the presidential ticket after US President Joe Biden announced in July that he was withdrawing from the election bid. If elected president, the 59-year-old Harris would become the first woman in history to become the US president. The vice president is only the second woman ever nominated for the presidency by a major political party.

Kennedy Jr. and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Chief among their reasons for endorsing Trump: their anti-Ukraine sentiments and support for Vladimir Putin and Russia. It’s too bad the American electorate has diametrically opposed views. A fresh University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll by the firm SSRS shows that bipartisan public support for Ukraine remains strong. Asked about where respondent sympathies lie in the current Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine was picked by 76% of Democrats, 58% of Republicans, and 57% of independents. Only 4% of Republicans sided with Russia, which is a shocking result given the prominence of pro-Russia right-wing personalities like Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk, Alex Jones,and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. At best, those right-wing efforts to whitewash the Kremlin’s murderous invasion of Ukraine have created some confusion among their adherents; support for Ukraine should be at 100% and utterly divorced from any partisan taint. Despite those efforts, a clear majority of Americans (62%) support Ukraine compared to Russia (2%). Furthermore, 48% of Americans believe the U.S. should support Ukraine “as long as it takes,” including 63% of Democrats and 37% of Republicans—the highest percentage recorded in this tracking poll. In June and October 2023, the overall number was 43% and 45%, respectively, meaning support for Ukraine has grown. And the biggest growth demographic? Republicans, who went from 29% to the current 37%. The party’s own pro-Putin propaganda efforts are failing. Yet Republicans nominated a ticket with views well outside of the American mainstream when it comes to Ukraine. Trump has promised to cut off aid to Ukraine if elected, and his running mate JD Vance has long been part of the pro-Russia crowd in the Senate. With Kennedy and Gabbard now on board, Trump has further surrounded himself with some of the fiercest Putin defenders in American politics. Kennedy loves to repeat Kremlin propaganda, and Hillary Clinton was right about Gabbard back in 2019 when she said, “She’s the favorite of the Russians.” They agree: Most Americans don’t vote based on foreign policy, and the Russia-Ukraine War is no different. But the country’s generally pro-Ukraine sentiment does create an unflattering narrative for Trump as a candidate—one that ostensibly seeks to “make America great again” yet cozies up to some of the worst people on the planet. One of the overarching Trump narratives is that he wants to be a dictator, modeled after his despotic heroes. Surrounding himself with Putin lovers isn’t a way to refute that as he places himself even further outside of the American mainstream.","summary":"Donald Trump is basking in the supposed glow of recent endorsements from two of the weirdest people in politics—Robert F.

Out of the 929 registered voters surveyed between August 23 and 25, 47 percent backed Harris, while 43 percent of respondents said they supported Trump for president. Harris' lead is slightly outside the poll's margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.The vice president held the same lead among likely voters surveyed by PolCom Lab, where 49 percent backed Harris, compared to 45 percent supporting Trump.The results are a significant leap for Harris, who a month ago was trailing Trump by 5 percentage points (49 percent to 44 percent), according to a PolCom Lab survey conducted in the days leading up to Harris entering the 2024 presidential race on July 21. In a separate poll conducted at the end of July, Harris and Trump were locked in a tie among U.S. voters in a head-to-head match-up at 46 percent.Harris has specifically made inroads among self-described independent voters included in PolCom Lab's sampling. While back in July the key voter demographic was fairly split between the two candidates (45 percent Harris and 43 percent Trump), the latest survey shows Harris being backed by 48 percent of independents, while Trump is supported by 35 percent.Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign via email for comment.Tuesday's poll follows Harris' formal nomination at the DNC last week, alongside her running mate and Vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. It also comes after Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his 2024 campaign and threw his endorsement behind Trump late last week.Kennedy's decision has not appeared to impact the momentum behind Harris' campaign for weeks, however. In a poll released Monday by Angus Reid Global, Harris was found to have a 5-point lead over Trump among registered voters (47 percent to 42 percent.)The vice president held a similar lead in a Morning Consult poll released this week as well, where Harris maintained a four-point lead over Trump (48 percent to 44 percent). That same poll also found that voters' approval rating of Walz jumped after the DNC--in the days following the convention, 42 percent of registered voters said they hold a favorable view of the vice presidential candidate, compared to the 39 percent favorability rating Walz had before the DNC.As of Tuesday, the vice president is leading Trump by 3.5 percentage points on average across national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight.","summary":"The vice president has taken a four-point lead in the latest poll from the Florida Atlantic University Political Communication and Public Opinion Research Lab.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-overtakes-donald-trump-new-poll-1945154","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2459157/harris-overtakes-donald-trump-new-poll.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 22:58:04","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":255063762,"title":"With campaign at full tilt, surprise! Jack Smith strikes again","text":"Smith was apparently in a race against time because the Department of Justice frowns on prosecutors indicting candidates too close to an election, and we are obviously getting close to an election. From the Washington Post: “In about 10 days, a Justice Department policy known as ‘the 60-day rule’ will take effect forestalling any new filing of charges against the former president, who is again the Republican nominee for the White House.” Now, you can look up the “60-day rule” and see that some experts believe the actual number is sort of vague or that it is really a 90-day rule. If that is the case, Smith missed the deadline by a lot. If the number is 60 days, he just made it. And by the way, the old 60- or 90-day rule was based on the fact that there was an actual election day when nearly everyone voted. That is no longer the case; in many states, it’s more like election month. And with early voting starting as early as Sept. 20 in some states, Smith blew up the rule any way you look at it. The new indictment comes 24 days before voting starts in those states. In any event, Smith has without doubt violated an explicit DOJ guideline that says, “Federal prosecutors and agents may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.” By any accounting, Smith has stomped all over that one.

SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!Indeed, the public interest in the presidential campaign is so intense — focusing on polls, Vice President Kamala Harris’s positions, her upcoming first interview, the debate, and more — that one could sometimes forget that Trump has multiple criminal indictments still against him. And then there is a looming sentencing Sept. 18 in another criminal case in New York in which he was found guilty of business fraud in a prosecution some experts found entirely without merit. But remember why many Democrats cheered on the elected Democratic prosecutors in New York and Georgia, and the prosecutor appointed by Democrats in Washington, D.C., who pursued the lawfare charges against Trump. With Trump running away with the Republican nomination, and with President Joe Biden’s age and infirmity depressing Democratic enthusiasm and support for his reelection bid, the future looked grim for the party’s prospects in the 2024 presidential race. At times, the only bright spot was the lawfare campaign, which many Democrats hoped would cripple Trump if all else failed. In her still-young campaign, Harris has made Trump’s criminal charges, plus a couple of lawsuits against him in New York, a central moment of her stump speech. For example, at a rally in Wisconsin, Harris said that as a prosecutor, “I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.” (Harris was referring to the E. Jean Carroll suit and then the New York lawsuit against Trump, as well as the New York indictment.) Harris is certain to bring up the Trump prosecutions when the two meet in their Sept. 10 debate — and again and again after that, all the way until Election Day. After all, what was the lawfare campaign all about? This new indictment keeps interest fresh. Reacting to the charges, Trump focused on the election angle. “This is merely an attempt to INTERFERE WITH THE ELECTION, and distract the American people from the catastrophe Kamala Harris has inflicted on our nation, like the border invasion, migrant crime, rampant inflation, the threat of World War III, and more,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Of course, Democrats will deny that the new indictment has anything to do with the election, but look around. Look at the news coverage. Look at the calendar. The Trump prosecutions are a huge part of the election, and many Democrats wouldn’t have it any other way.","summary":"WITH CAMPAIGN AT FULL TILT, SURPRISE!

A source with knowledge of the incident said the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump staffers from filming and photographing in a section where recent U.S. casualties are buried. The source said Arlington officials had made clear that only cemetery staff members are authorized to take photographs or film in the area, known as Section 60. When the cemetery official tried to prevent Trump campaign staff from entering Section 60, campaign staff verbally abused and pushed the official aside, according to the source. Trump participated in an event to mark the third anniversary of a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan as U.S. forces withdrew from the country; 13 U.S. service members were killed in the attack. The Trump campaign has blamed President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic presidential nominee, for the chaotic withdrawal. In a statement to NPR, Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign spokesman, strongly rejected the notion of a physical altercation, adding: \"We are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made. \"The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony,\" Cheung said in the statement. The Trump campaign declined to make that footage immediately available. In a statement to NPR, Arlington National Cemetery said it \"can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed.\" “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,\" according to the statement. \"Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants.\"","summary":"The cemetery official tried to prevent Trump staffers from filming and photographing in a section where recent U.S. casualties are buried, a source with knowledge of the event told NPR.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1024x683!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F27%2F4f1bf65d4e0a999565326c690e8d%2Fgettyimages-2168623932.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-27 22:55:03","author":"Quil Lawrence","authors":["Quil Lawrence"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.184}]}
