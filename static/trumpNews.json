They attempt to reach Islamabad to protest in solidarity with Palestinians, even as Israel approved the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal on Friday. Large-scale protests erupted in Pakistan earlier in the day after members of the TLP began marching towards Islamabad, leading to violent clashes with police in Lahore and prompting authorities to block roads and suspend internet services in the capital, Dawn reported.\nAlso Read | US Ambassador-Designate Sergio Gor Gifts Donald Trump Signed 'Mr Prime Minister, You Are Great' Photograph to PM Narendra Modi (See Pic).\nThe march dubbed the \"Gaza March\" by the group was launched after Friday prayers from the party's headquarters on Multan Road in Lahore. The procession, led by TLP chief Saad Rizvi, drew thousands of supporters, many of whom chanted religious slogans and carried sticks, rods, and bricks, Dawn reported. Police tried to block the rally by setting up barricades and using tear gas near key intersections, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, Azadi Chowk, and Shahdara. However, the protesters broke through the barriers and continued advancing towards Islamabad.

Videos on social media showed law enforcement personnel firing tear gas and warning shots to disperse the crowds, while some officers were seen retreating to safety.\nFurther, Lahore police reported that dozens of officers sustained injuries, while the TLP claimed that many of its workers were also hurt and alleged that some had been killed in police firing, claims that could not be independently verified. Amid the unrest, an anti-terrorism court in Lahore remanded 110 TLP activists to police custody for 12 days for allegedly attacking officers and damaging public property during the protest. The FIR filed by Nawankot Police accuses the group of opening fire and resorting to violence against law enforcement personnel.\nPakistan's Minister of State for Interior, Talal Chaudhry, accused the TLP of exploiting the issue of corruption for political purposes, warning that the government would not tolerate violence or blackmail by any group.\nSpeaking to the media in Islamabad, Chaudhry said, \"Peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. But there is no space for groups to blackmail others, use mobs, or resort to violence to achieve their demands.\"\nThe TLP, a hardline Islamist party, has frequently clashed with authorities in recent years over religious and political issues. Founded in 2015, it is known for mobilising large-scale street protests that often paralyse major Pakistani cities, as per Dawn.\nBy late Friday night, tensions remained high across Punjab province, with authorities maintaining heavy security along the main routes to Islamabad to prevent further escalation.

It also came at a time when President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to bar transgender people from serving in the military and issuing orders about biological sex and gender.\n\nPolice watched from atop the town hall and patrolled the streets with dogs, as people in rainbow clothing confronted a group that came to sing hymns and wave signs telling them to repent. There were applause and tears in the crowd as author, activist and former youth pastor John Pavlovitz spoke from a stage. \n\n“We are going through it right now, but we’re going through it together,” Pavlovitz said as he paced the plaza in brightly-colored sneakers. “We will not allow ourselves or the people we care about to be dehumanized or mistreated or erased. We will not stand for it.”\n\nPhoenix Bilodeau, who is transgender, said they always worry about violence when attending such public events.\n\n“They’ve already designated trans as terrorists,” Bilodeau said. “So, like, maybe next they’re going to say, like, we’re enemies of the state. I don’t know. And so it’s just scary, because you don’t even know what’s going to happen.”\n\nWake Forest, just north of the state capital, is home to the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. \n\nIn front of the town hall, people banged drums and shouted as the group sang hymns and waved signs. Local farmer Will Arterburn, who organized the singing, lamented the attempts to drown them out.\n\n“This particular event is directly against the scriptures and the teachings of the Bible,” he said. “Sexual immorality on display in the public square. And we wanted to be here as a presence of light, to oppose the principalities and powers on display here.”\n\nNikki Lyons, whose family moved here from California about a year and a half ago, laughed as she watched her 2-year-old daughter, Maeve, use a miniature Pride flag to joust with a blow-up man. Lyons said events like this are more important than ever.\n\n“We have to come together and stand against this administration,” Lyons said, choking up with emotion and scooping her daughter up in a hug. “Because we all deserve to be loved.”","summary":"The sound of hymns clashed with drums as thousands gathered for Pride Fest in Wake Forest, North Carolina","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-lgbtq-police-california-b2843840.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/12/01/NC_Coming_Out_Day_79904.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 00:46:43","author":"Allen G.

The first phase of the plan includes Israeli troop withdrawals from Gaza City, Rafah, Khan Younis, and the north, the opening of five crossings for aid, and the release of hostages and prisoners.\nEarlier, a Hamas source on Friday stated the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is expected to reopen in the middle of next week, allowing for limited movement of people, Xinhua reported. However, details on operations have not been announced. More than two years of Israeli military operations have devastated Gaza, killing over 67,000 people and triggering famine, according to Gaza's health authorities, Xinhua reported. Meanwhile, a Huge crowd gathered at Tel Aviv's Hostage Square on Saturday as families of captives awaited their return, marking an emotional evening of gratitude and solidarity, CNN reported. Expressing gratitude towards US President Donald Trump, his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, described it as a \"powerful night,\" thanking Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for their efforts in achieving the Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal, as reported by The Times of Israel.\n\"I dreamed of this night for a long time. This is the most powerful sight,\" Witkoff said, estimating that more than 100,000 people had gathered. \"Hearts beating as one, gathered here in Tel Aviv for peace, for unity and for hope in this sacred place we call Hostages Square. I only wish the President was here,\" he added, as reported by The Times of Israel.\nWitkoff praised Kushner, who was also present, saying, \"This moment was made possible through the tireless dedication of leaders who would not rest until the world saw what could be achieved. One of them is standing right here with me, Jared Kushner.\"\nHe also expressed \"a debt of deep gratitude\" to Trump, calling him \"a man who is a humanitarian through and through, with an indomitable spirit, who once again proved that bold leadership and moral clarity can reshape history and change the world.\"\nThe crowd chanted \"Thank you, Trump\" while booing when Witkoff promoted Netanyahu's name, The Times of Israel reported.\nMoreover, French President Emmanuel Macron will travel to Egypt on Monday to express his support for the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, CNN reported, citing the French Presidency announcement.\nMacron's visit comes at a critical moment, as global leaders rally around efforts to end the conflict and lay the groundwork for long-term peace in the region.\nMacron will show his \"full support\" for the ceasefire deal and \"also consult with his partners on the next steps in implementing the peace plan,\" the presidency said.\nHe is among several world leaders expected in Egypt early next week.

However, the U.S. President, who won re-election last year, has credited the platform in part for his return to office, and has presided over a deal that would buy out a majority of the platform, saving it from a recent U.S. law that would ban the app. \n\nThe book comes as India’s relations with China approach a detente, with direct flights between the two countries resuming and high-level contacts gradually approaching a normalisation in ties. China has sought to improve the access its firms benefit from in India, but no specific proposal to revoke TikTok’s ban has been hinted at in recent weeks. TikTok representatives did not return a request by The Hindu for comment on the book’s claims. \n\n“Project Phoenix” \n\nFollowing the app’s ban in India, the book says, TikTok attempted to tie up with Indian conglomerates like the Hiranandani Group and Reliance Industries Ltd., discussions that were indeed reported in some sections of the media at the time, but Ms. Baker-White wrote that such efforts to revive the app in India continued for “years thereafter”; but unlike a few brands like Shein, which were able to come back from the wave of Chinese app bans in 2020 through such a partnership, TikTok’s efforts, internally dubbed “Project Phoenix,” did not go anywhere, Ms. Baker-White wrote. \n\nThe Hiranandani Group and TikTok kept the government “apprised” of investment talks between the two parties, but no government approval came for any deal negotiated between Bytedance and the real estate group. \n\nNotably, the book says, TikTok’s parent firm “ByteDance had enjoyed strong relationships with the Prime Minister’s office,” but after the Galwan clashes in 2020 with China, “lobbyists and TikTok’s government relations team found that their previously warm contacts were now exceptionally hard to reach.” \n\n“Discriminatory videos” \n\nReprising a lot of reportage around the time, Ms. Baker-White wrote that like other platforms, “TikTok had problems with discriminatory videos,” with researchers finding “hundreds of casteist videos on the platform, often organised under caste-specific hashtags, which featured a mix of videos championing caste pride and videos by members of upper castes denigrating lower ones.” \n\nMs. Baker-White also recalled instances of political censorship, such as that following a June 2019 lynching of a Muslim man in Jharkhand, when a group of “Muslim stuntmen” made videos decrying the incident, and saw their accounts taken down. The platform was a place for “having fun,” and not “creating political strife,” a TikTok India executive had said at the time.","summary":"The book says that Donald Trump was eager to follow suit on India’s TikTok ban in 2020; after the ban and for “years thereafter,” the firm tried to tie up with an Indian firm to reverse the ban, the book says","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/trump-was-keen-on-copying-indias-2020-tiktok-ban-new-book-says/article70150846.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/lt1gyi/article70151127.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-24T211500Z_1489203236_RC2KYGAV0EWR_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TIKTOK.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 00:34:00","author":"Emily Baker","authors":["Emily Baker"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.094},{"id":368423270,"title":"Trump Ensures Military Personnel Receive Pay During Government Shutdown","text":"Support Our Cause\n\nSupport Our Cause\n\n Search for:\n\n HomeLocal newsTrump Ensures Military Personnel Receive Pay During Government Shutdown\n\nLocal news \n\nTrump Ensures Military Personnel Receive Pay During Government Shutdown\n\n \n\n Up next \n\nVolunteers Triumph Over Razorbacks with a 34-31 Comeback Victory\n\n Published on 12 October 2025\n\n Internewscast \n\nGovernment,\n\nTrump \n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nIE 11 is not supported.

They added that there were reports of notable damage inflicted on multiple Afghan posts and militant formations. The firing took place at several key posts, including Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baramcha in Balochistan, The Express Tribune reported.

Dozens of Afghan soldiers and Khwarij were killed in retaliatory fire,\" The Express Tribune reported, citing security sources. Taliban border forces said that the clashes broke out after Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on the Afghan capital earlier this week. \"In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces\", Taliban border forces in the east are \"engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces' posts in various border areas\", the Afghan military said in a statement, as reported by Dawn. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand -- all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan -- confirmed the clashes. Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul \"to stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on its soil,\" Dawn reported. Earlier on Friday, Former US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad expressed concern over Pakistan's reported strikes in Kabul, calling them a \"huge escalation\" which poses dangerous risks. In a post on X, Khalilzad called for dialogue between Islamabad and Kabul, stating that military escalation is not the answer. He said negotiations should take place between Kabul and Islamabad to deal with the terrorist sanctuaries on both sides of the Durand Line. Late on Thursday evening, a spokesperson of Afghanistan, Zabihullah, said that an explosion was heard in Kabul; however, no reports of damage have emerged so far, and investigations are underway.\n\"The sound of an explosion was heard in the city of Kabul. However, no one should worry, it is all well and good, the investigation of the incident is underway, no report of any damage has been given so far. The sound of an explosion was heard in Kabul. The investigation is underway, no report of any damage has been given so far, it is all well and good.\" On October 10, Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the National Assembly that \"collateral damage\" cannot be ruled out in response if Pak security forces come under attack and added that \"enough is enough,\" as reported by Dawn. The escalation by Pakistan comes even as Afghanistan's Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is on a week-long visit to India, the first high-level visit from Kabul since the Taliban seized power in August 2021.

Under the terms of the agreement, 48 hostages – including around 20 believed to be alive – are due to be released by Monday noon, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza. For Ofir Braslavski, the father of 21-year-old hostage Rom Braslavski, the prospect of reunion has brought hope after nearly two years of anguish. \"We focus on the kiss, the hugs, his smell,\" he told CNN from Hostages Square, the central Tel Aviv plaza that has become the focal point for hostage families. \"Every second feels like it's lasting forever. We're just waiting for the moment they call us – to Re'im and then to the hospital.\" Rom was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas-led militants, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 hostages taken into Gaza. Trump Credited for Brokering Deal Many in the crowd credited US President Donald Trump with helping to push the deal forward. Dozens held American flags and banners thanking him for his role in securing an agreement that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had long resisted. Trump reportedly pressed Netanyahu into approving the first phase of the ceasefire, following months of stalled negotiations. Braslavski, however, said he was not focused on politics. \"I just want peace,\" he said. \"I believe that now, with everything that happened, it'll get better.\" Among those gathered was Michel Illouz, whose 26-year-old son Guy died in Hamas captivity. \"I'm so proud to be able to meet the children who are alive,\" he said. \"But also I'm finding a place for my sadness. It's a very confusing moment.\" Illouz said he was preparing to receive his son's remains. \"What actually will I get … what kind of bones? How will I find the way to recognize him? It's going to be a long, long journey that we're just going to start,\" he said. Netanyahu acknowledged on Friday that not all the bodies of the deceased hostages may be returned, saying Hamas may not know the location of all 28 remaining hostages' remains. At Hostages Square, the atmosphere was subdued but hopeful. Volunteers distributed food marked \"Taste of Joy,\" while families shared sweets and embraced. Nearby, Simcha Cohen, who lost her own son to suicide years ago, said she was still processing the moment. \"I am not happy yet,\" she said. \"Maybe it will come tomorrow when they are home.\" Inside a nearby library, relatives of Ofer Kalderon, a hostage freed in February, gathered to support other families still waiting. \"We are not going to stop until the last hostage is here,\" said Sharon Kalderon, his sister-in-law. \"We got support from these families when Ofer returned, so we are here for them now.\"","summary":"The hostages were abducted during the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas-led militants, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 people being taken into Gaza","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-hostages-return-monday-tel-aviv-us-president-donald-trump-article-152985364","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-152985365,thumbsize-129472,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/152985365.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 00:25:22","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":368426724,"title":"World News | Pakistan Conveys Concerns to Kabul Envoy over India-Afghanistan Joint Statement","text":"Islamabad [Pakistan], October 12 (ANI): Pakistan has conveyed its reservations to Afghanistan's Ambassador in Islamabad over \"elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement.\" Islamabad expressed objections to the mention of Jammu and Kashmir in the statement issued during Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi's visit.

The reaction came after India and Afghanistan issued a joint statement on October 10, following discussions between External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar and Muttaqi on a range of bilateral and regional issues. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar expressed his deep appreciation to Afghanistan for its strong condemnation of the 22 April terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, India, as well as for the sincere condolences and solidarity expressed with the people and Government of India. Both sides unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries. They underscored the importance of promoting peace, stability, and mutual trust in the region. \"Both sides emphasised respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity. External Affairs Minister appreciated Afghan side's understanding of India's security concerns. The Afghan Foreign Minister reiterated the commitment that the Afghan government will not allow any group or individual to use the territory of Afghanistan against India,\" the statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) read. \"As part of India's ongoing healthcare cooperation with Afghanistan, several projects are being undertaken, including the establishment of a Thalassemia Centre, a Modern Diagnostic Centre, and replacement of the heating system at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health (IGICH) in Kabul. Additionally, India will construct a 30-bed hospital in Kabul's Bagrami district, an Oncology Centre and a Trauma Centre in Kabul, and five Maternity Health Clinics in the provinces of Paktika, Khost, and Paktia. About 75 prosthetic limbs have been successfully fitted to Afghan nationals, which was widely appreciated by both the Afghan government and the international community. India will also continue to extend medical assistance and provide high-quality healthcare treatment to Afghan nationals,\" it further read. Muttaqi is on a week-long visit to India, from October 9 to 16. This is the first high-level delegation from Kabul to India since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Earlier on Saturday, the Afghan minister said that the \"future of India-Afghanistan relations seems very bright.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

It's because they prefer conflict - hate is the air that they breathe","text":"Say what you will about Donald Trump, but he has succeeded where many others, including his predecessor Joe Biden, have failed.\n\nHow long this peace will endure is anyone’s guess. But for the people of Gaza, who have paid such a terrible price, it could not have come soon enough. Together with the families of the hostages, both alive and dead, they may now start to rebuild their shattered lives.\n\nIt has been a very long and painful two years. The world has watched with growing concern as Israel has exacted a truly Biblical revenge for the atrocities committed by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023. Far from strengthening his country’s position, Benjamin Netanyahu’s response has alienated Israel’s friends and given ammunition to its enemies.\n\nBut whatever Netanyahu’s misjudgments, we must not forget who ultimately is to blame for this latest bloody chapter in the conflict between Israel and Palestine: Hamas and its supporters throughout the Islamic world.\n\nIt is they, not Israel, that must ultimately bear responsibility for the thousands of dead in Gaza.\n\nI’m not an idiot. I understand the political and religious complexities in that part of the world.\n\nI know that Israel, as a nation, is far from perfect. I don’t deny, even as I support its right to existence, that it has blood on its hands.\n\nBut then so does any nation state that has ever had to defend its borders – including the newly recognised state of Palestine.\n\nWar is war – ugly and bloody. And the conflict in the Middle East is one of the oldest, ugliest and bloodiest. But what happened on October 7 went far beyond what might be considered reasonable in any theatre of conflict.\n\nIt was not an act of defence. It was a sadistic, unprovoked assault. It was not a military operation, army against army, soldier against soldier. It was a wanton massacre, an act of extreme cowardice visited on vulnerable civilians – elderly people, festival-goers, families, children. And it was done for no other reason than the fact that they were Jews.\n\nIf genocide is ‘an act of violence committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group’ (as defined by the UN), then that is exactly what happened on October 7. To me, and to many others, that is obvious. And yet, astonishingly, that is not how it is seen by many who live in this country.\n\nBritain has always been a nation broadly accepting of all cultures and creeds. But what has really struck me about the past two years, about the nature of the demonstrations against Israel, about the way our politicians and media have responded, is that this is no longer necessarily the case. This country has changed, and not for the better. There are many here who do not share our traditional values of tolerance. And over the past two years they have not only become more visible, but also increasingly outspoken.\n\nIt began almost immediately. At the time of the attacks, reeling in shock and horror at the atrocities committed, I wrote in disbelief about the twisted response from certain groups and individuals in Britain. Rivkah Brown, for example, commissioning editor at the hard-Left Novara Media website, proclaiming on Twitter/X that the actions of Hamas were ‘a celebration for supporters of democracy and human rights worldwide’.\n\nOr Dr Mennah Elwan, an NHS neurology registrar, who posted a series of abhorrent messages online, mocking the Israeli victims and accusing them of cowardice for fleeing the gunmen. Others, unnamed, marched on the Israeli embassy in Kensington and celebrated in the streets of west London, joyously sharing footage of atrocities as though they were nothing more than holiday videos.\n\nIt made me sick to the stomach.\n\nI just couldn’t understand it, how anyone – regardless of their faith, politics or affiliations – could condone, on a basic human level, such suffering. How – as women were being kidnapped and raped, as families were being massacred, children executed in front of their parents, victims set alight, as the terrorists were gleefully filming themselves defiling and mocking their targets – anyone in their right mind could possibly feel anything other than deep sadness, revulsion. Let alone delight.\n\nI remember in particular the footage of Shani Louk’s broken body being driven around the streets of Gaza, crowds jeering and spitting on her.\n\nI remember the picture of Naama Levy, her tracksuit bottoms stained with blood, confusion and pain on her face, being bundled into the back of a truck by men with guns. I thought at the time, and I think it now: what kind of coward does that to a defenceless woman, what kind of a pathetic excuse for a man thinks that makes him a hero?\n\nMore to the point, what kind of person celebrates such actions? What kind of woman condones the rape of another woman just because she belongs to a different tribe, how can any parent rejoice in the death of a child?\n\nI imagined how I would feel if it were my daughter broken, raped, defiled, if it were my son tortured and set alight at a music festival. I felt a kind of helpless rage, one that I assumed would be felt the world over.\n\nI was wrong. Even before the killing had stopped, the victim-blaming had begun: these people had brought it upon themselves, it was Israel’s fault, they knew this was going to happen, they failed to stop it, what were they doing there in the first place. And so on.\n\nAnd it’s not just certain fringe elements, like that silly girl who was filmed cutting up yellow ribbons the other day, or that horrible Dr Rahmeh Aladwan, who talked about ‘Jewish cesspits’ and made a throat-slit gesture at Jews. It’s also our institutions (including the police, who only yesterday arrested someone at a ‘pro-Palestinian’ rally for holding a sign saying ‘We stand with Britain’s Jews’), our teachers, our university students, our politicians, our doctors – and, most worrying of all, our young people, the next generation of leaders and policy makers.\n\nSo many of them seem to have been captured by this toxic narrative that all Israelis are devils and all Palestinians saints, all Jews evil, all Muslims good.\n\nThe sad truth is, Britain is in the grip of an ugly sectarianism that is entirely dominated by one highly vocal side that goes almost entirely unchallenged for the simple reason that it accuses anyone who dares to of Islamophobia.\n\nOver the past two years this bloody, seemingly irresolvable conflict thousands of miles away has come to dominate the cultural landscape of this country. Many Jews – quite correctly given the terrible attack on the Manchester synagogue earlier this month, in which two people were killed and many more might have died – no longer feel safe or welcome in Britain.\n\nAnd how could they when, barely hours after that attack, people were on the streets marching in support of Hamas?\n\nLet’s face it, this country – which once offered a safe haven to all religions and which fought a war to defeat anti-Semitism – is in danger of becoming a charnel house for the Jews.\n\nAnd yet, as I wrote last week, how many Jews have blown up stadiums full of teenage pop fans, how many have strapped bombs to their bodies and detonated them on Tube trains and buses? None. So why is it they, and not the hard-line Islamists responsible for these atrocities and others, who find themselves in the dock?\n\nAnti-Semitism and extreme Islam are not just bedfellows, they are one and the same.\n\nI used to think there would be widespread outrage and condemnation if people started voicing outright support for the actions of Isis or the Taliban on the streets of this country. But given the levels of naked anti-Semitism we are now seeing, I’m not so sure.\n\nPerhaps that is why there seem to be so many dismayed by this peace deal, angry at the thought of a ceasefire. Instead of rejoicing in the end of violence, they are angry that someone (especially a Republican president) has interfered with their agenda, which is to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth and then to come after the rest of us.\n\nThese people don’t want peace. Hate is the air they breathe, conflict is what feeds them. And the more we tolerate their vile beliefs, the less any of us are safe.","summary":"Say what you will about Donald Trump, writes SARAH VINE, but he has succeeded where many others, including his predecessor Joe Biden, have failed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15183889/SARAH-VINE-voice-dismay-Trump-peace-deal-Gaza-prefer-conflict-hate.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/11/21/102911513-0-image-a-9_1760216380212.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 00:19:20","author":"Editor,Sarah Vine","authors":["Editor","Sarah Vine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":368426044,"title":"Julia Roberts oozes sophistication in a black power suit as she joins handsome co-star Andrew Garfield at London premiere of After the Hunt","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Oct 12th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMosque in uber-liberal London enclave bans all females over 12 from charity park run... so where are the howls of outrage from the Wokerati?\n\nPrince Andrew secretly told Jeffrey Epstein they would 'play some more soon' - ONE DAY after the Mail on Sunday published photo of him with teenage sex victim Virginia Giuffre\n\nHuge bidding war looms for diaries of bonkbuster author Jilly Cooper 'that are even racier than Rivals'\n\nMy chilling encounter with self-pitying rapist and paedophile Christian Brueckner as he finally answers the question: Did you abduct and kill Madeleine McCann?

Trump touched down at Hamad International Airport in Doha, with relations between the two governments in the spotlight over Qatar’s offer to Trump of a $400 million luxury aircraft to serve as a new Air Force One and then pass into his personal use. \n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn an emailed statement to Newsweek, Al-Ansari stressed that “this will not be a Qatari air base.”\n\n“Rather, Qatar has made an initial 10-year commitment to construct and maintain a dedicated facility within an existing US air base, intended for advanced training and to enhance interoperability in defending and advancing our shared interests around the world,” Al-Ansari wrote.\n\n“The arrangement is similar to existing programs between the United States and several of its international allies, and represents a continued expression of the strong defense partnership between Qatar and the United States, including ongoing cooperation to further expand our collective defense capabilities,” he explained.\n\nAl-Ansari highlighted that, like any construction project, the facility will generate hundreds of jobs for local Americans and continue to sustain them during the “maintenance phases.”\n\nThe project has been in the works for “several years” with planning going through several rounds of “engagement and community consultation” and has received approval at both the city and local levels.\n\nThe U.S. has partnerships with several different partners to train their troops on U.S. facilities, including Turkey, Singapore, Italy, Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, the U.K., and others. Singapore, particularly, trains at Mountain Home Airbase.\n\nU.S. President Donald J. Trump and Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad al Thani attend a signing ceremony at the Amiri Diwan, the official workplace of the emir, on May 14, 2025, in Doha, Qatar. The visit underscores the strategic partnership between the United States and Qatar, focusing on regional security and economic collaboration.\n\nWhen Did The US Agree to Host a Qatari Air Force Facility?\n\nThe U.S. and Qatar first inked a deal in 2017 to sell Qatar 36 aircraft, their associated weapons systems, U.S.-based training, maintenance support equipment and logistics support, according to The Air Force Times.\n\nStars and Stripes then in 2022 reported that the Air Force was looking to bring 170 members of Qatar’s Air Force to the Idaho base, where they would learn to fly the newest F-15 fighter jet “specifically modified for the Persian Gulf state” and advance the program.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Yule at the time told the Idaho Statesman in a phone interview: “With Singapore, their ability to integrate with our local community has been phenomenal. I would expect the same thing out of the Qatar program.”\n\nYule called the sale of aircraft to Qatar “obviously a big strategic advantage” that will “continue to increase capability of partner nations within the Middle East, a region of huge influence for the United States. So the more we can increase capability with our appropriations there, the less reliant we have to be on a large footprint by the United States military.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nA U.S. official told Newsweek: “Facilities Construction and Operational Support for Qatari F-15 Aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Basewas executed via foreign military sales, will enable the construction and operational integration of an enduring location for Qatari F-15 aircraft at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho.”\n\n The establishment...","summary":"Plans for the facility date back to 2017 when the U.S. agreed to train Qatari pilots to use new F-15 fighter jets.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/qatari-air-force-facility-update-official-clarifies-status-and-plans-10865937","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2214408240.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-12 00:17:20","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.178},{"id":368426038,"title":"Fed up with your man boobs? You're not alone. Here's what causes them, how to get rid of them... and when you MUST see a GP","text":"When the billionaire Elon Musk appeared at the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022 wearing a tight khaki T-shirt, he may have hoped to project a confident, commanding image.\n\nInstead, the world’s richest man found himself the target of mockery on his own platform, X, as users fixated on the shape of his chest – accusing him of sporting so-called ‘man boobs’, or ‘moobs’, as they’re unaffectionately dubbed.\n\nSome joked he was ‘Making Moobs Great Again’, a riff on US President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, while others, less kindly, christened him ‘Adolf Titler’.\n\nFor men and boys who develop gynaecomastia – the medical term for enlarged male breast tissue – such teasing will be all too familiar. It’s a condition that is far more common, and psychologically damaging, than many realise.\n\nCelebrities including Take That’s Gary Barlow and Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood have all been candid about their own struggles with moobs and the effect on their confidence and sense of masculinity.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics estimates that between 20 and 40 per cent of men – up to 12 million in the UK – develop a degree of gynaecomastia at some point during their lives.\n\nIt is a normal part of puberty, as hormonal imbalances cause temporary breast tissue growth in up to half of boys before it largely resolves itself.\n\nIt can also affect men over the age of 55 as levels of the sex hormone testosterone drop naturally with age, allowing the female sex hormone, oestrogen – which fuels breast tissue growth – to become more dominant.\n\nA common but underdiagnosed genetic condition, Klinefelter syndrome, which affects one in 600 male births and means men are born with an extra X chromosome, may also result in moobs.\n\nBut in many cases it’s driven by weight gain or the hormonal side effects of prescription medication. However, a growing number of cases are also linked to the misuse of anabolic steroids and cannabis smoking, which seems to lower testosterone levels.\n\nExperts say it should always be taken seriously – not least because, in rare cases, it can be a sign of breast cancer.\n\nAbout one per cent of all breast cancer cases occur in men – equivalent to around 350 a year.\n\nA recent study also found that men with enlarged breast tissue had a 37 per cent higher risk of death, and it was a ‘canary in the coalmine’, the researchers said, because it could reveal underlying disease or the effect of medication.\n\nWhatever the cause, too many men put up with it – either because they are too embarrassed to seek help or it isn’t severe enough.\n\nPlastic surgeon Jeyaram Srinivasan, from the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS), says the impact, for the one to five per cent of men who develop breasts equivalent in size to a woman’s C-cup, must not be ignored.\n\n‘Men with this condition feel totally stigmatised and emasculated, and are very limited in their personal relationships and their ability to do anything – particularly sports, and especially in the summer, when they feel they can’t wear T-shirts or vests,’ Mr Srinivasan says.\n\n‘They live with significant psychological stigma, and because the NHS doesn’t offer surgery to correct it, they learn to live with it.\n\n‘But some of the men I’ve met are bordering on suicidal. It deeply affects them.\n\n‘They feel isolated from family and friends, and it’s common for them to not feel comfortable starting a relationship. It can be a hard and lonely life.’\n\nLast week The Mail on Sunday’s resident GP columnist, Dr Ellie Cannon, asked readers to get in touch if they, or their loved ones, had experienced this condition.\n\nOne 72-year-old described developing painful moobs in 2023 which kept growing and made him feel embarrassed to wear a T-shirt.\n\nOnce cancer was ruled out, he said: ‘My GP seemed to imply that I was just being vain when I questioned how long the symptoms might last.’\n\nAnother man described how he had put up with moobs all his life until he finally had surgery to remove them aged 54, which gave him a huge boost in confidence.\n\nThere are steps men can take to prevent gynaecomastia – and treatments that don’t always require costly private surgery.\n\nFirst, any change in the chest area should be checked by a GP to rule out cancer.\n\nMo Akhavani, co-founder of The Plastic Surgery Group, says: ‘Alarm bells ring particularly if it only affects one side of the chest, and if there’s bleeding or discharge through the nipple. Doctors may not consider breast cancer in men, as it’s rare, but always push for it to be ruled out.’\n\nOne of the most common causes is excess weight.\n\n‘Fat in the body converts testosterone to oestrogen and, while it’s complex, the result can be this increase in breast tissue,’ says plastic surgeon Paul Harris, a BAPRAS council member who carries out many gynaecomastia surgeries. ‘I see lots of young men who have been overweight during childhood, and they get this rapid growth during puberty which leads to gynaecomastia.\n\n‘When they hit their 20s, they slim down and they’re left with what are large breasts. Childhood obesity is undoubtedly driving some of this.’\n\nWhile losing weight and exercising can, for some men, reverse the problem by reducing fat all over the body, it doesn’t work in every case.\n\nMr Srinivasan says: ‘In some cases diet and exercise can get rid of some of the fat but in many cases it won’t – it’s a bit hit-and-miss where you lose fat, and the chest area isn’t an easy place to get rid of it. But it’s worth trying in the first instance.’\n\nMr Harris adds that even men who have successfully used weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro are still left with moobs, which may require surgery to remove. This is partly because of excess skin, but also because not all gynaecomastia is linked to fat.\n\nIn more established cases, it’s caused by the growth of glandular tissue, which is firmer than fat and more like a developed breast. Mr Harris says: ‘If it’s established gynaecomastia then nothing will touch it.’\n\nThis type tends to be linked to hormonal imbalances, which can be triggered by prescription medications that either lower testosterone, raise oestrogen or directly affect breast tissue.\n\nThe most common are spironolactone, used to treat heart failure, high blood pressure and liver disease, and finasteride, given to men with an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer to block testosterone.\n\nAcid reflux treatment cimetidine and the anti-psychotic drug risperidone are also known to cause moobs.\n\nThere are also reports of statins, used to lower cholesterol, causing problems, though there is less evidence for this.\n\nIf a GP suspects medication is to blame, it may be possible to switch to a different drug and the problem should resolve itself.\n\nMail on Sunday reader Charles Stubley, 80, from Malton, North Yorkshire, developed the problem after taking finasteride for an enlarged prostate. ‘I stopped taking the finasteride, and after a month or two the problem disappeared,’ he said.\n\nIf this does not ease the issue, patients can be given low doses of tamoxifen – a drug used to prevent the recurrence of certain types of breast cancer by blocking oestrogen receptors in breast tissue – which can reduce the size and tenderness of moobs.\n\nMr Harris says: ‘I’ll often put patients on it post-operatively to stop any residual gland getting activated. It will take it down and means it won’t be so painful.’\n\nA growing problem, experts warn, is the rise in men – particularly young men – misusing steroids and drugs such as cannabis.\n\n‘I see lots of big gym-goers who take protein supplements which contain whey, which contains soya that then reacts with the oestrogen receptors in the body so you end up with gynaecomastia,’ says Mr Harris. ‘Or they’re buying anabolic steroids from other gym users to bulk out.’\n\nAnabolic steroids – synthetic versions of testosterone – raise hormone levels far above normal, and the body compensates by converting the excess testosterone into oestrogen. This leads to growth of male breast tissue and the shutdown of natural testosterone production.\n\nOllie Matthews, 39, from Norwich, learned this the hard way.\n\nNow a functional medicine practitioner with his company Ojay Health, Ollie developed gynaecomastia in his teens after putting on weight when his father died.\n\nAfter he started bodybuilding to boost his confidence, he began taking steroids, which affected his hormones even further.\n\nHe eventually needed to begin taking testosterone replacement therapy (TRT).\n\n‘Steroids screwed up my body, and the TRT, which I took without much guidance, only made it worse. That’s when I started getting lumps under my nipples,’ Ollie says.\n\n‘It hit my confidence. I didn’t want to wear certain things to the gym and began getting really self-conscious. I hope to have surgery soon.’\n\nSurgery in the UK is expensive, typically £5,000–£10,000 depending on the clinic – but it is effective in the long term.\n\nThere are two main options: liposuction, which removes fat and leaves minimal scarring, and gynaecomastia surgery, which removes glandular tissue, or the ‘breast disc’, and tightens the skin.\n\n‘Often, liposuction alone is enough to resolve it in people with what we call grade one gynaecomastia, which is often referred to as pseudo-gynaecomastia because it’s just fat,’ says Mr Srinivasan. ‘That can take under an hour. But if you need gynaecomastia surgery, that can take around two hours.’\n\nMr Harris says techniques have improved enormously in the past decade, though there will still be some scarring.\n\nThis can be minimised if the surgeon cuts around the dark skin of the nipple area, where it meets the patient’s normal skin tone. Sometimes it can be done via keyhole surgery, removing breast tissue through tiny incisions made for liposuction instruments after breaking up the tissue with a laser.\n\n‘That’s really important,’ Mr Harris says. ‘Patients who don’t take their tops off because of their gynaecomastia don’t want to be left with physical scars – they might look better in a T-shirt, but they still won’t want to take it off.’\n\nFor advice and to find a surgeon visit bapras.org.uk.\n\nLeft with scars... but they look cool\n\nAt its worst, Sam Sawyers resorted to taping down his C-cup moobs to avoid embarrassment in public.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who lives near Oxford, spent years being teased mercilessly over his chest, which swelled after he hit puberty in his early teens.\n\nAlready overweight, he was targeted by school bullies who poked him every day.\n\nHe never took his top off for fear of ridicule and always wore a T-shirt when swimming. ‘It affected every area of my life,’ he says today. ‘I used to tape them to the side under my armpit but ended up ripping the skin. Sometimes I would bleed through the tape – it was horrible.’\n\nEven after losing 5st two years ago, the moobs stubbornly remained – ‘which wasn’t great for my mentality’, says Sam.\n\nNow an online fitness coach, he was diagnosed with gynaecomastia by a doctor in the UK but chose to have surgery in Poland in July last year. It finally left him feeling confident in his own skin.\n\n‘Now all I think about is tomorrow and bettering myself,’ he says.\n\n‘I’ve missed out on quite a lot in life because of gynaecomastia and not knowing what it was. It needs a lot more awareness.\n\n‘I now post pictures on social media to show people they can do it, too. The scars don’t really bother me – I think they look pretty cool.’","summary":"Teasing for gynaecomastia (enlarged male breast tissue) will unfortunately be familiar for many men and boys.

The plane is expected to be used by Trump for official White House travel once it has been upgraded for security.\n\n “This donation is made in good faith and in the spirit of cooperation and mutual

administration's grasp on reality","text":"A federal judge on Friday night released her full opinion justifying an earlier decision to block President Donald Trump from deploying Texas National Guard troops in Chicago, and she even went so far as to question his administration’s grasp on reality.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge April Perry began by citing a lengthy quote from the Federalist Papers in which Alexander Hamilton addressed concerns that a tyrannical US president would use a militia from one state to invade and occupy another state.\n\nAfter giving the matter brief consideration, Hamilton dismissed fears about a would-be tyrant carrying out such a scheme on the grounds that “it is impossible to believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs.”\n\nAnd yet, Perry noted, this exact scenario is one that the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago claim is happening right now, as they argue that “National Guard troops from both Illinois and Texas have been deployed to Illinois because the president of the United States wants to punish state elected officials whose policies are different from his own.”\n\nPerry went on to consider circumstances in which the president may federalize the National Guard, and concluded that the administration’s case for sending the National Guard to Chicago did not meet any of them.\n\nPerry noted that the president may federalize the National Guard if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority” of the US government, but she argued there has historically been a “very high threshold for deployment” that is not justified by current circumstances.\n\n“In the late 1800s and early 1900s, ‘rebellion’ was understood to mean a deliberate, organized resistance, openly and avowedly opposing the laws and authority of the government as a whole by means of armed opposition and violence,” she explained. “As an example, during the late 1800s, after the close of the Civil War, the Supreme Court and several statutes referred to the Civil War as constituting a ’rebellion.‘”\n\nShe then found that the administration itself has not claimed any Civil War-like rebellion is occurring in the US right now.\n\n“In all of the memoranda actually deploying the National Guard to Illinois, the court does not see any factual determination by President Trump regarding a rebellion brewing here,” she wrote. “This is sensible, because the court cannot find reasonable support for a conclusion that there exists in Illinois a danger of rebellion.”\n\nElsewhere in the ruling, Perry examined the government’s claims that local law enforcement officials have been unable to contain demonstrations at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Broadview, Illinois, which has become a focal point for protests in recent weeks.\n\nAlthough there have been incidents in which local law enforcement has had to intervene to keep protesters from getting too close to the facility, Perry said, there has never been a level of disorder that would justify the deployment of the National Guard.\n\n“The ICE Processing Center has continuously remained open and operational throughout the protest activity,” she wrote. “Broadview Police are not aware of any occasion where an ICE vehicle was prevented from entering or exiting due to activity by protestors.”\n\nThis led her to remark upon a “troubling trend” of the Trump administration “equating protests with riots” and “a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”\n\n“This indicates to the court both bias and lack of objectivity,” she wrote. “Ultimately, this court must conclude that defendants’... perceptions are not reliable.”","summary":"A federal judge on Friday night released her full opinion justifying an

roared, police arrested several pro-Israeli counter-demonstrators who had infiltrated the protest.\n\nA small group of people from Our Fight, a pro-Israeli organisation describing itself as mostly

It will not stop protesting ‘until Israel’s occupation and apartheid is ended’, it added.\n\nFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walked at the front of the crowd across Westminster Bridge, helping to carry a large banner that read ‘National march.

Trump on Monday blamed Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown, saying he’d be \"happy to work with the Democrats on their failed healthcare policies\" once the government reopens. \"Democrats have SHUT DOWN the United States government right in the midst of one of the most successful economies, including a record stock market, that our country has ever had,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This has sadly affected so many programs, services, and other elements of society that Americans rely on — and it should not have happened.\" \"I am happy to work with the Democrats on their failed healthcare policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our government to re-open,\" he added.

Equality before the law must apply to everyone.'\n\nThe annual event, originally named Run 4 Your Mosque, has been held in Victoria Park since 2012 without drawing any public criticism of its anti-women policy.\n\nBut the MoS is aware of one woman, who goes by the name 'Farahyd89' on social media, who has repeatedly attempted to raise the issue with organisers. \n\nShe wrote on Instagram: 'Why aren't women allowed to join?' and in another post she said: 'Why are you not allowing women to even walk? Your grandmothers and mothers with prams also not welcome?'\n\nOn its website, the event claims to be an 'inclusive' family day out that allows 'men, boys of all ages and girls under 12' to take part.\n\nWhen pressed by the MoS if that meant teens and older women could not run, the East London Mosque organisers confirmed that they are banned. \n\nDespite that, mosque leaders last night insisted that their policy was not in contravention of the Equality Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate against someone on the grounds of their sex.\n\nHowever, they failed to explain why some girls could take part in the event – those under 12 years old – and not others.\n\nThe revelations will compound fears that there is a growing tide of 'sharia' values in Britain – a concern raised by President Donald Trump at the UN last month.\n\nIn a chilling warning, the US President said London wants 'to go to sharia law' under its 'terrible' mayor, Sir Sadiq Khan.\n\nMr Khan – who responded to Mr Trump by calling him 'Islamophobic' and 'racist' – last night did not respond to a request to comment on whether Muslim Charity Run's rules were acceptable.\n\nSharia values vary across the globe. However, concerns have been raised about more hardline attitudes towards women and girls that have seen them limited in their access to education and sports.\n\nYesterday, Ms Keen said: 'The East London Mosque Trust reports annual revenues exceeding £5 million, including £10,000 from the Government, and claims to spend much of this on education,training, social welfare and community cohesion. \n\n'It raises serious questions about how much of their charitable activity may also breach the Equality Act.\n\n'It is clear that this organisation does not understand, or chooses to ignore, its legal responsibilities to women and girls.'\n\nIt is not the first time that the East London Mosque Trust, which had an income of £5,597,271 last year, has raised eyebrows.\n\nIn May it was given an official warning by the Charity Commission over a £1 million loss in funds.\n\nIt had invested in an NHS-approved supplier which was forced into administration, and the commission found that the charity's 'due diligence' was 'not thorough enough'. \n\nThey also found that trustees 'failed to have sufficient oversight of activities'.\n\nLast night, an East London Mosque spokesman said: 'The suggestion that our event breaches the Equality Act is entirely incorrect. \n\n'Single-gender sporting events are lawful under Section 195 and Schedule 23 of the Act, and are common across the UK, including the Women's Run Series, Nike Women's 10K, and gender-segregated swimming sessions at Orthodox Jewish facilities like Manchester Jewish Community Centre.\n\n'The Muslim Charity Run operates under the same legal framework as these established events.'\n\nAn EHRC spokeswoman said last night: 'We consider each [complaint] carefully and take action where appropriate.'\n\nKHADIJA KHAN: Despite what Sadiq Khan claims, we ARE creeping towards Islamic law \n\nI wish I could say I was surprised by this shocking and shameful event. But, sadly, I'm not. I see the exclusion of women from a Muslim charity fun run in Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, as the inevitable consequence of our obsession with multiculturalism. \n\nThis ruinous creed has quietly normalised the oppression of women when it occurs under the banner of Islam.\n\nLast month, President Trump warned that the UK was sliding towards a culture of sharia law – a claim dismissed as 'appalling and bigoted' by a spokesman for London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.\n\nAnd, of course, in this country we don't officially have sharia law but we are creeping towards a society that is compliant with its values.\n\nYes, misogyny exists everywhere. But we're usually quick to call it out, whether it's a sexist advert on the London Underground or discrimination in the workplace. \n\nOnly when it's Islamic misogyny do we fall silent, excusing it as a cultural issue.\n\nAsk yourself: how long would a Jewish or Christian run excluding women go ahead without sparking national outrage? That this event is taking place in Hackney – heartland of London's progressive hipster set – only adds insult to injury.\n\nThe coconut cappuccino brigade would be first in line to boast of their feminist credentials, just not when Muslim women are being excluded by their own community.\n\nThis isn't just hypocrisy, but a betrayal. A betrayal of these women who are denied the basic freedoms most others take for granted. It's infantilising, too – the unspoken suggestion that Muslim communities are somehow incapable of adapting to the secular, democratic values of wider society.\n\nThe liberal Left may not want to hear it, but there is a straight line between a seemingly innocent charity run and the horrors of so-called honour killings, or even the grooming gangs scandal. \n\nThese are not isolated incidents. They stem from the same toxic ideology, that women are inherently 'less'.\n\nSo yes, I'm outraged. But I'm also profoundly saddened – because behind the headlines are thousands of women and girls still denied the freedom to run, swim, cycle or enjoy the simplest pleasures of life.\n\nI know, because I was one of them. Growing up in a strict Muslim household in Pakistan, I remember the joy of riding my bike in the street. \n\nBut when I complained to my father that a group of boys had jeered at me for being so permissive, he told me in no uncertain terms that I was the problem and banned me from cycling ever again. I was eight years old.\n\nIt would take another two decades – and a move to Germany in my late 20s, leaving behind both my family and my religion – before I rode a bike again.\n\nI cried when I did. Because to me, that freedom symbolised everything I had finally regained and everything I'd lost.\n\nSo make no mistake, while young girls may be on that 'family' run today, the fact their mothers are not participating tells us exactly what fate awaits them. \n\nOnce they reach puberty, they'll be expected to hang up their running shoes for good.\n\nHow can we, as a democratic society in the West, tolerate this?\n\nIf Sadiq Khan had any backbone, he'd issue a statement making it clear: people are free to follow whatever values they choose, but when those values conflict with the core principles of the society we all live in, they must be condemned without fear or favour.","summary":"Women and girls over the age of 12 have been banned by a mosque from taking part in Muslim Charity Run, in

Minister will fly to an international peace summit where he is expected to pay 'particular tribute' to the US President and the diplomatic work of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, Downing Street said.\n\nThe summit is part of efforts to secure the fragile ceasefire agreed in Gaza.\n\nThe ceremony for the Gaza peace plan will take place at the event to mark a turning point for the Middle East after the two-year war, No 10 said.\n\nThe US president's 20-point plan calls for Israel to maintain an open-ended military presence inside Gaza, along its border with Israel.\n\nAn international force, comprised largely of troops from Arab and Muslim countries, would be responsible for security inside the enclave.\n\nThe Israeli military has said it will continue to operate defensively from the roughly 50 per cent of Gaza it still controls after pulling back to agreed-upon lines.\n\nThe first phase of the plan is expected to see remaining hostages returned to their families and Palestinian prisoners released by Monday morning.\n\nSir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for 'bringing us to this point' as well as Mr Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure 'swift progress towards phase two' of the truce.\n\nReports suggest the US president will be present at the summit in Sharm El Sheikh on Monday.\n\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff told Israeli officials on Friday that Washington would establish a centre in Israel to co-ordinate issues concerning Gaza until there is a permanent government, according to a readout of the meeting obtained by the Associated Press.\n\nThe readout said no US soldiers would be on the ground in the enclave, but there will be people who report to the US and aircraft may operate over the strip for monitoring.\n\nA different official said that a group, including the US, Qatar, Egypt and other countries and organisations, would be part of a mission to locate and identify hostage bodies and avoid issues with misidentification.\n\nIt was unclear if the 200 US troops coming to Israel would be part of that group or a separate initiative.\n\nThe Gaza war was triggered when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.\n\nIn Israel's ensuing offensive, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and nearly 170,000 wounded, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children.\n\nThe United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.","summary":"The Prime Minister will fly to an international peace summit

Some of those bodies are being unearthed right now as we speak. It’s a tragedy.’\n\nThe President plans to give a historic address to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and hopes to visit some of the freed hostages.\n\nHe will then fly to Egypt to discuss the future of Gaza with ‘a lot of leaders’, including representatives from the UK, Germany, France, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\n‘It’s a great deal for Israel, but it’s a great deal for everybody,’ Mr Trump declared.\n\nHis comments came as US troops began to arrive in Israel as part of a 200-strong force that will help to oversee the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nAdmiral Brad Cooper, the head of the US military’s Central Command, was seen in Tel Aviv with lieutenant general Eyal Zamir, chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).\n\nThey then travelled with US special envoy Steve Witkoff to visit an Israeli army post in the Gaza Strip to confirm the IDF had pulled back to the agreed withdrawal line. \n\nWhile no US boots will be deployed on the ground in the war-ravaged territory, American troops will oversee logistics from Israel.\n\nSome 50,000 refugees arrived in Gaza City yesterday, bringing the total number to return to their homes across the Strip to 250,000. \n\nOne, Raja Salmi, told how she walked for hours to find the wreckage of her home in the territory’s capital. ‘It no longer exists. It’s just a pile of rubble,’ she said. ‘I stood before it and cried. All those memories are now just dust.’\n\nIn a further sign of difficulties ahead, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine released a joint statement rejecting any ‘foreign guardianship’ over Gaza. \n\nIt puts in jeopardy the plan to have a Board of Peace, with members including former Prime Minister Tony Blair helping to govern the Strip until it is handed to a Palestinian body.\n\nThe terror groups stressed that any governance must be a purely internal Palestinian matter.\n\nMeanwhile Lebanon’s president Joseph Aoun condemned Israel for carrying out overnight strikes which killed one and injured seven.\n\nIsrael struck a peace deal with Hezbollah, the terror group that rules the south of Lebanon, in November. But it struck overnight on Friday, claiming it had targeted heavy machinery to use ‘for rebuilding its terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon’.\n\nMr Aoun called for Lebanon to have a similar peace plan to Gaza following the conflict.\n\nHezbollah started firing rockets at Israel a day after Hamas’ October 7 atrocity until their leadership was decapitated following Israel’s daring exploding pagers operation in September last year.\n\nLast night, there was heartbreak in Israel after it was revealed that Roei Shalev, a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre, had killed himself after struggling following the death of his girlfriend, Mapal Adam, on October 7.\n\nHis mother also killed herself days after the attack.\n\nOn Friday, he posted a note on his Instagram account, saying that he couldn’t ‘go on any more’. ‘I’ve never felt such deep and burning pain and suffering in my life. It’s eating me up inside,’ he wrote.\n\nHis body was later found inside a burning car on a beach in Netanya.","summary":"The US President said that some of the 28 captives who have been killed - and whose repatriation is expected to get under way tonight - were being 'unearthed' and declared it a 'tragedy'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15184151/Hamas-bodies-hostages-rubble-release-deadline.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/12/00/102901551-0-Displaced_Palestinians_walk_with_their_belongings_along_the_coas-a-37_1760223881550.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 23:06:17","author":"Andy Jehring,Editor","authors":["Andy Jehring","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":368421750,"title":"Carney condemns Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy during call with Zelenskyy","text":"The readout notes Carney and Zelenskyy also discussed the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, which Canada and Ukraine convened at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly last month.\n\nIt said the leaders agreed to remain in close contact as their ministers meet at the upcoming G7 finance ministers meeting, as well as at the 2025 annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund meeting, for increasing financial pressure on Russia.\n\nZelenskyy said Saturday that he also had a “very positive and productive” phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelenskyy said he told Trump about Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy system, and that the two discussed opportunities to strengthen Ukraine’s air defence.\n\n–With files from AP","summary":"Prime Minister Mark Carney and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke Saturday about recent Russian attacks on Ukraine&#8217;s energy grid.

UK-US trade talks, says Swinney","text":"John Swinney has said he would like to be involved in trade talks between the UK and US following meetings with President Donald Trump about whisky.\n\nThe First Minister has met Mr Trump numerous times this year, championing tariff relief for the Scotch whisky industry – the UK’s biggest drinks export.\n\nDiscussions remain ongoing about the imposition of a 10% tariff on exports from the UK to the US, a result of Mr Trump’s desire for the levies.\n\nSpeaking to the US president earlier this year during a visit to Scotland, Mr Swinney put the issue of the Scotch industry on the table, with Mr Trump saying he “didn’t know whisky was a problem”, but appearing open to moving on the issue.\n\nSpeaking to the PA news agency ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, the First Minister said: “I’ve not been privy to the trade talks.\n\n“I would like to be, because I think I’ve actually been quite helpful in all of this.\n\n“It’s clear to me earlier on this year that whisky was not really featuring in the trade talks at all, it was not there as a principle negotiating priority for the UK Government.\n\n“Well, I had to make sure it was, because it really matters to Scotland.”\n\nTrade remains reserved to the UK Government and the First Minister’s visit to Washington last month was facilitated by former ambassador Lord Peter Mandelson.\n\nReports emerged last week that whisky could be exempted from the US tariffs, but the First Minister said he had not heard any updates.\n\n“We’ve sought engagement with the UK Government on the trade talks and we’ve had a certain amount of information, but nothing of the detail and I have no update on the events since the last time I had interactions with the Prime Minister on the margins of the state banquet at Windsor Castle when I had the opportunity to discuss it once again with President Trump and also a number of senior members of President Trump’s administration,” he said.\n\nThe First Minister argued there was an incentive for the US to reduce tariffs, given casks used to make bourbon whiskey are sold to distilleries in Scotland to age their product, with a fall in output here meaning a decline in demand for American casks.\n\n“That’s a very valuable trade – it’s worth 300 million dollars a year,” he said.\n\n“When I was in the United States in early September, I talked to one of the companies producing the whiskey casks and they’re having orders cancelled from Scotland because there isn’t sufficient production in Scotland to merit the casks coming from the United States.\n\n“So, if we just were to take all of this out of the trade talks to say ‘let’s have zero for zero’, we would see an improvement in the fortunes for Scotch whisky and we’d see an improvement in the fortunes for, principally, interests in the state of Kentucky and the Kentucky bourbon industry.”\n\nA spokeswoman for the UK Government said: “We have always used our trade agenda to promote our world-class Scotch whisky industry, by continually engaging with the US on the issue and securing significant tariffs cuts in our other trade deals like with India.\n\n“Our deal in May secured preferential access to Scotch whisky to the US market compared with other major economies.\n\n“We continue to work to ensure this deal protects British jobs and exports as part of our Plan for Change.”","summary":"The First Minister has been pushing for an exemption from tariffs for Scotch

Monday?","text":"Egypt will host an international summit on Monday in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh aimed at finalizing an agreement to end the war in Gaza, an Egyptian presidential spokesperson has confirmed. More than 20 world leaders are expected to attend the summit, including US President Donald Trump, the spokesperson said in a statement. The gathering, first reported by Axios, is part of a push to cement a ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. According to Axios, invitations were extended to leaders or foreign ministers from Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The outlet also reported that the US State Department later expanded the list to include Spain, Japan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Hungary, India, El Salvador, Cyprus, Greece, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Canada. Iran was also invited, although Israel will not participate, the report said. Under the proposed deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages — including around 20 believed to be alive and the remains of up to 28 others. In return, Israel would release about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while allowing larger quantities of humanitarian aid to enter the territory. Subsequent phases of the agreement are expected to tackle more contentious issues, including the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas. Also Read: Why Hamas has Refused to Sign Trump's Gaza Peace Deal Confirming the summit on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to \"end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability.\" President Trump said on Friday that he would travel to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament, the Knesset, before heading to Egypt. \"We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited,\" he told reporters at the White House. Egypt's foreign ministry said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had discussed summit preparations with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty. The meeting follows Israel's approval of the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return plan on Thursday, after three days of indirect negotiations in Egypt. The Israeli military has since partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza, though it continues to occupy roughly half of the enclave. The war began after the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians — including more than 18,000 children — have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military operations, having failed to progress beyond the first stage of a three-phase plan.","summary":"The meeting follows Israel's approval of the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return plan on Thursday","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/middle-east/gaza-peace-summit-which-countries-are-attending-egypt-talks-article-152985266","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-152985269,thumbsize-105180,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/152985269.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 22:58:40","author":"Rounak Bagchi","authors":["Rounak Bagchi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.016},{"id":368415492,"title":"Trump Directs Pentagon To Pay US Troops With All Available Funds Amid Shutdown","text":"Washington: President Donald Trump said Saturday that he has directed the Defense Department to use “all available funds” to ensure U.S. troops are paid Wednesday despite the government shutdown, a short-term fix that will not apply to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed.Trump said in a social media post that he was acting because “our Brave Troops will miss the paychecks they are rightfully due on October 15th.”The Republican president's directive removes one of the pressure points that could have forced Congress into action, likely ensuring that the shutdown — now in its 11th day and counting — extends into a third week and possibly beyond. But no similar action seems forthcoming for federal employees also working without pay while thousands are now being laid off during the lapse in government operations. The White House budget office started the layoffs on Friday.Trump blamed Democrats and said he was exercising his authority as commander in chief to direct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “to use all available funds to get our Troops PAID on October 15th.” The Republican president added, \"We have identified funds to do this, and Secretary Hegseth will use them to PAY OUR TROOPS.”U.S service members were in danger of not receiving their next paycheck on Wednesday after the government shut down on Oct. 1, the start of the federal budget cycle. The U.S. has about 1.3 million active-duty service members, and the prospect of troops going without pay has been a focal point when lawmakers on Capitol Hill have discussed the shutdown’s negative impact.Trump did not say where he's getting the money, but a spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget said Pentagon research and development funds would be tapped.The Pentagon said it identified about $8 billion of unobligated research development testing and evaluation funds from the last fiscal year that will be used to issue the mid-month paychecks, “in the event the funding lapse continues past October 15th.”Federal workers typically receive back pay after a shutdown ends, as now required by a law that Trump signed during his first term. He recently floated the idea of not making up the lost salaries.It was unclear if the president’s directive applies to the U.S. Coast Guard, which is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces but is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security during peacetime.The nation’s third shutdown in 12 years has again raised anxiety levels among service members and their families as those in uniform are working without pay. While they would receive back pay once the impasse ends, many military families live paycheck to paycheck.During previous shutdowns, Congress passed legislation to ensure that troops kept earning their salaries, but discussion of taking a similar step by lawmakers appeared to have fizzled out.Asked earlier this week if he would support a bill to pay the troops, Trump said, “that probably will happen.”“We’ll take care of it,” he said Wednesday. “Our military is always going to be taken care of.”The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions of people.Trump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first.Both sides appear dug in on their positions, making it unclear when, or how, the shutdown ends.","summary":"President Trump directs Pentagon to use available funds to pay US troops amid government shutdown, ensuring 1.3 million active-duty service members receive paychecks.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-directs-pentagon-to-pay-us-troops-with-all-available-funds-amid-shutdown","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/white-house-physician-gives-big-update-on-donald-trumps-cardiac-health-after-routine-checkup-1760152402834-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 22:55:42","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.575},{"id":368421190,"title":"El-Sisi and Trump to chair Gaza summit in Egypt on Monday","text":"Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will chair an international summit to discuss the US president’s proposal to end Israel’s war on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.\n\nThe meeting will involve leaders from more than 20 countries, the Egyptian presidency said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nIt will aim “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, the statement said.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said they would attend, along with Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain. French President Emmanuel Macron has also confirmed his attendance.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, or any representatives of the Hamas Palestinian group, would attend.\n\nThe announcement comes as tens of thousands of Palestinians streamed north along the coast of Gaza, by foot, car and cart back, to their abandoned and mostly destroyed homes in the Strip, as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared to be holding.\n\nIsraeli troops partially pulled back under the first phase of a US-brokered agreement reached this week to end Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 67,000 people and left much of the famine-struck enclave in ruins.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said that the ceasefire “ended one form of violence, but the struggle continues”.\n\n“People walk this exhausting, tiring journey back here [in the north] because they belong here. They keep telling us that they belong to this part of the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip, and they will never be uprooted from here,” Mahmoud said.\n\n“But spending a night here is going to be very difficult,” he said. “The struggle to survive continues to present itself in the most aggressive way, not each day but each hour.”\n\nGaza’s Government Media Office has said that 5,000 public operations have been carried out after the ceasefire came into force to improve the lives of Palestinians in the enclave.\n\nAmong them are more than 850 rescue and relief missions carried out by the Gaza Civil Defence, police and municipal teams to recover bodies, remove rubble and secure destroyed areas.\n\nAbout 150 bodies have been recovered from various areas across the enclave since Friday morning, the Civil Defence said. Separately, Nasser Hospital reported that 28 bodies were recovered from southern Gaza’s Khan Younis alone.\n\nMore than 900 service missions to restore water and sewage lines have also been carried out, the agency added.\n\nThese missions are being carried out with the bare minimum of resources as Israel’s blockade on Gaza remains in place, restricting the entry of fuel and equipment. During the genocide, Israeli attacks destroyed ambulances, fire trucks and civil defence centres, further crippling emergency and recovery efforts across the enclave.\n\nThe mayor of Khan Younis said that 85 percent of the southern Gaza governorate has been destroyed by Israeli attacks, adding that about 400,000 tonnes of rubble must be removed from the city’s streets.\n\nCalls for crossings to open\n\nAid groups have also urged Israel to reopen more crossings to allow aid into Gaza.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) said it was ready to restore 145 food distribution points across the territory, once Israel allows for expanded deliveries. Before Israel completely sealed off Gaza in March, United Nations agencies provided food at 400 distribution points.\n\n“What is most important now for us to reach the north is crossings to be opened,” Antoine Renard, a WFP representative and the country director for Palestine, told Al Jazeera from Deir el-Balah.\n\nHe explained that in a previous ceasefire in January, the WFP had enabled “practically a third of all the different goods that managed to enter into Gaza”.\n\n“The conditions should be the same [now]. We expect that the good practices that we had in January 2025 will be again applied in this ceasefire,” Renard said.\n\nIzzat al-Risheq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said the group is working with “friendly countries” to ensure the entry of aid into Gaza, “despite the massive destruction caused by the war”.\n\nUNICEF spokesperson Tess Ingram said on Saturday that the children’s agency expects to significantly scale up supplies of high-energy food for malnourished children, menstrual hygiene supplies and tents, starting on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli captives held in Gaza by Hamas and other armed groups are expected to “come back” on Monday, US President Trump said, with 20 living captives and the bodies of 28 others due to be handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.\n\nIn exchange, Israel is due to release some 250 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, as well as about 1,700 people detained from Gaza over the past two years of war and held without charge. The Israel Prison Service said that detainees have been transferred to deportation facilities at Ofer and Ktzi’ot prisons, “awaiting instructions from the political echelon”.\n\nIn past exchanges, Israel has delayed the release of Palestinian prisoners and subjected them to harsh treatment, including physical abuse, humiliation and restrictions on family contact, before eventually releasing them. Rights groups have documented numerous cases of Palestinians arriving in dire health conditions after prolonged interrogation and detention without charge or trial.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, tens of thousands of people gathered in Hostages Square after two years of protests led by family members of captives calling for their return.\n\nTrump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his daughter, Ivanka Trump, took the stage in the square with the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, who played a key role in the ceasefire negotiations.\n\n“I dreamed of this night. It’s been a long journey,” Witkoff said. Some yelled, “Thank you, Trump, thank you Witkoff”, and booed when the envoy mentioned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nTurning to the captives, Witkoff said: “As you return to the embrace of your families and your nation, know that all of Israel and the entire world stands ready to welcome you home with open arms and endless love.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut said that Israeli captives’ families credit Trump for the deal, not Netanyahu.\n\n“The family members of captives have no faith in their government, no faith in the Israeli prime minister, whom they accused of prolonging the war for his own personal and political gain,” Salhut said.\n\n“The cheers for [Trump] and for Steve Witkoff come because the family members and those who are protesting say this happened because of the Americans.”","summary":"Leaders from more than 20 countries to attend meeting in Egypt&#039;s Sharm el-Sheikh, Egyptian presidency says.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/11/el-sisi-and-trump-to-chair-gaza-summit-in-egypt-on-monday?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/epa_68ea8d3ce09d-1760202044.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 22:53:44","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.155},{"id":368411286,"title":"National Guard troops sent to Illinois by Trump can stay but can't be deployed for now","text":"National Guard troops sent to Illinois by President Donald Trump can stay in the state and under federal control, but can't be deployed to protect federal property or go on patrol for now, an appeals court ruled on Saturday (October 11, 2025).\n\n The decision comes after federal Judge April Perry on Thursday ruled to temporarily block the National Guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois during Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\n The appeals court on Saturday granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments.\n\n The on-again, off-again deployments stem from a political and legal battle over Trump's push to send the Guard to several US cities.

Two others were also seen being taken out of the crowd by officers.\n\nIn footage which has since emerged online, protestors could be heard chanting 'shame on you' and 'Zionists' while police 'quickly' descended on the scene, escorting away the counter-protesters. \n\nThe Met Police made a 'small number of arrests' after breaking up a scuffle between the two groups.\n\nMeanwhile six other people holding a banner saying '\"Globalise the intifada\" is a call to murder Jews' were also taken into custody, Campaign Against Antisemitism has said. \n\nOfficers also threw a ring of steel around hundreds of pro-Israel supporters near Waterloo Bridge. The group was heard shouting 'losers' while a man speaking through a megaphone declared pro-Palestinian protesters 'animals'.\n\nElsewhere pro-Palestine protesters were heard chanting 'death, death to the IDF' and 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free'. It is understood that arrests have also been made among the pro-Palestinian marchers.\n\nThe Met Police has since confirmed 14 people were arrested, seven for breaching conditions under the Public Order Act while others were taken into custody for other offences which included supporting a proscribed group and affray. \n\nThey also made a 'number of arrests' in response to a group of Youth Demand activists blocking Tower Bridge and causing serious disruption. \n\nA Campaign Against Antisemitism spokesperson said: 'A week after Jews were murdered at a synagogue in Manchester on Yom Kippur, protesters have called again with impunity to 'Globalise the intifada', while brave and decent people daring to stand with Britain's Jews have been abused and arrested on the streets of London, because the 'Free Palestine' mobs cannot stand the sight of them.\n\n'Holding signs saying \"We stand with Britain's Jews\" should not be controversial, but we have had to provide solicitors to represent those who held them in jail. \n\n'There is a ceasefire now, but these marches were never really about a ceasefire. The marchers say that they are 'anti-Zionist', but this was never really about 'Zionists'.\n\n'This is London just over a week after the Prime Minister said he would do 'everything in my power' to protect the Jewish community. \n\n'This is the same Prime Minister who swore that he would tear out antisemitism by its roots. \n\n'These are hate marches, this is two tier policing, and this must stop.

We have yet to hear any answers.'\n\nThe pro-Palestine march, which was attended by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, made its way through central London one day after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas came into effect.\n\nIt marks the 32nd national demonstration in support of Palestine since October 2023, according to organiser Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), with protesters setting off from Embankment at midday for a march ending in a rally in Whitehall.\n\nOrganisers are expected to call for the ceasefire, which was announced by US President Donald Trump, to become a permanent agreement.\n\nA counter protest organised by Stop The Hate took place at the junction of Aldwych and the Strand.\n\nConditions were imposed on both demonstrations by the Met Police, which set out specific areas protesters can gather and the routes they can march on.\n\nPSC director Ben Jamal said pro-Palestine protests will be held less frequently if the ceasefire holds - but believes it is 'not a viable path to ending decades of apartheid' in Gaza.\n\n'We share the huge relief of Palestinians that a ceasefire is now taking effect,' he said.\n\n'However, we also know that Israel has violated every ceasefire agreement it has ever signed.\n\n'In the last two years we have seen Israel commit a live-streamed genocide in Gaza that has killed at least 67,000 Palestinians, including 20,000 children. And we have seen our governments, Conservative and Labour, continue to arm and politically support Israel.\n\n'We will keep protesting and campaigning all over the UK to end the complicity of our government, public bodies and corporations with Israel's crimes under international law.'\n\nBut campaigners against anti-Semitism have argued that protests should no longer go ahead as they have no legitimate aim. \n\nOn Saturday thousands of pro-Palestine protesters gathered along Victoria Embankment to the sound of drums, ahead of a demonstration to mark two years of the war in Gaza.\n\nStalls were selling keffiyehs and outside Embankment station people were handing out placards that said 'from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free', 'it's not a crime to act against genocide' and 'Starmer has blood on his hands, free Palestine'.\n\nControversial signs spotted among marchers included the slogan 'globalise the intifada'.\n\nOther signs include a cartoon of Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, with a Nazi swastika drawn across it, and several appearing to compare the Israeli Prime Minister to Adolf Hitler. \n\nA leaflet has also been handed out by the Socialist Worker, entitled: Palestine resistance, revolution and the struggle for freedom. It includes a section on the banned terrorist organisation Hamas. \n\nProtesters chanted: 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free'.\n\nA large stationary crowd of counter-protesters waving Israeli and English flags blared loud music as they faced pro-Palestinian protesters passing from Waterloo Bridge onto the Strand.\n\nA man with a megaphone declared the pro-Palestinian group to be 'animals', adding: 'They are all Jew haters'. \n\nThe group had a deafening loud speaker that blared heavy rock metal music that included the lyrics 'you can stick your Palestine up your hole'.\n\nThe song also said 'with your twisted goals, we will bleed for your lies', referenced Islamic State, and said '(we are) sick of all your burning hate'. It ended with the line 'you're not welcome anymore', before someone on the megaphone shouted 'Shalom losers'.\n\nA blue Trump 'make America great again' flag was flown at the front of the counter-protest, as well as several Union flags.\n\nYour Party co-founder and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at the protest, and co-founder Zarah Sultana later spoke to those gathered in Whitehall.\n\nMs Sultana criticised the Home Secretary for switching sides on Palestine and 'locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action', who she described as 'heroes'.\n\nThe Independent MP for Coventry South said Shabana Mahmood 'doesn't want to just ban demonstrations, she wants to criminalise dissent - she wants to send a message that if you march for Palestine, if you speak out against genocide, if you demand justice, then the state considers you the problem. Shame on her.'\n\nFrom a stage outside Downing Street, she told tens of thousands of protesters that in 2014 Ms Mahmood took part in two demonstrations for Gaza: Lying on the floor of a Sainsbury's supermarket and weeks later addressing 'a Palestine protest like this' with expressions of compassion.\n\nToday 'she is locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action and calling them terrorists - they are heroes', Ms Sultana said.\n\n'The real terrorists are the war criminals that continue to drop bombs on Gaza and the politicians here in Britain who welcome them with open arms - shame on them', she added.\n\nEarlier at around 12:45pm, police ushered away multiple people carrying placards that said 'we stand with Britain's Jews', taking them out of the crowd of pro-Palestine protesters after they managed to infiltrate the march.\n\nShouts of 'shame' and 'free Palestine' came loudly from the pro-Palestine crowd gathered along Victoria Embankment, which at that point numbered in the tens of thousands.\n\n'A small group of counter protesters breached their conditions by demonstrating at the form up point of the Palestine Coalition protest. This led to a scuffle between several individuals from the two groups. \n\n'Officers were quickly on the scene to separate those involved, making a small number of arrests,' the Met later said in post on X.\n\nAnnouncing plans for its policing this weekend, the Met made reference to recent Government proposals to give police greater powers to restrict repeat protests but said that 'at this time, the law remains unchanged'.\n\nThe measures announced last weekend follow frequent pro-Palestinian demonstrations, including in London and Manchester last Saturday.\n\nThe Met said 492 people were arrested at last week's protest in Trafalgar Square, with the majority on suspicion of supporting the banned terror organisation Palestine Action.\n\nCalls for restraint had been made following the terror attack on a synagogue in Manchester on October 2 in which two people were killed, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer urging protesters to 'respect the grief of British Jews'.\n\nIt followed scuffles between police and pro-Palestine protesters on the evening of the attack after supporters of a flotilla headed to Gaza gathered in Whitehall.\n\nMelvin Cravitz, 66, and Adrian Daulby, 53, were killed following the attack outside Heaton Park Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, Manchester on October 2, carried out by Islamic extremist Jihad Al-Shamie.\n\nGreater Manchester Police said that one of the deceased men was shot by officers, adding a second victim sustained a non-life threatening gunshot wound.\n\nIn the wake of the attack, the Met had also urged organisers to call off the plans, with Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley saying policing the protest would mean drawing officers away from communities 'at a time when they are needed most'.\n\nThe demonstration in support of Palestine Action went ahead, with human rights campaigner Sir Jonathon Porritt saying protesters should not be asked to 'give up on our right to stand up for those who are being devastated by an ongoing, real-time genocide in Gaza'.\n\nOn Thursday, around 2,000 protesters gathered outside Downing Street to mark a week since the synagogue attack.\n\nAt the protest, Gideon Falter, chief executive of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: 'This is a Jewish community that has clamoured for two years in the face of mounting hate.'\n\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said repeated large-scale protests had caused 'considerable fear' for the Jewish community.\n\nBen Jamal, PSC director, said the group will 'never stop' supporting Palestinians to 'achieve a free Palestine'.\n\nOf the planned protest this weekend, he said: 'For two years we've seen Israel commit a no holds barred genocide with the political and military support of successive UK governments.\n\n'In response, a community of resistance in this country has responded with an historic show of solidarity - actively and intensively campaigning, day in day out, to demand politicians, public bodies and corporations end their complicity with Israel's crimes.\n\n'This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country and around the world who want freedom and justice for Palestine.\n\n'That work will go on. Because we know Israel is capable of breaking the ceasefire at any time, as it has done on every previous occasion. And we know this ceasefire based on (US President Donald) Trump's plan does nothing to address the root causes of Israeli occupation and colonisation of Palestine, and its system of apartheid against Palestinians. It also does nothing to hold those responsible for genocide to account.\n\n'The rights of the Palestinian people are enshrined under international law - they are inviolable and non-negotiable. They will never give up those rights, and we will never stop supporting them to achieve a free Palestine.'\n\nThe Israeli military said on Friday that the ceasefire agreement came into effect at noon local time (10am BST).\n\nThe pause in the two-year war in the Middle East follows Hamas agreeing to release the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nNews of the ceasefire agreement came just two days after the second anniversary of October 7, the attacks by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel.","summary":"Police have arrested pro-Israel supporters who were holding placards which read 'we stand with Britain's Jews', while elsewhere pro-Palestine protesters were filmed chanting 'death to the IDF'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15183993/police-arrest-pro-Israel-placard-britains-jews.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/11/13/102904043-0-image-a-61_1760185227471.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/11/906655044164341391/1024x576_MP4_906655044164341391.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-11 22:45:32","author":"Editor,Elizabeth Haigh,Shannon McGuigan","authors":["Editor","Elizabeth Haigh","Shannon McGuigan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":368409280,"title":"Tiger Woods reveals latest health setback with his third major surgery of the last two years","text":"The prospects of Tiger Woods returning to competitive golf are growing ever bleaker after he disclosed he has been forced to undergo further back surgery.\n\nThe 15-time major winner revealed in a statement on Saturday that pain and a lack of mobility had necessitated the replacement of a disc in his lower spine on Friday.\n\nTaking to X, the statement read: 'After experiencing pain and lack of mobility in my back, I consulted with Doctors and Surgeons to have tests taken. \n\n'The scans determined that I had a collapsed disc in L4/5, disc fragments and a compromised spinal canal.

The S&P 500 settled at 6,552.51, down 182.60 points or 2.71 per cent, while the Nasdaq ended at 22,204.43, slipping 820.20 points or 3.56 per cent.More than USD 1.5 trillion in market value was wiped out from the US stock market, while the cryptocurrency market saw USD 19 billion in liquidations, the biggest single-day figure ever recorded.The sell-off reflected investors' anxiety over escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing and the potential global economic fallout.President Trump, in a post on Truth Social, said the new tariffs will take effect on November 1, 2025. \"Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the USA, and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100 per cent on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying. Also on November 1, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software,\" Trump stated.The announcement came after the US President accused China of taking \"an extraordinarily aggressive position on trade\" by sending \"an extremely hostile letter to the world.\"Earlier on Friday, Trump had said there was \"no reason to meet\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping after Beijing imposed sweeping new export controls on rare earth elements.He had warned that the US was preparing to respond with strong countermeasures, including a \"massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese goods.China, which dominates global processing of rare earths used in products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, and fighter jets, expanded its list of restricted minerals.It added five new elements, holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium, bringing the total to 12 out of 17 rare earth types.Export licences will now be required not only for the elements but also for technologies related to mining, smelting, and magnet production.The developments mark a sharp escalation in US-China trade tensions and have raised concerns about the impact on global supply chains and technology industries.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LILY JOBSON, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:23:20 BST, 11 October 2025 |Updated:23:31 BST, 11 October 2025 \n\nParis Fury has defended her daughter Venezuela's engagement as she opened up about the exciting news for the first time.\nTyson and Paris' eldest child got engaged to her boxer boyfriend Noah Price at her sweet sixteenth last month.\nAfter the boxer hit back at critics following the news, Paris admitted: 'I did encourage her to wait as long as possible, but she was determined.'\nVenezuela's engagement had echoes of Tyson and Paris' romance, with the couple having met when they were 17 and 15 respectively.\nThey reconnected and began a romance at her 16th birthday.\nParis, 35, and Tyson, 37, married in 2008 when she was just 19 and he was 21-years-old during a ceremony in Doncaster. They later renewed their vows in April 2013 in New York City.\n\nParis Fury has defended her 16-year-old daughter Venezuela's engagement as she opened up about the exciting news for the first time\n\nTyson and Paris' eldest child got engaged to her boxer boyfriend Noah Price at her sweet sixteenth birthday party last month\nIn August the couple married for the third time, with a ceremony held in the South of France, attended by their seven children.\nIn an interview with The Mirror, Paris added: 'We're all really happy for her and Noah, they’re a great match and genuinely excited about this next chapter in her life. \n'Yes, she’s young, but as we all know, that’s in line with our traditions and values. I was engaged to Tyson at 17, so we’re not far off in age.'\nSpeaking about her third wedding this summer, Paris said it was to 'reaffirm' their love for one another.\nIn another chat, she added: 'I told Tyson I wasn't doing it for anyone else this time. We did it to reaffirm our love and to embrace the fact that our kids are now such a big part of our life. It was just for us.'\nIt comes after Venezuela posed for a photo with her proud dad Tyson at her 16th birthday after he hit back at critics who questioned her relationship.\nGiving a further insight into the night on Thursday, Paris uploaded a series of snaps to her Instagram Story.\nLater in the week, former heavyweight world champion Tyson appeared to respond to the criticism on Instagram. \n\nVenezuela's engagement had echoes of Tyson and Paris' romance, with the couple having met when they were 17 and 15 respectively, getting engaged two years later\n\nIn August the couple married for the third time, with a ceremony held in the South of France, attended by their seven children\n\nIt comes after Venezuela posed for a photo with her proud dad Tyson at her 16th birthday after he hit back at critics who questioned her relationship\n\n Newly engaged Venezuela Fury poses with proud dad Tyson at her 16th birthday \nHe shared a video by minaret minds, an Instagram account which states that it focuses on 'Islamic reminders, stories and reflections.'\nIn the video, the narrator states '50 years ago people got married at 18 and stayed together until death. Today people wait until 30 to get married and divorce within three years.\n'Back then, couples had nothing but built everything together. Now couples have everything but can't build anything together. Our grandparents shared one small room and called it paradise. We have five bedroom houses and call them prisons.\n'The only difference is we now call commitment settling and call running away finding yourself.'\nThe post added: 'Who convinced us that love expires, that compatibility is instant, that marriage should feel like a Disney movie every day.\n'If we question ourselves, we might stop expecting perfection and start building connection.\n'I ask have we become on focused on finding the one that we forgot how to become the one.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nParis Fury defends daughter Venezuela, 16, as she breaks silence on her engagement\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.
