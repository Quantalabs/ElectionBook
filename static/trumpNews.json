Both Melania and her step-daughter, Ivanka, have long embraced a refined aesthetic closely associated with the royals. \n\nMelania has echoed Meghan’s understated style on numerous occasions, selecting perfectly-tailored coats and dramatic caped gowns in matching hues. \n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka frequently mirrors Kate’s wardrobe, donning identical outfits from some of the Princess’ favourite designers. \n\nIt seems the Trumps might be hoping to establish themselves as America’s version of royalty, blending luxury couture with timeless elegance, much like their British counterparts. \n\nTake a closer look at the comparisons below…\n\nIvanka and Kate \n\nMonochrome magic\n\nIvanka made a noteworthy entrance at the Liberty Ball in a Givenchy haute couture gown, reminiscent of Kate’s monochrome look at the 2023 Bafta Awards.\n\nBoth women elevated their ensembles with contrasting black opera gloves and statement jewellery – Ivanka opting for a dazzling Leviev 50-carat diamond necklace, while Kate chose rose gold floral earrings from Zara.\n\nIvanka attended the National Prayer Service donning a vibrant coat dress by one of Kate’s favourite designers, Suzannah London. \n\nThe scarlet outerwear, adorned with a bow at the neck, echoed Catherine Walker’s Beau Tie coat dress, which Kate debuted at her Christmas carol service in 2021.\n\nGlittering glamour \n\nBoth Ivanka and Kate have turned heads in dazzling Jenny Packham caped gowns at notable events.\n\nKate radiated elegance in a floor-skimming golden dress for the No Time To Die world premiere in 2021, while Ivanka sparkled in the mint version two years later.\n\nFit and flare \n\nDuring her campaign trail in 2017, Ivanka chose a breezy shirt dress by Alexis, featuring short puff sleeves and a midi-length.\n\nThe look resembled an Emilia Wickstead frock that Kate wore during her 2016 visit to Mumbai.\n\nTimeless chic\n\nAt a wreath-laying ceremony, Ivanka appeared to channel a tonal outfit previously worn by Kate in 2022. \n\nShe opted for an Oscar de la Renta coat with 3D floral appliqués, a mock turtleneck dress, leather boots and gloves. \n\nThis was reminiscent of Kate’s Scarborough ensemble, which comprised a Max&Co coat, Gabriela Hearst knitted dress and Ralph Lauren pumps. \n\nBridal statement\n\nKate made an unforgettable bridal statement at her wedding to Prince William in a breathtaking ivory lace and organza gown, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen. \n\nSimilarly, Ivanka’s wedding dress, designed by Vera Wang, featured layers of Chantilly and Lyon lace, complete with a voluminous skirt and semi-sheer sleeves. \n\nEnglish florals\n\nIvanka and Kate both own Beulah London’s charming ‘Sonia’ blouson sleeve dress. \n\nThe American businesswoman showcased hers with sky-high heels during a visit to a bakery. \n\nMeanwhile, Kate accessorised with nude slingbacks and oversized sunglasses at a charity polo match held at Guards Polo Club in Berkshire.\n\nStyle stripes \n\nKate radiated sophistication at a 2022 charity polo match in Berkshire, donning an Emilia Wickstead fit-and-flare cloqué dress. \n\nThe dress was distinguished by its contrasting piping details and came with a detachable belt, which the Princess opted not to wear. \n\nConversely, Ivanka accentuated her waist with the belt while visiting The White House. \n\nBoth Kate and Ivanka have Alessandra Rich’s coveted navy and white polka dot dress in their wardrobes. \n\nKate first wore the vintage-inspired crepe de chine frock for Prince Charles’ 70th birthday portrait, later revisiting the look at Bletchley Park.\n\nThe dress features a pleated midi skirt, which Kate paired with denim-blue court shoes, while Ivanka complemented hers with navy-toned heels.\n\nIvanka’s nod to Princess Diana\n\nIvanka showcased refined style in a forest green Dior skirt suit, accessorised with a matching hat and Lady Dior bag, offering a firm nod to Princess Diana. \n\nThe rigid rectangular bag, designed by Gianfranco Ferré in 1994, features a motif inspired by two items of furniture found in Christian Dior’s private mansion: Napoléon III chairs and a neo-Louis XVI medallion armchair.\n\nThe style was originally called ‘Chouchou’, but renamed ‘Lady’ in 1996 in Diana’s honour, after she was seen carrying it.\n\nMelania and Meghan\n\nSharp tailoring \n\nFor Anzac Day in 2018, Meghan Markle chose a somber yet sophisticated look, sporting a bespoke Matthew Williamson coat, featuring oversized lapels and double pockets. \n\nTwo years later, Melania Trump echoed these design elements in an Altuzarra coat, worn to a wreath-laying ceremony marking the 75th Anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. \n\nBoth women styled their looks with black pumps and loose waves. \n\nUtilitarian chic \n\nAt the White House National Day of Prayer service in 2020, Melania Trump opted for a sleeveless khaki trench dress by Dior, complete with utility-inspired detailing. \n\nShe accessorised with a slim waist belt and eye-catching snake-print Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nMeghan wore a comparable look in 2018 at the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition, choosing a House of Nonie belted trench dress in a similar silhouette.\n\nPhilip Treacy’s iconic ‘slice’ hat has found a place in both Meghan and Melania’s headwear collections. \n\nMeghan debuted a custom straw version at Trooping the Colour in 2018, paired with a pale pink Carolina Herrera off-the-shoulder dress. \n\nThe following year, Melania wore a similar design at the D-Day 75th Anniversary commemorations, styling it with a chic coat from The Row. \n\nCaped elegance\n\nFloor-length cape silhouettes with embellished cascading sleeves have both been worn by the ladies for evening events.\n\nMeghan set the trend in 2019, during a trip to Morocco, wearing a bespoke Dior creation, which skimmed over her pregnancy bump. \n\nLater in the year, Melania looked suitably festive for the Congressional Ball in the same champagne hue with beaded sleeves by Reem Acra. \n\nAdding definition \n\nMeghan exuded elegance during her first royal engagement with Queen Elizabeth in 2018, wearing an ivory Givenchy dress designed by Clare Waight Keller. \n\nThe pencil silhouette was cinched with a slim belt for a polished look. \n\nJust a month later, Ivanka stood alongside Her Majesty at Windsor Castle in a tailored Christian Dior skirt suit featuring covered shoulders, a narrow belt and a midi length, offering a similarly refined aesthetic.\n\nLadies in red\n\nBoth Meghan and Melania showcased minimalist American-style elegance with striking red cape gowns.\n\nDuring Donald Trump’s UK tour in 2019, Melania wore a Givenchy caped gown – coincidentally, a favourite designer of Meghan’s. \n\nMeanwhile, Meghan dazzled in a near-identical cape-sleeve gown by Safiyaa at the Mountbatten Music Festival during her farewell UK tour, completing the look with sleek, wavy hair. \n\nLara’s Camilla moment\n\nDonald Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, who is married to the President’s son Eric, communicated with viewers through her fashion choices at the inauguration ball.\n\nThe mother-of-two opted for a scarlet gown, paired with a glimmering ruby necklace, which could easily have been lifted from the Royal Family’s collection.\n\nThe show-stopping piece of jewellery featured three tiers of diamonds and rubies and resembles one of Queen Camilla’s favourite necklaces. \n\nThe royal piece is thought to have been a diplomatic gift, only worn on special occasions.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs they made their dazzling return to the White House, the women&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Melania, Ivanka, and Lara Emulate

Brutalist’ expands","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk” managed to open No 1 at the box office with a modest USD12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.\n\nOn a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s “Hacksaw Ridge.” Reviews (21 per cent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible.\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently named Gibson a “special ambassador” to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nGoing into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region.\n\nThe weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming.\n\nBut the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist” a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and managed solid business, collecting USD6 million in limited release.\n\nIn wide release, it earned USD2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.”\n\nThe audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys.” Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just USD340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters.\n\nComing off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact.\n\nSteven Soderbergh’s “Presence,” a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with USD3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just USD2 million.\n\nThe top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa: The Lion King,” in its sixth weekend of release, scored USD8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed USD626.7 million globally.\n\n“One of Them Days,” the Keke Palmer and SZA led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32 per cent with USD8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at US and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/mel-gibsons-flight-risk-is-no-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AP25021681716126-2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 01:00:54","author":"Borneo Bulletin Ap Video","authors":["Borneo Bulletin Ap Video"],"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.232},{"id":284192190,"title":"CIA says Covid ‘more likely’ to have leaked from lab","text":"WASHINGTON: The Central Intelligence Agency has shifted its official stance on the origin of Covid-19, saying Saturday that the virus was “more likely” leaked from a Chinese lab than transmitted by animals.\n\nThe new assessment came after John Ratcliffe was confirmed Thursday as the CIA director under the second White House administration of Donald Trump.\n\nRatcliffe, who served as the director of national intelligence from 2020-2021 during Trump’s first term, said in an interview published Friday that a “day-one” priority would be making an assessment on Covid’s origins.\n\n“The agency is going to get off the sidelines,” Ratcliffe — who believes Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology — told right-wing outlet Breitbart.\n\n“CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting,” a CIA spokesperson said in a statement Saturday.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The Central Intelligence Agency has shifted its official stance on the origin of Covid-19, saying Saturday that the virus was “more likely” leaked from a Chinese lab than transmitted by animals.\n\n\n\nThe new assessment came after John Ratcliffe was confirmed Thursday as the CIA director under the second White House administration of Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nRatcliffe, who served as the director of national intelligence from 2020-2021 during Trump’s first term, said in an interview published Friday that a “day-one” priority would be making an assessment on Covid’s origins.\n\n\n\n“The agency is going to get off the sidelines,” Ratcliffe — who believes Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology — told right-wing outlet Breitbart.\n\n\n\n“CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting,” a CIA spokesperson said in a statement Saturday.","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40344793/cia-says-covid-more-likely-to-have-leaked-from-lab","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/01/6796c303d49c5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:50:28","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":284192180,"title":"Colombia to block US deportation flights amid growing LatAm pushback","text":"BOGOTÁ: Colombia’s president vowed Sunday to block US deportation flights until migrants were guaranteed “dignified treatment,” escalating a row between Washington and left-wing Latin American governments over US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\n“The United States cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals.

After returning to office on Monday, he renewed his attacks on the US central bank.\n\n“I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately,” the real estate mogul-turned president said Thursday, later adding that he would “put in a strong statement” if the Fed — led by chair Jerome Powell — did not listen to his views. \n\n“I think I know interest rates much better than they do,” he added. “And I think I know certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision.”\n\nTrump’s public criticism of the Fed and Powell — whom he first nominated to run the US central bank — is unusual, and runs counter to the policy pursued by most recent presidents of avoiding public criticism of the institution and its policymakers while in office.\n\n“The Fed will not front-run any policies by the new administration,” Swonk from KPMG said of the bank’s upcoming rate decision. “They will wait and see how they play out and how they actually affect the economy.”\n\nThe Fed’s expected pause comes against the backdrop of a small uptick in inflation, with a relatively robust labor market and strong economic growth. \n\nIn December, Fed policymakers dialed back the number of rate cuts they expect in 2025 to a median of just two, with some incorporating assumptions about Trump’s likely economic policies into their forecasts, according to minutes of the meeting.","summary":"WASHINGTON: The US Federal Reserve is expected to announce a pause in rate cuts on Wednesday, as policymakers look to continue tackling inflation under close and vocal scrutiny from President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nThe Fed cut its key lending rate by a full percentage point in the last four months of 2024 and indicated it would move more cautiously going forward amid an uptick in inflation away from its long-term target of two percent. \n\n\n\n“I think they will do nothing, and I think they should do nothing,” Jim Bullard, the long-serving former president of the St. Louis Fed, told AFP. “I think the committee’s in very good shape right now.”\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s challenge this week is how to pause and communicate a data-dependent approach to future cuts without drawing the ire of the commander-in-chief, who has expressed his desire for rates to come down. \n\n\n\n“The goal will be to make as least amount of news as possible as they pause, which is well televised,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk said in an interview. \n\n\n\nFinanci","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40344724/fed-prepares-to-pause-in-first-rate-decision-since-trumps-inauguration","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/01/6796b0c51b994.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:50:26","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.172},{"id":284190876,"title":"Does TikTok have a US buyer? Trump advises on new bid which could give government 50% stake","text":"A company interested in aquiring TikTok has submitted a second proposal after feedback from the Trump administration.\n\nThe proposal, by Perplexity AI, would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50 percent of the new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.\n\nThe first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.\n\nThe new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.\n\nIf the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.\n\nByteDance and TikTok did not immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nUnder the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.\n\nUnder the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.\n\nThe proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures — that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.\n\n\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"\n\nThe Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. President Donald Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.\n\nOn a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite a report that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.\n\n\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary...I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"\n\nUnder a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nTrump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Trump said he would postpone the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.\n\nCongress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.\n\nHowever, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.","summary":"The future of TikTok is still up in the air despite Trump’s intervention last week","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tiktok-us-bid-perplexity-ai-trump-b2686721.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/21/14/17-0692cdc8e46f4968ae26b9bf1f5d6d33.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wV2GCMr1-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:46:56","author":"Associated Press Reporters","authors":["Associated Press Reporters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":284192490,"title":"Florida special session includes immigration and petition bills being filed","text":"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – On the eve of a special legislative session called by Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican lawmakers Sunday filed a flurry of bills to crack down on undocumented immigrants and place additional restrictions on the ballot initiative process.\n\nThe bills, in part, would end in-state tuition at colleges and universities for undocumented-immigrant students known as dreamers; place new requirements on police to help with immigration-enforcement efforts; and dramatically change the petition process for proposed constitutional amendments.\n\nSen. Blaise Ingoglia, R-Spring Hill, Sen. Jonathan Martin, R-Fort Myers, and Sen. Jay Collins, R-Tampa, had filed 11 bills as of late Sunday afternoon, according to the Senate website. Rep. Mike Caruso, R-Delray Beach, and Rep. John Temple, R-Wildwood, had filed House versions that largely mirrored the Senate bills.\n\nDeSantis on Jan. 13 called the special session because he wants lawmakers to make changes to help carry out President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Other issues DeSantis wants lawmakers to take up include making changes in the ballot-initiative process, providing aid to hurricane victims and addressing issues that have increased costs for condominium associations and residents.\n\nThe special session, however, has been surrounded by uncertainty because Senate President Ben Albritton, R-Wauchula, and House Speaker Daniel Perez, R-Miami, raised objections. Among other things, they said the special session was “premature” and pointed to the March 4 start of the regular legislative session.\n\nDeSantis, however, has made a series of appearances to try to pressure lawmakers into acting on the issues — particularly focusing on immigration issues.\n\nWhile the bills were filed Sunday, it remained unclear how the special session would play out. The Senate and House are scheduled to convene at 10:30 a.m. Monday, but neither had scheduled committee meetings as of Sunday afternoon to consider the proposals.\n\nAmong the proposals:\n\n— Martin and Temple filed bills (SB 20-A and HB 19A) that would repeal a 2014 law that allows undocumented-immigrant students to avoid higher out-of-state tuition rates if they meet certain criteria. Albritton has suggested phasing out the law, taking into account students who already receive the tuition benefit or who are making plans to attend colleges or universities at the cheaper in-state rates.\n\n— Ingoglia and Caruso filed bills (SB 4-A and HB 9A) that say law enforcement agencies in the state “shall” support enforcement of federal immigration laws. Currently, a state law says agencies shall “use best efforts” to support such enforcement. Also, under the bills, when counties receive notice that jail inmates have immigration detainers, they would be required to transport the inmates to federal facilities or to federal officials.\n\n— Ingoglia and Caruso filed bills (SB 14-A and HB 11A) that would require state and county law-enforcement agencies and other police agencies with more than 25 officers to enter agreements with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement to participate in a program that authorizes local officers to perform certain duties of federal immigration agents. The bills also would give the governor authority to suspend the head of a law-enforcement agency “who, in the judgment of the governor, acts in bad faith and fails to comply with any provision” of the bill.\n\n— Collins and Caruso filed bills (SB 18-A and HB 21A) that would overhaul the ballot-initiative process, including what appears to be elimination of the use of paid petition gatherers to collect signatures. Voters could request petition forms to be mailed to them by supervisors of elections; they could then mail back signed petitions. The proposals come after DeSantis led efforts to defeat ballot proposals in November that would have enshrined abortion rights in the state Constitution and allowed recreational use of marijuana.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. – On the eve of a special legislative session called&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Florida special session includes immigration and petition bills being filed first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/florida-special-session-includes-immigration-and-petition-bills-being-filed/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Immigration-petition-bills-filed-for-Florida-special.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:38:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":284188276,"title":"Xiomara convoca a reunión de la CELAC para tratar crisis diplomática de Colombia y EEUU","text":"La presidenta de Honduras y titular pro tempore de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac), Xiomara Castro, convocó este domingo a una reunión «urgente» de presidentes y jefes de Estado del organismo regional el próximo día 30 para tratar entre otros el tema migratorio, tras suscitarse este dominglo una crisis diplomátca sobre Colombia y Estados Unidos a raíz de las deportaciones de inmigrantes en el país norteamericano.\n\n«Como presidenta pro tempore (PPT) de la Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños (Celac), convoco con carácter urgente a una reunión de presidente y jefes de Estado, próximo jueves 30 de enero a las 11:00 a.m. (hora de Honduras, 17:00 GMT)», indicó Castro en un mensaje difundido en la red social X.\n\nAgregó que los puntos de agenda a tratar son «migración, medioambiente y unidad latinoamericana y caribeña».\n\nLa convocatoria la hizo Castro pocas horas después de una petición que en ese sentido le hizo el presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, tras su rechazo a la entrada a su país de aviones con ciudadanos colombianos deportados por Estados Unidos, si estos no reciben un trato digno.\n\nCastro indicó que la reunión «se ha programado en formato híbrido» y que Petro «ha confirmado su participación de manera presencial en Tegucigalpa».\n\nEsta convocatoria a una cumbre de la Celac, que integran más de treinta países de la región, tiene lugar despues de que el presidente Gustavo Pedro dijera este domingo que «los Estados Unidos no pueden tratar como delincuentes a los migrantes colombianos».\n\n«Desautorizo la entrada de aviones norteamericanos con migrantes colombianos a nuestro territorio.

Sharpton said in a post on X. \n\nSharpton revealed in a speech outside the store that he'd bought 100 $25 gift vouchers for each buy in participant to spend inside. \n\n'We’re going shopping at Costco because they’ve stood with us. People that stand with us, we will stand with them,' he said. \n\nBut the move has been sharply criticized online due to Sharpton's divisive reputation. Some critics called his involvement as the 'kiss of death' for Costco.\n\n'Al Sharpton? Kiss of death for Costco,' one said.\n\n'As a life long customer when Rev Al Sharpton is using you as Liberal Party tool I am done with you. Sharpton is the kiss of death,' another added.\n\nOthers said they would now boycott the retailer - such as the infamous boycott of Bud Light after their partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney - due to their disappointment in Costco aligning itself with Sharpton.\n\nIt is unclear if Costco had any knowledge of Sharpton's plans. \n\n'I wonder how much they love Al Sharpton now that they’re getting bud lighted. I’m cancelling my memberships auto renewal this week and won’t be shopping there again,' one critic said.\n\n'If Al Sharpton shows up, you’re most definitely on the wrong side of history,' another said, while a third described him as a 'chaos agent.'\n\nSharpton was slammed for accepting a $500,000 payment from Kamala Harris' team during the presidential election campaign just weeks before a gushing interview with her which aired on MSNBC.\n\nHarris' campaign allegedly gave two $250,000 payments to Sharpton's National Action Network on September 5 and October 1.\n\nAnd on October 20, Sharpton's went on to praise Harris' 'extraordinary historic campaign' in a gushing interview, and branded Donald Trump 'hostile and erratic.'\n\nMSNBC has stayed silent over the payment, despite suspending Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough in 2010 for making $4,000 in campaign donations.\n\nAt the company's annual meeting last week, they voted against a proposal from a conservative activist group that challenged diversity, equity and inclusion policies at Costco.\n\nThe vote was seen as an early test of investor views about the value of corporate DEI programs, which many companies added or beefed up starting in 2020 amid the Black Lives Matter movement. \n\nMore than 98 percent of the shareholders voted against examining DEI policies on Thursday. \n\nAhead of the vote, retail expert Neil Saunders told DailyMail.com that Costco takes the view that its various programs have helped it to build a strong business.\n\n'Given the positive results over recent years it is impossible to argue that Costco management doesn't know what it's doing,' Saunders, of Global Data, said. \n\n'There is an element of them saying leave us to get on with the job. While some customers might dislike the policy, I doubt many will defect as it is not something that is visible or that directly impacts shoppers.'\n\nIt comes after major companies such as Walmart, Ford, John Deere, and Tractor Supply bowed to pressure and rowed back on their DEI commitments. \n\nIn July, John Deere made a huge U-turn on its DEI practices in the face of opposition and a damaging boycott from farmers and conservatives. \n\nThe company said in a statement it would drop 'socially motivated messaging' and 'diversity quotas and pronoun identification' and distance itself from 'cultural awareness parades.'\n\nThe $61 billion-a-year firm had come under fire over sponsoring a Pride event for children as young as three and other DEI efforts, even as it shuttered plants and sacked American workers.","summary":"The retail giant and its shareholders defied President Donald Trump and conservative activists by sticking to their DEI policies last week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14327865/costco-al-sharpton-dei-stunt-slammed.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/26/23/94541877-0-image-a-15_1737934626611.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:34:52","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":284188992,"title":"Ex-Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin slams paper, accuses journalists of enabling ‘authoritarian regime’","text":"Former Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin joined MSNBC on Saturday and lambasted her former employer, accusing the Washington Post of trying to “ingratiate” themselves with President Donald Trump.\n\n“They seem to think that their own press outlet should be muzzled, should be quieted, should not upset Donald Trump so much.

The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures — that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.On a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite a report that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.","summary":"Perplexity is seeking to create a new $300-billion public company with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/perplexity-ai-tiktok-merger-proposal/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/01/27/f747ea72-511f-4fde-a880-63b84748567a/thumbnail/1200x630/542a1b1090caa3776dd6b1c3cc007489/gettyimages-2194263189.jpg?v=e306e7b9fefc168c00baa623d76d1eaf","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3483299_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:33:50","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":284192454,"title":"US, Colombia clash over deportations and raise tariffs in show of Trump’s pledge to limit migration","text":"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The United States and Colombia, long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a show of what countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump and Gustavo Petro, in a series of social media posts, defended their views on migration, with the latter accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation and announcing a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nEarlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by Petro’s decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants.\n\nTrump said the measures were necessary because Petro’s decision “jeopardized” national security in the U.S.\n\n“These measures are just the beginning,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, Petro said his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.\n\n“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants… In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.”\n\nAfter Trump’s announcement, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.”\n\nColombia has traditionally been the U.S.’s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia’s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S.\n\nColombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.\n\nColombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.\n\nThe U.S. government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.\n\n“This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,” a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement said Petro “canceled his authorization” for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.\n\nNo official order had been issued as of Sunday afternoon that would allow for the implementation of the measures Trump announced.\n\nA State Department spokesperson confirmed to AP the agency suspended processing visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia’s capital, Bogota, “in direct response to President Petro’s decision to not accept repatriation flights of Colombian citizens.”\n\nColombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans.\n\nMexico hasn’t imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, as they have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.\n\nPetro’s government in a statement later announced that the South American country’s presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them “dignified conditions.”\n\nAs part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.\n\nTwo U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.\n\nIn announcing what he called “urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,” Trump explained that he ordered the tariffs and “A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations” on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters.\n\n“All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,” Trump wrote will be subject to “Visa Sanctions.” He did not say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions.\n\nTrump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.\n\nTrump’s actions would seem to undercut his goal to reduce his country’s trade deficit. Unlike Mexico or China, Colombia is one of the few countries with a trade deficit with the U.S., of around $1.4 billion, according to U.S. trade data.\n\nColombia is the U.S.’s second biggest buyer of corn and corn feed, according to the U.S. grains council, helping boost U.S. commodity exports from farm belt states like Iowa, Indiana and Nebraska to more than $733 million last year.\n\nThe U.S. export boom has been driven by a two-decade-old free trade agreement between the two countries, which have for long been close partners in the war on drugs. It is unclear if Trump’s tariffs are allowed under the agreement, which contains a dispute mechanism to resolve trade fights.\n\nColombia is the U.S.’s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.’ dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.’s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.\n\nRegina Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.

mediators resolved disagreements over fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon late on Sunday, after clashes involving the Israeli military and civilians threatened to undermine both accords.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced Hamas would be releasing three hostages in Gaza on Thursday, including Arbel Yehud, resolving the first major crisis of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which took effect one week ago.\n\nIn return, Israel will allow displaced Palestinians in Gaza to return to their homes in the north of the shattered territory starting on Monday.\n\nThe issue of Yehud’s release had strained the US-brokered truce between Israel and Hamas despite the release on Saturday of four female Israeli soldiers from Gaza, and 200 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.\n\nIsraeli officials claimed Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, had violated the agreement when it released the soldiers before Yehud, who is the last civilian female hostage still believed to be alive in Gaza.\n\nIsrael retaliated by delaying its withdrawal from the strategic Netzarim corridor, which bisects north and south Gaza, blocking hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from crossing back into the northern part of the territory, as stipulated in the accord.\n\nOver the weekend masses of Palestinians congregated near the corridor, with some families sleeping outside in the winter cold.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had fired “warning shots at several gatherings of dozens of suspects who were advancing toward the troops and posed a threat to them”.\n\nHealth authorities in Gaza said two people were killed and nine others injured in the clashes on Sunday.\n\nUS, Qatari and Egyptian mediators were able to resolve the crisis by effectively securing an additional hostage release this Thursday, including Yehud.\n\nThe weekly hostage release that is set to take place next Saturday will move ahead as planned, with three more Israelis expected to be freed, according to Israeli officials.\n\nIn return, several hundred Palestinian prisoners will also be released from Israeli jails.\n\nHamas on Sunday provided Israel with a list of the remaining hostages in captivity and set to be released as part of the initial six week ceasefire, detailing whether they were alive or dead.\n\nThe war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, during which fighters from the group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.\n\nIsrael responded with an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 47,000 people and fuelled a humanitarian catastrophe in the territory.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has urged Egypt and Jordan to take in most of the population of Gaza, saying it was time to “clean out” the territory, but his proposal was rejected by the two Arab countries.\n\nMeanwhile Trump’s administration announced that the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon, reached last November through American mediation, would be extended until February 18.\n\nThe accord halted more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hizbollah, the Lebanese militant group that was attacking the Jewish state in solidarity with Hamas.\n\nIsrael made clear last week it would not meet the two-month deadline of Sunday for the withdrawal of its military from southern Lebanon.\n\nIsrael has claimed the Lebanese army’s deployments in areas vacated by both its troops and Hizbollah fighters had been too slow to meet the deadline.\n\nWith Israeli forces still holding territory inside Lebanon, hundreds of residents came under Israeli fire as they attempted to return on foot to their villages.\n\nAccording to Lebanon’s health ministry, 22 people were killed and 124 injured on Sunday.","summary":"Gazans

The US is Colombia’s largest trading partner, with exports including crude petroleum, coffee and cut flowers.\n\nThe back-and-forth between the two leaders depicted the rising tensions between central and south US governments and Washington over US deportation flights. Mexico had also reportedly refused to receive a similar flight on Saturday, according to US officials cited by Reuters and NBC News.\n\nIn an early Sunday post on Twitter/X, Colombia’s leftist leader wrote: “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that every human being deserves.\n\n“That is why I ordered the return of US military planes carrying Colombian migrants,” Petro wrote, sharing a video of Brazilian deportees who had been flown out of the US on Friday, shackled at the wrists and ankles.\n\nHe added: “I cannot force migrants to remain in a country that does not want them. But if that country returns them, it must be with dignity and respect – for both them and our nation. In civilian planes, and without treating them like criminals, we will welcome our compatriots. Colombia deserves respect,” wrote the president.\n\nSecretary of state Marco Rubio issued a statement accusing the Colombian leader of revoking the flights’ authorizations. “Colombian President Petro had authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air,” the statement read.\n\n“President Trump has made it clear that under his administration, America will no longer be lied to nor taken advantage of.”\n\nIn an earlier post, Petro had already written: “The US must establish a protocol for the dignified treatment of migrants before we accept their return.”\n\nPetro’s office said in an earlier statement that the presidential plane would be made available to transport the migrants who had been scheduled to arrive on the military planes.\n\nPetro’s comments add to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as the US president’s week-old administration starts mobilizing for mass deportations.\n\nA flight carrying 88 deported Brazilians landed in Brazil, but not without triggering the first diplomatic clash between Trump’s new administration and Brazil’s leftist president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\n\nThe flight, which left Alexandria, Louisiana, on Friday, was destined for Belo Horizonte in south-eastern Brazil. However, due to technical issues, it made unscheduled stops in Panama, and Manaus in northern Brazil.\n\nUS officials reportedly sought to continue the journey, but the Brazilian government intervened, dispatching an air force aircraft to complete the final leg without handcuffs and leg irons. The deportees arrived in Belo Horizonte at about 9pm on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, Brazil’s ministry of foreign affairs announced it would file a formal “request for clarification” with the US government over the “degrading treatment” of the deportees – including six children, who reportedly were not shackled.\n\nSuch deportation flights have been ongoing since the first Trump administration signed an agreement with Brazil in 2017. Last year alone, 17 flights transported deportees from Alexandria to Belo Horizonte.\n\nHowever, the Brazilian government claims that the use of handcuffs and leg irons “violates the terms of the agreement with the US, which requires the dignified, respectful, and humane treatment of deportees”.\n\nDeportees told Brazilian media upon their arrival that they were assaulted and threatened by US agents during the flight.\n\nAn internal Department of Homeland Security memo obtained by the New York Times revealed that the Trump administration is rolling out a new series of stringent measures to expedite deportations. The directive grants Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers sweeping authority to fast-track removals.\n\nOfficials from the US state department, Pentagon, US Department of Homeland Security and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe use of US military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagon’s response to Trump’s national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday.\n\nIn the past, US military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nThis has been the first time in recent memory that US military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one US official said.","summary":"Trump had called for ‘retaliatory measures’ including 50% tariffs on Colombia after Gustavo Petro blocked two aircraft\n\nColombian president Gustavo Petro blocked two US military aircraft carrying deported Colombians from landing in his country, prompting a feud with Donald Trump who enacted emergency tariffs and other retaliatory measures.\n\nThe US president responded fiercely in a post on his Truth Social network when he was informed that two repatriation flights from the US to Colombia had been denied landing clearance.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/colombia-gustavo-petro-trump-deportation-flights","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7bb5a63f50b4b6227be0cbef7e4f9fcfb34ce12/0_17_4530_2719/master/4530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:11:31","author":"Edward Helmore,Tiago Rogero","authors":["Edward Helmore","Tiago Rogero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":284189120,"title":"Trump suggests ‘cleaning out’ Gaza","text":"US President Donald Trump has suggested that neighboring Arab countries should take in Palestinian refugees and “clean out” the embattled Gaza Strip.\n\nSpeaking to journalists aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump said that he spoke to King Abdullah II of Jordan over the war and was planning to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Sunday.\n\n“I’d like Egypt to take people, and I’d like Jordan to take people,” Trump said. “You’re talking about probably a million and a half people, we just clean out that whole thing. It’s a real mess.”\n\n“It’s literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything’s demolished, and people are dying there,” he added. “So, I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change,” Trump told reporters.\n\nBoth Egypt and Jordan have rejected the idea of displacing Palestinians from Gaza. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi affirmed on Sunday that the kingdom’s position against displacing Palestinians remains “irreversible and unchanged.” On Sunday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry also stressed its commitment to defending the rights of Palestinians and the opposition to uprooting Gaza’s population.\n\nAround 1.9 million people – more than 90% of Gaza’s population – have been displaced since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out in October 2023, according to the UN.\n\nAlthough the sides agreed to a ceasefire on January 15, Israel has since accused Hamas of violating a prisoner swap arrangement and halted the return of Gazans to their home in the northern part of the enclave. Both sides have also accused each other of ceasefire violations.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas handed over four female Israeli soldiers in exchange for the release of 200 Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli government has said that Hamas had initially promised to release a different hostage.\n\nHamas took around 250 hostages and killed some 1,200 people during its surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. More than 47,00 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, according to the local authorities.","summary":"Donald Trump has proposed relocating Gaza’s population to neighboring Arab states \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/611677-trump-clean-out-gaza/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/6796c9ee85f540355423ad2e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:09:52","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":284188998,"title":"Only a trip to the hospital could have kept me from Donald Trump’s inauguration","text":"A cold shoulder for hosps\n\nWinter vacations.

How can you write a report about what happened in Alberta without Deena Hinshaw,” asked Conway.\n\n“Some of the key decision makers, who are not in government, but apparently even within government, wouldn’t talk to the task force because I think they felt — and rightly so — that the deck was already stacked against them,” said Mount Royal University Political Science Professor, Dr. Duane Bratt.\n\n“I think that’s what’s happened here. Like it was a group of people who are selected, who are already known in the public domain to have extreme or fringe views about things like vaccination and about things like, you know, restrictions, public health restrictions,” said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Alberta.\n\nThe report is 269-pages long and contains a long list of grievances over the province’s pandemic response.\n\nAmong the reports findings and recommendations:\n\nIt says Alberta should refrain from future mask mandates for respiratory illnesses because, “there is no benefit for masking asymptomatic individuals,” and cites potential harms of masking, such as self-contamination, discomfort, and a false sense of security”;It criticizes the use of lockdowns to control the spread of the disease saying “the stringency of NPIs (non pharmaceutical measures) had a small relative effect on the growth of infections”;It says rapid tests with reasonable accuracy should not be used for screening the general population and “future pandemic responses should prioritize minimizing severe disease and mortality over extensive case detection,”It promotes herd-immunity or “infection-acquired immunity” that it says is “poorly understood” — nothing that during the Athenian plague of 430 B.C. recovered individuals “were never attacked the same way twice – never at least fatally.”It says there needs to be more protection of physician’s right to prescribe and a pharmacist’s ability to promote alternative treatments such as Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine, that, in their professional judgement — are in a patient’s best interest; and,It recommends the Alberta government immediately halt the use of all COVID-19 vaccines without full disclosure to patients regarding both the safety and efficacy issues by their physician, saying based on evidence that has emerged to date — most of which was supplied by the vaccine manufacturers — it “cannot be concluded that these COVID-19 vaccines are safe.”\n\n“This is completely dangerous,” said Dr. Conway. “It speaks of the fact that we neglected natural immunity — hybrid immunity. We did not. This was part of the messaging from very early on. It speaks of the vaccine being ineffective. It’s highly effective. Before the clinical trials initial trials report published, we had stated that 50 per cent efficacy in these trials would be something very important — but it was over 80 per cent.\n\n“It’s taking a lot of pieces of information completely out of context,” said Conway. “So it’s surprising to me that a document of this type might make it to to the Premier’s office and receive any credibility.”\n\nDr. Saxinger describes the report as an attempt to “rewrite history.”\n\n“I have one colleague actually who was on our scientific advisory group who is listed as a contributor who actually asked his name to be withdrawn.”\n\n“If you take it at face value, it would make you really question everything that happened in the pandemic, and I don’t think people should have to do that,” added Saxinger. “If you assume that the outcome of these recommendations would be kind of more of a U.S. style approach — there would have been, you know, 15,000 deaths in Alberta — and that’s a lot more than we actually saw.”\n\nSpeaking on an Alberta podcast on Friday, the Chair of the Task Force, Dr. Davidson defended the panel’s research methods saying “there’s no such thing as consensus in science — that makes no sense — science is about questioning everything, experimenting and improving whether its true of not… that’s science.”\n\nIn a statement to Global News, the office of Alberta’s Health Minister, Adriana LaGrange, said the “Alberta government will review and consider this report and its findings, however, no policy decisions have been made in relation to it at this time.”","summary":"The Alberta government has quietly released the report of a government-appointed task force reviewing the province's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10978373/potentially-dangerous-health-experts-call-alberta-covid-report-an-attempt-to-rewrite-history/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/covid-report.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-27 00:00:24","author":"Ken MacGillivray","authors":["Ken MacGillivray"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":284185674,"title":"Latest on TikTok bid could involve 50% government stake","text":"Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok’s parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok’s parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.\n\nThe first proposal, which ByteDance hasn’t responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business and include investments from other investors.\n\nThe new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity’s proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.\n\nIf the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company’s board.\n\nByteDance and TikTok did not immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nUnder the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a “full U.S. board control,” the person said.\n\nUnder the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok’s U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.\n\nThe proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during Trump’s first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures — that a new investor in TikTok could simply “dilute down” the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.\n\n“But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,” he added. “It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There’s absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.”\n\nThe Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. President Donald Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.\n\nOn a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Trump also said he hadn’t discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite a report that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok’s global operation.\n\n“Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,” Trump said. “We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I’d only do it if the United States benefits.”\n\nUnder a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nTrump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives “right down the road” from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, “I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I’ve spoken to many people about TikTok and there’s great interest in TikTok.”\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Trump said he would postpone the ban. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year’s presidential election.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump’s inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who’ve been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.\n\nCongress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok’s ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.\n\nHowever, to date, the U.S. hasn’t provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.\n\nHadero reported from South Bend, Indiana.","summary":"Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok’s parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok’s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The left predictably accused Musk of offering a ‘Nazi salute’ to Trump supporters.\n\n‘Stop with the faux outrage you disingenuous clod,’ wrote social media profile Jayroo on X. ‘What a dangerous and destructive narrative you try to spin,’ wrote 1stInspect on X. ‘You know that is not what was going on with Elon. Try to be more constructive and bring unity not division. This is why you are not liked FYI.’ Ocasio-Cortez doubled down on her criticism on a video posted to her Instagram account.\n\n‘I don’t care what Elon Musk is doing behind a presidential seal. In this country we hate Nazis, kind of a foundational defining thing,’ she said, adding, ‘We beat the confederates and we beat the Nazis.’ ‘I still am not rocking with anyone sympathetic to Nazis and I’ll do that until I’m six feet under the ground,’ she said. She excoriated people for ‘defending’ acts such as ‘Nazi salutes’ instead of condemning them.\n\n‘I’m not with the Nazis. How ’bout that?’ she concluded. Others on social media share videos of AOC repeatedly thrusting out her arm at an angle during a political rally, accusing her of doing the same thing. ‘AOC is literally Hitler. I’m shaking,’ wrote social media user Sara Rose on X sarcastically. Ocasio-Cortez has tried to rally disappointed leftists after President Donald Trump’s reelection and inauguration.\n\nShe condemned Trump for allowing billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos to enjoy prominent seats at the inauguration while other elected officials were ‘kicked to the curb.’ ‘They were unelected billionaires,’ she said. ‘That pretty much is the story of the Trump administration in a nutshell, you’re getting ripped off.’\n\nOcasio-Cortez pushed back against Trump’s attempt to sign an executive order doing away with birthright citizenship, arguing it was unconstitutional. ‘We don’t have to listen to him. We don’t have to treat this seriously, this is a joke,’ she said.\n\n‘Don’t let these people’s [expletive] get you down,’ she concluded. She also lashed out at the conservative activist ‘LibsOfTikTok’ for criticizing her for describing Trump as a rapist. ‘[Expletive]. Cry more,’ she said.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

She specifically asked whether he stood by his past comments that the U.S. should not \"abandon anybody who's been properly vetted.\" \"Well, Margaret, I don't agree that all these immigrants, or all these refugees have been properly vetted,\" Vance said. \"In fact, we know that there are cases of people who allegedly were properly vetted and then were literally planning terrorist attacks in our country. That happened during the campaign, if you may remember. So, clearly, not all of these foreign nationals have been properly vetted.\" VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE REVEALS BIG TECH 'VERY MUCH ON NOTICE' AFTER CEO'S INAUGURAL DONATIONS Brennan pressed Vance on whether he stands by his comments while tens of thousands of Afghan refugees’ resettlement processes remain in limbo due to the executive order. Vance responded, \"My primary concern as the vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people…\" \"So, no,\" Brennan said. \"…And now that we know that we have vetting problems with a lot of these refugee programs, we absolutely cannot unleash thousands of unvetted people into our country.

Vance referenced a recent example of an Afghan national in Oklahoma who was accused of planning a terrorist attack in October. He originally came to the country in Sept. 2021 after the United States withdrawal from Afghanistan and went through multiple vetting processes. \"I don't want my children to share a neighborhood with people who are not properly vetted.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has ordered a 25 percent increase in import tariffs on US goods, retaliating against a similar move by President Donald Trump. The tariffs fight began when Petro rejected two US military flights carrying migrants to Colombia, citing concerns over their treatment. Trump responded by announcing tariffs, visa restrictions, and other retaliatory measures against Colombia.According to Trump, the rejection of the flights \"jeopardised\" national security in the US. He also stated that Colombia has a legal obligation to accept repatriation flights.Colombia has accepted 475 deportation flights from the US between 2020 and 2024. However, Petro has insisted that migrants must be treated with dignity and not as criminals.The trade dispute may impact various US industries, including oil, coffee, and flower imports. Colombia is the US' fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil and the largest supplier of fresh-cut flowers.Petro in a post on X said he had ordered Colombia's “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the US by 25%.” US President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was ordering tariffs, visa restrictions and other retaliatory measures to be taken against Colombia after its government rejected two US military flights carrying migrants.Trump said the measures were necessary because the decision of Colombian President Gustavo Petro “jeopardized” national security in the US.“These measures are just the beginning,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States,” the US President stated. Earlier Sunday, Petro said his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the US until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. “A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. He said, “That is why I returned the US military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.\" Notably, Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the United States from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.","summary":"Colombia Imposes 25% Tariff On US Goods In Response To Trump&#39;s Restrictions As Trade War Escalates","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/colombia-imposes-25-tariff-on-us-goods-in-response-to-trump-s-restrictions-as-trade-war-escalates","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/colombia-imposes-25-tariff-on-us-goods-in-response-to-trump-s-restrictions-as-trade-war-escalates-1737935611921-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 23:53:38","author":"Digital Desk","authors":["Digital Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.061},{"id":284185058,"title":"Israeli hostage’s mother believed Hamas played a cruel game with her son’s fake death, now relieved that he’s alive","text":"The mother of a hostage whose death Hamas faked said she always believed it was a ‘cruel game’ by the terror group after she returned alive on Saturday.\n\nDaniella Gilboa, 20, was reported as having been killed in an Israeli airstrike by the extremists as they published an image of her in a white funeral kafan.\n\nBut she walked out of Gaza smiling alongside fellow IDF observers Naama Levy, 20, Liri Albag, 19, and Karina Ariev, 20, at the weekend.\n\nHer mother Orly, 53, thanked Israelis for ‘being there with us, right beside us, even when it seemed like she had suffered the worst possible fate’.\n\n‘You, like us, believed that Daniella was ok, that it was just a cruel mind game that Hamas was playing against us, and now it’s our turn to keep praying for everyone,’ she said.\n\nMrs Gilboa revealed that Daniella had seen them fighting for her on television in captivity and knew they had changed her name from Danielle after a Rabbi said it would give her ‘spiritual protection’.\n\nShe said in a statement at a press conference for the relatives of the freed hostages: ‘My daughter returned thin and pale and she suffered in captivity.\n\n‘But she is still the same wonderful and talented girl she had been when they kidnapped her from us.’\n\nMrs Gilboa thanked Donald Trump ‘for everything you are doing for our hostages’ before she joined other relatives to give a thumbs up – a nod to the defiant pose the four girls gave in Gaza.\n\nLiri’s parents and sisters also made a love heart to the camera, after she made the symbol after being freed. Her father, Eli, told journalists he ‘hates’ all those in Israel who had opposed the hostage deal.\n\nRelatives of the youngest female hostages released on Saturday said they ‘have new images to hold in our minds and hearts’ now they are free.\n\nNaama Levy, Karina Ariev, Liri Albag and Daniella Gilboa returned after 477 days in captivity and now face an ‘emotionally and medically complex’ road to recovery.\n\nDaniella, 20, still has a bullet in her leg after she was shot on October 7, 2023, while there are fears for their vision after some spent 15 months in tunnels underground.\n\nBut doctors said the 19 and 20-year-olds are ‘stable’ and ‘better than we thought’ as they put in place ‘tailored’ programmes to nurse them back to health.\n\nThe four unarmed border observers were captured at Nahal Oz base and horrific images of their battered and bloodied faces went around the world following a powerful report by the Mail.\n\nOne of the most sickening images from that day showed Naama being dragged by the hair in bloodied pyjamas as she was thrown in a truck and taken to Gaza.\n\nBut the young women survived against the odds following an extraordinary campaign by their mothers and emotional images showed them being reunited at the weekend.\n\nIt comes as British hostage Emily Damari, 28, was discharged from hospital today a week after she was freed alongside Romi Gonen, 24, and Doron Steinbrecher, 31.\n\nNaama’s relative Marissa Shemi said: ‘Everyone knew Naama from the very beginning of the nightmare that we have all been enduring for the last 477 days.\n\n‘But now we have new images to hold in our minds and hearts – the images of Naama reunited with her family.’\n\nFootage from the day showed Liri making heart signs with her hands and writing a message in a helicopter saying: ‘I love you.’\n\nOther released hostages described her as a ‘leader’ in the group with a great sense of humour.\n\nHer aunt, Ruhama Albag, said yesterday: ‘Liri has personality and that does not change. I was not surprised to see her write Liri Albag number one and her wave out the window.\n\n‘But I was shocked at her energy. I guess this does not go away. She is a special child and we have never doubted her inner strength.\n\n‘She is home now and will be in full control of her life. She has a strong family and wonderful parents and in time things will work out and become clear.’\n\nDaniella, who Hamas cruelly claimed had been killed in an Israeli airstrike two months ago, is also said to be recovering well despite being shot on October 7.\n\nHer auntie, Etti Schwartz, said: ‘She still has a bullet in her leg, which hasn’t been removed yet. You could see it in the video of her capture when she hopped on one foot.’\n\nDescribing their conditions in captivity, she added: ”I cannot share much, but I was told she ate a pita or two a day, until their stomachs swelled.\n\n‘Sometimes they would cook, but wouldn’t eat. She was in a tunnel, in the dark, but they were together; that’s the luck.’\n\nDr Michal Steinman, director of nursing at Beilinson and Sharon Hospitals, who is leading their treatment, said they are ‘better than we thought.’\n\n‘Everything is treatable physically but mentally there is still a way to go and it is too soon to say.’\n\nShe told how they have had to ‘write the textbook’ on hostage treatment as nothing prepared them for how to deal with those held for 15 months underground.\n\nThey are braced for them to have lost their vision and developed skin conditions and hearing difficulties after so long underground in cramped, squalid surroundings.\n\nMedics were also concerned Hamas may have drugged them. The four girls were seen smiling wildly as they were paraded in front of terrorists in a sickening handover ceremony.\n\nWhile it may have been euphoria at being freed, those released in the November 2023 deals reported being given narcotics to make them appear happy.\n\n‘As part of our medical protocols, when they came to hospital we conducted checks to see if they have been given some medication or toxins. We made those examinations, but I can’t give you more information.’\n\nOn the four girls’ general condition, she said: ‘They are still amazed from the fact that they have come from the darkness to the light and they can be with their mums.\n\n‘They can’t believe it has happened. So mentally we will have to wait a little bit until the euphoria falls down, it is too soon to say, but they are standing on their feet smiling.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe mother of a hostage whose death Hamas faked said she always&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Israeli hostage&#8217;s mother believed Hamas played a cruel game with her son&#8217;s fake death, now relieved that he&#8217;s alive first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/israeli-hostages-mother-believed-hamas-played-a-cruel-game-with-her-sons-fake-death-now-relieved-that-hes-alive/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/26/23/94538787-14327581-Daniella_Gilboa_20_was_reported_as_having_been_killed_in_an_Isra-a-13_1737934576388.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 23:49:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":284186362,"title":"US, Colombia clash over deportations and raise tariffs in show of Trump's pledge to limit migration","text":"The United States and Colombia, long close partners in anti-narcotics efforts, clashed Sunday over the deportation of migrants and imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a show of what countries could face if they intervene in the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nPresidents Donald Trump and Gustavo Petro, in a series of social media posts, defended their views on migration, with the latter accusing Trump of not treating immigrants with dignity during deportation and announcing a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tariffs on U.S. goods. \n\nEarlier, the U.S. president had ordered visa restrictions, 25% tariffs on all Colombian incoming goods, which would be raised to 50% in one week, and other retaliatory measures sparked by Petro's decision to reject two Colombia-bound U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants. \n\nTrump said the measures were necessary because Petro's decision “jeopardized” national security in the U.S.\n\n“These measures are just the beginning,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, Petro said his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.\n\n“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.\"\n\nAfter Trump's announcement, Petro said in a post on X that he had ordered the “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.”\n\nColombia has traditionally been the U.S.’s top ally in Latin America. But their relationship has strained since Petro, a former guerrilla, became Colombia’s first leftist president in 2022 and sought distance from the U.S. \n\nColombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. \n\nColombia is also among the countries that last year began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.\n\nThe U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.\n\n“This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,\" a senior administration official told AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss issue publicly.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement said Petro “canceled his authorization” for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.\n\nNo official order had been issued as of Sunday afternoon that would allow for the implementation of the measures Trump announced. \n\nA State Department spokesperson confirmed to AP the agency suspended processing visas at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia's capital, Bogota, “in direct response to President Petro’s decision to not accept repatriation flights of Colombian citizens.”\n\nColombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking though the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans.\n\nMexico hasn't imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, as they have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.\n\nPetro's government in a statement later announced that the South American country's presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them “dignified conditions.\"\n\nAs part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations. \n\nTwo U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.\n\nIn announcing what he called “urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,” Trump explained that he ordered the tariffs and “A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations” on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters.\n\n“All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,” Trump wrote will be subject to “Visa Sanctions.” He did not say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions.\n\nTrump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.\n\nTrump’s actions would seem to undercut his goal to reduce his country's trade deficit. Unlike Mexico or China, Colombia is one of the few countries with a trade deficit with the U.S., of around $1.4 billion, according to U.S. trade data.\n\nColombia is the U.S.’s second biggest buyer of corn and corn feed, according to the U.S. grains council, helping boost U.S. commodity exports from farm belt states like Iowa, Indiana and Nebraska to more than $733 million last year.\n\nThe U.S. export boom has been driven by a two-decade-old free trade agreement between the two countries, which have for long been close partners in the war on drugs. It is unclear if Trump’s tariffs are allowed under the agreement, which contains a dispute mechanism to resolve trade fights.\n\nColombia is the U.S.’s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.’ dependence on foreign oil. The South American country is also the U.S.’s largest supplier of fresh cut flowers.\n\nRegina Garcia Cano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.

It also [said] the abortion pill is safe (though it’s been found to be four times more dangerous than a first-trimester surgical abortion) and available to be mailed to them at their homes.” As also reported, “The site appears to be part of the administration’s plan to expand abortion in any way possible, as discussed by HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, who said ‘all options are on the table’ when it comes to protecting abortion accessibility.”\n\nThe site promoted abortion and birth control much more heavily than any other “reproductive rights” such as pregnancy and parenting; as The Radiance Foundation’s Ryan Bomberger pointed out, the site only referenced the term “pregnant” in relation to a single mention of “prenatal care.”\n\nA foremost priority\n\nAmong the foremost priorities of the Biden-Harris administration was promoting abortion as “reproductive freedom” and “reproductive health care.” And as one of his last acts as President, Joe Biden confused even mainstream media by declaring that the pro-abortion Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution (which had a deadline of 1982 to be passed by 38 states and failed to meet this requirement) had been “ratified.” However, as both the U.S. Archivist and Deputy Archivist noted back in December 2024 when Democrats pushed for this exact action from Biden, this isn’t how the constitutional process works. They said in a joint statement:\n\nIn 2020 and again in 2022, the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice affirmed that the ratification deadline established by Congress for the ERA is valid and enforceable. \n\nThe OLC concluded that extending or removing the deadline requires new action by Congress or the courts. Court decisions at both the District and Circuit levels have affirmed that the ratification deadlines established by Congress for the ERA are valid.\n\nWhat’s the big deal about the ERA? It impacts things like Title IX as well as abortion. As Live Action News noted in 2021:\n\nIn an opinion piece for USA Today, Mercedes Schlapp and Mary Vought explained why the ERA would actually be harmful to women:\n\n…[T]he ERA would actually erode the rights of women recognized in state and federal law. By stating that “equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged … on account of sex,” the amendment would supersede, and effectively eliminate, statutes designed to protect women.\n\nFrom Title IX, which allows women the ability to compete in sports and earn athletic scholarships, to child support and alimony laws as well as Social Security benefits for surviving spouses, the ERA could be the downfall of many protections for women, said Schlapp and Vought.\n\nIn addition, the ERA would expand the taxpayer-funding of abortion and could make abortion a right in the Constitution. Because only women seek abortions, any government policy that was to restrict abortion would now be treating women differently than men — which goes against the ERA.\n\nSo, even on his way out of the White House doors, President Biden was attempting to solidify into U.S. law the intentional and direct killing of preborn children by induced abortion.\n\nIs it really ‘up to the states’?\n\nIt remains to be seen what actions the incoming Trump Administration may take regarding abortion.\n\nAs Donald Trump has stated many times, he believes it is up to the states to decide abortion law, and he has said he would veto any federal legislation attempting to protect preborn children from abortion — even though the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson did not say that abortion was to be left to states to decide, but to “the people’s elected representatives” — which includes even those at the federal level.\n\nClearly, pro-abortion Members of Congress understand this fact, as some even attempted to resurrect the extreme, pro-abortion Women’s Health Protection Act in the years since Roe was overturned.\n\nIn reality, the decision about which innocent human beings can be legally killed in America shouldn’t be left to any democratic process. The 14th Amendment already recognizes equal rights of all persons; there are, logically and ethically, no human beings who are “less” than persons. To be a human being is to be a person, regardless of one’s abilities or lack of abilities.\n\nThe pro-life movement — regardless of who is in the White House, the state house, or the halls of Congress — is not going anywhere, and will continue to defend the right to life of every human being.\n\n[Editor’s note: This story originally was published by Live Action News.]","summary":"Website that was used to push to 'expand abortion in any way possible' shut down","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/gone-biden-era-abortion-promotion-vanishes/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/children-boys-blacks-baby-babies-toddlers-happy-smiling-teeth-bowtie-students-school-uniform-unsplash.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 23:43:25","author":"Live Action News","authors":["Live Action News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":284183156,"title":"Six hostages to be freed and Gazans to be allowed north - Israel","text":"Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinians had been scheduled to be allowed to travel north of the Netzarim Corridor, a seven kilometre (4.3 miles) strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the territory, on Saturday.\n\nImages show massive crowds waiting to pass.\n\n\"We're sleeping in the streets,\" Nireem Musabeh told the BBC at the checkpoint on Sunday. \"We can't go home and every time we try to go home they shoot at us.\"\n\nThe 42-year-old had travelled from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, but was displaced from her home in Shejaiya, in the south.\n\nDiab Shehbari said he had been at the checkpoint since 20:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday.\n\n\"All night the kids were screaming because of the cold - we lit a fire and covered them,\" he said.\n\nIsrael has now said it will allow residents to return to the northern Gaza Strip from 07:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday, and by vehicle two hours later, after the row over Ms Yehud was resolved.\n\nQatari and Egyptian mediators who have facilitated talks between Israel and Hamas were involved in the efforts to end the dispute.

Trump, in a social media post, said the rejection “jeopardized” national security in the U.S.\n\nPetro in a post on X said he had ordered Colombia’s “foreign trade minister to raise import tariffs from the U.S. by 25%.”\n\nEarlier Sunday, Petro said his government would not accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with “dignity.” Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet.\n\n“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants… In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens.”\n\nSunday afternoon, the Colombian government confirmed it was sending the presidential plane to Honduras to pick up Colombians, The Hill reports. According to Petro, the plane will facilitate the “dignified return of Colombian nationals who were to arrive in the country today in the morning hours, coming in from deportation flights.”\n\n“This measure is in response to the government’s commitment to guarantee dignified conditions. In no way have Colombians, as patriots and subjects of rights, been or will be banished from Colombian territory,” a statement continued.\n\nColombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the United States from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024.\n\nLast year, Colombia and other countries began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama.\n\nThe U.S. government didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement said Petro “canceled his authorization” for the flights when the aircraft were in the air.\n\nNo official order had been issued as of Sunday afternoon that would allow for the implementation of the measures Trump announced.\n\n“This is a clear message we are sending that countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights,” a senior administration official told the AP. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.\n\nColombians emerged in recent years as a major presence on the U.S. border with Mexico, aided in part by a visa regime that allows them to easily fly to Mexico and avoid trekking through the treacherous Darien Gap. They ranked fourth with 127,604 arrests for illegal crossings during a 12-month period through September, behind Mexicans, Guatemalans and Venezuelans.\n\nMexico hasn’t imposed visa restrictions on Colombians, as they have on Venezuelans, Ecuadoreans and Peruvians.\n\nThe government of Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, in a statement later announced that the South American country’s presidential aircraft had been made available to facilitate the return of migrants who were to arrive hours earlier on the U.S. military airplanes and guarantee them “dignified conditions.”\n\nAs part of a flurry of actions to make good on Trump’s campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations.\n\nTwo U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people.\n\nIn announcing what he called “urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,” Trump explained that he ordered “25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States,” which would be raised to 50% in one week. He said he also ordered “A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations” on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters.\n\n“All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,” Trump wrote will be subject to “Visa Sanctions.” He did not say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions.\n\nTrump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.\n\nTrump’s actions would seem to undercut his goal to reduce his country’s trade deficit. Unlike Mexico or China, Colombia is one of the few countries with a trade deficit with the U.S., of around $1.4 billion, according to U.S. trade data.\n\nColombia is the U.S.’s fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil, shipping about 209,000 barrels of oil per day last year, although booming domestic production has reduced the U.S.’ dependence on foreign oil. Other imports include coal, coffee and gold.\n\nColombia is also the U.S.’ largest supplier of fresh cut flowers, and with Valentine’s Day just weeks away, the price of saying “I love you” could be impacted.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: After Colombia rejects US military deportation flights, Trump imposes tariffs. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/after-colombia-rejects-us-military-deportation-flights-trump-imposes-tariffs/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Trump-orders-tariffs-after-Colombia-rejects-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 23:31:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":284187012,"title":"Trump’s Palestinian refugee idea falls flat with Jordan and confounds senator","text":"US President Donald Trump’s push to have Egypt and Jordan take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from besieged Gaza fell flat with those countries’ governments and left a key congressional ally in Washington perplexed on Sunday.\n\nFighting that broke out in the territory after ruling Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 is paused due to a fragile ceasefire, but much of Gaza’s population has been left largely homeless by an Israeli military campaign.\n\nMr Trump told reporters on Saturday aboard Air Force One that moving some 1.5 million people away from Gaza might mean that “we just clean out that whole thing”.\n\nMr Trump relayed what he told Jordan’s King Abdullah when the two held a call earlier on Saturday: “I said to him, ‘I’d love for you to take on more because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it’s a mess’.”\n\nHe said he was making a similar appeal to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi during a conversation they were having while Mr Trump was at his Doral resort in Florida on Sunday.\n\nMr Trump said he would “like Egypt to take people and I’d like Jordan to take people”.\n\nBoth Egypt and Jordan also have perpetually struggling economies and their governments, as well as those of other Arab states, fear massive destabilisation of their own countries and the region from any such influx of refugees.\n\nJordan already is home to more than two million Palestinian refugees.\n\nEgypt has warned of the security implications of transferring large numbers of Palestinians to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, bordering Gaza.\n\nMr Trump suggested that resettling most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million could be temporary or long term.\n\nJordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said on Sunday that his country’s opposition to what Mr Trump floated was “firm and unwavering”.\n\nSome Israel officials had raised the idea early in the war.\n\nEgypt’s foreign minister issued a statement saying that the temporary or long-term transfer of Palestinians “risks expanding the conflict in the region”.\n\nMr Trump does have leverage to wield over Jordan, which is a debt-strapped, but strategically important, US ally and is heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\nThe US is historically the single-largest provider of that aid, including more than 1.6 billion dollars through the State Department in 2023.\n\nMuch of that comes as support for Jordan’s security forces and direct budget support.\n\nJordan in return has been a vital regional partner to the US in trying to help keep the region stable.\n\nJordan hosts some 3,000 US troops. Yet, on Friday, new Secretary of State Marco Rubio exempted security assistance to Israel and Egypt but not to Jordan, when he laid out the details of a freeze on foreign assistance that Mr Trump ordered on his first day in office.\n\nMeantime, in the United States, even Trump loyalists tried to make sense of his words.\n\n“I really don’t know,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, when asked on CNN’s State Of The Union about what Mr Trump meant by the “clean out” remark.\n\nMr Graham, who is close to Mr Trump, said the suggestion was not feasible.\n\n“The idea that all the Palestinians are going to leave and go somewhere else, I don’t see that to be overly practical,” said Mr Graham.\n\nHe said Mr Trump should keep talking to Mideast leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and officials in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n“I don’t know what he’s talking about. But go talk to MBS, go talk to UAE, go talk to Egypt,” Mr Graham said. “What is their plan for the Palestinians? Do they want them all to leave?”\n\nMr Trump, a staunch supporter of Israel, also announced on Saturday that he had directed the US to release a supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.\n\nFormer president Joe Biden had imposed a hold due to concerns about their effects on Gaza’s civilian population.\n\nEgypt and Jordan have made peace with Israel but support the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.\n\nThey fear that the permanent displacement of Gaza’s population could make that impossible.\n\nIn making his case for such a massive population shift, Mr Trump said Gaza is “literally a demolition site right now”.\n\n“I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location,” he said of people displaced in Gaza. “Where they can maybe live in peace for a change.”","summary":"Jordan’s foreign minister said his country’s opposition to what Mr Trump floated is ‘firm and unwavering’.\n\n\nThe post Trump’s Palestinian refugee idea falls flat with Jordan and confounds senator appeared first on Jersey Evening Post.","url":"https://www.jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/worldnews/2025/01/26/trumps-palestinian-refugee-idea-falls-flat-with-jordan-and-confounds-senator/","image":"https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Img39726806.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 23:31:11","author":"World News","authors":["World News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":284186492,"title":"How Miley Cyrus Dealt With Dad’s Nightmare Inauguration Performance","text":"A certain Ivy League university may or may not have gotten a shout out instead. \n\nLEAVE ME OUT OF IT\n\nThe pop star’s brother, Trace, claimed their dad threatened legal action after he expressed concern over his performance at an inaugural ball.\n\nIN THE MOOD FOR LOVE\n\nThe intimacy-enhancing kit contains arousing botanical oils to help boost blood flow, reduce muscle tension, and support lubrication for better sex. \n\nAn X user responded to an ICE tweet on Thursday telling agents to go to Forth Worth’s Northside High School.\n\nBaseball Baby \n\nThe New York Yankees outfielder announced the exciting news on Saturday.\n\nNEW YEAR, SAME ME\n\nThey’re giving away free RXBARs to help you start the year on your own terms.\n\nDONALD CORLEONE\n\nThe president had just announced an emergency 25% tariff on Colombia for blocking two U.S. military deportation flights from landing in the country.\n\nHIJACKED SPEECH\n\nA woman in the crowd interrupted tennis player Alexander Zverev‘s losing speech. \n\nPOLICY CHANGE\n\n“I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change,” Trump said, of potentially displacing Palestinians to other countries.\n\nIf it receives enough signatures, the proposed measure would be on the ballot in 2028.\n\nBezel gives you access to thousands of the world’s most collectible and desirable watches.\n\nSURE WHY NOT\n\n“I’m actually fine with this AS LONG AS Trudeau Jr Jr is formally banned from entering politics for the rest of his natural life,” tweeted Canadian singer-songwriter Dan Boeckner.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe ordered the release of the report just days after his confirmation.","summary":"Chris Polk/BBMA2017/Getty Images for DCPMiley Cyrus reportedly wants nothing to do with the family drama after her father’s bizarre performance at President Donald Trump’s inaugural celebrations last week sparked public concern from her brother, Trace Cyrus. “Miley used to feel overwhelmed by the family drama.

A Washington-based employment lawyer who represents federal workers told the outlet that his firm had received a surge of calls in the wake of Trump’s stack of executive orders.\n\nAn Environmental Protection Agency staffer told the outlet: “Trump version 1.0 was bad. I’m already done with version 2.0.”\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management sent out a memo this week warning federal employees against trying to “disguise [DEI] programs by using coded or imprecise language.” The memo stated that failing to report this information within 10 days ”may result in adverse consequences.”\n\nOthers in need of a paycheck say they are “terrified” about leaving their current jobs.\n\n“I would love to leave, but I don’t know where I’d go, and I am terrified of not being able to pay rent and not having healthcare,” one State Department staffer told the outlet.\n\nOthers still are waiting to see how the orders shape up before making any career changes.\n\n“Most of us are watching cautiously and letting the dust settle,” an employee at the U.S. Agency for International Development told the outlet. “We know that there is a range of possible outcomes, and some people are panicking, but most are taking a wait-and-see approach.”\n\nThe clock is ticking.\n\nTo add insult to injury, a memo from the Office of Personnel Management Monday required all agencies to identify recent hires and “promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.” Employees who have been in their posts for less than a year can be terminated without “triggering” appeals from the Merit Systems Protection Board, which protects federal employees.\n\nSome employees are exploring the option of joining the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents over 800,000 workers. Membership already skyrocketed in the weeks before Trump was sworn in, according to the outlet.\n\nA spokesperson told the outlet it “will be tracking how agencies implement the orders and will be prepared to file grievances if our contracts are violated.”\n\nPerhaps a barrage of resignations is part of the new administration’s plan. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, as anticipated co-heads of the Department of Government Efficiency, wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that an in-person work mandate would result in resignations.

That does not mean there won't be plenty of action. The 47th president is known to spring major actions and announcements without much notice. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NEEDS MORE PLANES TO CARRY OUT DEPORTATIONS: REPORT The president starts off the week by attending a House GOP Conference meeting at Trump National Doral Miami at a time to be determined. The GOP January retreat is an opportunity for Republicans to game-plan their approach to implementing their shared agenda with President Trump. Major policy initiatives that are likely to be addressed are the president's sweeping border security and ongoing deportation initiatives, increasing domestic energy production and advancing a new tax plan. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Politico that he expects to have a \"blueprint\" for a massive reconciliation package in place after the retreat. The House Budget Committee, which is tasked with writing the instructions on the bill, is set to meet next week. Johnson sent a letter to the president to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025. In the letter, Johnson wrote, \"Your administration and the 119th Congress working together have the chance to make these next four years some of the most consequential in our nation’s history.\" He went on to write, \"To that end, it is my distinct honor and great privilege to invite you to address a Joint Session of Congress on Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives, to share your America First vision for our legislative future. I eagerly await your response.\" SPEAKER JOHNSON INVITES TRUMP TO ADDRESS CONGRESS AMID BUSY FIRST 100-DAY SPRINT Another event that is key to an early Trump priority will be a hearing at the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation titled \"Fees and Foreign Influence: Examining the Panama Canal and Its Impact on U.S. Trade and National Security.\" The committee is headed by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In his inaugural address, Trump said, \"China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.\" Newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to visit Panama this week. According to the State Department, the trip will include visits to the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Guatemala and El Salvador.

Continued immigration and deportation activities are expected to continue with border czar Tom Homan and the acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, traveling to Chicago on Sunday to witness the stepped-up enforcement actions.

And on Monday, Israeli authorities will allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza.\n\nThe office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release will take place on Thursday and confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday.\n\nUnder the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza. But Israel put that on hold because of Ms Yehoud, who Israel said should have been released on Saturday.

Since Trump’s inauguration last week, White House correspondent Eli Stokols and White House Bureau Chief Dasha Burns reported how Trump has given multiple speeches, made several policy announcements and has spoken to reporters at length. Trump’s huge media presence is a change compared to the more muted Biden years. \"Yes, Trump was eager to sign all those executive orders reversing Biden’s policies,\" they wrote. \"But the bigger flex for Trump, 78, was to contrast his accessibility, aptitude and activity with his predecessor, who was so often shielded from public view by aides wary of showcasing the 82-year-old’s growing limitations.\" POLITICO EDITOR-IN-CHIEF CALLS TRUMP ‘GREATEST AMERICAN FIGURE OF HIS ERA’ DUE TO HIS INFLUENCE \"As fast as the movers changed out the White House furniture, the country went from an invisible president, unable to command the spotlight, to an omnipresent one who wants the public’s attention at all times,\" they continued.

Too much to process and capture in real-time. Too much for the country to digest.\" On Sunday, Trump held a 20-minute gaggle with reporters on Air Force One where he discussed a variety of topics like TikTok, and Greenland.

Said the returning president after taking the oath of office, “The golden age of America begins right now.”\n\nOutgoing Vice President Harris, his rival, observed without emotion during the remarks of the new president, and an equally blank-faced now former President Biden sat with his head propped up in his hand. Thus began the second era of Trump.\n\nHis was an uphill path back to the White House, marked not just by the normal battles of politics but by legal prosecutions and two failed assassination attempts. “I felt then and believe even more so now,” Trump said recalling the moment last summer when a bullet came millimeters from killing him, “that my life was saved for a reason; I was saved by God to make America great again.”\n\nWhen Secret Service agents covered him with their bodies in Butler, Pennsylvania, a bloodied Trump pumped his fist in defiance and shouted, “Fight, fight, fight!” At his second inaugural, he defined that work, declaring “My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all these many betrayals that have taken place and give people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy and indeed their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over.”\n\nHe said the date would be forever immortalized as “Liberation Day,” promising hundreds of executive actions that would reverse and make only a memory of the Biden presidency. His administration will declare a national emergency at the border and designate drug cartels as terrorist organizations. He vowed to put an end to the government practices of “socially engineering race and gender” into every aspect of life, “all government censorship,” and even birthright citizenship. He marshaled the 19th-century rhetoric of American exceptionalism and nationalism, casting an eye on both new lands on Earth and in the cosmos. “We are taking it back,” Trump said of the Panama Canal. “We will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars,” he added later, predicting that an American flag would soon be planted on Martian soil.\n\nMars may be beyond his reach. The federal register is not. The Trump administration placed a desk on stage at the Capitol One Arena in downtown Washington, D.C. His second presidency is expected to begin with a live display of authority as he signs executive order after executive order.\n\nOn the steps of the U.S. Capitol, Trump vowed eight years ago that “American carnage stops here and right now.” He made the same promise today but without much of the lofty rhetoric. Instead, the new president was more workmanlike.\n\nMick Mulvaney, who served as his White House chief of staff, told RealClearPolitics to expect that “Trump 2.0 will be a lot more direct and assertive administration this time around.” A political apprentice no more, Trump returns to power after both remaking the Republican Party in his own image and shifting public opinion on everything from immigration policy to the old consensus on relations with China. And this time, the president has surrounded himself not with converts, but with a Cabinet of true believers in his vision. They were all there to watch their new boss.\n\nA polar vortex sent temperatures below freezing, ostensibly forcing the inauguration indoors where space was limited and Trump’s Cabinet nominees sat side by side with congressional leaders, Supreme Court justices, and foreign dignitaries. Their collective government power was rivaled only by the vast market cap of the billionaires also present under the Rotunda. The three richest men in the world, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg, had great seats. Rank-and-file members of Congress watched the government business on television screens from an overflow room.\n\nBill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, every living former president, watched the inauguration. That list now includes Biden, whose administration insisted that their final act would be restoring the process of a peaceful transfer of power. Former Vice President Pence, now estranged from Trump, also attended the ceremony. It was lost on none of the attendees that the process played out in the same spot where a mob of Trump supporters tried to foil the certification of the 2020 election. And yet this was unspoken. “Welcome home,” Biden told Trump and the new first lady when they arrived at the White House earlier this morning.\n\nBut beyond his ceremonial duties, Biden made the most of his executive power in his final moments, issuing pardons of the defunct January 6th Committee, Gen. Mark Milley, and Dr. Anthony Fauci. The defining characteristic of the recipients: defiance of the incoming president. The extraordinary clemency was billed as a safeguard against a vengeful Trump, but it was not tailored. The pardons were sweeping. The Fauci pardon stretches back more than a decade and begins on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nHe did not forget his own family. In the final minutes of his presidency, Biden preemptively pardoned several close members, including his brother James, citing the “unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me.” The Republican House Oversight Committee saw it differently. They sent a criminal referral of James Biden to the Department of Justice for “making false statements” about his family’s foreign influence-peddling. The chairman of that committee, Kentucky Rep. James Comer, called it “a confession of their corruption.”\n\n“Biden is the worst president in the modern era, maybe ever,” complained Mike Davis, a Trump stalwart and president of the Article III project. “Fortunately, President Trump took out the trash at the White House.”\n\nTrump promised a new day, condemning a status quo where “for many years, a radical and corrupt establishment extracted power and wealth from our citizens, while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.” On the back foot after an electoral shellacking, the Democratic National Committee issued a statement accusing Trump of “leaving his own supporters literally out in the cold while billionaires worth over $1 trillion get a front row seat.”\n\nOligarchy is the new charge of Democrats. Just days after rewarding George Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Biden warned in his farewell address of an emerging tyranny of the wealthy. Trump, who often touts his own wealth, embraced Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and Space X, who will soon reportedly work out of a West Wing office. At the Capitol, Musk pumped his fist repeatedly in triumph throughout Trump’s speech.\n\nThe executive work is already ongoing. Legislative battles are soon to start. Trump returns to the Oval Office with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress. The difference this time is a GOP on board with his vision and also an American culture increasingly skeptical of progressive values and supportive of the MAGA version of conservative ones. Unlike the last Trump inauguration, celebrities abound in the capital city. Front and center was Carrie Underwood.\n\nThe singer, who was tapped to perform at the end of the ceremony, was left waiting on a cue that did not come. When the music did not start, Underwood went it alone. “If you know the words,” she told the assembly, “help me out here.” They obliged and the second inauguration ended with nearly the whole of government singing “America the Beautiful,” a cappella.","summary":"And a key factor is Americans 'increasingly skeptical of progressive values'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/the-beginning-of-the-2nd-era-of-trump/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/donald-trump-melania-inauguration-capitol-one-arena-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 22:55:32","author":"Realclear Wire,RealClearWire","authors":["Realclear Wire","RealClearWire"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":284192312,"title":"Trump and Starmer agree to ‘meet soon’, says Downing Street","text":"Donald Trump and Sir Keir Starmer “agreed to meet soon” in the course of a 45-minute phone call on Sunday, following a declaration by the US president that he liked the UK prime minister “a lot”.\n\nStarmer hopes to visit the White House soon, while Trump, who professed his “respect and affection” for the British royal family, said he may visit the UK on his first foreign trip since re-entering the White House.\n\nThe call, described as “a very good conversation” by one person briefed on its contents, has raised hopes in London that Trump could have a constructive relationship with Starmer, in spite of past tensions.\n\nA key feature was what was not discussed: those briefed on the call said there was no mention of potential tariffs on the UK or on Starmer’s choice of Lord Peter Mandelson as his ambassador to Washington.\n\nIn spite of criticism by Trump allies of Starmer’s plan to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in return for securing the long term future of the US-UK Diego Garcia military base, that issue was not raised either.\n\nThe president’s reticence on all those questions has raised hopes in London that Britain may escape some of the hostile attention that Trump has so far reserved for the likes of Colombia, Mexico and the EU.\n\nAn official UK readout of the call said Starmer discussed with Trump, among other things, “how we are deregulating to boost growth”, a policy which chimes with the president’s war on red tape.\n\nStarmer’s plan to streamline planning and to curtail judicial reviews also came up. Trump has been involved in his own wrangles with environmentalists over his Aberdeenshire golf resort.\n\nDowning Street said Starmer also praised Trump for his “role in securing the landmark ceasefire and hostages deal in Gaza” between Israel and Hamas. The two leaders “agreed to meet soon and looked forward to further discussions then”, Number 10 added.\n\nThe White House readout of the call said Trump and Starmer discussed “how both countries can promote a fair bilateral economic relationship”.\n\nSpeaking before the call, Trump told the BBC on Air Force One he had a good rapport with Starmer. “I get along with him well. I like him a lot,” he said.\n\n“He’s liberal, which is a bit different from me, but I think he’s a very good person and I think he’s done a very good job thus far. I may not agree with his philosophy, but I have a very good relationship with him.”\n\nTrump met Starmer for dinner last September at Trump Tower in New York, in what was seen by both sides as a positive encounter.\n\nThe expectation in London is that Trump will not oppose the appointment of Mandelson as Britain’s new ambassador to Washington. The former UK minister is due to start in the post next month.\n\nAllies of Starmer also hope Trump will not block the contentious Chagos Islands deal. “It hasn’t been number one on my list, I’ll be honest with you,” the president told reporters.\n\nAsked where he might go for the first international trip of his second White House term, Trump said: “It could be Saudi Arabia, it could be UK. Traditionally it could be UK.\n\n“Last time I went to Saudi Arabia because they agreed to buy $450bn of US merchandise.”\n\nA meeting with Britain’s royals would appeal to Trump and is seen in Downing Street as a key selling point to the president. No dates have yet been set for the mutual visits.\n\nStarmer this month told the Financial Times in Kyiv he had a “constructive” relationship with Trump, in spite of numerous criticisms of the president by Labour ministers in the past.\n\nTrump railed against the involvement of Labour staffers in Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful presidential campaign. Technology billionaire Elon Musk, named by Trump as a “waste-buster” in his new administration, has called Starmer “tyrannical”.\n\nDavid Lammy, UK foreign secretary, previously called Trump “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Lammy has said the two patched up relations in the Trump Tower dinner in September.Trump’s positive comments about Starmer contrast with those he has made since his inauguration about countries including Canada and Denmark.\n\nOn Sunday Trump imposed tariffs and sanctions on Colombia after it declined entry to US military flights carrying deported migrants.\n\nJonathan Reynolds, UK trade secretary, has argued that Britain should not be hit by tariffs, given that trade between the UK and US is mainly services-based and is broadly balanced.","summary":"Ahead of the phone call between the two leaders, the US president lavishes praise on the UK prime minister","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/ed30f4b2-65db-4b0f-aa75-af345c1de6d0","image":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F59ae7151-7938-4354-9c9a-7b9320bbc187.jpg?source=next-article&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&width=700&dpr=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-26 22:54:42","author":"Demetri Sevastopulo,George Parker,Stefania Palma","authors":["Demetri Sevastopulo","George Parker","Stefania Palma"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.35},{"id":284178548,"title":"Agreement reached to release Israeli civilian hostage and allow Palestinians to return to north Gaza","text":"An agreement has been reached to release an Israeli civilian hostage and allow displaced Palestinians to return home to northern Gaza, mediator Qatar has said.\n\nThe agreement brings an end to one of the first major crises in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, after Israel prevented thousands of Palestinians from returning to their homes in northern Gaza as it accused Hamas of changing the order of its hostage release.\n\nHamas will hand over Arbel Yehoud, a civilian, along with two other hostages before Friday, Qatar’s statement said.

The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment unambiguously and expressly confers citizenship on ‘[a]ll persons born’ in and ‘subject to the jurisdiction’ of the United States. More than 125 years ago, the Supreme Court confirmed that this entitles a child born in the United States to noncitizen parents to automatic citizenship.”\n\nThe suit, which was filed in Massachusetts against Trump and the U.S. government, notes how Congress “subsequently codified that understanding in the Immigration and Nationality Act” and describes how the executive branch has “long recognized” that attempts to deny citizenship to children based on their parents’ status would be “unquestionably unconstitutional,” per the complaint.\n\n“President Trump now seeks to abrogate this well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle by executive fiat,” the suit says.\n\nFive pregnant women who are part of a lawsuit filed in federal district court in Maryland, along with two immigrant advocacy groups, have condemned Trump’s order as a “flagrant violation of the Fourteenth Amendment” and the history underlying the text of those enactments, “all of which guarantee the fundamental right to citizenship for all children born in the United States,” their suit says.\n\n“The President has no unilateral authority to override rights recognized in the Constitution or in federal statutes,” the complaint states. “The principle of birthright citizenship is a foundation of our national democracy, is woven throughout the laws of our nation, and has shaped a shared sense of national belonging for generation after generation of citizens.”\n\nThree pregnant women in Washington state — Alicia Chavarria Lopez, Cherly Norales Castillo and Delmy Franco Aleman — joined forces with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project to file a class action suit in federal court on Friday, Jan. 24, saying children will be left “stateless” under Trump’s executive order and unable to be recognized as citizens.\n\n“Citizenship is the fundamental marker of belonging in this country,” the suit alleges. “Indeed, without citizenship, the babies soon to be born in this country whom President Trump unilaterally and unconstitutionally seeks to strip of citizenship will be left without any legal immigration status.”\n\nIn addition to Trump and the federal government, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Department of State, Attorney General James McHenry, the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have all been named in lawsuits related to birthright citizenship over the past week.\n\nTrump’s order ultimately argues that the 14th Amendment “has always” excluded people whose parents are in the United States illegally on account of them not being “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S., the order says.
