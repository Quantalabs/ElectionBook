There are seven trips that he took on the ‘Lolita Express,’ the records are out on that. There are many pictures of him surrounded by 13-year-old girls on the plane … We’ve seen him and Epstein, you know, in pictures together and talking and recordings of, you know, their affection for each other.”“But I think the theory that this would be what the circular firing squad would form on, I don’t think anybody saw that coming,” he added.Cobb insisted Bongino “either has to come back from the weekend and say he's sorry, he had a bad day and looks forward to working with his esteemed colleagues and moving forward. Or he's gone.”READ ALSO: Trump's goal isn’t to restore American greatness — it's much more sinister“Because Bondi is not going,” Cobb said. “For a specific reason, which is Bondi, like [Secretary of Defense Pete] Hegseth, is very senior to the other people in their departments who are screwing up. And while they've both been a huge embarrassment and done some just astonishing things … for the history of the country, if [Trump] terminates one of them, he picked him and he put him in those senior positions, and it'll be a huge embarrassment to him.”“So the further down the pecking order you go, if you're Trump and his thinking if somebody leaves that's further down — if it's not the top dog, it's not as big a reflection on him,” Cobb said.\n\nWatch the video below or at this link.\n\nREAD MORE: 'We don’t want to be bought': Flooded TX county turned down Biden funds for warning system","summary":"Former White House lawyer Ty Cobb on Friday explained why President Donald Trump is likely to side with Attorney General Pam Bondi over FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett it would be “a huge embarrassment” for Trump to fire his attorney general.\n\nBongino is reportedly considering resigning over Bondi’s handling of the “Epstein Files” after the Department of Justice and FBI “concluded they have no evidence that convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures, kept a ‘client list’ or was murdered,” according to a memo detailed Sunday by Axios.\n\nBongino — who in the past has “fueled” conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death and relationships with powerful individuals in government — didn’t show up for work Friday, Trump confidant Laura Loomer reports.

Mark J. BENNETT, Eric D. MILLER, Jennifer SUNG A judge of this court has called for a vote to determine whether this case should be reheard en banc. The parties are directed to file simultaneous briefs setting forth their respective positions on whether this case should be reheard en banc. The briefs shall not exceed 15 pages unless they comply with the alternative length limitation of 4,200 words, and they shall be filed within seven (7) days of the date of this order.\n\nIt is not clear which judge of the court requested the poll, but a “judge may sua sponte call for a vote on rehearing or rehearing en banc.”\n\nLove true crime?

The one that ended in June with a three-judge panel unanimously staying U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer’s temporary restraining order, an order that had blocked the president’s action. The lower court’s order had said Trump exceeded his statutory authority and violated the 10th Amendment by taking over the state’s National Guard and deploying it to Los Angeles.\n\nIn the per curiam appellate decision that followed, however, U.S. Circuit Judges Mark Bennett and Eric Miller, both Trump appointees, and Jennifer Sung, a Joe Biden appointee, agreed that the Trump administration made a “strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal.”\n\nThe panel wrote that it was “likely” at that stage that Trump “lawfully” deployed the National Guard to “protect federal personnel performing federal functions and to protect federal property” amid civil unrest or, as the administration put it, “rebellion” over ICE raids. The panel also said it “must be highly deferential” to Trump, even though his invocation of the federal statute that allows the president to call up the National Guard isn’t “completely insulated from judicial review.”\n\n“The source of the President’s power to federalize the National Guard is statutory, not constitutional. Consequently, the political question doctrine does not bar judicial review,” the order stated, rejecting the notion that a president could “federalize the National Guard based on no evidence whatsoever, and that courts would be unable to review a decision that was obviously absurd or made in bad faith.”\n\nNow, it seems, at least one 9th Circuit judge believes there are more questions worth asking.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft: FILE – California Governor Gavin Newsom unveils his revised state budget&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge from 9th Circuit Proposes Reconsideration of National Guard Case first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-from-9th-circuit-proposes-reconsideration-of-national-guard-case/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trumps-military-move-exceeds-his-authority-as-president.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 01:05:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":340776110,"title":"Trump directs ICE to use 'whatever means necessary' to arrest 'slimeballs' throwing rocks at officers","text":"President Donald Trump has directed federal law enforcement officials to use 'whatever means necessary' to arrest anyone who throws rocks or other projectiles at ICE agents during immigration raids.\n\nTrump appeared to be referring to footage of protestors violently clashing with ICE agents during the Thursday raid of a cannabis farm in Camarillo, a city in Southern California.\n\nThe raid, despite the chaos, resulted in 200 migrant workers being detained.

Nations works as an actor in Los Angeles, and Berezhnova-Gunel is an English teacher. \n\nBerezhnova-Gunel, a Ukrainian temporarily residing in Rosarito, Mexico, which is just south of Tijuana, was hesitant to visit California with her fiancée, US-born Nations. \n\nThey were staying in the temporary apartment until Berezhnova-Gunel's visa status was approved. Once approved, the happy couple was hoping to start their life together at Nations' home. \n\nBerezhnova-Gunel had applied for a K-1 visa, a legal document that allows a foreign-born individual to come to the US legally to marry an American. \n\nThe visa requires couples to marry within 90 days of approval, and if the marriage is determined to be legitimate, a Green Card will be issued, and the individual can become a permanent resident of the US. \n\nThe couple said Berezhnova-Gunel's visa status was pending. Still, Nations wanted to bring her to California for the day to see where they would be getting married and later living together.\n\nNations confessed that he 'had no idea how intense' border control had become since President Donald Trump assumed office in January. \n\nHe admitted it was a 'risk' entering the US while Berezhnova-Gunel's visa application was pending, but figured that the worst thing that could happen is they'd be turned away. \n\n'Honestly, it was kind of out of desperation. We had our K-1 visa already pending. We had already done all that stuff,' Nations said. \n\n'We were like, \"Hey, let's just go ask ... and see if they will let us come in for the day,\"' he added. \n\nThe two arrived at the San Ysidro border crossing in San Diego on Nations' motorcycle on the morning of April 6, hoping to get a peek at their wedding venue.\n\nAgents with Customs and Border Protection were not so lenient, and the two were handcuffed and separated. \n\nA CBP supervisor told the couple, 'Tell them you took a wrong turn, and they will be easier on you,' Nations told AZ Central. \n\nWhen Nations was escorted to an interview room, he saw his fiancée handcuffed to a bench, in tears. \n\n'They treat you like trash, not like humans. I mean, it was awful,' Nations recalled. \n\nNations said he was accused of taking money from Berezhnova-Gunel to smuggle her into the US. \n\nBerezhnova-Gunel was taken to the San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona, where she has been staying ever since the debacle. \n\nNations was held overnight and took a bus back to his home in Marina Del Rey the next morning. \n\nSince then, he has desperately been trying to get his fiancée out of the detention center. \n\nNations shared a video on YouTube, sharing their story. He included pictures and videos of the couple during happier times. \n\n'Currently, she [Berezhnova-Gunel] is in detention, or as you like it, prison. Why? Because we are incredibly naïve,' he explained in the video. \n\nHe said that he just wanted to show his fiancée where he lived and where they would have their wedding. Nations said that he never got to say goodbye to Berezhnova-Gunel. \n\n'She is not a gang member. She is not a criminal. She is an English teacher,' Nations pleaded. \n\nHe said since his fiancée was detained, he's contacted senators, representatives, immigration attorneys, and calls ICE every day. \n\n'All I have gotten is an automated loop and a bureaucratic red tape. At this point, I'm at my wits' end and I'm making this plea for help,' Nations pleaded. \n\nDaily Mail reached out to ICE and CBP for additional information on Berezhnova-Gunel's arrest and an update on her case. \n\nAccording to the US Embassy and Consulate, individuals with a K-1 visa can travel, but 'may be subject to additional scrutiny.' \n\n'Traveling under another visa status or the visa waiver program is not advised for K-1 fiancé(e) visa applicants prior to the approval of their K visa as they have already indicated their intention is to marry in the U.S.,' the consulate adds. \n\nSandra Grisolia, a spokesperson for ICE, told AZ Central in a statement, 'All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention, and if found removable by final order, removed from the U.S., regardless of nationality.'\n\nThe statement added that Berezhnova-Gunel will stay in custody until her visa status is approved. \n\nICE argued that because Berezhnova-Gunel didn't have legal documentation to enter the US per Trump's 'Securing Our Borders' executive order, her detainment was justified.","summary":"A couple's plans to get married and move in together were dramatically upended when ICE arrested a woman for a 'stupid' mistake at the border.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14898603/couple-torn-apart-southern-border-crossing.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/12/01/100242727-0-image-m-14_1752279550576.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:54:18","author":"Editor,Sophie Gable","authors":["Editor","Sophie Gable"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":340777964,"title":"Liberal Barstool host gets 'reality check' about Trump's popularity across America","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Media July 11, 2025 00:38 \n\n Liberal Barstool host gets 'reality check' about Trump's popularity across America \n Zach Bryan’s ex Brianna \"Chickenfry\" LaPaglia says she can’t avoid supporters of President Donald Trump because “everyone voted” for him. \n\n Tags V-VIDEOMEDIA","summary":"Zach Bryan’s ex Brianna &quot;Chickenfry&quot; LaPaglia says she can’t avoid supporters of President Donald Trump because “everyone voted” for him.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375557907112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/ead30209-9bf9-4c25-a433-3851d3a39985/e20fc47b-1a0c-42aa-8654-2c28338dd166/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:41:11","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.136},{"id":340777260,"title":"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,234","text":"The United States has resumed military supplies to Ukraine, and senior officials in Kyiv will work on military cooperation next week with US special envoy Keith Kellogg, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Russian media covering his ASEAN meeting in Malaysia that he outlined Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position on settling the Ukraine war during a meeting with top US diplomat Marco Rubio the day before.\n\nLavrov has arrived in North Korea, according to North Korea’s state media KCNA, the latest visit by a senior Russian official to the isolated state amid warming ties between the countries.

In its 15-page preliminary report on the crash which happened in around 30 seconds of the plane lifting off, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said the fuel control switches were switched on later but the deceleration in one of the engines could not be stopped.

On June 12, Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI 171 en-route to London Gatwick crashed into a medical hostel complex soon after take-off from Ahmedabad, killing 260 people, including 241 persons who were onboard the plane. Releasing the report a month after the fatal crash, the AAIB said the aircraft air/ground sensors transitioned to air mode, consistent with liftoff at 08:08:39 UTC (13:38:09 IST).

As per the report, the engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off. \"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,\" it said. AAIB said the CCTV footage obtained from the airport showed Ram Air Turbine (RAT) getting deployed during the initial climb immediately after lift off. \"No significant bird activity is observed in the vicinity of the flight path. The aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall,\" it said. As per the EAFR, the engine 1 fuel cutoff switch transitioned from CUTOFF to RUN at about 08:08:52 UTC. Thereafter at 08:08:56 UTC, the engine 2 fuel cutoff switch also transitions from CUTOFF to RUN. \"When fuel control switches are moved from CUTOFF to RUN while the aircraft is inflight, each engines full authority dual engine control (FADEC) automatically manages a relight and thrust recovery sequence of ignition and fuel introduction,\" the report said. \"The EGT (Exhaust Gas Temperature) was observed to be rising for both engines indicating relight. engine 1's core deceleration stopped, reversed and started to progress to recovery. Engine 2 was able to relight but could not arrest core speed deceleration and re-introduced fuel repeatedly to increase core speed acceleration and recovery,\" the report said. The EAFR recording stopped at 08:09:11 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). At about 08:09:05 UTC, one of the pilots transmitted 'MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY' and when the Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) enquired about the call sign, there was no response but the ATCO observed the aircraft crashing outside the airport boundary and activated the emergency response. \"At 08:14:44 UTC, Crash Fire Tender left the airport premises for Rescue and firefighting. They were joined by Fire and Rescue services of local administration,\" the AAIB said. On December 17, 2018, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature. The SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. AAIB noted that the concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive by the FAA. \"The fuel control switch design, including the locking feature, is similar on various Boeing airplane models including part number 4TL837-3D which is fitted in B787-8 aircraft VT-ANB. \"As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory,\" the report said. According to AAIB, the scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023. \"However, the reason for the replacement was not linked to the fuel control switch. There has been no defect reported pertaining to the fuel control switch since 2023 on VT-ANB,\" it said.

Now, with this action, the supply chain includes software as well. It includes anything that enables creation and employment in India,” he said.Regarding companies rethinking their ‘China Plus One’ strategy with the lifting of software curbs, Dixit said that companies considering investing in India for EDA development or other functions might choose to thoughtfully evaluate their timing.However, Shankar Krishnamoorthy, chief product development officer, Synopsys, said the company does not foresee the software export restrictions that were previously placed on China being placed on India, especially given India’s ambition to build its semiconductor ecosystem and the existing US-India collaboration in the sector. But Biswajeet Mahapatra, principal analyst at Forrester, said this signals increased competition.A more enabled Chinese chip industry, with restored access to critical design software, can accelerate its own research and development (R&D) and manufacturing, potentially intensifying the race for global market share and foreign investment, especially in design and packaging where India is also making significant strides, he said.Kunal Chaudhary, partner and co-leader, Inbound Investment Group, EY India, emphasised the need for India to act swiftly. “India must move faster on chip design. With the US easing EDA export restrictions for China, the global playing field is shifting,” he said.Chaudhary said “building our own chip design software is a strategic necessity, not just for resilience but to lead in the next era of semiconductor innovation”, calling for focused investment in R&D, intellectual property (IP) and deep skilling.Kathir Thandavarayan, partner, Deloitte India, said that with the rescinding of EDA software restrictions, Chinese design entities will continue their efforts in advanced chip design that are crucial for cutting edge technology applications such as artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing.This is an area of importance for India, too. However, India currently focuses on mature nodes that account for 75-80% of the market demand, with an objective of creating an end-to-end value chain ecosystem in the medium term. The country accounts for 20% of semiconductor design engineers globally and thus plays a very critical role in chip design in advanced nodes, Thandavarayan said.Jaswinder Ahuja, former managing director of Cadence India, said that while the immediate impact on Indian companies might be limited, it “raises questions about potential future restrictions on India”.He also highlighted the opportunities for EDA startups, “particularly with the industry's growing focus on AI, chiplets and 3D-IC packaging”.Ahuja said these startups, “unencumbered by legacy constraints, can reimagine design approaches and drive innovation”.Dixit pointed out that none of the beneficiaries of the government’s Design-Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme, for example, are EDA companies. “They are all design companies, people who will make or design some silicon or some printed circuit board (PCB) that will go into a system using EDA,” he said.“The inherent challenges are that the three (Siemens, Cadence, Synopsys) are so big and have armies of people trying to solve problems that it becomes difficult for a smaller company to find a problem which a major EDA is not looking at. They don’t have enough people to solve a problem if it is a very complicated problem,” he said.This is why India doesn’t see many EDA companies with a wide range of products initially, he said.Cadence India declined to comment.The US decision, while fostering greater stability in global tech trade, clearly signals a more competitive environment for India's semiconductor aspirations. The consensus among experts is that India must leverage this stability to further its own domestic capabilities, invest heavily in R&D and skill development, and solidify its position in the global semiconductor landscape.","summary":"Regarding companies rethinking their ‘China Plus One’ strategy with the lifting of software curbs, Dixit said that companies considering investing in India for EDA development or other functions might choose to thoughtfully evaluate their timing.

'That was bulls*** my mom said to get attention one time. And my dad's not dying. Stop!' \n\nKelly Osbourne, 40, has revealed the truth behind the 'suicide pact' that her parents Ozzy and Sharon claimed to have made years earlier\n\nBack in 2023 on The Osbournes podcast, Sharon stated that euthanasia was 'still a plan' for both herself and the Crazy Train hitmaker and questioned, 'Do you think that we’re gonna suffer?'; seen in 2020 in Beverly Hills \nIn a separate reel, Kelly also brought up a viral AI video of her father saying that he is 'dying.' \n'So, there's this video going around on social media and it's supposed to be of my dad and it's AI,' the mom-of-one said. \n'And it has a voice like my dad's David Attenborough or something and it starts out saying, \"I don't need a doctor to tell me that I'm going to die. I know I'm going to die.\"' \nOsbourne paused and then frustratingly added, 'What the f*** is wrong with you people? Why would you spend your time making a video like this? He's not dying!' \nShe continued, 'Yes, he has Parkinson's. And yes his mobility is completely different that it used to be but he's not f***ing dying. What is wrong with you?' \nKelly additionally included a screenshot to give an example of comments filtering on social media platforms such as: 'Tell us Ozzy is going to be dying soon without telling us he's going to be dying soon.' \nEarlier this month in Birmingham, Ozzy took to the stage for his final live show - amid his battle with Parkinson's after being initially diagnosed with the disease in 2003. \nA few years earlier on The Osbournes podcast, the topic of a 'suicide pact' that both he and Sharon made was brought up by their son Jack. \n\nHowever in a new clip, Kelly expressed, 'I don't know what side of the bed I woke up on today, but I woke up on a f***ing I'm gonna f*** you up and fight you day'\n\n'So, there's this video going around on social media and it's supposed to be of my dad and it's AI,' the mom-of-one said; singer seen in 2024 in Ohio \n\nOsbourne paused and then frustratingly added, 'What the f*** is wrong with you people?

Mental suffering is enough pain without physical. So if you've got mental and physical, see ya.'\nKelly - who also appeared on the podcast episode at the time - asked her mom, 'But what if you could survive?' \nThe British-born star answered, 'Yeah, what if you survived and you can't wipe your own a**, you're pissing everywhere, s****ing, can't eat.' \nThe topic was also previously brought up when Sharon interviewed with The Mirror back in 2007 when she released her own autobiography titled Survivor: My Story - The Next Chapter. \nShe expressed, 'Ozzy and I have absolutely come to the same decision.\n'We believe 100 per cent in euthanasia so have drawn up plans to go to the assisted suicide flat in Switzerland if we ever have an illness that affects our brains. If Ozzy or I ever got Alzheimer's, that's it - we'd be off.'\n\nJack then said, 'Aren't we already all suffering?' and Sharon continued to offer her view on the matter; Sharon and Ozzy seen with son Jack in 2024 in Ohio \n\n'We believe 100 per cent in euthanasia so have drawn up plans to go to the assisted suicide flat in Switzerland if we ever have an illness that affects our brains. If Ozzy or I ever got Alzheimer's, that's it - we'd be off,' she said; seen in 2020 in L.A. \nThe X Factor alum further explained, 'We gathered the kids around the kitchen table, told them our wishes and they've all agreed to go with it.\n'I saw my father suffer from the day he came back into my life in 2002 to the day he died in July. There's no way I could go through what he did, or put my kids through that.'\nShe added, 'At least with something like cancer you can communicate, say how you feel and explain why your body hurts.' \nShe then referenced to her father again by stating, 'But my father deteriorated at such a rapid speed he became a shell of himself - dribbling, wearing a diaper and tied into a wheelchair because he didn't realize he could no longer walk.\n'Some say the disease is hereditary so at the first sign I want to be put out of my misery.'\nThe star continued, 'Ozzy and I have asked our lawyers to make the appropriate arrangements. It's taken away some of the fear of our ending and is a final gift of love to our kids.'\nOver a decade ago in 2014, Ozzy spoke with the Daily Mirror and said physician-assisted suicide was an option if they had a 'life-threatening condition.'\nHe said, 'If I can't live my life the way I'm living it now - and I don't mean financially - then that's it...[Switzerland].' \n\nHe said, 'If I can't live my life the way I'm living it now - and I don't mean financially - then that's it...[Switzerland]'; seen in 2022 in Inglewood \nOsbourne also told the outlet, 'If I can't get up and go to the bathroom myself and I've got tubes up my ass and an enema in my throat, then I've said to Sharon, \"Just turn the machine off.\"\n'If I had a stroke and was paralyzed, I don't want to be here. I've made a will and it's all going to Sharon if I die before her, so ultimately it will all go to the kids.'\nOver the past weekend, Ozzy took to the stage at Villa Park Stadium in Birmingham, U.K. for his final live show as he reunited with Black Sabbath. \nAfter being welcomed by cheers and applause from fans at the venue, the singer offered an emotional message. \n\nThe evening was even more memorable as Ozzy was supported by his family. Kelly was also in attendance and her partner Sid Wilson proposed to her backstage in front of her parents\n\n'You have no idea how I feel,' the star - who has notably undergone seven surgeries in the past five years - expressed to the audience. \nHe belted out lyrics to the crowd while sitting on a throne on the stage and exclaimed, 'It's so good to be on this f***ing stage. Let the madness begin!' \nAlong with performing with original members of Black Sabbath, the singer also had the chance to do a solo set for the sold-out stadium. \nThe evening was even more memorable as Ozzy was supported by his family.

We’re gonna lose the president,' Bannon thundered to a packed audience. \n\n'They don’t even have to steal it, which they’re gonna try to do in ’28.'\n\nThe longtime political guru of the MAGA movement addressed conspiracy theories that Epstein was behind an elite cabal of child rapists.\n\n'It’s not about just a pedophile ring and all that. It’s about who governs us, right? And that’s why it’s not gonna go away,' Bannon said. \n\n'They’ve disheartened the hardest core populist nation that’s always been who governs us.' \n\nAt the heart of the firestorm is the Justice Department's abrupt decision to close the book on the Epstein investigation - denying the existence of the long-rumored 'client list,' reaffirming that Epstein died by suicide, and refusing to release further records.\n\nThe memo, jointly released by the DOJ and FBI, stated that further disclosures were neither appropriate nor warranted. \n\nBut what was intended as a final word has instead detonated a whole new round of conspiracy theories on the right. \n\nInfluential MAGA figures, already furious over Attorney General Pam Bondi's failure to deliver the promised bombshells, erupted. \n\n'The DOJ says there's no client list? Next they'll say Epstein never even existed,' raged InfoWars founder Alex Jones. \n\nBondi, once a darling of the movement, had assured Fox News viewers that a list of Epstein's clients was 'on her desk' but the DOJ now says no such document ever existed.\n\nFar-right influencer Laura Loomer, close to Trump himself, didn't hold back.\n\n'President Trump should fire Bondi for lying to his base and creating a liability for his administration. She is an embarrassment and she doesn't do anything to help Trump,' Loomer wrote on X. \n\nMeanwhile, Dan Bongino, Trump's deputy FBI director and himself a key player in cultivating MAGA loyalty, reportedly considered resigning after a heated clash with Bondi at the White House. \n\nSources say Bongino was 'furious' over how the Epstein memo was handled and skipped work on Friday to contemplate his future.\n\nIn an attempt to rally the base and refocus their fury, Bannon called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Epstein's clients and possible blackmail operations.\n\n'There's only one solution,' Bannon insisted. 'You must appoint a special prosecutor immediately. DOJ and FBI, love those guys, but they can't do it. No possibility. They're too busy. Too conflicted.' \n\nHis call was echoed by conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, who demanded action in front of a roaring crowd.\n\nBut despite the fiery rhetoric, the administration appears to be circling the wagons.\n\nPresident Trump leapt to Bondi's defense in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, scolding a reporter who dared raise the Epstein issue.\n\n'Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? This guy's been talked about for years. That is unbelievable.' \n\nBehind closed doors, however, tensions are boiling. A private clash earlier in the week between Bondi and Bongino sparked by a NewsNation report suggesting DOJ obstruction nearly broke into the open. \n\nFBI Director Kash Patel, Deputy AG Todd Blanche, and even Bongino were all forced to issue public statements denying divisions within the administration.\n\nThe Epstein memo marked a stunning reversal from earlier promises. \n\nIn February, MAGA influencers were invited to the White House and handed binders labeled 'The Epstein Files: Phase 1 – Declassified.' But the files were mostly rehashed public documents. \n\nBondi promised that a 'truckload' of unreleased evidence was coming but that release never happened.\n\nInstead, on Monday the DOJ said that court orders sealed most of the remaining materials, and much of it would never have been made public even if Epstein had stood trial.\n\nThe only disclosure accompanying the memo was a video intended to prove Epstein's jailhouse suicide. Yet even that drew fire from skeptics due to a mysterious one-minute gap in the footage.\n\nComplicating matters, tech mogul Elon Musk, once a close Trump confidant, is now hammering the president from the outside. \n\nHaving announced plans to launch his own political party, Musk took to X to stoke Epstein suspicions.\n\n'How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won't release the Epstein files?' Musk asked.\n\nMusk has hinted that Trump may have been named in redacted documents, further fueling speculation and deepening the fissure within the right.\n\nThe Epstein backlash comes amid a series of fractures inside Trump's base. \n\nMAGA hardliners are already fuming over Trump's decision to resume arms shipments to Ukraine, his bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, and his recent comments urging restraint on immigration raids at farms.\n\nInsiders fear the cumulative effect could be an erosion of support among the grassroots populists who powered Trump's rise and who expect scorched-earth tactics, not compromise.","summary":"Steve Bannon issued a stark warning about the political cost of the Epstein controversy, hinting at deep cracks forming within Trump's base.

It is published here with permission.\n\nFor all the right reasons, the conversation about the Donald Trump-led budget reconciliation centers on massive Medicaid funding reductions and the long-term damage they’ll do to public health. With some 15 million Californians relying on Medi-Cal, the state’s version of Medicaid, to see a doctor, that’s no thought exercise — it’s an emergency. The misery hasn’t arrived yet, but it already feels real.\n\nThere is another program, though, that is in more immediate danger of losing its punch. Without an extension of federal subsidies that are scheduled to expire this year, people who shop on the Covered California exchange for their health insurance are going to absorb premium rate hikes in the painful-to-impossible range — 75%, by one estimate.\n\nAnd they are going to leave the exchange, possibly by the hundreds of thousands.\n\nAnd our state will become sicker — and poorer — for it. Covered California, imperfect though it is, keeps people in health plans on at least somewhat affordable terms, when their situations otherwise might preclude that and force them into mostly awful choices.\n\nHow would I know? I was once one of them.\n\nCovered CA fills an insurance gap\n\nRolled out in 2014 as part of the Affordable Care Act, Covered California — or Covered CA, as it’s commonly known — is an exchange through which people can buy health insurance when they don’t qualify for Medi-Cal, or work at a place that doesn’t offer health care, or work on their own in the gig economy.\n\nConsidering that 90% of California’s private businesses have fewer than 20 employees, this matters. Establishments don’t have to offer health insurance in this state unless they have the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees. That’s one of several reasons Covered CA’s enrollment reached nearly 2 million early this year, including more than 345,000 new sign-ups in the last open enrollment period alone.\n\nIn all, Covered CA officials estimate that more than 6.3 million Californians have had marketplace coverage since 2014 — the precise goal of the Obama administration when it included the health exchange in the Affordable Care Act, which Congress passed in 2010.\n\nCovered CA fills more than one niche, but it’s especially important for those who can’t otherwise afford health care because they aren’t eligible for Medi-Cal. Let’s look at that for a moment. If you work part-time hours — say, 30 a week — in California and are paid the rock-bottom hourly state minimum of $16.50, you still earn way too much to qualify for Medi-Cal, whose annual income threshold for a single person is $21,597. That’s even though your wages are levels below what you actually need to afford the basics of living in California. Medi-Cal is an absolutely critical service in the state, but its eligibility restrictions are real.\n\nFurther, as Covered CA’s executive director told the Los Angeles Times, a quarter of the people who use the exchange are sole proprietors. “That’s everything from mom-and-pop Etsy shops to a consultant (to) a highly educated tech worker in San Francisco doing contract work,” said the director, Jessica Altman. “We really have that full spectrum.”\n\nFederal subsidies help\n\nFor a while, that included me. When a corporate job ended a few years ago and I became an independent contractor, I nervously shopped for a family health policy. After a terrifying tour through the insurance sites, I landed on Covered CA and eventually found a major-carrier policy at a price that, while painful, didn’t threaten to bankrupt anyone.\n\nThe reason? Those federal subsidies — and especially the enhanced subsidies that took effect in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan and were renewed through 2025 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe federal money dramatically lowers the monthly premiums for the health policies purchased on the exchange, not just in California but for nearly 24 million Americans. The funds, technically tax credits, generally get paid directly to the insurers — so yes, those mega-corporations still collect their whopper premiums, an apparent incentive for them to participate on the exchange. But every subsidy dollar is also a dollar less that a struggling person or family has to pay. It all depends on income levels — as you earn more, your subsidy shrinks — but in California, nearly 90% of Covered CA users receive at least some discount on their premiums.\n\nThe program has grown because it helps. No one who’s registered through its website will tell you it’s an effortless process, but it does work to put people and families into health plans. Covered CA officials say the federal subsidies have helped create four straight years of enrollment growth, as well as a reduction in California’s uninsured rate to 6.4% by 2023. When the program launched in 2014, that rate was 17.2%.\n\nDespite the program’s success, the GOP’s giant spending and tax bill makes no provision for extending the subsidies. Without further action by Congress between now and the end of the year (and let’s call that doubtful), premium payments on the exchange will rise by an average of over 75%, according to the health policy and research group KFF.\n\nIn California, that will lead to an estimated 660,000 people either dropping off Covered CA because of the cost or being stripped of the right to use it, the program’s officials told me this week. In addition to not extending the subsidies, the GOP’s budget reconciliation adds layers of red tape for those participating on the exchange, shortens the enrollment period and denies access to a bunch of groups that used to be eligible. That list includes lawfully present immigrants such as those with work and student visas, asylees and victims of trafficking.\n\nState officials have attempted to keep users’ costs down by eliminating deductibles on several of Covered CA’s mid-level “silver” plans, the most commonly selected. (On some other plans, the deductible can hit an eye-watering $11,600 for a family.) Beyond that, the state has allotted $190 million in one-time additional funding to help offset the looming cuts.\n\nThose measures help, but they don’t compare with the impact of the federal enhancements that have made it possible for millions of Californians to access health care over the past several years. The potential shrinking of Covered CA and its benefits puts more people at risk, pure and simple. There is absolutely no good to come of it.\n\nCapital & Main is an award-winning nonprofit publication that reports from California on the most pressing economic, environmental and social issues of our time, including economic inequality, climate change, health care, threats to democracy, hate and extremism and immigration.​\n\nCopyright 2025 Capital & Main","summary":"Without an extension of federal subsidies set to expire this year, Covered California customers are going to absorb premium rate hikes.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2025/07/11/will-covered-california-land-on-life-support/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Covered-California-Bus.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:19:08","author":"Mark Kreidler • Capital & Main","authors":["Mark Kreidler • Capital & Main"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":340769994,"title":"Laura: It’s not hard to see why Dem have turned away voters","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle July 11, 2025 01:49 \n\n Laura: It’s not hard to see why Dem have turned away voters \n Fox News host Laura Ingraham discusses how President Donald Trump's support for Texas after deadly floods and the fall of the Democrat Party on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’\n Tags POLITICSV-VIDEOTHE INGRAHAM ANGLESHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIR","summary":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham discusses how President Donald Trump&apos;s support for Texas after deadly floods and the fall of the Democrat Party on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6375565012112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c79f6f80-cc78-49c0-916b-94561dcc7e25/5944d400-afb1-4e4e-934f-c9e19d5f0571/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:16:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.699},{"id":340773228,"title":"Celebrity Gogglebox fans beg bosses to give Hannah Waddingham and famous pal Tim Minchin a permanent slot as they praise 'fabulous' duo","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Jul 12th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCelebrity Gogglebox fans beg bosses to give Hannah Waddingham and famous pal Tim Minchin a permanent slot as they praise 'fabulous' duo\n\n Have YOU got a story?

The interim deal would allow for continued talks, giving New Delhi space to resolve outstanding issues ahead of a broader agreement expected this fall, they said. \n\nThe statement would likely set a baseline tariff below 20% — compared with 26% initially proposed — with language that would allow the two sides to continue negotiating the rate as part of the final pact, the people said. The timing of an interim agreement is unclear.\n\nIf finalized, India would be on a short list of trading partners that have secured deals with the Trump administration. US President Donald Trump has otherwise shocked dozens of trading partners this week by announcing tariff rates of as high as 50% in some cases ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline. \n\nIndia’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry didn’t respond to an email seeking further information. The White House and Commerce Department also did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNew Delhi is seeking to secure a deal on more favorable terms than the one Trump said he signed with Vietnam, which included 20% import duties. However, Vietnam was caught off guard by that rate, and is still seeking to bring it down. The UK is the only other country that Trump has announced a trade deal with. \n\nOn Thursday, Trump told NBC News he’s eyeing blanket tariffs of 15% to 20% on most trading partners who haven’t been informed yet of their rates. The current global baseline minimum levy for nearly all US trading partners is 10%.\n\nTariff rates announced for Asian nations so far range from 20% for Vietnam and the Philippines to 40% for Laos and Myanmar.\n\nIndia was among the first nations to approach the White House for trade talks this year, but signs of strain have emerged in recent weeks. While Trump said earlier this week that an agreement with India is close, he has also threatened additional tariffs over the country’s participation in the BRICS group. A team of Indian negotiators is expected to visit Washington soon to advance the talks. \n\nIndia has already put forward its best offer to the Trump administration, making clear the red lines it won’t cross in finalizing an agreement, Bloomberg News previously reported. \n\nBoth sides have dug in their heels over a few key issues including Washington’s demand that India open its market to genetically modified crops — an ask New Delhi has rejected, citing risks to its farmers. \n\nThe two nations are yet to find a landing zone on contentious issues, including non-tariff barriers in agriculture and regulatory processes in the pharmaceutical industry, people familiar with the matter said. \n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\nPublished on July 12, 2025","summary":"The deal, yet to be formally announced, will provide space for continued negotiations and could place India among a handful of nations with favorable trade terms under the Trump administration. ","url":"https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/world/us-india-trade-deal-talks-may-lower-tariffs-below-20/article69803213.ece","image":"https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/nkl6s4/article69803217.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI02_14_2025_000085A.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:11:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.003},{"id":340776308,"title":"‘I just got you’: SWAT team member breaks silence on firing ‘9th shot’ that slowed Trump’s would-be assassin in Butler","text":"The SWAT team leader who fired on President Donald Trump’s would-be assassin at last year’s campaign rally in Butler has spoken for the first time about the moment he took the “ninth shot” that slowed the gunman.\n\nAaron Zaliponi, an Army combat veteran turned sniper, recalled thinking: “I just got you,” as he struck Thomas Matthew Crooks with a bullet, slowing his salvo of gunshots that struck the president and killed one person in the crowd on July 13 last year at the Pennsylvania rally.\n\nThe 46-year-old, a police sergeant with the rural Adams Township who serves on the county SWAT team, is convinced that his single shot is what saved more lives that day, he told The Washington Post. He believes his bullet hit Crooks’ gun or the man himself, delaying more shots, before a Secret Service sniper delivered the fatal shot on the would-be assassin.\n\nOfficials, including Butler County’s district attorney, the county’s SWAT team commander and Congressman Clay Higgins, who investigated the assassination attempt, agree that “the ninth shot stopped Crooks from firing again.”\n\nA bullet grazed Trump’s ear as Secret Service agents bundled him to the ground after 20-year-old Crooks opened fire at the campaign rally. Two others were injured and one of his bullets killed rallygoer Corey Comperatore.\n\nZaliponi, a father of two, recollected standing in the open field about 115 yards away from Crooks, between him and the rally stage. “There you are,” Zaliponi recalled thinking as he spotted the gunman on the roof of a warehouse.\n\nHe took out his M4 SWAT rifle, aligned the red dot of its scope with the gunman’s chin and fired just once.\n\nCrooks “jerked hard to the right and slumped over his weapon,” Zaliponi told The Post. “It wasn’t like he was ducking or flinching. Something smacked him. Whether it was my round hitting the buttstock or the buttstock exploding in his face, I know I hit him.”\n\nCrooks didn’t fire again.\n\nThe 6-foot-3 police sergeant revealed that he only ended up being posted in a red barn to the north of the rally stage because he lost a coin toss. His colleague won the coveted position of joining the federal counterassault team to stay close to Trump during the visit.\n\nAs the crowd was restlessly waiting for the president to appear, a local officer pointed out Crooks as one of four people behaving suspiciously, Zaliponi recalled. “Just keep an eye on him,” Zaliponi said he told the officer. “Let me know what’s going on.”\n\nAbout 20 minutes before Trump went onstage, an alert came over the radio about a young male “lurking around” the warehouses belonging to local business Agr International.\n\nPolice lost sight of Crooks and called in more officers to track him down, according to transcripts obtained by The Post.\n\nZaliponi and members of the SWAT team left their positions in the barn and looked towards the Agr building, he told The Post. \n\n“Male on the roof with a long gun,” SWAT commander Ed Lenz urgently relayed over the radio.\n\n“Go, go, go,” Zaliponi recalled ordering members of his counterassault team to race to the complex where Crooks was.\n\n“Technically, I should have gone with my team,” he told the outlet. “I don’t know what it was, but something told me to stay there.”\n\nZaliponi and his rifle’s red-dot sight had no magnification, making Crooks a challenging target, when he was spotted on the roof.\n\nHe aimed for Crooks’s chin, quickly evaluating that it would be better to risk missing low and hit his body than miss high. “All this went through my head in a millisecond,” Zaliponi said.\n\nZaliponi said he was “110 percent sure” he made the shot after seeing Crooks jerk to the right and slump backward.\n\nHe kept his rifle pointed on the roof’s peak before a Secret Service countersniper fired the shot that killed Crooks.\n\nDespite his heroism, for weeks after the shooting, Zaliponi said he has flashbacks. He struggled with one regret. “I wish I would have just looked up to the roof sooner,” Zaliponi told The Post. “Maybe everyone’s still here.”\n\nWhile the FBI said there was “no forensic evidence” that the ninth bullet hit Crooks or his rifle, others have credited Zaliponi for his actions that day.\n\n“It’s very reasonable to say Aaron Zaliponi saved lives that day,” GOP Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, told The Post. “At the moment he needed to perform, he performed beautifully, and he has not been recognized enough for that.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/just-got-swat-team-member-150926679.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/8d98dfafdb7884338523963f9e05e4fb","video":"","publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:10:35","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.44},{"id":340771860,"title":"Trump tours Texas flood sites and defends officials amid mounting questions about response","text":"President Donald Trump on Friday (July 11, 2025) toured the devastation from catastrophic flooding in Texas and lauded state and local officials, even amid mounting criticism that they may have failed to warn residents quickly enough that a deadly wall of water was coming their way.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly promised to do away with the Federal Emergency Management Agency as part of his larger pledges to dramatically shrink the size of government, and he's fond of decrying officials in Democrat-run states hit by past natural disasters and tragedy. \n\nBut the President struck a far more somber and sympathetic tone while visiting America's largest Republican state — highlighting the heartbreak of what happened while effusively praising elected officials and first responders alike. \n\n“The search for the missing continues. The people that are doing it are unbelievable,” Mr. Trump, seated with officials around a table with emblazoned with a black-and-white “Texas Strong” banner, said at a makeshift emergency operations center inside an expo hall in Kerrville. \n\nHe later added, “You couldn’t get better people, and they’re doing the job like I don’t think anybody else could, frankly.\" \n\nSince the July 4 disaster, which killed at least 120 people and left more than 170 missing, the President has been conspicuously silent on his past promises to shutter FEMA and return disaster response to the states. Instead, he's focused on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of what occurred in central Texas' Hill Country and its human toll. \n\n“We just visited with incredible families. They’ve been devastated,” the President said of a closed-door meeting he and first lady Melania Trump had with the relatives of some of those killed or missing. \n\nTrump’s shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though he has made slashing the federal workforce a centerpiece of his administration’s opening months. He spent a lot of time Friday discussing the victims from Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 people were killed. \n\n“They were there because they loved God. And, as we grieve this unthinkable tragedy, we take comfort in the knowledge that God has welcomed those little beautiful girls into his comforting arms in heaven,” Mr. Trump said. \n\nThe first lady described meeting “beautiful young ladies” from the area who she said gave her a “special bracelet from the camp in honor of all the little girls that lost their lives.”\n\n\"We are here to honor them,” she said, promising to return to support the camp in the future. \n\nBefore arriving for his tour, Mr. Trump approved Texas’ request to extend the major disaster declaration beyond Kerr County to eight additional counties, making them eligible for direct financial assistance to recover and rebuild.\n\n“All across the country Americans’ hearts are shattered. I had to be here as president,\" he said. \"All the beautiful souls, and we’re filled with grief and devastation. This, the loss of life. And unfortunately, they’re still looking.”\n\nMr. Trump also tried to steer away from partisanship, even saying at one point, “I don’t want to say politics” while still bragging about reducing the cost of eggs around the country. \n\nHe also still insisted his administration “is doing everything it can to help Texas” and “we’ve got some good people” running FEMA. That is nonetheless a far cry from his call mere weeks ago to begin “phasing out” FEMA.","summary":"President Donald Trump toured the devastation from catastrophic flooding in Texas and lauded local officials amid mounting criticism that they failed to warn residents quickly enough that a deadly wall of water was coming their way","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-tours-texas-flood-sites-and-defends-officials-amid-mounting-questions-about-response/article69803212.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/mtsyw/article69803216.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-07-11T190257Z_1741867976_RC2HKFAFZ7TK_RTRMADP_3_USA-WEATHER-TEXAS-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-12 00:10:34","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.167},{"id":340773020,"title":"World News | Colombian Authorities Arrest Alleged Leader of Italian Mafia in Latin America","text":"Bogota (Colombia), Jul 11 (AP) Colombian authorities said Friday they captured an alleged leader of the Italian 'Ndrangheta mafia in Latin America who is accused of overseeing cocaine shipments and managing illegal trafficking routes to Europe. Police identified the suspect as Giuseppe Palermo, also known as “Peppe,” an Italian who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, which called for his arrest in 196 countries.

He was apprehended on the street in Colombia's capital Bogota during a coordinated operation between Colombian, Italian and British authorities, as well as Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, according to an official report. Palermo is believed to be part of “one of the most tightly knit cells” of the 'ndrangheta mafia, said Carlos Fernando Triana, head of the Colombian police, in a message posted on X. Also Read | Pakistan Monsoon Mayhem: 98 Killed, 185 Injured As Rains and Flash Floods Wreak Havoc. The 'ndrangheta, one of Italy's most powerful and secretive criminal organizations, has extended its influence abroad and is widely accused of importing cocaine into Europe. The suspect “not only led the purchase of large shipments of cocaine in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador, but also controlled the maritime and land routes used to transport the drugs to European markets,” Triana added. Illegal cocaine production reached 3,708 tons in 2023, an increase of nearly 34% from the previous year, driven mainly by the expansion of coca leaf cultivation in Colombia, according to the United Nations.

A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Authorities say Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing him to flee. The suspect did not fire a single shot.\n\nRouth told District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Thursday he wanted to fire his court-appointed defense team. Cannon was separately the judge who dismissed Trump’s classified documents case.\n\nWhen Cannon asked Routh whether he wanted her to appoint new defense attorneys, he said, “No. I will represent myself.”\n\nCannon then closed the courtroom to reporters and the public for about an hour to discuss matters potentially involving attorney-client privilege. The hearing was scheduled to continue Thursday afternoon.\n\nIn a letter to the court filed Friday, Routh told Cannon, “It was ridiculous from the outset to consider a random stranger that knows nothing of who I am to speak for me. That was foolish and ignorant, and I am sorry-a childish mistake.”\n\nRouth claimed his lawyers “refuse to answer my questions” and are “ignoring all I say.”\n\n“They do not want the case and I no longer want to listen to what a horrible a person I am- I can beat my own self-up,” he added.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.\n\nProsecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before the assassination attempt. \n\nPolice obtained help from a witness who prosecutors said informed officers he saw a person fleeing. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested, and the witnesses confirmed it was the person he had seen, prosecutors say.\n\nThe assassination attempt came months after gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks grazed Trump’s ear with a bullet during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024.

Those weapons could be transferred to Ukraine, with European countries buying replacements from the U.S., he said.\n\n“It’s a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a (U.S.) factory and get it there,” Rubio told reporters during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\nUkraine badly needs more U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russian ballistic and cruise missiles. The Trump administration has gone back and forth about providing more vital military aid to Ukraine more than three years into Russia’s invasion.\n\nAfter a brief pause in some weapons shipments, Trump said he would keep sending defensive weapons to Ukraine. U.S. officials said this week that some were on their way.\n\nDetails still are being worked out on Trump’s plan\n\nNATO itself doesn’t send weapons to Ukraine or otherwise own or handle arms — that is done by its 32 member nations — but it does coordinate the deliveries of weapons to a logistics hub in Poland, bordering Ukraine. The alliance itself ships items like medical supplies and fuel.\n\n“Allies continue to work to ensure that Ukraine has the support they need to defend themselves against Russia’s aggression,” NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said. “This includes urgent efforts to procure key supplies from the United States, including air defense and ammunition.”\n\nGermany, Spain and other European countries possess Patriot missile systems, and some have placed orders for more, Rubio said.\n\nThe U.S. is encouraging its NATO allies to provide “the defensive systems that Ukraine seeks … since they have them in their stocks, and then we can enter into financial agreements with them, with us, where they can purchase the replacements,” Rubio said.\n\nA senior NATO military official said Trump spoke to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte about the plan but noted that the details were “still being worked out.”\n\nU.S. weapons already in Europe could be transferred to Ukraine under Trump’s proposal, as could American-made weapons previously purchased by allies.\n\n“NATO has effective mechanisms in place to make something like this possible,” the official said.\n\nA senior European defense official said it was their understanding that European nations would purchase U.S. weapons for Ukraine under the plan.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nUkraine is seeking more coveted Patriot air defense systems\n\nRussia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses by launching major aerial attacks. This week, Russia fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones at Ukraine, topping previous barrages for the third time in two weeks.\n\nUkraine has asked other countries to supply it with an additional 10 Patriot systems and missiles, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday. Germany is ready to provide two systems, and Norway has agreed to supply one, he said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday that officials “stand ready to acquire additional Patriot systems from the U.S. and make them available to Ukraine.”\n\nAsked how many Patriot systems Germany is interested in buying, Merz didn’t give a number. But he said he spoke to Trump a week ago “and asked him to deliver these systems.”\n\nIn addition to the Patriots, the weaponry that could be sold to NATO members includes advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles, shorter-range missiles and Howitzer rounds, according to a person familiar with the internal White House debate. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private discussions.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment seeking more details.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has been in touch with Trump in recent days, said it’s in U.S. national security interests to sell weapons to Ukraine, and “Europe can pay for them.”\n\n“We have the best weapons. They sure as hell know how to use them,” Graham said in an AP interview in Rome while attending a meeting on the sidelines of a Ukraine recovery conference.\n\nAllies purchasing U.S. weapons for Ukraine would get around a possible stalemate in funding for Kyiv once an aid package approved last year runs out. Even with broad support in Congress for backing Ukraine, it’s unclear if more funding would be approved.\n\nTrump’s evolving stance on Putin\n\nTrump’s efforts to facilitate Ukraine’s weapon supply come as he has signaled his displeasure with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At a Cabinet meeting this week, he said he was “not happy” with Putin over a conflict that was “killing a lot of people” on both sides.\n\nRussia’s bigger army is pressing hard on parts of the 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line, where thousands of soldiers on both sides have died since the Kremlin ordered the invasion in February 2022.\n\nGraham says Trump has given him the go-ahead to push forward with a bill he’s co-sponsoring that calls, in part, for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil. Trump said Tuesday that he’s “looking at it very strongly.”\n\nIn the NBC News interview, Trump teased that he will make a major announcement on Russia next week.\n\nThe U.S. president also has had a tumultuous relationship with Zelenskyy, which reached a low point during an Oval Office blowup in February when Trump berated him for being “disrespectful.” The relationship has since shown signs of rebounding.\n\nThe two leaders spoke by phone last week about Ukraine’s air defenses. Zelenskyy said Thursday that talks with Trump have been “very constructive.”\n\nImpact of the latest Russian attacks\n\nIn the latest attacks, a Russian drone barrage targeted the center of Kharkiv just before dawn Friday, injuring nine people and damaging a maternity hospital in Ukraine’s second-largest city, officials said.\n\n“There is no silence in Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. A daytime drone attack on the southern city of Odesa also injured nine.\n\nKyiv, the Ukrainian capital, has endured repeated and intensifying drone attacks in recent weeks, as have many other regions of the country, mostly at night.\n\nZelenskyy urged Ukraine’s Western partners to quickly follow through on pledges they made at the international meeting in Rome on Thursday. Ukraine needs more interceptor drones to bring down Russian-made Shahed drones, he said.\n\nAuthorities said Friday that they’re establishing a comprehensive drone interception system under a project called Clear Sky. It includes a $6.2 million investment in interceptor drones, operator training and new mobile response units, the Kyiv Military Administration said.\n\n“We found a solution. … That’s the key,” Zelenskyy said. “We need financing. And then, we will intercept.”\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Now, with global tensions rising, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is testing whether that distance might yet be a source of strength.\nThe answer, he seems to believe, lies in recalibrating Australia’s relationships with friends and rivals alike. As both critics from the political left and independent observers assail the cost and risks of Aukus – and the right demands ever-greater defence spending – Albanese has chosen his moment to assert a new doctrine: not America first, nor China first, but Australia first.\nIn doing so, he has looked to the past for inspiration. At last weekend’s commemoration of wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese delivered a speech that signalled this new direction, just days before his arrival in Beijing for a state visit.\nHe lauded Curtin as the “father” of the US-Australian alliance – now “a pillar of our foreign policy” – not only for turning to Washington following Britain’s disastrous surrender of Singapore to invading Japanese forces during World War II, but for insisting that Australia’s foreign and defence posture must be rooted in strategic reality, not tradition.\n\n“Curtin restored in Labor what he revived in Australia: unity and purpose in times of crisis and uncertainty; ambition and cooperation in pursuit of opportunity, and above all, the confidence and determination to think and act for ourselves – to follow our own course and shape our own future,” Albanese said last Saturday of his long-ago predecessor as Labor party leader.\nAlbanese’s speech followed an emphatic election victory in May, granting his government another three years in office and, with support from the Greens in the Senate, the latitude for bold policy decisions. There is no indication his administration will abandon the Aukus nuclear-submarine programme or the Anzus alliance with the United States and New Zealand, both of which retain broad public backing; a recent Lowy Institute poll found six in 10 Australians surveyed believed the country should do more to deter China militarily.\nBut the return of Donald Trump to the White House has caused trust in the US to plummet, with only a third of Australians now regarding America as a responsible global actor and a mere quarter seeing Trump as a competent leader. The Lowy poll also found deep wariness of China, with 80 per cent expressing concern over Beijing’s ambitions, and just 16 per cent viewing President Xi Jinping as a responsible head of state.\n\n‘Two fingers’ to the US\nAlbanese’s speech was, in part, a direct answer to recent US demands that Australia raise defence spending to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product. He had earlier curtly rejected such calls, testily asserting that Australia’s defence strategy would remain a sovereign imperative. James Curran, a professor of modern history at the University of Sydney and author of Australia’s China Odyssey: From Euphoria to Fear, called it Albanese’s most significant address as prime minister.\n“He was clearly giving a polite ‘two fingers’ to Washington’s calls we increase our defence spend,” Curran said. “He invoked the Curtin myth and World War II to make the point that we have a close relationship with the United States. But he made it very clear that it is the Australian government that will decide what is in Australia’s national interest.”\nWhile Albanese’s government has outlined ambitious plans to modernise the military, deep dysfunction exists within the defence sector. Reports suggest dozens of senior officers and bureaucrats face imminent dismissal as part of a sweeping shake-up.\nDefence Minister Richard Marles has argued that boosting spending without tackling structural issues such as workforce shortages, procurement inefficiencies and an institutional culture lacking transparency and accountability would do little to enhance capability. Sober minds in Washington may recognise this logic, and in any event, Australia’s long-standing ties with the US – rooted in shared values, culture and history – give Canberra significant bargaining power, even with a volatile Trump administration.\n\nThese bonds run deep, tested in conflicts from World War I onwards. Australia hosts a network of joint military facilities, including those vital for signals intelligence, missile launch confirmation across Asia and the Middle East, and relaying communications to warships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. A rapidly expanding naval base in Western Australia is set to house British and US nuclear-powered submarines from 2027, while the country’s Northern Territory hosts rotating deployments of US marines and nuclear-capable bombers.\nAustralia also forms the southern anchor of the “democratic defence diamond”, according to Troy Lee-Brown, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia’s Defence and Security Institute, referring to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, grouping that links India and Japan to the US-Australia axis.\n“The Quad gives considerable strategic depth to handle contingencies across the Asia-Pacific, and Australia is essentially a huge unsinkable aircraft carrier,” he said. “It is a vital deployment and logistics hub for America’s military presence in the Asia-Pacific.”\nAustralia is essentially a huge unsinkable aircraft carrier\nTroy Lee-Brown, security researcher\nAlbanese’s recent assertion of sovereignty comes as Australia quietly fumes over the imposition of tariffs on its exports by the US – its third-largest trading partner after China and Japan – despite a free-trade agreement signed in 2005.\nHis speech also reflects the shifting role of Australia as a middle power in a region of some 4 billion people confronted with the most volatile strategic environment since the second world war.\nAllegiances across the region are rapidly evolving under the twin pressures of Chinese assertiveness and the Trump administration’s apparent disregard for established alliances, as Lee-Brown observes.\n“A lot of countries in Southeast Asia were split, some in the Chinese camp, some in the US camp, some in the middle,” he said. “But with the behaviour of the Trump administration, most are going to end up in the China camp.”\n“India is interesting in that they’ve been forging ahead with their ‘Act-East’ policy. India is really pushing its relationships with Singapore and Indonesia, but also the Philippines with its sale of BrahMos missiles, and its strategic alliance with Vietnam.”\n\n‘Poor white trash of Asia’?\nLong dismissed by its detractors as an arrogant newcomer to the region relevant only by virtue of its relationship with the US, Australia’s transformation since the abandonment of the White Australia policy in the early 1970s has been profound. Today, while half the population claims British or European ancestry, one-third of its 28 million people are immigrants – many from China, India, the Philippines and Vietnam – with large diasporas from elsewhere in Asia strengthening Australia’s ties to its immediate neighbourhood.\nAccording to this year’s Lowy Institute poll, Australians generally hold Japan and Singapore in particularly high esteem, with South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia close behind. More than half view Indonesia and India favourably.\nThe institute’s 2024 Asia Power Index ranked Australia fifth behind the US, China, India and Japan. Susanna Patton, director of Lowy’s Southeast Asia programme, said Australia scored highly for diplomatic and cultural influence, as well as economic exchanges. Its rating for defence networks slipped marginally, yet it remained second only to the US and ahead of Japan.\n“I’ve got a view that goes against a lot of what you hear about Australia’s engagement with Asia, which tends to be very negative and tends to be framed through the prism that Australia’s engagement with Asia used to be better than what it is now,” she said. “But if you look at the facts of Australia’s current relationships in Asia, they are much more substantial and much more positive than they have been in the past.”\n\nAustralia’s trading relationships with China, Japan and South Korea are robust, and trade with India has surged since the signing of a free-trade agreement in 2022.\nTrade with Southeast Asia has grown in nominal terms over the past 20 years, though the region’s share of Australia’s total trade remains stuck at around 15 per cent. Similarly, investment in the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations – one of the world’s largest trading blocs – remains modest, comprising only 3.4 per cent of Australia’s total overseas investment in 2022.\nSpeaking on Thursday at an event in Kuala Lumpur, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong offered Southeast Asia reassurances about her country’s “role in the region”.\n“Australia still believes in the logic of the post-war economic order,” she told the audience at the Institute for Strategic and International Studies’ Malaysia Forum on Australia and Southeast Asia. “Economic security doesn’t have to be code for putting up walls. It is about making the right investments, with the right partners, at the right time.”\nWe may be bound by the geography that fate has chosen for us, but we are strengthened by the partnerships that we choose for ourselves\nAustralian Foreign Minister Penny Wong\nTouching on the issue of sovereignty, Wong said “there are some who want to define Australia’s security simply in terms of what China does or the United States does in the region. Or even more simply define Australia by our traditional allies and partners alone.”\n“This has never sat well with me,” she said. “We may be bound by the geography that fate has chosen for us, but we are strengthened by the partnerships that we choose for ourselves.”\nParadoxically, Australia’s devotion to free trade has undermined its economic diversity. Over four decades, it has become a champion of open markets, signing 18 free trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. But its exports are now dominated by “rocks and crops” – low value-added outputs such as minerals, energy and agricultural goods highly vulnerable to economic ups and downs.\nHarvard University’s Growth Lab ranks Australia 105th out of 145 countries for economic complexity – a proxy for resilience. Since 1995, it has tumbled 43 places on the Atlas of Economic Complexity, now nestled between Botswana and the Ivory Coast. The country’s lack of export diversification, the index cautions, could threaten its future prosperity.\nIn 1964, Donald Horne’s book The Lucky Country described Australia as a nation rich in resources but hindered by unimaginative leadership. Two decades later, Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew warned Australia to reform or risk becoming “the poor white trash of Asia” – a reminder that mineral wealth alone is neither necessary nor sufficient for enduring prosperity and influence.","summary":"For much of its history, Australia’s identity has been defined by distance – geographical, political, psychological.

The components imported so far could be meant for trial production, according to industry experts, given that their volume is a fraction of that for the older models.Various components and sub-assemblies such as the display assembly, cover glass, mechanical housing and integrated rear camera modules began arriving in India last month, as per the customs data.Components for the upcoming iPhone 17 mobile phone model made up about 10% of the components imported by Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn — officially known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd — from China in June.

While the iPhone 14 assembly in India started six weeks after it began in China, the iPhone 15 was manufactured almost simultaneously in the two countries.By 2024, India had started participating in Apple’s new product introduction (NPI) process for the base models of the iPhone 16, ending the exclusivity of China. Apple plans to continue on that trajectory with the iPhone 17, executives said.However, following an exodus of skilled Chinese engineers from Foxconn’s India factories, amid China’s efforts to restrict technology transfer to rival manufacturing hubs including India, scaling up the iPhone 17 mass production would be a challenge, they said.Crucial link“Chinese engineers are crucial because iPhone 17 manufacturing involves complex precision machining of many small parts, and even a 1 mm difference can cause a product to fail quality testing. They are needed to train employees on the intricate assembly processes and specific moulds for components,” an industry executive tracking Apple’s manufacturing growth in India said on condition of anonymity.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News oniPhone 17Foxconn IndiaiPhone production in IndiaApple supplierChina to India manufacturing shiftiPhone exports to USApple manufacturing strategytrial production iPhone 17AppleDonald Trump\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Paxton raised almost $3 million in the second quarter while the Cornyn-backing group Texas for a Conservative Majority PAC says it raised $10.9 million during the same time frame, according to The Hill.\n\nJust Thursday, Paxton’s wife, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, announced that she is divorcing him on “biblical grounds,” citing “recent discoveries” she has made.\n\n“I believe marriage is a sacred covenant and I have earnestly pursued reconciliation,” Angela Paxton wrote on X. “But in light of recent discoveries, I do not believe that it honors God or is loving to myself, my children, or Ken to remain in the marriage.”\n\nAngela Paxton alleged that her husband committed adultery and said the couple stopped living together a year ago.\n\nAll of that took a back burner on Friday as the men mourned the loss of more than 135 people who had died in central Texas flooding. Paxton and Cornyn each posted on X about Trump’s visit, but did not mention each other.\n\n“Thank you [President Trump] and [first lady Melania Trump] for coming to Texas,” Cornyn wrote. “Your heartfelt commitment to the Lone Star State’s rescue and recovery efforts, to the victims, and to those still missing is deeply appreciated. We will keep searching for those unaccounted for & praying for all who have lost loved ones.”\n\nKen Paxton sounded a similar note. \n\n“Today, I joined President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, and federal, state, and local officials for a roundtable in Kerr County following the deadly flooding that has devastated so many of our communities,” he wrote.\n\n“I’d like to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and swift action to support Texans throughout this crisis, which has undoubtedly saved lives,” Paxton continued. “Our prayers continue to be with the families impacted by this tragedy and everyone on the ground who has continually worked around the clock to respond to this catastrophic natural disaster.”\n\nTrump promises to rebuild, lashes out at ‘evil’ reporter during Texas visit\n\nThe Texas GOP primary will be held March 3, 2026. \n\nOn the Democratic side, former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred has launched a bid, though winning the race will be difficult in a state that Trump won by 14 points last year. Allred lost a Senate bid to Cruz in the same election.","summary":"Despite fighting a bitter GOP primary battle against each other, Sen.

(WAVY) A local organization is sharing the impact a current federal funding freeze could have on kids across the country, with more than $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs currently being withheld, done to ensure the grants align with President Donald Trump’s priorities. \n\nKevin Will, president of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeast Virginia, explained after-school care is in jeopardy at clubs nationwide because of this. \n\n“After-school to kids is just as important as the academic day to make sure that they’re growing, that they’re developing,” Will said. \n\nHe said Boys and Girls Clubs offers this after-school care. \n\n“We see these kids directly after school,” he said. “They come, they get a healthy meal and a snack. And then we go straight into homework assistance. We go into our programming areas, whether that’s good decision-making, whether that’s art, whether that’s STEM or whether that’s healthy lifestyles in their, not only physical wellbeing, but their mental wellbeing.” \n\nDuring the funding freeze, Will said what is at stake for Boys and Girls Clubs across the country is the 21st Century Community Learning Center funds. If this funding is lost, Will said that the organization as a whole could close 1,000 locations nationwide. \n\n“There would be a chance of 14 … Boys and Girls Clubs closing throughout Virginia,” Will said.\n\nHowever, he said that the southeast Virginia clubs would not close. \n\n“We will do everything in our power to make sure that our kids are thriving and that we’re here for our families and our community,” Will said. \n\nHe reiterated that after-school care is pivotal for the success of youth everywhere. \n\n“My hope with this issue is that it really shines a light on the importance of after-school, of having a productive place to go grow,” Will said, “and really, giving each kid an equal access to succeed is, to me, it’s really shining a light on the importance of that.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVIRGINIA BEACH, Va.

They were informed that their positions were being “abolished” and that those notified would lose access to the State Department at 5 p.m.\n\nA number of those affected headed outside the State Department with signs to protest the mass layoffs. Among them read statements like “We all deserve better” and “Thank you to America’s diplomats.”\n\n“It’s just heartbreaking to stand outside these doors right now and see people coming out in tears, because all they wanted to do was serve this country,” New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim said of the scene.\n\n“We talk about people in uniform serving. But foreign service officers take an oath of office, just like military officers,” Anne Bodine, a retired State Department staffer, told the AP. “This is not the way to treat people who served their country and who believe in ‘America First.’”\n\nNews of the reorganization first came back in May as part of Trump’s aggressive efforts to downsize the federal government – much under the purview of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The State Department announced it aimed for an 18% cut in workforce. It is far from the only sector under Trump’s hammer. USAID was downsized and folded into the State Department last week, and the Department of Education is being eyed to be cut entirely by the president.\n\nTrump also issued warnings Thursday night to his fellow Republicans about siding with him when it came to defunding efforts for PBS and NPR. The choice was either do as he says or lose his support.\n\n“It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,” the president wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe continued: “Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.

Releasing its 15-page report, a month after the fatal plane accident that happened in around 30 seconds after lift off, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday also said fuel samples taken from bowsers and tanks used to refuel the aircraft were tested at the DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) Lab and were found satisfactory.

On June 12, Air India's Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI 171 en-route to London Gatwick crashed into a medical hostel complex soon after take-off from Ahmedabad, killing 260 people, including 241 persons who were onboard the plane. One passenger survived the crash.

The aircraft took off at 08:08:39 UTC (13:38:39 IST) and at about 08:09:05 UTC (13:39:05 IST) one of the pilots transmitted 'MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY'. \"The ATCO (Air Traffic Controller) enquired about the call sign. ATCO did not get any response but observed the aircraft crashing outside the airport boundary and activated the emergency response,\" the report said. Citing the plane's Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR), AAIB noted that immediately after the aircraft achieved the maximum recorded airspeed, \"engine 1 and engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec\". As per the report, the engine N1 and N2 began to decrease from their take-off values as the fuel supply to the engines was cut off. \"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,\" it said. The preliminary report was widely anticipated to throw more light on what could have led to the crash, which was one of the worst in India in decades, and also it was the first accident involving a Boeing 787 aircraft that resulted in hull loss. AAIB said the wreckage site activities, including drone photography/ videography have been completed and the wreckage has been moved to a secure area near the airport. \"Both engines were retrieved from the wreckage site and quarantined at a hangar in the airport. Components of interest for further examinations have been identified and quarantined,\" it said. According to the report, fuel samples taken from the bowsers and tanks used to refuel the aircraft were tested at the DGCA's Lab and were found satisfactory. \"Very limited amount of fuel samples could be retrieved from the APU filter and Refuel/Jettison valve of left wing. The testing of these samples will be done at a suitable facility capable of carrying out the test with the limited available quantity,\" it said. AAIB is gathering additional details based on initial leads and data downloaded from the forward Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorder (EAFR) is being analysed. \"At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to B787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers,\" the report said. The plane that crashed was powered by GEnx-1B engines. Statements of the witnesses and the surviving passenger have been obtained by the Investigators. The complete analysis of postmortem reports of the crew and the passengers is being undertaken to corroborate aeromedical findings with the engineering appreciation, AAIB said. The probe is continuing and the investigation team will review and examine additional evidence, records and information that is being sought from the stakeholders. There were 230 passengers on board, out of which 15 passengers were in business class and 215 passengers were in economy class including two infants. The Pilot In Command (PIC) had more than 15,638 hours of flying experience while the first officer had over 3,403 hours of flying experience. Air India on Saturday said it is working closely with regulators and other stakeholders, and will continue to cooperate with the authorities in the ongoing probe into the plane crash. Boeing, in a statement, said it continues to support the investigation and Air India. \"We will defer to the AAIB to provide information about AI171, in adherence with the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization protocol known as Annex 13,\" it added.

The employees affected were also told they'd lose access to the State Department headquarters in Washington D.C., their emails and their shared drives by 5pm on Friday.\n\nThe layoffs come only days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump's executive order allowing mass layoffs across the federal government to proceed, despite ongoing legal challenges.\n\nEmployees, some of whom were crying, were seen exiting the State Department holding boxes of their belongings.\n\nStaffers who weren't laid off lined up in the lobby and applauded for their former colleagues.\n\nOutside the building were dozens of former colleagues, ambassadors, members of Congress and others who were protesting.\n\nSigns seen in the crowd said, 'Thank you to America’s diplomats,' and 'We all deserve better.'\n\n'We talk about people in uniform serving. But foreign service officers take an oath of office, just like military officers,' Anne Bodine, who retired from the State Department in 2011 after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, told the AP. \n\n'This is not the way to treat people who served their country and who believe in \"America First.\"'\n\nFriday's firings were part of President Donald Trump's mission to dramatically shrink the size of the federal government. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, though not yet commenting on the layoffs, was the one who proposed to Congress the reorganization of his department in late May.\n\nThe State Department also lauded the Supreme Court ruling that allowed this reorganization to go through unchallenged.\n\n'Today’s near unanimous decision from the Supreme Court further confirms that the law was on our side throughout this entire process. We will continue to move forward with our historic reorganization plan at the State Department, as announced earlier this year,' the department posted on X, which was later reposted by Rubio himself.\n\nRubio said officials took 'a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused.'\n\n'It’s not a consequence of trying to get rid of people.

He reportedly barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2008, and said in 2019, \"I knew him like everybody in Palm Beach knew him,\" insisting, \"I was not a fan.\"\n\nHowever, investigative reporter Dylan Howard wrote in Epstein: Dead Men Tell No Tales, that's not exactly the truth. \n\n\"In the early 90s the two were constant companions,\" Howard shared. \"A (video) from 1992 shows the two pervy playboys whispering and laughing, surrounded by women at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nIn 2000, Trump and Epstein were photographed attending an event on the same property with Prince Andrew and Trump’s wife, Melania.BFF'sTrump himself has previously confessed to a connection with Epstein, telling New York magazine in 2002: \"I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. He’s a terrific guy.\n\n\"It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\"\n\nAttorney Spencer Kuvin, who represents one of Epstein’s victims, shared: \"We certainly knew that Mr. Trump was a close friend of Mr. Epstein during those exact years that Mr. Epstein was molesting these young girls. \n\n\"These are two gentlemen that definitely ran in the same circles.\"Open AccessKuvin said Trump had open access to Epstein's home anytime he wanted and sometimes would just visit his BFF unannounced.\n\n\"On one occasion, we were aware that Mr. Trump had come to the house and stopped by and just ate in Mr. Epstein's kitchen,\" Kuvin continued. \"And just sat there, and chatted, and ate in the kitchen with him.\n\n\"So, this was more than just a casual acquaintance. This was somebody that he knew. They spoke with one another, they socialized with one another.\"\n\nAccording to Howard, Epstein's flight logs showed an entry for Trump on the \"Lolita Express\" – the plane he used to allegedly traffic underage girls. \n\n\"Not only was Trump's phone number found in Epstein’s little black book,\" he wrote, \"but also 12-14 additional ways to contact him.\"Not So Fast!Epstein's lawyer recently weighed in on the debate, claiming the pedophile confessed the truth about Donald Trump’s connection with his notorious \"dirt files\" nine days before his mysterious prison death – and the answer was no.\n\nAttorney David Schoen wrote on X: \"I can say authoritatively, unequivocally, and definitively that he had no information to hurt President Trump.\n\n\"I specifically asked him!\"\n\nHe continued: \"I discussed this subject with Mr. Epstein at the time when it would be in his best possible interests to implicate others, and he made clear that Donald Trump did nothing wrong and that he had no damaging information against him.\"","summary":"Trump has long denied ever having close ties with the convicted sex

commitment to helping rebuild the Central Texas community Friday on \"The Will Cain Show.\" \"What they've gone through, nobody's ever seen anything like it, frankly. When you have a wave that's almost 40 feet high just come rushing through this, you would think it was a dam that burst,\" Trump said on \"The Will Cain Show.\" \"It's a tough thing that they're going through, but it's an amazing community,\" he continued. The president, along with first lady Melania Trump, arrived in Kerrville, Texas, Friday, following massive floods that have taken the lives of more than 120 people. They met with local officials and first responders who are navigating the aftermath of flash floods that devastated the region, after the Guadalupe River surged more than 22 feet in just a matter of hours. TRUMP, FIRST LADY MOURN YOUNG LIVES LOST IN TEXAS FLOODS, PRAISE FIRST RESPONDERS DURING KERRVILLE ROUNDTABLE During his visit, Trump met with the families of some of the flood victims, including those from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp founded nearly 100 years ago for girls.

What could be more harmful than a series of rulings misrepresented as emergencies in order to keep us in the dark about how justices voted, what evidence supported their rulings, and why they classified these issues as emergencies in the first place?\n\nBravo to those few Supreme Court justices who refuse to go along with this sham and to those lower-level judges who have the courage and integrity to take their oaths and duties seriously. Unfortunately, while Supreme Court justices took oaths to the Constitution and the people, most have chosen to pledge their allegiances to campaign promises instead.\n\nLinda Thorlakson\nCastro Valley\n\nCould sirens have\nsaved lives in Texas?\n\nMy chiropractor was born in Hawaii and grew up there. So when I saw him for an adjustment on July 9, I asked him what sort of warning system Hawaii has when dangerous weather is coming. After all, his native state experiences hurricanes, tsunamis and even volcanic activity.\n\nWith no hesitation, he answered, “Sirens. And they are tested on the first of every month.”\n\nHawaiians know what natural phenomena they live with and are as ready as they can be. In the hill country of Texas, local government officials could not bring themselves to spend the money on a siren warning system in an area prone to flash flooding and now wallow in the consequences. Too bad.\n\nI can only think of the Boy Scout motto: Be prepared.\n\nMasked ICE agents\nlack moral authority\n\nWhy aren’t we paying attention to the source of the masked men? Where did they come from? Was there a pool of angry, faceless men just waiting for the call? How many more are ready for duty now that the regime has oodles of money to hire with?\n\nIf these men and their lack of empathy did not exist, the paramilitary would collapse. I don’t buy that they were created by violent video games or groomed in social media chat rooms. Something had to break inside them first: the sense of right and wrong, of good vs. evil. That has to be absent, or at least totally suspended, for them to behave as they do.\n\nThese are the men our country is giving authority to — do we think it will be easier to fight back once they’ve been emboldened by early success? Really?

Allow anyone who wants to compete with men and men’s teams, including people born women who identify as men, nonbinary people, people born men who identify as women, or even people born women who identify as women. But restrict women’s sports to people born women who remain women.\n\nThat way, no one would be excluded from participating in competitive athletics.\n\nMarilyn Langlois\n\nTrump’s law shows\ndisdain for most\n\nRe: “Trump signs his bill to law” (Page A1, July 5).\n\nThere are those in our government who hug the flag, professing their love for America and Jesus. But their actions speak louder than their words. Every action so far has taken from us, who are designated by our Founding Fathers as the self-rulers of the United States.\n\nThomas Jefferson did not write “we the White men” or “we the Christians.” He clearly says, “We the People.” Jesus never said “read the bottom line” or ‘balance the budget” at the expense of the poorest of us. We, the people, are being treated as collateral damage, and those in the current government justify their actions with patriotism.\n\nPerhaps those making decisions for the rest of us do love America and Jesus. Too bad they don’t love us.\n\nNancy Thornton\n\nRepublicans are left\nto explain themselves\n\nRe: “House approves Trump’s tax bill” (Page A1, July 4).\n\nTo the Republicans in the House and the Senate — especially those who pretended they were going to vote against Trump’s big, ugly bill — I say, “Cowards, the lot of you.”\n\nGood luck explaining to your constituents how and why you sold them out to save your own political skin.\n\nAnne Stafford\n\nOpening Hetch Hetchy\ncould relieve Yosemite\n\nAs national parks like Yosemite grapple with DOGE’s cuts and Donald Trump’s budget proposal, can folks around the Bay Area please re-evaluate using Hetch Hetchy as a water reservoir?\n\nWith unpleasant overcrowding at Yosemite these days, demolishing O’Shaughnessy Dam and reopening Hetch Hetchy would give people much-desired elbow room.\n\nAnd it would be a step toward the ideal of living in greater harmony with nature, instead of making perpetual demands upon it.\n\nAs a guy who used to live there, I ask folks in the Bay Area to please advocate on behalf of national parks.

According to the Qatari network, the map was presented by the Israeli delegation during ongoing talks in Doha and is seen by some sources as laying the groundwork for a long-term displacement plan in Gaza. Al Jazeera reported that the map maintains full Israeli control over the city of Rafah and outlines a buffer zone extending up to three kilometers deep along the Gaza-Egypt border. The proposal, according to the network, would annex approximately 40% of the Gaza Strip, prevent around 700,000 displaced Palestinians from returning to their homes and concentrate them instead in displacement centers in Rafah. Meanwhile, Egypt’s Al Ghad TV reported that negotiations over the Israeli withdrawal have been frozen until the arrival of U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in Doha. The report said talks are currently focused on securing guarantees for a potential deal, the mechanics of a prisoner and hostage exchange and the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Witkoff’s upcoming visit to the Qatari capital is reportedly contingent on reaching preliminary understandings on these key issues. His presence is expected to address the deadlock surrounding the proposed Israeli map, which remains one of the most contentious points in the negotiation. Modern-day concentration camp Israel is insisting on keeping IDF forces stationed along the Morag Corridor, which separates Khan Younis from Rafah, as a way to maintain control over the Rafah area, where Israeli officials hope to establish a “humanitarian city” for displaced Palestinians. Israeli and Western officials told The New York Times they had been briefed on the concept, but so far, there are no signs of its implementation. The report also noted that critics of Israel have likened the idea of a “humanitarian city” to a “modern-day concentration camp,” where residents would be confined and barred from returning to northern Gaza. In Doha, negotiators continue to await the arrival of Witkoff, who is expected to personally oversee the indirect proximity talks between Israel and Hamas, with Qatari mediators shuttling messages between the delegations. His visit was reportedly delayed earlier this week—an indication of difficulties in the negotiations—and it remains unclear when he will travel to Qatar.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel on Thursday after a four-day visit to the United States, during which he held two meetings at the White House with President Donald Trump. The talks focused on a potential hostage deal and a Gaza ceasefire. While early in the visit, both U.S. and Israeli officials expressed cautious optimism that an agreement could be reached soon—possibly by the weekend—hopes have since cooled. One senior Israeli official told CBS News on Wednesday that a deal could still be as much as 20 days away. Nevertheless, Netanyahu sounded more optimistic in an interview with Newsmax, published Thursday, saying he hoped a hostage deal could be completed within “days.” Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram","summary":"Al Jazeera publishes Israeli redeployment map, claiming it paves way for displacement plan and annexes 40% of Gaza; withdrawal talks frozen until Witkoff arrives","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bkpkyz18lg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/07/11/ryW0000aASgx/ryW0000aASgx_0_0_770_513_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 23:25:36","author":"Lior Ben Ari, Moran Azulay","authors":["Lior Ben Ari, Moran Azulay"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":340767172,"title":"FBI head wants resignation of attorney general over conflict in Epstein case — portal","text":"NEW YORK, July 12. /TASS/. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) head Kash Patel is unhappy with the reluctance of the US Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more documents on the case of financier Jeffrey Epstein and wants her resignation, The Daily Wire portal reported citing sources.\n\nAccording to their information, Patel also does not rule out that he will leave his position like his deputy Dan Bongino. Bongino had previously said in an ultimatum that he would not work with Bondi and would resign if she remained at the head of the Justice Department.\n\nEarlier, Fox News reported that a heated conversation took place between Bongino and Bondi on July 9. After that, the deputy head of the FBI did not appear at his workplace, probably taking a day off. CNN reported the FBI wanted to get more information on the Epstein case, but the Department of Justice refused to do so.\n\nOn July 6, the Axios portal reported that the Justice Department and the FBI had found no evidence of possible blackmail of influential people by Epstein, of an allegedly existing list of his clients, as well as any evidence of the theory of his murder. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that Epstein's \"client list,\" which was mentioned earlier by the Department of Justice, does not exist.\n\nAmerican entrepreneur Elon Musk later questioned whether US President Donald Trump could be trusted if the White House did not publish materials on the Epstein case. Trump and members of his team repeatedly promised during the election campaign to declassify the documents of the Epstein investigation and ensure maximum transparency of this story.\n\nEpstein was detained in July 2019. The prosecutor's office said that there was evidence that in 2002-2005 he organized visits to his Manhattan home by dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14. Epstein's friends and acquaintances included a large number of current and retired officials not only from the United States, but from many other countries, including former heads of state, major entrepreneurs and show stars.

And he has weathered criticism from relatives for not traveling alongside his wife and children. “He's got complicated grief and sorrow and his own emotional stress,” said Njoroge's attorney, Robert Clifford. “He's haunted by nightmares and the loss of his wife and children.” Also Read | Pakistan Monsoon Mayhem: 98 Killed, 185 Injured As Rains and Flash Floods Wreak Havoc. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. Clifford said his client intended to seek “millions” in damages on behalf of his wife and children, but declined to publicly specify an amount ahead of the trial. “The aviation team at Clifford Law Offices has been working round-the-clock in preparation for trial, but the mediator was able to help the parties come to an agreement,” Clifford said in a statement Friday. The proceedings were not expected to delve into technicalities involving the Max version of Boeing's bestselling 737 airplane, which has been the source of persistent troubles for the company since the Ethiopia crash and one the year before in Indonesia. A combined 346 people, including passengers and crew members, died in those crashes. In 2021, Chicago-based Boeing accepted responsibility for the Ethiopia crash in a deal with the victims' families that allowed them to pursue individual claims in U.S. courts instead of their home countries. Citizens of 35 countries were killed. Several families of victims have already settled. Terms of those agreements also were not made public. The jetliner heading to Nairobi lost control shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport and nose-dived into a barren patch of land. Investigators determined the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes were caused by a system that relied on a sensor that provided faulty readings and pushed the plane noses down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the Ethiopia crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system. This year, Boeing reached a deal with the U.S. Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecutions in both crashes. Among those killed were Njoroge's wife, Carolyne, and three small children, Ryan, age 6, Kellie, 4, and Rubi, 9 months old, the youngest to die on the plane. Njoroge also lost his mother-in-law, whose family has a separate case. Njoroge, who met his wife in college in Nairobi, was living in Canada at the time of the crash. He had planned to join his family in Kenya later. He testified before Congress in 2019 about repeatedly imagining how his family suffered during the flight, which lasted only six minutes. He has pictured his wife struggling to hold their infant in her lap with two other children seated nearby. “I stay up nights thinking of the horror that they must have endured,” Njoroge said. “The six minutes will forever be embedded in my mind. I was not there to help them. I couldn't save them.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Noem,\" led by The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of California and Public Counsel, a nonprofit, was filed against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and demands an immediate stop to the immigration raids in the Los Angeles area.

Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Lloyd Doggett of Texas, and Eric Sorenson of Illinois wrote to the president and Laura Grimm, who is performing the duties of the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well as Lt. Gen. William Graham Jr., the Chief of Engineers. \n\n“This tragedy echoes a troubling national pattern of accelerating flash flood disasters that have claimed lives,” the members of Congress wrote, noting the 46 killed in New York in September 2021, the 45 who died in July 2022, the 20 killed in Tennessee in August 2021, and the 250 who died across the Southeast in September of last year. \n\n“These events are not anomalies—they are harbingers of a climate-disrupted future,” they stated. \n\nDoggett represents a district in the Austin, Texas area, hours from the flood epicenter in Kerr County. Sorensen is a meteorologist. \n\nThey shared concerns that cuts mandated by the Department of Government Efficiency to the National Weather Service had delayed warnings regarding the floods in Texas. At least 121 people have died, and more than 160 remain missing.\n\n“While the National Weather Service (NWS) forecast may have been accurate, accurate weather forecasts are not enough,” the House Democrats wrote. “It is imperative that these warnings are adequately communicated to members of the public and in a way that prompts the appropriate lifesaving action by emergency managers, first responders, and the public at-large. We are concerned that there seems to have been a breakdown at this stage starting with the first flash flood watches issued on Thursday afternoon.”\n\nThe lawmakers noted the NWS has lost almost 15 percent of its nationwide staff since January. \n\n“The forecast accuracy and timeliness during this event in Texas was a testament to the dedication of the local NWS staff who flexed their schedules to ensure adequate coverage during such a high-impact event,” they wrote. “That is not a sustainable solution, nor is it reliable enough for the increasing incidence of dangerous weather events.”\n\nThe vacancies may have complicated efforts to work with officials on the local levels, The New York Times has reported. Some of the unfilled positions stem from before Trump’s second term. \n\nThe legislators called on NOAA and the Army Corps of Engineers to outline plans to adapt federal weather services to what they referred to as “the growing frequency of extreme precipitation events attributable to climate change.”\n\nTrump visited Kerrville on Friday, meeting with Texas officials, as he toured the damage from last week’s deadly flash floods. \n\nAlongside First Lady Melania Trump, the president shook hands with first responders. More than two dozen girls from the Camp Mystic summer camp died in the floods. Trump took part in an aerial tour of the Guadalupe River along with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Sen. Ted Cruz, and other officials. \n\nTrump visited the state as Texas lawmakers are facing increasing scrutiny over the handling of the floods and the state’s warning systems. \n\nThe president took part in a roundtable discussion with local officials, comparing the death toll and devastation to previous natural disasters he has seen during his time in office. \n\n“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Trump. “A little narrow river that becomes a monster.”\n\nHe went on to note that “dozens and dozens of precious children” had been “taken from us.”\n\nPhil McGraw, the TV personality known as Dr. Phil, took part in the discussion, saying, \"We know psychologically that the number one stressor that we can experience in life is the loss of a child.”\n\n\"And the worst situation that we can experience is when it's sudden and when it's violent. That's the worst thing that can happen, stress-wise, in life,” he added. \n\nIt was unclear why the TV personality attended the roundtable. \n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Acting Administrator David Richardson has been absent during the federal response to the floods in Texas, and he was not present for the discussion.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed back against the criticism that its previous cuts led to a slower response amid growing pushback against the administration’s previous calls to eliminate FEMA.\n\nA White House official told NewsNation on Friday that a FEMA review council is planning to “reform” the agency, rather than closing it down. \n\n“While Federal assistance was always intended to supplement state actions, not replace those actions, FEMA’s outsized role created a bloated bureaucracy that disincentivized state investment in their own resilience,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the outlet.","summary":"‘I’ve never seen anything like it.
