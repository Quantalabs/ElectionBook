\n\nTariffs are fees that importing businesses pay for their purchases of foreign goods.\n\nWhen tariffs are imposed, companies must choose between forking out more for foreign goods -- and potentially passing those costs on to consumers -- or looking for alternatives.\n\nThe levies bring in revenue for governments imposing them and are commonly used to protect local companies and workers from competition abroad.\n\nThe charges can make domestic goods more cost-competitive, encouraging buyers to select local producers instead.\n\n Arguments for \n\nTrump's position is that with tariffs on key imports, companies will move more manufacturing to the United States -- or buy US-made products -- to avoid additional fees.\n\nA commonly-used example is the \"chicken tax\" of the 1960s, when president Lyndon Johnson pushed back against European tariffs on American poultry with a levy on imported trucks.\n\nToday, a 25 percent US tariff remains on light trucks and this is a key reason that most pick-up trucks sold in the country are built in North America.\n\nThe White House says new tariffs could also bring in more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade -- about $600 billion per year -- although it has yet to release its full plans.\n\nWhile US-based companies generally pay the tariffs, White House officials have argued that foreign sellers would absorb the hike by lowering their prices as they seek to do business with the world's biggest economy.\n\nSupporters of Trump's trade policy also say that tariffs did not cause widespread inflation during his first White House term.\n\n Arguments against \n\nBut economists warn that tariff hikes can bring economic pain to affected sectors, and Trump's stop-start approach to announcing levies has sent financial markets tumbling.\n\nIf companies are unable to absorb additional fees and foreign sellers decline to lower their prices, the burden of tariffs could flow to other firms or consumers.\n\nTrump's 25 percent tariffs on autos and parts could cause the price of a typical car to surge by $5,000 to $10,000, said Wedbush analysts.\n\nEven US automakers producing cars in the country use up to 50 percent of foreign auto parts, they said.\n\n\"It would take three years to move 10 percent of the auto supply chain to the US and cost hundreds of billions with much complexity and disruption,\" Wedbush added.\n\nNationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic estimates that recent tariffs on Chinese goods, alongside steel and aluminum imports, would raise construction material prices by up to nine percent.\n\nPrices of appliances could also surge up to 15 percent, she said.\n\nTrump's tariffs attract retaliation too, and countermeasures triggered more than $27 billion in US agricultural export losses from mid-2018 to late-2019.\n\nThe Tax Foundation said: \"Based on actual revenue collections data, trade war tariffs have directly increased tax collections by $200 to $300 annually per US household, on average.\"\n\nThese estimates do not account for \"lower incomes as tariffs shrink output, nor the loss in consumer choice\" as buyers seek tariff-free alternatives, it added.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"US President Donald Trump has made tariffs a cornerstone of his trade policy, insisting that they will revive American manufacturing while swelling government coffers.","url":"https://yen.com.gh/business-economy/280572-tariffs-economic-liberation-straitjacket/","image":"https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/243d485c892c35d7.jpeg?v=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 01:12:03","author":"Samuel Obour","authors":["Samuel Obour"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.033},{"id":306267284,"title":"What next for Venezuela as Trump goes after oil revenues?","text":"President Donald Trump has revoked the licenses that allowed several transnational oil and gas companies to operate in Venezuela despite the country being under US sanctions.\n\nAfter US energy giant Chevron, Washington has ordered a handful of other energy firms, including Spain's Repsol and France's Maurel & Prom, to cease operating in Venezuela.\n\nTrump, who is seeking to force out authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro, has also announced plans for 25 percent tariffs on imports from any country buying Venezuelan oil and gas.\n\nWhat's next for the struggling Caribbean country, which has the world's largest-known oil reserves but has become increasingly isolated since July 2024 elections that President Nicolas Maduro is accused of stealing?\n\n Will the oil stop flowing? \n\nIn 2019, during his first term in office, Trump imposed an embargo on Venezuelan oil in response to 2018 elections that were already marred by fraud allegations.\n\nVenezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil giant was in freefall at the time, beset by corruption scandals, mismanagement and a crippling lack of investment.\n\nOil output buckled under the weight of the sanctions, falling from around three million barrels per day at the start of the 2000s to below 400,000 b/d in 2020.\n\nThe sector recovered some ground after former US president Joe Biden in 2022 eased the sanctions in return for a promise by Maduro to allow fair elections.\n\nBiden later reimposed most sanctions when it became clear that Maduro was not keeping his side of the bargain, but allowed Chevron to continue operations.\n\nToday, Venezuela produces around 900,000 barrels per day of which Chevron contributes about 220,000, Repsol about 60,000, and Maurel & Prom between 20,000 and 25,000.\n\nWashington has given Chevron and the other companies until May 27 to wind up their operations.\n\n\"PDVSA ...now has some operational capacity, although we don't know how big it is,\" Gilberto Morillo, PDVSA's former financial manager told AFP.\n\n Who will buy it? \n\nEven if PDVSA manages to keep pumping oil, finding a way to monetize it \"is another matter,\" Morillo said, pointing to the threatened 25-percent US tariffs on countries that buy its crude.\n\nIn February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels per day to China, 240,000 to the United States, and 70,000 to India and Spain.\n\nIn the past, sanctions forced PDVSA to discount the oil and to find partners to circumvent the sanctions.\n\nCaracas also attempted to trade crude oil through a cryptocurrency scheme, which ended with then oil minister Tareck El Aissami being jailed for corruption in a case that cost the country more than $15 billion, according to media reports.\n\n What impact for the economy? \n\nThe situation looks set to pile further misery on an economy already in tatters.\n\nThe price of dollars has soared on the black market as Venezuelans fear falling oil revenue will trigger another bout of hyperinflation and a return to the kind of deep recession the country experienced between 2014 and 2021.\n\nThe forced pullout of gas producers could also have an impact on the country's crumbling energy infrastructure, leading to more blackouts.\n\nRepsol pointed out that 85 percent of its operations in Venezuela were related to the production of natural gas, which it warned \"supports part of the electricity network.\"\n\nThe cancellation of the licenses will prevent PDVSA from using oil to pay the foreign energy companies for gas, as it had been doing, Morillo explained.\n\n\"If PDVSA can't pay them, then it generates a debt,\" he said.\n\nBut if the energy firms decide \"ok, we'll close down and leave...they would lose their entire investment,\" he argued.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"President Donald Trump has revoked the licenses that allowed several transnational oil and gas companies to operate in Venezuela despite the country being under US sanctions.

The policy has been legally challenged by religious organizations.\n\nSuch uncertainty and fear have spawned a flurry of rumors about suspected immigration raids and movements of ICE agents that ricochet across messaging apps and online platforms, leaving immigrant communities on edge.\n\nIn February, AFP's fact-checkers debunked a viral online video that claimed to show an undocumented Colombian woman being expelled from the United States. In reality, it was a fictionalized clip posted in 2023 by an American YouTuber.\n\nLast month, another online video purportedly showed undocumented immigrants being arrested from a US barbershop. AFP found the video staged, with the uniforms worn by the supposed immigration officials appearing inauthentic.\n\n\"In the current scary climate, it is hard to know what's true, what's inaccurate,\" the director of an immigration advocacy group in Washington told AFP, requesting anonymity.\n\nThe heightened fears among immigrant communities, he added, have made it harder to \"decipher fact from fiction.\"\n\n- 'Fear grabs you' –\n\nDespite an uptick in immigration arrests, authorities appear to be struggling to meet Trump's mass deportation goals.\n\nThe number of deportation flights since Trump took office on January 20 has been roughly the same as those in the final months of President Joe Biden's administration, US media reported, citing data collected by an immigration rights advocate.\n\nThat has done little to allay fears among the country's estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nThose concerns are aggravated by the government's shock-and-awe tactics of publicizing raids in major cities and footage of shackled migrants being loaded onto deportation flights.\n\nAmid a lack of reliable information and fears of stepped-up raids, many undocumented immigrants have gone underground, with some even withdrawing their children from school, advocacy groups say.\n\nMany also remain vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.\n\nElizabeth, an undocumented immigrant and mother of five, avoids the messaging groups filled with unverified information, choosing instead to stay vigilant and aware of her surroundings.\n\n\"If you don't know what is happening, fear grabs you,\" she told AFP, declining to share her real name and country of origin.\n\n\"Fear is a product of misinformation.\"","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/undocumented-migrants-turn-whatsapp-stay-011048963.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.co.uk/5ec1c6f71d3b4ffed36c5113b834c252","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 01:10:48","author":"Anuj Chopra","authors":["Anuj Chopra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":306265510,"title":"Virginia Giuffre's lawyer says friends are waiting for an update she revealed she was days from death following a bus crash - adding 'it's a very bad situation... we're hoping for better news'","text":"Jeffrey Epstein victim Virgina Giuffre's lawyer has said her friends are waiting for an update after she revealed she has just days to live following a crash with a school bus.\n\nOn Sunday, Ms Giuffre, née Roberts, 41, shared a photograph to Instagram of herself from her hospital bed, covered in bruises sustained in the smash.\n\nMs Giuffre - who was sex trafficked by Epstein and claims she was sexually assaulted as a teenager by Prince Andrew - said she is now suffering from kidney failure and begged to see her children 'one last time' before she dies after doctors said she had just four days to live.\n\nBrad Edwards, a US lawyer who represented Ms Giuffre in her previous legal cases, said it was a 'very bad situation'.\n\nHe said they were 'hoping for better news in the coming days' and that he hoped Ms Giuffre would pull through with good medical care.\n\nIn a statement given to the BBC, her spokesperson, Dini von Mueffing, said: 'Virginia has been in a serious accident and is receiving medical care in the hospital. She greatly appreciates the support and well wishes people are sending.'\n\nIn her Instagram post on Sunday Ms Giuffree wrote: 'They've given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology,' she captioned the photograph. This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won't bore anyone with the details.\n\n'But I think it's important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110kmh as we were slowing down for a turn, that no matter what your car is made of, it might as well be a tin can.'\n\nIn the wake of the news, Lady Victoria Hervey, who dated the disgraced Prince Andrew in 1999, took to Instagram to claim 'karma' had reached Giuffre. \n\nShe added: 'If Virginia Giuffre really does have days to live then a complete confession is needed. \n\nWithout evidence, the socialite wrote: 'I don't believe it though, the FBI are on her right now and arrest warrants are coming. She's conveniently dying to evade jail.\n\nShe added, again without evidence: 'I think it's time that Robert Giuffre who has custody of their teenage children to speak [sic]. I know he knows the truth of the fake photo and all her con jobs.'\n\n'[Giuffre] is the Queen of the fake photo after all. Hence I'm such a sceptic and don't believe in jumping to any conclusions right away from a visual.'\n\nMs Giuffre found herself at the centre of one of the world's biggest scandals when she launched legal action against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in 2015.\n\nShe alleged she was trafficked for sex at age 16 after his associate and ex-lover, Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from her job as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. \n\nMs Giuffre and Maxwell eventually reached an undisclosed settlement over a defamation case in 2017.\n\nEpstein took his own life in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, while Maxwell was jailed for 20 years in 2022 for conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors. \n\nMs Giuffre alleges Epstein forced her to have sex with Prince Andrew on at least three occasions when she was 17 and that she spent two days alone with the royal in New Mexico.\n\nIn 2022 she received an out-of-court settlement reported to be worth millions from the Duke of York.\n\nThe settlement accepted no liability and Andrew has always strongly rejected claims.\n\nBut he agreed to pay the unspecified amount to Ms Giuffre and her charity for victims' rights.\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, Andrew lost his military titles and royal patronages as well as the use of His Royal Highness title.\n\nHer father has previously spoken of his torment knowing he helped his daughter get a job alongside him at the Trump resort, before she was recruited as a masseuse by Maxwell. \n\n'As a parent you kind of ask the question, \"How do you not know your children are doing this?\",' Mr Roberts said previously.\n\n'But she's a very good actress. When she would come home from these trips she said nothing about it. It must have been killing her inside.\n\n'But for powerful people like that, they can threaten a young girl like that.' \n\nEven Ms Giuffre's father, Sky Roberts, was shocked by his daughter's late night Instagram post and also appeared to be in the dark about the incident. \n\n'Virginia my daughter, I love you and praying you get the correct treatment to live a long and healthy life,' he wrote.\n\n'If there is anything in the world, I can do to help you, please let me know. My spirit is with you now and holding your hand.'\n\nHe told DailyMail.com that he is ‘sick to my stomach’ and would do anything to be able to fly from his home in Florida to be by his daughter’s hospital bedside in Australia following a horrific car crash.\n\n‘I’m sick to my stomach. I feel like crying because I love my daughter more than life,’ he said.\n\n‘If there’s anything I could do, I’d do it.’\n\nMs Giuffre's last known address was with her estranged husband, Robert Giuffre, and their three children at a $1.9million beachfront property in Ocean Reef, North Perth in Western Australia.\n\nAmerican-born Ms Giuffre met her Australian martial arts instructor husband when she was 19 during a trip to Thailand.\n\nThe pair married 10 days later and later moved to Australia, eventually settling in West Australia in December 2020.\n\nEight months later, she filed court paperwork suing Prince Andrew for sexual assault.\n\n But the couple, who had been married for 22 years, recently parted ways, with Ms Giuffre claiming she is now estranged from their three teenage children.\n\n'I'm ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time,' she added in her Instagram post.\n\n'But you know what they say about wishes. S*** in one hand and wish in the other and I guarantee it's still going to be s*** at the end of the day.'\n\nShe ended the post, on an account which uses her maiden name, by saying goodbye and thanking her followers for being a 'great part' of her life.","summary":"On Sunday, Ms Giuffre, née Roberts, 41, shared a photograph to Instagram of herself from her hospital bed, covered in bruises sustained in the smash.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14557119/Virginia-Giuffres-lawyer-says-friends-waiting-update-revealed-days-death-following-bus-crash-adding-bad-situation-hoping-better-news.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/31/18/96736673-0-image-m-34_1743443184720.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2022/02/16/5896761724569697265/1024x576_MP4_5896761724569697265.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-01 01:06:48","author":"Editor,Freya Barnes,Perkin Amalaraj","authors":["Editor","Freya Barnes","Perkin Amalaraj"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":306265848,"title":"Trump's executive order targets price gouging at entertainment events","text":"March 31 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order on ticket prices in an effort to end price gouging where tickets on the resale market hit thousands of dollars for Taylor Swift concerts.\n\nIn the executive order, the Federal Trade Commission was directed to work with Attorney General Pam Bondi to make competition laws are enforced for concerts and other shows.\n\nThe Better Online Ticket Sales Act of 2016 allows the FTC to take action against individuals and companies that use bots to buy concert tickets in bulk and resell them.\n\nThe order will, if appropriate, take enforcement action to prevent \"unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct\" for all stages of the ticket-buying process for consumers, including the secondary ticketing market.\n\nThe Justice Department and Treasury Department were directed to ensure that ticket scalpers are operating in full compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and other laws.\n\nThe agencies must deliver a report within 180 days.\n\nMusician Kid Rock was present at the signing in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've spoken to him over the years about it and it bothers him,\" Trump said about Kid Rock, who appeared the Republican National Convention last July in Milwaukee. \"It bothers a lot of other artists. They go out with a $100 ticket, and it sells for $2,000 the following night.\"\n\nTrump, admitted he hadn't known much about price gouging, said \"I checked it out, and it is a big problem.\"\n\nTrump owned casinos with live entertainment.\n\nKid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, said in the White House: \"Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years, no matter what your politics are, knows it is a conundrum. If you buy a ticket for 100 bucks by the time you check it out, it's 170.

During an appearance on “Kudlow,” Laffer slammed the proposed tax hike and called it “silly and stupid.”\n\n“The single contribution he had in his first term was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That was the most amazing bill ever. Lower the corporate rate to 21%. Drop the income tax rate to 39.6 to 37. Leave it alone. Get that bill passed, and just get out of taxes. We’ve got everything there. If he wants to do the other ones on tips, on overtime, that’s great,” Laffer said.\n\nMembers of the administration, Laffer said, should focus on other pressing issues like immigration, which he believes is trending in their favor, and international concerns, such as events in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n“Let’s just get the tax one behind us. We’ve got the immigration issue going beautifully in our favor. He’s doing the whole thing on war and peace and the settlements in Ukraine and Gaza. These are all great issues,” Laffer added. “Don’t confuse things by adding another stick in the mud of raising the highest tax rate. That’s silly. It’s stupid, and it doesn’t work. Every time we’ve raised the highest tax rate the economy has underperformed. The rich have not paid more in taxes, and the poor have been hurt.”\n\nLaffer then suggested focusing on what he termed “80/20” issues like immigration, voter integrity, and transparency, which he said are likely to garner broad support. (RELATED: Scott Jennings Says GOP Must ‘Come To Grips’ With ‘New’ Electoral ‘Reality’)\n\n“We don’t need any of these issues that cause all sorts of problems. We need to keep the House next year, Larry. We really do. Let’s get the 80/20 ones. Immigration. You’ve got transparency. You’ve got voter integrity. You’ve got all of these issues just standing there. War and peace. Let’s just get those through,” Laffer told host Larry Kudlow. “Let’s get the election done next year, and then we can do all the other issues you want. But President Trump is heading towards truth, world fame, time and memorial types of stuff. He’s going on the legends list.”\n\nSenate Republicans are poised to vote on a budget blueprint this week, aiming to push forward President Trump’s initial legislative goals through the budget reconciliation process, bypassing Democratic filibusters.\n\nTrump has requested that congressional Republicans secure long-term tax relief for Americans by permanently extending the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in an upcoming budget reconciliation bill. The House budget resolution that passed in February, however, did not include provisions for making these tax cuts permanent.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem announced actions three days after being sworn into her role to strip nearly 350,000 Venezuelan nationals of their protection under the TPS program, which allows them to live and work temporarily in the U.S. By stripping the Venezuelans of their TPS status, the court said Noem is subjecting them to \"possible imminent deportation\" back to their country, which the State Department has categorized as a \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\" country because of the \"high risk of wrongful detentions, terrorism, kidnapping, the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, [and] poor health infrastructure.\" The action would reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to extend temporary protections of Venezuelan nations that have been in place since 2021. TRUMP ADMIN PULLING LEGAL STATUS FOR MORE THAN 530K MIGRANTS U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the San Francisco Federal Court granted a postponement of Noem’s order on Monday, saying, \"The Court finds that the Secretary’s action threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States.\" Chen also said the government has failed to identify \"any real countervailing harm\" in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries. \"Plaintiffs have also shown they will likely succeed in demonstrating that the actions taken by the Secretary are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus,\" Chen wrote. \"For these reasons, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ request to postpone the challenged actions pending final adjudication of the merits of this case.\" DHS' KRISTI NOEM SAYS TRUMP ADMIN WILL RESUME CONSTRUCTION OF 7 MILES OF SOUTHERN BORDER Fox News Digital has reached out to DHS for comment on the decision. The National TPS Alliance – an organization representing individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the U.S. – and individuals from Venezuela who have TPS challenged the Trump administration's decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in the U.S., argue that Noem’s action was unlawful and motivated by racial bias. Venezuelan migrants were allowed to fly directly to the U.S. after applying from abroad under a policy started during the Biden administration that was designed to open legal migration pathways, but President Donald Trump suspended the program when he returned to office in January. JUDGE GIVES MAHMOUD KHALIL LEGAL TEAM MORE TIME TO REVIEW IMMIGRATION CASE The Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela program, CHNV, allowed migrants and their immediate family members to fly into the U.S. if they had American sponsors. They could then remain in the country for two years under a temporary immigration status known as parole. The program first applied to Venezuelans before it was expanded to additional countries. Trump's efforts to remove legal and illegal migrants from the U.S. since taking office in January as part of his immigration agenda have faced numerous legal obstacles.

The lawsuit was filed by lawyers for the National TPS Alliance and TPS holders across the country.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also announced the end of TPS for an estimated 250,000 additional Venezuelans in September.Chen said in his ruling that the action by Noem “threatens to: inflict irreparable harm on hundreds of thousands of persons whose lives, families, and livelihoods will be severely disrupted, cost the United States billions in economic activity, and injure public health and safety in communities throughout the United States.”He said the government had failed to identify any “real countervailing harm in continuing TPS for Venezuelan beneficiaries” and said plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that Noem’s actions “are unauthorized by law, arbitrary and capricious, and motivated by unconstitutional animus.”Chen, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, said his order applies nationally.He gave the government one week to file notice of an appeal and the plaintiffs one week to file to pause for 500,000 Haitians whose TPS protections are set to expire in August. Alejandro Mayorkas, the previous secretary, had extended protections for all three cohorts into 2026.The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congress created TPS, as the law is known, in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people authorization to live and work in the U.S. in increments of up to 18 months if the Homeland Security secretary deems conditions in their home countries are unsafe for return.The reversals are a major about-face from immigration policies under former President Joe Biden, a Democrat, and come as Republican President Donald Trump and his top aides have ratcheted up attacks on judges who rule against them, with immigration being at the forefront of many disagreements.At a hearing last Monday, lawyers for TPS holders said that Noem has no authority to cancel the protections and that her actions were motivated in part by racism. They asked the judge to pause Noem’s orders, citing the irreparable harm to TPS holders struggling with fear of deportation and potential separation from family members.Government lawyers for Noem said that Congress gave the secretary clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and that the decisions were not subject to judicial review. Plaintiffs have no right to thwart the secretary’s orders from being carried out, they said.RELATED STORY | Homeland Security revokes temporary status for 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and VenezuelansBut Chen found the government's arguments unpersuasive and found that numerous derogatory and false comments by Noem — and by Trump — against Venezuelans as criminals show that racial animus was a motivator in ending protections.“Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” he wrote.Biden sharply expanded use of TPS and other temporary forms of protection in a strategy to create and expand legal pathways to live in the United States while suspending asylum for those who enter illegally.Trump has questioned the the impartiality of a federal judge who blocked his plans to deport Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, levelling his criticism only hours before his administration asked an appeals court to lift the judge’s order.The administration has also said it was revoking temporary protections for more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who have come to the U.S. since October 2022 through another legal avenue called humanitarian parole, which Biden used more than any other president.

He loved to draw, and had a penchant for bringing aesthetic flourishes to every corner of his life. When he worked as a hotel receptionist for a time, he created balloon decorations in the lobby; at home, he designed costumes and clothes. He made friends easily but, Alexis said, didn’t drink or stay out late. Andry is “very, very humble and very, very open,” she told me, by phone. “He’s comfortable being alone. He cooks for me and helps clean. He’s a homebody.”\nIn 2023, Andry took a job at a state-run television station in Caracas, the country’s capital. It was an ideal job—he was responsible for prepping the show’s anchors and guests for the screen, and his family, who have a shop that sells glass for mirrors and tables, needed the money. But he was gay and skeptical of the country’s authoritarian regime, which made him a target for abuse. The year he spent in Caracas, Alexis told me, was one of “persecution and discrimination. People in high places always discriminate against those who are lower down. They humiliated him.” At night, after work, he was often followed home and harassed by armed vigilantes aligned with the government; on one occasion, his boss at the station slapped him in front of his co-workers.\nWhen Andry told his parents that he’d decided to leave Venezuela, in late May of 2024, they begged him to stay. “At least see how things go with the elections,” Alexis told him, referring to the country’s Presidential race that August. “His father talked to him, too. But there was no way to convince him not to go.” Andry’s decision initially seemed prescient: the current President, Nicolás Maduro, who appeared to have lost the vote by an overwhelming margin, declared himself the winner. Andry was one of roughly seven hundred and sixty thousand Venezuelans who travelled to the United States during the Biden Administration, traversing an infamously dangerous jungle known as the Darién Gap, between Colombia and Panama. “He made the journey,” Alexis said. “He wanted to change his life, to reach his potential, and to help us here.”\nThe first time Andry tried to enter the U.S., he was arrested and sent to Tabasco, Mexico, where a friend helped him download a government app that allowed migrants to make appointments at ports of entry. The system, known as CBP One, was the Biden Administration’s attempt to create a more orderly process for people to enter the country. Part of the premise was to incentivize migrants to come “the right way,” though it often took months for slots to open up. On the morning of August 29th, a U.S. official interviewed Andry at the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. Andry had no criminal record, and the exchange seemed straightforward.\n“Did you claim asylum while in Mexico?” the official asked.\n“I didn’t know I could do that,” he replied.\nAndry eventually passed his preliminary asylum screening. Officials determined that he demonstrated a “credible fear” of persecution in his home country. But during a physical exam, they had fixated on his tattoos. A snake extending from a bouquet of flowers covers his left forearm and biceps. On each of his wrists is a crown, with the words “Mom” and “Dad” inked next to them in English. The photographs in his file show a thin man, slight of build, with a youthful face and dark hair; there are rings under his eyes, and he is standing before the government photographer without a shirt.\nAndry denied belonging to any gang. The agent, who asked him about the tattoos, described his “demeanor during interview” as “uncooperative.” A note was added to his file: “Upon conducting a review of detainee Hernandez’s tattoos it was found that detainee Hernandez has a crown on each one of his wrist. The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member.” These crowns, according to the government, were “determining factors to conclude reasonable suspicion.”\nOften, asylum seekers who pass their initial screening are released with a future court date, but Andry remained in custody, apparently because of the government’s suspicions about his tattoos. In December, three months into his detention, he met Paulina Reyes, a lawyer from the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a legal-advocacy organization, who agreed to represent him on a pro-bono basis. Reyes filed an asylum application on Andry’s behalf. They spoke regularly, both in person and on the phone, while waiting for a court appearance scheduled for March 13th.\nAbout a week before the hearing, Andry and a number of other Venezuelans in San Diego were transferred to a facility in South Texas. Reyes, whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had neglected to inform, found this out when Andry called her from Texas. That was the last time the two of them spoke. During his March 13th hearing, in San Diego, Reyes thought he might appear on video. When he did not, the proceedings were postponed until March 17th. Reyes wasn’t able to speak with him, so she didn’t realize that, on Friday, March 14th, he’d managed to make one last phone call to his mother. He told her he was fine, but that the government was about to transfer him again. He had no information about his destination.\nWhen Andry failed to appear at his second hearing, the immigration judge wanted to know why the government wasn’t making him available. “He was removed to El Salvador,” the ICE lawyer replied. “We just found out today.” This surprised the judge, who was there to determine whether or not Andry should be deported. “How can he be removed to El Salvador,” the judge asked, “if there’s no removal order?”\nThe White House didn’t make the proclamation public for another day. In the meantime, the government was secretly putting Venezuelans who were in federal custody on planes, readying them for deportation. Andry was one of them; there were two hundred and thirty-seven others who, like him, were accused of belonging to the gang. The vast majority were involved in pending immigration cases but were not given an opportunity to contest the alleged evidence against them. A high-ranking ICE official later acknowledged that many of these men had no criminal records in the U.S. but insisted that the absence of such a history “actually highlights the risk they pose.”\nEl Salvador is a conspicuously punitive destination. The country’s President, Nayib Bukele, has suspended parts of the country’s constitution and, during the past three years, jailed more than eighty thousand alleged gang members without clear charges. In February, after a meeting in San Salvador with Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, Bukele offered to house immigrants who’d been arrested on American soil in his newly built prison, which is called the Terrorism Confinement Center. “We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,” Bukele wrote on X. “The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.”\nOn the day that Trump signed the order, Lee Gelernt, a veteran litigator with the American Civil Liberties Union who specializes in immigrants’ rights, was in a courtroom in Washington, D.C., arguing a case about another controversial decision recently made by the Administration. In February, the President had sent a hundred and seventy-eight Venezuelan men from U.S. detention to the military compound at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. After the A.C.L.U. brought a legal challenge, the Department of Homeland Security deported the men to Venezuela, evidently to avoid a court fight over their access to legal representation. But the government said that it planned to send more migrants to Guantánamo. Gelernt was trying to insure that they’d have access to lawyers. In the hours before the hearing, he’d also been monitoring early news reports that the President was preparing to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to deport more Venezuelan migrants.\nAs soon as the hearing ended, Gelernt rushed back to his hotel, where he worked through the night with his A.C.L.U. colleagues to prepare an emergency lawsuit. The idea was to prevent the government from deporting anyone under the Alien Enemies Act while the case could be argued in court. “If people already had final orders of removal, the government doesn’t need the Alien Enemies Act,” Gelernt told me. “Using the Alien Enemies Act is all about short-circuiting the immigration process, not only to eliminate hearings in immigration court but to be able to send them wherever the government wants.”\nThrough a national network of immigration attorneys, the team identified five plaintiffs who fit the profile of those at the greatest risk of being summarily deported to El Salvador: they were Venezuelan men in federal custody who had open immigration cases and had recently been transferred to a detention facility in Texas. The lawyers took down affidavits from the plaintiffs’ immigration attorneys—the men themselves were unreachable—and crafted an argument to protect a wider class of migrants in custody. The A.C.L.U. filed its brief sometime after two in the morning on March 15th—a Saturday. Within hours, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., had issued a temporary restraining order to block the deportation of the five plaintiffs, who, it turned out, had already been taken to the airport. Four of them had to be pulled off the planes on the tarmac. The other passengers were left to wait on the aircraft for several hours more.\nThe judge, James Boasberg, a former prosecutor who’d been appointed to his current position by Barack Obama and to a prior judgeship by George W. Bush, scheduled a hearing on Zoom for five o’clock that afternoon. About an hour before it was set to begin, the White House announced its invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. At the hearing, Boasberg asked the government lawyer, “Are imminent deportations and removals under this proclamation planned?” According to a transcript of the proceedings, the lawyer responded, “Your Honor, I don’t know the answer to that question.” Boasberg turned to Gelernt, who said, “I recognize it’s Saturday, but, on the other hand, the government appears to be moving planes very rapidly to El Salvador with hundreds of people. So we hope that, in the next five minutes, counsel for the government can get an answer to that.” Boasberg gave the government forty minutes.\nDuring that time, according to an analysis by the Washington Post, two planes full of migrants left Texas for Honduras. Either the government lawyer was unaware of these departures or he feigned ignorance, because when Boasberg reconvened the hearing at six o’clock the attorney still couldn’t provide any information. “I am still trying to get additional details,” he said.\nAt a quarter to seven, Boasberg issued a ruling to extend his temporary restraining order to anyone in federal custody, which meant that, until further notice, the Trump Administration could deport people under federal immigration laws but not under the Alien Enemies Act. “Particularly given the plaintiff’s information unrebutted by the government that flights are actively departing and plan to depart, I do not believe that I am able to wait any longer,” Boasberg said. He instructed the government’s lawyer “that any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States.” He added, “However that’s accomplished . . . I leave to you. But this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”\nThe judge’s verbal order was entered into the written record at 7:26 P.M. Shortly after that, the two planes that had left Texas during the adjournment arrived in Honduras, and a third took off from Texas. Within a few hours, each of those planes departed Honduras for El Salvador: one at 11:39 P.M., another at 11:43 P.M., and the last at 12:39 A.M. Just before eight o’clock on the morning of March 16th, Bukele posted a New York Post article about Boasberg’s order, adding in a comment, “Oopsie . . . Too late.” Rubio retweeted Bukele’s sarcastic post. Bukele soon began releasing footage of Salvadoran soldiers swarming the migrants as they got off the planes. Videos showed the men looking stunned, as their heads were shaved and they were frog-marched into prison.\nArturo is a singer who worked landscaping jobs in the U.S. He left Venezuela in 2016, living in Colombia and then Chile with his wife, who, three months ago, gave birth to their daughter. As part of his application for temporary protected status in the U.S., which would have theoretically shielded him from deportation and granted him work authorization, he was supposed to have an appointment with D.H.S. on February 12th to get fingerprinted. But, on February 8th, he was arrested at a house where he was shooting a music video. In Nelson’s telling, ICE officers turned up looking for someone else but took Arturo into custody as a “collateral arrest.”\nThe family didn’t have the money to retain a lawyer, and Nelson was told he couldn’t raise bond. Still, Nelson managed to secure documentation from each of the countries where his brother had lived, demonstrating that he didn’t have a criminal history. When I asked Nelson whether he thought Arturo’s tattoos were the reason for his deportation to El Salvador, he told me, “I imagine it has to be. He hasn’t even gotten a speeding ticket in the U.S., which is how they normally get Latinos. I just don’t even understand how there’s evidence to categorize him as a criminal.”\nOther family members learned of their relatives’ deportations the same way that Nelson had—from the footage released by Bukele. As the Washington Post reported, Mervin Yamarte, a twenty-nine-year-old father from Maracaibo, who had worked as a roofer in Venezuela, had called his mother in mid-March saying he would see her soon: after being arrested, he and three of his friends from home, who were living together in Dallas, had agreed to sign deportation orders, expecting to be returned to Venezuela. When his mother recognized him in a video posted by Bukele, she told the Post, “I couldn’t speak.” The father of Carlos Daniel Terán, an eighteen-year-old Venezuelan who was first arrested in January, shared with NPR a series of text messages he had exchanged with his son on the eve of Carlos’s deportation. “With God’s help, we are leaving today,” Carlos had said, assuming that he was being deported home. “God bless you, son,” his father replied. A few days later, someone sent him a photo of his son in the Salvadoran prison. Other relatives panicked when they hadn’t heard from the men but could not find them in the U.S. government’s searchable database of people in immigration detention. The wife of Franco Caraballo, a twenty-six-year-old, told Reuters, “I’ve never seen him without hair, so I haven’t recognized him in the photos,” adding, “I just suspect he’s there because of the tattoos that he has and right now any Venezuelan man with tattoos is assumed to be a gang member.”\nThe Trump Administration has denied the Venezuelans a chance to respond to the government’s allegations of gang membership, but the most obvious through line, in each case, appears to be their tattoos. As part of the White House’s effort to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, ICE officers received a document called the “Alien Enemy Validation Guide,” which provided a point system based on different categories of incriminating behavior or associations. If an immigrant in custody scored six points or higher, according to the rubric, he “may be validated” as a gang member. Tattoos, which fall under the “Symbolism” category, constitute four points; social-media posts “displaying” gang symbols are two points. Using “open source material,” agents at the investigative arm of ICE compiled photos of tattoos considered suspicious: crowns, stars, the Michael Jordan Jumpman logo.\nJerce Reyes Barrios, a thirty-six-year-old soccer player and youth coach, fled Venezuela last year after marching in anti-government protests. His immigration file cites two grounds for suspicion: a gesture he made while posing for a photo that was posted to social media and a tattoo of a crown on top of a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “Dios.” His lawyer, Linette Tobin, worked with his family to secure documents from the police in Venezuela to show that he hadn’t committed any crimes. They also tracked down Barrios’s tattoo artist. “He wanted a tattoo related to soccer,” the artist said in a legal declaration. “We searched on the internet and the ball with a crown caught our attention to represent the king of soccer, and he liked the idea.”\nIn the aftermath of the deportations, someone took photographs of Tobin’s court filing and posted them on social media, where they soon went viral. Critics of Trump shared them as evidence that innocent people were being sent to “rot in prison” in El Salvador, while the President’s defenders shared photos of Tobin, deriding the affidavit she gave as as a “hoax.” “I looked at my phone, and I saw the calls and the emails. I was seriously horrified,” she told me. Right-wing groups were singling her out for harassment, but she was more upset about her client, whose personal information was now being widely circulated.\nAndrés Antillano, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela, has spent much of his career studying Tren de Aragua. “This is the first time I’ve ever encountered any reference to the significance of tattoos,” he told me. He called the thinking “absurd” and “naïve.” Tattoos were typically associated with Central American gangs that built their identities around holding specific territory, he said, but “it’s been a long time since that sort of thing would apply to Tren de Aragua.” In fact, the guidance ICE provided to its officers for identifying members of Tren de Aragua seems to be based on the operations of the Salvadoran gang MS-13. It flags graffiti, hand signs, and tattoos—all hallmarks of MS-13, but “irrelevant” to how Tren de Aragua functions, Antillano said.\nRonna Rísquez, a Venezuelan journalist who’s reported extensively on criminal groups in Venezuela, published the definitive book on Tren de Aragua. “The truth is that a tattoo identifying Tren de Aragua does not exist,” she told me. “Tren de Aragua does not use any tattoos as a form of gang identification; no Venezuelan gang does.” In Rísquez’s view, tattoos are a completely unreliable indicator of someone’s criminal proclivities; rather, they reflect contemporary fashions and socioeconomic class. “Most young people in Latin America these days have tattoos,” she said. Often, they imitate those of celebrities: a watch in reference to the Argentinean soccer legend Lionel Messi, the phrase “real hasta la muerte,” in homage to the Puerto Rican singer Anuel AA. (Both of these symbols appear in the ICE documents.) Rísquez went on, “People get a tattoo because it means something particular to them.”\nCárdenas has known Andry since he was a boy, when Andry participated in the festival’s program for children. When we spoke, Cárdenas described Andry’s contributions to local theatre, including all of his roles in the festival itself, before leaving me a series of messages brimming with literary and religious detail. Andry was one of the thirteen main actors in the show, a makeup stylist for the others, and the costume designer for nearly two dozen dancers. One of the principal symbols of Three Kings Day is a crown. “Andry is a great lover of the festival, and the two crowns on his wrists are a tribute to his passion for it,” Cárdenas said.\nDuring the past week, several of Andry’s friends—some in the U.S., others in Venezuela—urged me to watch footage of Andry at the festival, which is on YouTube. There was something painfully desperate in their insistence, as if seeing images of Andry for myself would help correct an otherwise stunning cultural misunderstanding.\nOne morning, a childhood friend of Andry’s named Alejandro, who currently lives in the state of Georgia, where he works as a food deliveryman, spoke to me during his shift. Alejandro came to the U.S. at the end of 2023, shortly after the death of his father, who owned a bus company. He had spent a few years in Venezuela as a taxi driver but eventually abandoned the job because he had to pay too much of his meagre wages to local criminal groups as protection money, a tax known as a vacuna, or vaccine. The irony wasn’t lost on him that he was now living in a country where he could be accused of gangsterism. “They’re taking everyone now,” he told me. “It doesn’t matter if you have papers or not.” He lives in an apartment with his brother-in-law and two others from Capacho. One of them, in a nod to their home town, also has a tattoo of a crown.\nThe government lawyer said that he could “consult with the clients on that, but we don’t believe it’s necessary.” Gelernt told the judge, “There’s been a lot of talk over the last seven weeks about constitutional crisis. People are throwing that term around. I think we are getting very close to it.”\nWithin a day, Trump began attacking Boasberg on Truth Social. “This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President,” he wrote. “I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!” In response to the President, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare rebuke, saying, “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”\nSoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi’s name began to appear on an increasingly aggressive series of filings. One of them called the judge’s requests for information “a picayune dispute over the micromanagement of immaterial factfinding.” The Administration claims that it did not violate the judge’s order, because two of the three deportation flights had already left the United States when Boasberg made his ruling. According to federal officials, the Venezuelans on the third plane weren’t removed solely on the basis of the Alien Enemies Act. But that assertion raises another question: if they were deported under regular immigration procedures, why would they be sent to El Salvador without prior warning? Early last week, the Justice Department invoked the “state-secrets privilege,” claiming that sharing even minimal details about the deportation flights “would pose reasonable danger to national security and foreign affairs.”\nGelernt was the lead litigator in some of the highest-profile lawsuits of Trump’s first term, including successful challenges to the initial Muslim ban and the Administration’s family-separation policy. He pointed out that the last time Roberts rebuked the President was in 2018, when, in another case brought by Gelernt and the A.C.L.U., a federal judge blocked a Trump proclamation ending asylum at the border. Trump lambasted him as an “Obama judge.” The echoes were unmistakable, yet they also reinforced the fact that the Administration has only become more combative since Trump’s first term. “They’re much more intent on picking a fight with the federal judiciary,” Gelernt told me. “It appears to me that they think that’s a winning political issue for them.” He continued, “The stridency of their positions is what’s catching me, the unwillingness to give at all. What also seems clear is that the D.O.J. lawyers do not have authorization to make any concessions in court.”\nOn March 26th, a federal appeals court upheld Boasberg’s temporary restraining order. One of the judges, Patricia Millett, had expressed disbelief that Venezuelans were being sent to El Salvador without any notice or opportunity to mount a legal defense. “Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act,” she said. The Justice Department filed an emergency petition before the Supreme Court. In the meantime, Trump’s Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, who has publicly called undocumented immigrants “dirtbags,” visited the Salvadoran facility. Standing in front of a cell crammed with prisoners who appeared to be Salvadorans, covered in MS-13 tattoos, she said, “This facility is one of the tools in our tool kit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”\nAndry’s American lawyers are caught in something of a paradox. They’re vocal about sharing the details of his disappearance, because, if he fades from the news, his situation may grow even more dire. Yet Andry is also an asylum seeker. Disclosing the full identity of someone fleeing persecution is inherently risky. One evening, while I was talking with one of his attorneys, Lindsay Toczylowski, the president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, CBS News published the full list of the two hundred and thirty-eight Venezuelans deported to El Salvador. “I had spent nights looking at his Instagram pictures, thinking, How can something like this happen to him? ” she told me. “But at the same time I felt like we couldn’t share that information. When the list was published, it was inevitable that those pictures would be out there.”\nToczylowski and her colleagues had debated whether disclosing that Andry was gay would make him a target inside the Salvadoran prison. They decided it was pointless to try to hide it, and that maybe it would make the public more sympathetic to his case. Ordinarily, this would be a conversation they could have had with Andry. Under the circumstances, all they could do was discuss it with his mother. She told them, “Do absolutely everything you can to get him out of there.”\nOn March 21st, Time published a report, by Philip Holsinger, an American photojournalist, who gained access to the Salvadoran prison when the Venezuelans first arrived. In the story, he described someone roughly resembling Andry. “One young man sobbed when a guard pushed him to the floor,” Holsinger wrote. “He said, ‘I’m not a gang member. I’m gay. I’m a barber.’ ” The description went on: he “began to whimper, folding his hands in prayer. . . . He was slapped. The man asked for his mother, then buried his face in his chained hands and cried as he was slapped again.”\nOn social media, people connected this account with the photos that Toczylowski had shared of Andry. Toczylowski told me that it seemed unlikely Andry would have described himself as a barber. But was it possible that, in addition to a gay makeup artist, the Trump Administration had just deported a gay hairdresser? One user on X posted a photo of Andry alongside a photo taken by Holsinger of a Venezuelan prisoner getting his head shaved. “The first photo is of a young Venezuelan named Andrys—a twenty-three-year-old gay makeup artist,” the person wrote. (Andry is thirty-one.) A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security quoted the post and responded, “No. DHS intelligence assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos. This man’s own social media indicates he is a member of Tren de Aragua.”\nThe residents of Capacho have been holding regular vigils for Andry, and they’ve recorded videos of spirited pleas to release him. Cárdenas, the head of the Three Kings festival, begged Bukele directly, calling Andry a “great talent of our town.” At the gatherings, many people turned out wearing costumes from the festival. Andry’s full name is ubiquitous in the Spanish-language coverage. Online, there are already dozens of photos, not just of him but of his old neighbors and friends filling the streets before the local church. In one of them, Andry’s mother and father are standing next to three men in festival garb, holding signs for Conscience, Justice, and Liberty. On each of their heads is a crown. ♦","summary":"The President has invoked the law to send Venezuelans to prison in El Salvador without due process—and, in many cases, under false pretenses.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-immigration/the-makeup-artist-donald-trump-deported-under-the-alien-enemies-act","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/67eae97520903a45193287e9/16:9/w_2858,h_1607,c_limit/VNZLN_DEPORTATION_COL_ALT_FINAL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:32:18","author":"Jonathan Blitzer","authors":["Jonathan Blitzer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.14},{"id":306264298,"title":"Trump has dubbed April 2 ‘Liberation Day’ for his tariffs. Here’s what to expect","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — As the trade wars launched by U.S. President Donald Trump continue to escalate, all eyes are on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called April 2 “Liberation Day,” with promises to roll out a set of tariffs, or taxes on imports from other countries, that he says will free the U.S. from a reliance on foreign goods. To do this, Trump has said he’ll impose “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duties that other countries charge on U.S. products.\n\nBut a lot remains unknown about how these levies will actually be implemented. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Trump would unveil his plans to place reciprocal tariffs on nearly all American trading partners on Wednesday, but maintained that the details are up to the president to announce.\n\nSince taking office just months ago, Trump has proven to be aggressive with tariff threats, all while creating a sense of whiplash through on-again, off-again trade actions. And it’s possible that we’ll see more delays or confusion this week.\n\nTrump has argued that tariffs protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition, raise money for the federal government and provide leverage to demand concessions from other countries. But economists stress that broad tariffs at the rates suggested by Trump could backfire.\n\nTariffs typically trickle down to the consumer through higher prices — and businesses worldwide also have a lot to lose if their costs rise and their sales fall. Import taxes already in effect, coupled with uncertainty around future trade actions and possible retaliations, have already roiled financial markets and lowered consumer confidence while enveloping many with questions that could delay hiring and investment.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat will happen on April 2?\n\nDetails around Trump’s plans remain uncertain. Reciprocal tariffs could take the form of product-by-product duties, for example, or broader “averages” imposed across all goods from each country — or perhaps something else entirely. The rates could reflect what other countries charge as well as their value added taxes and subsidies to domestic companies.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro told “Fox News Sunday” that the tariffs could raise $600 billion annually, which would imply an average rate of 20%.\n\nTrump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries, through these levies. On Monday, Leavitt said Trump had been presented with several proposals by his advisers. She added that the president would make a final decision, but right now was not contemplating any country-wide exemptions from the tariffs.\n\nPreviously-delayed import taxes could take effect very soon. Trump’s month-long delay for many goods from Canada and Mexico, for example, is set to elapse in early April. Earlier this month, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that the extension granted for Mexican imports covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement runs through April 2. But further confirmation around a specific date has not been issued since.\n\nWhich of Trump’s tariffs are about to start?\n\nTrump has said he will place a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela, which includes the U.S. itself, starting Wednesday — in addition to imposing new tariffs on the South American country.\n\nHis 25% tariffs on auto imports will start being collected Thursday, with taxes on fully-imported cars kicking off at midnight. The tariffs are set to expand to applicable auto parts in the following weeks, through May 3.\n\nThe White House says it expects to raise $100 billion in revenue annually from these new duties, but economists stress this trade action will upend the auto industry’s global supply chain and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nWhich tariffs have already gone into effect?\n\nTrump imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports beginning Feb. 4, a levy he later doubled to 20% from March 4 onward. And China has hit back with retaliatory tariffs covering a range of U.S. goods, including a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products and 10% tariff on crude oil from the U.S. that took effect Feb 10. China also imposed tariffs of up to 15% on key U.S. farm exports starting March 10.\n\nTrump’s expanded steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect earlier this month, too. Both metals are now taxed at 25% across the board — with Trump’s order to remove steel exemptions and raise aluminum’s levy from his previously-imposed 2018 import taxes taking effect March 12.\n\nCanada and Mexico, America’s two largest trading partners, have also faced steep tariffs. Earlier this month, Trump implemented a partial, month-long delay of his 25% tariffs on both countries — delaying taxes for auto-related imports as well as goods that comply with the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement until early April.\n\nBut other imports are still levied, as well as a lower 10% duty on potash and Canadian energy products. In response to these tariffs, as well as the new steel and aluminum import taxes, Canada has rolled out a series of counter measures amounting to billions of dollars on U.S. goods. Mexico, meanwhile, has yet to formally impose new levies — signaling it may still hope to de-escalate the trade war, although the country previously promised retaliation to Trump’s actions.\n\nCan we expect additional tariffs down the road?\n\nEven more tariffs from Trump are likely, with the president also threatening import taxes on products like copper, lumber, pharmaceutical drugs and computer chips.\n\nAnd many countries have promised retaliatory measures — if not already imposed them, like Canada. Trump has said he won’t negotiate with other countries on Wednesday’s tariffs until after they’re imposed, though he has said his 25% taxes on auto imports would be permanent.\n\nIn response to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, the European Union announced measures on U.S. goods worth some 26 billion euros ($28 billion) — to target steel and aluminum products, but also American beef, poultry, bourbon, motorcycles, peanut butter and jeans. The 27-member bloc had intended to roll out this retaliatory trade action in two phases, on Tuesday and April 13, but later said it will delay it until mid-April, without giving a specific date.\n\nWe’ll potentially see more retaliatory announcements this week, particularly if Trump confirms more details of sweeping reciprocal tariffs on Wednesday.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

So I wasn’t happy with that,” Trump said. He has threatened 25-point tariffs on Russian oil if the Kremlin does not comply with terms discussed at recent peace talks in Saudi Arabia, but geo-economic experts are warning that such a threat could be meaningless in the end.\n\nFinnish President Alexander Stubb, after golf with Trump on Saturday, told Sky News: “I do think that the president of the United States is a very skillful negotiator, and he’s trying to find the right balance.\n\n“My message was, he’s the only one who can do it, and now we need a deadline for the ceasefire. And for me, the deadline would be the 20th of April, when he’s been in office for three months, and also when we have Easter. “\n\nHowever, he added, “This is sort of where Putin is strongest. And I think, when you put him in a room or phone call with Donald Trump, or have their deputies speak, the Russians are very good at sort of massaging the language and hitting the nerves and making this thing look like everything is going to be OK,” he said. \n\nThe Finnish leader concluded: “My message to President Trump, when he asked, ‘Can I trust Putin’ was, ‘No, you can’t.” \n\nMoreover, analysts have said that the impact of any US penalties on buying Russian oil would be limited.\n\nThe tariffs would likely boost oil prices in the short term if countries opt for other oil sources as a result, but the tariff’s effectiveness and resulting market fluctuations are unclear at this stage, given the lack of details, particularly on how the tariffs would be imposed.","summary":"As Finland’s leader calls the US president a “skillful negotiator”, analysts wonder if Trump’s threat of oil tariffs on Russia are actually a useful bargaining tool after all.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/49942","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2024/10/31/6a8234e046ff755b11914c2ba52aa5db.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:29:01","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":306265496,"title":"South Korea March exports rise for second month, misses expectations","text":"SEOUL : South Korea's March exports grew for a second month but missed market expectations, as a global trade war triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs raises uncertainty for manufacturers, government data showed on Tuesday.\n\nOutbound shipments from Asia's fourth-largest economy stood at $58.24 billion, up 3.1 per cent from a year earlier, weaker than a median 3.5 per cent increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. \n\nThe fresh U.S. tariffs on automobiles will kick in this week, and Trump has threatened duties on chip imports and reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners.\n\nImports grew 2.3 per cent to $53.29 billion, resulting in a preliminary trade surplus of $4.99 billion for March. \n\nOn average per working day, exports were up 5.5 per cent in March.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/south-korea-march-exports-rise-second-month-misses-expectations-5036276","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--KzKsThMh--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-04-01t002717z_1_lynxnpel3014d_rtroptp_3_southkorea-strike-truckers-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:27:17","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.663},{"id":306262120,"title":"White House says 'no exemptions' as Canada braces for new wave of U.S. tariffs (Canada)","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday provided few details of his plan this week to upend global trade through \"reciprocal\" tariffs as the White House confirmed there's been no decision on whether a pause on economy-wide duties against Canada will be lifted.\n\nTrump called Wednesday \"Liberation Day\" — the day when he intends to impose \"reciprocal\" tariffs by increasing U.S. duties to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports.\n\n\"We are going to be very nice by comparison to what they were. The numbers will be lower than what they have been charging us,\" Trump said in the Oval Office where he signed an unrelated executive order flanked by musician Kid Rock.\n\n\"And in some cases, maybe substantially lower, but we sort of have a world obligation perhaps.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier Monday there will be \"no exemptions.\"\n\nCanada could face an even harder hit by Trump's tariffs on Wednesday. A White House official confirmed no decision has been made on whether Trump will reinstate additional duties on Canada and Mexico, which he has linked to the flow of fentanyl.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump hit Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent across-the-board duties, with a lower 10 per cent levy on Canadian energy — then partly paused the tariffs a few days later. Trump said at the time that the pause would last until April 2.\n\nDemocrat Sen. Tim Kaine said Friday he would force a vote on Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, also called IEEPA, to declare an emergency at the northern border in order to hit Canada with tariffs.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the Washington Post, Kaine wrote that \"the president is using the fake emergency as a smoke screen to collect tariff revenue that he can use to fund a massive tax cut for the uber-rich.\"\n\nIEEPA includes a provision allowing any senator to force a vote to block emergency powers. While it might not stop Trump's declaration of an emergency at the northern border, the vote would force Republican senators to publicly record their opinion of the measure.\n\nU.S. government data shows the volume of fentanyl seized at the northern border is minuscule. The Annual Threat Assessment report, released last week, does not mention Canada in its section on illicit drugs and fentanyl.\n\nReciprocal tariffs aren't the only ones set to launch this week. Thursday will bring Trump's 25 per cent levies on automobiles.\n\nThe White House official said any carve-out for cars made with American parts under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade will not be in place until there is \"a system set up to gauge how much of each finished car is made with foreign components.\"\n\nEarlier in March, Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including product from Canada.\n\nThe White House official said many of those duties would stack on top of each other if economy-wide tariffs return. Any cars or automobile parts that don't fall under the continental trade pact's rules will be hit with double duties, the official said. The White House previously said levies on steel and aluminum will jump to 50 per cent.\n\nCanadian officials have been connecting with members of Trump's team to gain insight into how Wednesday's duties will roll out. Ontario Premier Doug Ford spoke with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week but said he was not given any details.\n\n\"I think he has an idea, or maybe he doesn't. That's even scarier if he doesn't,\" Ford said last Thursday.\n\nThis week's tariff speculation comes after Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney had their first phone conversation — which seemed to offer hope for setting the bilateral relationship on a less adversarial path.\n\nTrump spent months repeatedly saying Canada should become a U.S. state and referring to former prime minister Justin Trudeau as a \"governor.\"\n\nTrump described the Friday call with Carney as \"very good\" and said he thinks \"things are going to work out very well between Canada and the United States.\" Carney said the two leaders agreed to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship immediately after the federal election on April 28.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday provided few details of his plan this week to upend global trade through &quot;reciprocal&quot; tariffs as the White House confirmed there&#39;s been no decision on whether a pause on economy-wide duties against Canada will be lifted.\n\nTrump called Wednesday &...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/541747/White-House-says-no-exemptions-as-Canada-braces-for-new-wave-of-U-S-tariffs","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/3/2bae43cdc99bfe7384e61e6c0ee463f881fc100d2964e00c35d799fc6d01daae_p4170947.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:26:00","author":"Kelly Geraldine Malone","authors":["Kelly Geraldine Malone"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":306263060,"title":"Judge who is sending Marie Le Pen to prison and banned her from standing in French elections is under armed police guard after receiving 'personal threats'","text":"The judge who sentenced Marine Le Pen to prison and banned her from standing to become the new French President was under armed police guard tonight following ‘clearly expressed personal threats’.\n\nFar-Right supporters of the 56-year-old National Rally politician were on Monday believed to have targeted anti-corruption magistrate Bénédicte de Perthuis, 63.\n\nA police source told Le Parisien that Judge De Perthuis had received ‘a large number of messages containing clearly expressed personal threats.’\n\nThe news outlet added: ‘As a result, the police presence has been increased near her home.’\n\nThe two other judges who made up the professional jury at the Paris Correctional Court have also been threatened, said the source.\n\nLe Pen and more than 20 other party officials were on Monday found guilty of stealing millions of pounds worth of tax payers’ money from the European taxpayer.\n\nThey did this over at least a decade while they were MEPs working in the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg.\n\nRather than spend the money on their European roles, they used it to fund the National Rally (NR) in Paris.\n\nJudge Petrius handed down the controversial judgement against Le Pen following a trial last year for ‘embezzlement of public funds’.\n\nLe Pen was sentenced to four years in prison, with two suspended, and also barred from running in elections for the next five years.\n\nAlthough Le Pen is now appealing, she is unlikely to stand to become President of France in 2027, despite being a favourite to replace Emmanuel Macron, who has to stand down after serving the maxium two terms allowed.\n\nLe Pen appeared on French TV on Monday night and said the judgement was a ‘political decision’ and that she would fight it.\n\nShe accused Judge De Perthuis of ‘wanting to prevent me from running and being elected in the presidential election,’ and ‘violating the law’.\n\nBut in a statement released on Monday, Jacques Boulard, the First President of the Paris Court of Appeal, called for ‘respect for the judicial system’.\n\nJudge Boulard deplored ‘numerous comments but also, particularly on social media, personal attacks against the three judges who make up the collegial body.’\n\nHe expressed his ‘deep concern’ and said that in a democratic state governed by the rule of law, criticism of a court decision can under no circumstances be expressed through threats against judges.’\n\nFrance’s Justice Minister, Gérald Darmanin, also said the threats were ‘worrying for the independence of the judicial authority.’\n\nNational Rally president Jordan Bardella is among those who have called for demonstrations against the court decision.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter X on Monday: ‘Today it is not only Marine Le Pen who was unjustly condemned - it was French democracy that was killed.’\n\nEven some of Le Pen’s political opponents attacked the decision, with former presidential candidate Éric Zemmour writing: ‘It is not for judges to decide who the people must vote for.

Andrew Cuomo, who frequently sparred with Donald Trump in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, is once again leveling harsh criticism at the president, calling him “diabolical” at a weekend event.\n\nCuomo, who is running to become mayor of New York City, was at a campaign event in Queens on Sunday when he took direct aim at Trump in his remarks, calling him an “existential threat” to the city, according to AM New York.\n\n“We all know this man. He came from Queens. I dealt with him for four years. I fought with him for four years. I know him,” Cuomo said. “He, in many ways, has learned from his first administration to his second, and he’s more diabolical in this administration.”\n\nCuomo was appearing at the Queens County Democratic Party’s headquarters in Forest Hills to pick up the endorsement of Democratic U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks. Meeks said that Cuomo was “the best person to stand up to that guy at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.” \n\nIn a video of the event posted by WPIX-TV, Cuomo warned that what Trump has done so far in his second term as president is just the beginning. \n\n“What he’s doing on immigration, what he’s doing on the Department of Education, what he’s doing with the lawyers, what he’s doing with the judges, what he’s doing with the federal workers ― you ain’t seen nothing yet,” he said. \n\nAn excerpt of Cuomo’s remarks begins at the 1:40 mark of the video:\n\nCuomo became New York’s 56th governor in 2011 and was easily re-elected in 2014 and 2018. He achieved nationwide acclaim for his near-daily press conferences in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, and his approval numbers soared. But those numbers took a downturn when Attorney General Letitia James issued a report revealing that the governor’s administration had significantly undercounted the Covid-19 death toll in nursing homes.\n\nSoon after that, six different women publicly accused him of sexual harassment and offensive behavior. Cuomo denied the allegations, but an investigation by James concluded that he had harassed several women, and Cuomo resigned in August of 2021.\n\nCuomo announced his intention to run for New York City mayor earlier this month. Current Mayor Eric Adams has been indicted on corruption charges. Though a Democrat, Adams has recently become an ally of Donald Trump, and the Justice Department has urged that charges against Adams be dropped. \n\nWhile Adams has shown a willingness to cooperate with Trump, Cuomo vowed to lead the opposition in New York City.\n\n“The counter-revolution starts here,” Cuomo said, according to AM New York. “The home of the opposition is New York City, and we’re going to push back, and we’re going to win.”\n\nTrump has blunt words on possible car price hikes amid new tariffsMegyn Kelly: I don’t care that Trump ‘got handsy’ with women 20 years agoTrump says he’s ‘not joking’ about third term as president","summary":"Cuomo and Trump feuded in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic when Cuomo was governor.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/04/andrew-cuomo-running-for-nyc-mayor-levels-harsh-criticism-at-diabolical-donald-trump.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/DODU6V5EK5E7XG6ZZROOW5KRX4.JPG?auth=2210525994eaf19cdf3626c393e8692758f31fca14ff03e8f1ee0374b235382e&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:17:40","author":"George Owens","authors":["George Owens"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.045},{"id":306259880,"title":"Iran will have 'no choice' but to get nukes if attacked, says Khamenei adviser","text":"Iran complained to the United Nations Security Council on Monday about \"reckless and belligerent\" remarks by US President Donald Trump, who threatened Iran on Sunday with bombing and more tariffs if Tehran did not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear program.

Susan Collins, R-Maine, made her stance clear on whether transgender athletes should compete in girls’ and women’s sports on Monday. Collins said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital that a Maine state law that allows biological males to compete against girls and women is the antithesis to the \"spirit and intent of Title IX.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"I believe that the State of Maine is under scrutiny because of the state law that allows biological males to play in girls’ sports. And that is contrary, not just to the President's executive order, but what I believe is the very spirit and intent of Title IX, which was to provide sports and other athletic activities to girls in a safe and fair way,\" Collins wrote. The state refused to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to keep biological males from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. The Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Civil Rights referred the state’s \"noncompliance with Title IX\" to the Justice Department on Friday. \"It is critically important to treat people who are transgender with respect and dignity. But that does not change the fact that Title IX, which was passed in 1972, has greatly expanded opportunities for girls and young women to participate in organized sports at the high school and college levels,\" Collins added. \"It did so, in part, by mandating equal access to athletic resources and facilities on the basis of sex – not on the basis of gender identity. Safe and fair athletic competition has been one of the keys to the success of Title IX. That is why I do not believe that transgender athletes should compete in girls’ and women’s athletics. \"I will continue to advocate for Maine to receive its fair share of federal funding, something I have done successfully so far, but I support the original intent behind Title IX.\" Maine school officials explained why they refused to comply with Trump’s executive order on Monday. \"The Maine Principals’ Association is bound by the law, including the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), which our participation policy reflects,\" officials wrote. \"We are unable to sign any resolution agreement that would mandate we create a new policy that would violate the law and MHRA. \"As such, we have not signed and will not sign the resolution agreement sent by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. With respect to the Federal Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, resolution agreement, we were not a direct recipient of that agreement, so we are not required to respond.\" MAINE SCHOOL OFFICIALS EXPLAIN WHY STATE WAS IN 'NONCOMPLIANCE WITH TITLE IX' AFTER REFERRAL TO DOJ Maine School Administrative District 51 also pointed to the Maine Human Rights Act. \"The MSAD #51 Board of Directors is guided by the Mission, Vision, and Core Values of our district. This includes promoting a safe, caring and ethical learning environment where each person will be treated with respect and fairness; and individuals are recognized, valued and supported,\" its letter reads. \"To our students: Thank you for your maturity, perseverance, and dedication to learning through these distractions. Please continue to lead the way. \"To our teachers and staff: We deeply appreciate your unwavering commitment to our students. Your dedication makes a profound impact, and we are grateful for your resilience and compassion. Please note that no Board policies have changed at this time. We encourage you to continue supporting every student, socially and academically, as you always have.\" The Maine Human Rights Act was amended four years ago to add gender identity as a protected class and specifically stated that denying a person an equal opportunity to participate in sports is discrimination against education. The Maine Principals’ Association updated its policy to allow athletes to compete against the gender they identify as last year. A University of New Hampshire poll released Thursday showed that 64% of Maine residents believe transgender athletes \"definitely should not\" or \"probably should not\" participate in girls’ and women’s sports. Only 29% of Maine residents believed that transgender athletes \"probably should\" or \"definitely should\" compete against girls and women in sports. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Maine Gov.

He has gone so far as to declare a National Energy Emergency. However, while promises of deregulation and the removal of export controls were initially greeted with enthusiasm, that optimism has since tempered into cautious pragmatism. Increasing production to drive prices lower may be good for inflation data, but oil and gas companies must operate above their breakeven price to maintain profitability. Said simply, satisfying campaign promises to consumers and making it easy for oil executives to do business are objectives that aren’t easily reconciled.\n\nThe Crossroads of Energy Policy and Business\n\nOne of the defining features of Trump’s energy policy is his commitment to energy dominance and decreasing our country’s reliance on foreign energy means we need to drill baby drill! This means increasing domestic oil and gas production, rolling back regulations that were perceived to inhibit fossil fuel extraction, and positioning the U.S. as a global energy powerhouse. Key to this strategy is the promotion of the U.S. shale industry, which has revolutionized domestic energy production over the past decade. The U.S. has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest producer of crude oil. But further increasing energy production may be a tough pill for oil executives to swallow. An increase in production puts pressure on prices and puts pressure on existing oil infrastructure. Drilling a new shale well is not a huge cost in and of itself, but increasing production above current record levels may necessitate spending on transportation or storage systems – programs that require more up front investment with a longer payback timeline.\n\nPerhaps more important, not everything the administration has done so far has actually streamlined the process for oil companies to invest and drill. While President Trump has been vocal about encouraging energy policy, the Department of Government Efficiency’s cuts to the Bureau of Land Management and Energy Department has slowed the process for attaining export licenses and permits.\n\nFurthermore, Trump’s broader economic policies - specifically his tariffs on steel and aluminum - have had a significant impact on U.S. oil and natural gas production. These tariffs directly increase costs for producers, particularly in the construction of drilling rigs and pipelines. Steel pipe prices in particular are a significant line item in the construction of new oil and gas wells. Uncertainty around steel pricing invariably pushes the cost of production higher as it makes it more difficult for the engineering teams to accurately estimate future expenses. This in turn slows down expansion plans, especially in the offshore drilling sector, which requires heavy infrastructure investment.\n\nTariff uncertainty is also affecting the downstream U.S. oil and gas industry, particularly companies reliant on specific imported oil types. Decades of investment in transportation infrastructure and refineries designed for certain crude grades make continued imports essential, despite rising domestic production. As a result, much of the oil drilled in the U.S. is exported, while a significant portion of refined oil is imported.\n\nCanada plays a crucial role in this dynamic, supplying 98% of its crude exports to the U.S., accounting for nearly 60% of U.S. oil imports. Alberta’s oil sands hold one of the world’s largest reserves, and their thick, heavy crude is a key input for Midwest refineries. Any tariffs on Canadian oil would likely be passed on to U.S. consumers, as these refineries do not have many other potential suppliers.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNSA Warning—Change Your iPhone And Android Message Settings\n\nA Disappointing Update About ‘Solo Leveling’ Season 3\n\n‘The White Lotus’ Season 3, Episode 7 Recap And Review: I’m Starting To Worry About This Show\n\nWATFORD CITY, ND - JULY 28: Ray Gerish, a floor hand for Raven Drilling, works on an oil rig ... More drilling into the Bakken shale formation on July 28, 2013 outside Watford City, North Dakota. North Dakota has been experiencing an oil boom in recent years, due in part to new drilling techniques including hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. In April 2013, The United States Geological Survey released a new study estimating the Bakken formation and surrounding oil fields could yield up to 7.4 billion barrels of oil, doubling their estimate of 2008, which was stated at 3.65 billion barrels of oil. Workers for Raven Drilling work twelve hour days fourteen days straight, staying at a camp nearby, followed by fourteen days. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nEnergizing The US Shale Revolution\n\nHorizontal drilling technologies have unlocked previously inaccessible reserves of oil and natural gas, particularly in the Permian Basin, which alone accounts for over four million barrels per day of oil production. This surge in production has made the US the largest producer globally. Perhaps more important, U.S. shale producers can move very quickly and are highly responsive to price signals compared to traditional drillers. When global oil prices rise, U.S. shale producers quickly ramp up production, often outpacing the ability of traditional oil exporters like OPEC member countries to adjust their output.\n\nThis toggling of production is possible because of how shale oil is extracted. Traditional wells take longer to develop but can produce oil for decades. In contrast, shale wells can be drilled in just a few weeks and typically last only two to three years, with most production occurring in the first 12 to 18 months.\n\nThis shorter lifecycle allows shale producers to respond more quickly to market volatility and policy shifts, optimizing capital allocation. However, shale production is relatively expensive, with high production costs and breakeven prices between $40 and $50 per barrel. Because of its price sensitivity and short investment horizon, shale acts as a global marginal producer. When oil prices rise, shale wells can be rapidly deployed; when prices fall, investments slow, and production declines, helping to stabilize supply and prices.\n\nDisciplined capital allocation has become a primary feature of the oil industry since the oil boom and bust in 2015. High efficiency wells have allowed drillers to produce more with less. As of March 21, there were only 486 active rigs in the US, a significant decline from the 1,500-plus rigs in 2015. Technological innovation has pushed up production, minimized operational costs, and allowed drillers to be careful with their capital deployment during times of uncertainty.\n\nThe Natural Gas Transport Dilemma\n\n​Less discussed than the push to drill for oil is the potential for the US to become a dominant player in the global trade of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG.) Natural gas is often closely tied to oil drilling as both resources are commonly found together in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Natural gas has historically been harder to transport and a lower margin good. However, innovation in cooling technology has made the liquification and transportation of natural gas more viable. Liquification reduces its volume by about 600 times allowing for more efficient storage and transport. LNG can be shipped via tankers or distributed through pipelines for use in power plants, industrial manufacturing, and even transportation.\n\nThe United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter, ahead of Qatar and Australia. And the world wants what we have to sell. While the focus for power in most developed countries has been on renewables, there is still insatiable demand for new power capacity beyond what renewables can deliver. Natural gas has the opportunity to compete with coal, diesel, and other inefficient power sources across the globe, delivering cleaner and cheaper power. While not necessarily a clean form of energy, natural gas emits far less greenhouse gases when burned compared to oil and coal and is helping to bridge the gap in the transition towards cleaner energy. according to the International Energy Agency, coal consumption reached a record high in 2024 at 8.77 billion tons!\n\nThe primary constraint on LNG today is transportation capacity. While liquefaction plants are under construction at U.S. ports, these projects take time to complete. Currently, natural gas is oversupplied. In 2024, prices at the Waha Hub in West Texas even turned negative due to limited takeaway capacity, forcing producers to pay to have their gas transported away.\n\nNew natural gas production is unlikely to expand significantly until more liquefaction infrastructure is completed and takeaway capacity improves.\n\nMacro Factors Affecting Energy Production\n\nWhile energy companies are balancing tariffs and supply/demand dynamics, there’s also the macroeconomic variable like inflation and interest rate levels they need to keep in mind. While inflation has been inching its way back down to the Fed’s 2% target, rising costs for labor, materials, and equipment mean oil and gas producers face higher operational costs. The impact of inflation has been particularly evident in the upstream sector, where rising costs for drilling rigs and labor have made it more difficult to maintain production levels without significant increases in oil prices.\n\nAs it relates to interest rates, throughout much of Trump’s first term, low interest rates made borrowing cheaper, allowing oil and gas companies to finance new exploration and production projects. Now, the shift towards a more normalized rate environment has had a significant impact on shale oil producers, many of whom rely on debt to fund their capital-intensive operations. These companies now face higher borrowing costs than before, which may result in a slowdown in drilling activities.\n\nMILNE POINT, AK - NOVEMBER 19: A full moon helps illuminate the Alaskan pipeline under the faint ...

Syverson/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nInvesting in Energy Independence\n\nThe upstream sector, which focuses on oil and gas extraction, remains the most volatile but also offers significant potential during periods of high oil prices. The rise in interest rates and inflation could dampen the growth prospects of shale oil producers, particularly smaller companies that are highly sensitive to borrowing costs. However, large-cap shale producers like ConocoPhillips or EOG Resources are well-positioned to weather these challenges.\n\nInvesting midstream involves the transportation, storage, and distribution of oil and gas, and tends to be more insulated from commodity price fluctuations. Many midstream companies like Kinder Morgan (KMI) or Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) operate under long-term pricing contracts that can provide more stability in volatile markets.\n\nOn the other hand, refineries downstream regularly see big swings in their profitability. Large-scale refiners like Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Phillips 66 (PSX), and independent refiners like Valero Energy (VLO) dominate space, but the capital intensive and cyclical nature of the business is difficult to forecast for executives and investors alike. In fact, no entirely new large-scale refineries have been built in the US since the 70’s.\n\nWrapping it Up\n\nThe path to U.S. energy dominance involves balancing a variety of economic, geopolitical, and technological factors. While President Trump’s energy policy initially spurred optimism in the oil and gas sector, the realities of production costs, environmental regulations, and international trade uncertainty continue to create challenges for producers. The U.S. shale revolution, while impressive, has highlighted the volatility of the market, with factors such as fluctuating global demand and negative pricing episodes underscoring the difficulties in sustaining long-term growth. Despite these challenges, there are still opportunities for growth, especially for larger, well-capitalized producers who can navigate these complexities. Ultimately, achieving energy independence requires a delicate balancing act, and the ongoing adjustments made by both policymakers and industry leaders will shape the future of U.S. energy for years to come.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Three days later, DOGE employees made their way into the building, reportedly using a physical key from a former security contractor. The dramatic confrontations culminated in a full takeover, with former State Department official Kenneth Jackson assuming the role of president. As of this past Friday, most USIP staffers have received termination notices.\nFormer USIP officials have since filed a lawsuit against Jackson, DOGE, Donald Trump, and other members of the Trump administration, seeking an immediate intervention “to stop Defendants from completing the unlawful dismantling of the Institute,” according to the complaint. While US district judge Beryl Howell declined the USIP request for a temporary restraining order that would reinstate the institute’s board on March 19, she sharply criticized DOGE’s conquest in court.\nCourt documents filed by defendants on Monday reveal the next phase of DOGE’s plans for USIP. As of March 25, DOGE staffer Nate Cavanaugh—formerly installed at GSA—has replaced Jackson as the institute’s acting president, the documents show. They further state that Cavanaugh has been instructed to transfer USIP’s assets—including its real estate—to the GSA. The letter detailing those changes and instructions was signed by secretary of defense Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio.\nCavanaugh did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The lead attorney for the Department of Justice in this case also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a separate undated letter, which was also included in the batch of documents filed with the court, Cavanaugh writes to GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian: “I have concluded that it is in the best interest of USIP, the federal government, and the United States for USIP to transfer its real property located at 2301 Constitution Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, to GSA and to seek an exception from the 100 percent reimbursement requirement for the building.”\nCavanaugh goes on to estimate that the building has a “fair market value” of $500 million.\nIn another letter included in the lawsuit’s docket dated March 29, Project 2025 architect and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought writes to Ehikian to approve his request “to set the amount of reimbursement at no cost for the transfer of the United States Institute of Peace’s (USIP) headquarters building.”\nTo state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency, installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost.\n“The effort to transfer the building to GSA is part of the DOGE playbook to run agencies through a wood chipper. That’s what they’re trying to do,” claims George Foote, longtime outside general counsel to USIP. “They’re trying to kill the agency, which they have no right to do.”\nJudge Howell will decide whether to allow the transfer in court Tuesday; a broader ruling in the USIP case is expected by the end of the month.\nAdditional reporting by Matt Giles.","summary":"The documents reveal a DOGE affiliate is attempting to transfer the headquarters of an independent think tank, the United States Institute of Peace, to the government at no cost.","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/doge-takes-control-usip-office-building/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/67eb0fc7ccba5f471579ce2f/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/DOGE-US-Institute-of-Peace-Business-AP25077697394201.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:06:27","author":"Brian Barrett","authors":["Brian Barrett"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":306258580,"title":"CTU bargainers approve tentative contract deal.

CEO Pedro Martinez has insisted he was trying to make sure the cash-strapped district didn’t promise what it couldn’t afford.\n\nWith a settled contract, one major source of conflict is near resolution. But the school board will now have to turn its attention to a looming budget deficit, as well as finding a new CEO.\n\nCPS officials said they worked to reach “a fair contract resolution” that put students at the center of decisions.\n\n“The pending contract achieves this goal, recognizes the significant contributions of our educators, reflects the district’s budgetary constraints and fiduciary responsibilities, and avoids a strike for the first time in more than a decade,” the district said in a statement.\n\nOnce CTU members ratify the contract, the Board of Education will have to approve it. Because the contract expired last June, the board also will have to amend its current year budget to provide retroactive pay increases. A vote on that amended budget has been a major source of conflict at the board.\n\nCTU members will get 4% raises in the first year, then up to 5% in the next three. One of the union’s most significant wins was notching extra raises for veteran educators — guaranteeing annual increases through 25 years with the district.\n\nCPS also gave elementary school teachers an additional 10 minutes of planning time per day, which is less than many educators wanted. But three principal-directed professional development days each school year will become days when teachers can do their own planning.\n\nDavis Gates said the union regaining its right to bargain over nontraditional issues outside of salary and benefits in 2021, for the first time in 30 years, made a difference.\n\n“This is the first time where teachers begin to regain their voice and agency and how we should conduct school,” Davis Gates said. “In Chicago Public Schools, they become co-producers and not reactors.\n\n“We don’t want this to be a contract. We want this to catalyze a different way of doing the work,” she said.\n\nHere are five key changes in the CTU’s tentative contract, according to CTU officials and a review of the agreement:\n\nSports, arts, music: aiming for a better school experience\n\nBudget constraints, as well as the pressure to focus more on core instruction, has long limited art, music and sports in Chicago schools. As CTU has pointed out, suburban schools often have more robust offerings in these areas. In addition, CPS schools with affluent parents often use fundraising to supplement arts and sports programming, creating disparities between schools.\n\nCTU convinced CPS to commit $10 million — up from $5 million in the past — for uniforms, buses to games and supplies and to make sure this money is directed to schools with students from mostly low-income families. Coaches also will see an increase in their stipends, bringing them closer to suburban coaches.\n\nThe CTU also got the district to agree to create a cadre of art and music teachers that will be available to elementary schools without any arts programming or only one offering. This will especially help small schools that have trouble filling art positions.\n\nLower class sizes\n\nStudies show small class sizes can make a big difference, especially for low-income students. Yet lowering class size is difficult because it is costly.\n\nWith bargaining rights restored by the state Legislature, this was the first contract where CTU could directly negotiate over class size, though it has made it an issue in previous contract fights.\n\nThe big battle has always been over what is considered overcrowded and in need of relief. In this contract, CTU was able to lower that threshold at every level. Kindergarten classes will see the most dramatic reduction, from 32 to 25 students. And classes with more than 23 students will automatically get an assistant teacher. Most other grade levels will go from a maximum of 36 or 32 students to 29.\n\nCPS agreed to $40 million to address class size issues, up from the $25 million in the 2019 contract. Altogether, CTU says at least 400 teaching assistants will be hired under this contract, most to make class sizes more manageable and to give all preschool classes an assistant. CTU also is touting that CPS agreed to take action on class size early in the year, rather than waiting until the 20th day for the official enrollment count.\n\nLibrarians make a comeback\n\nChicago kids could see dozens more librarians in their schools over the next few years.\n\nThe CTU has made a stink about a lack of libraries in CPS for more than a decade. When schools lost funding over the years, librarians and libraries were often one of the first to be cut. Today, about four in five CPS schools don’t have a librarian.\n\nThe tentative agreement guarantees 90 new librarian positions over the next three years — 30 each year. The district will also pay for 40 educators to receive a library endorsement at a local university every year.\n\nAnd a new program will be aimed at redeveloping some libraries by figuring out what resources schools may need, and how to secure book collections.\n\nBilingual and special education\n\nQuinella Bounds works as a special education case manager at two schools. She develops and monitors the education plans for almost 200 students. This contract ensures that no case manager will have more than 70 students.\n\n“I will be able to do what the job really entails,” she said. “I will be able to collaborate with general education teachers, and to work with students and parents. That’s phenomenal.”\n\nIn addition, special education teachers will get more planning time and time to work with general education teachers under the tentative contract.\n\nAlso, CTU sought to address some concerns around bilingual education as CPS has seen a surge in students needing language support. The union convinced the district to double the number of teachers working with students who need English Language instruction.\n\nProtections in the Trump era\n\nBoth CPS officials and CTU educators have vowed to combat the effects of President Donald Trump’s administration in a number of areas.\n\nThe new CTU contract cements sanctuary protections for immigrant students and families, barring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from entering schools without a warrant, giving employees leave for immigration matters and providing more resources to English language learners.\n\nCPS has also agreed to hire several “gender support coordinators,” and set a requirement that preferred names and pronouns be used at all times.\n\nThe contract also guarantees the right to abortion coverage for school workers, promising to cover the full cost of care after the insurance deductible.\n\nOn climate change, the district and union agreed to partner on a joint committee for climate preparedness, to install solar panels at 30 schools, work to remove lead pipes from service lines connected to schools and introduce scratch kitchens at 25 schools.\n\nNader Issa covers education for the Chicago Sun-Times.

As it is, Dublin is running out of options quickly and if anything happens to the single pipe that serves the capital from the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant in Kildare, chaos is guaranteed.\n\nSure, the scheme to source water for Dublin from the Shannon basin is radical and foresighted, but it is going to take at least another decade to complete. So too the situation in Cork City, where the 300km of cast iron pipes distributing water across the city is old and truculent and will have to be replaced in its entirety.\n\nIt is a similar situation in cities, towns, and villages across the country, not to mention those rural areas where supply and demand are constant issues for many.\n\nUisce Éireann does have a €10.2bn, five-year investment plan to achieve water and waste water compliance and replace ageing and failing assets, as well as building resilience into the system. Whatever about the sum of money it has at its disposal, the timescale being allowed for the work seems unrealistic and far-fetched.\n\nWater is our lifeblood and the Government must seize the moment and begin a co-ordinated and finely tuned action plan to right decades of wrong.\n\nTalk of third term\n\nIt may be April 1, a date associated with spoof news stories and tall yarns aimed at causing mirth and confusion in equal measure, but with Donald Trump as US president it should come as no surprise that he is “not joking” about seeking an unconstitutional third term in the Oval Office.\n\nInterviewed at the weekend, the US president said with typical ambivalence that “a lot of people” wanted him to serve a third term and suggested there were ways and means of securing this aim.\n\nTo do so would run afoul of the 22nd Amendment of the US constitution which states: “No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.” His weekend interview, however, disabused the notion that he was only jesting about such a move. “No, no, I’m not joking,” he said, adding that there were “methods which you could do it”.\n\nHaving already likened himself to a king, shown affinity to autocratic leaders, and displayed governance tactics which constitutional experts and historians reckon is close to authoritarianism, it is a certainty he is not kidding about a third term. When he assumed office as America’s 47th president in January, he committed himself under oath to “faithfully execute” his role and to “preserve, protect, and defend” the constitution of the US.\n\nAs he is already plummeting the country towards a constitutional crisis because he and his supporters have taken so many steps to circumvent the constraints placed by the constitution on his executive authority – not to mention a level of expansionism not seen since his predecessor Andrew McKinley — it seems the trivial matter of a third term will not be thwarted.\n\nThat he has left nobody guessing about his desire to enjoy a level of independent authority similar to that exercised by leaders in China and Russia and wishes for nothing less than federal ignorance of his peoples’ health and education requirements, should be deeply worrying for the citizens of his country.\n\nIt is to be hoped, therefore, that the Federal and Supreme Court judges remain true to their obligation to uphold a constitution their president seems determined to shatter.","summary":"The development of water services across the country needs to be addressed fast — and particularly so if the Government's ambition of 50,000 new homes annually is to be met","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41604247.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9126/4563241_3_seoimage1x1_iStock-1471071579_1_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-01 00:00:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.002},{"id":306259882,"title":"Stunning view of Earth captured by China's Tiangong Space Station","text":"LadBibleNASA astronaut makes comment to Elon Musk and Donald Trump in first interview since returning from spaceBarry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita Williams have done their first sit down interview since returning to Earth\n\nLadBibleNew recycling rules for all households in England after government announcementThe government’s Simpler Recycling plan is already taking shape in the workplace\n\n Why this ad?Go ad-free* \n\nLadBibleNASA astronauts speak out for first time since returning to Earth after spending nine months 'stranded' in spaceNASA astronauts Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Suni Williams were stranded for nine months in space\n\nSky News'You can start with me': Commander of NASA flight that was stranded in space for more than nine months says he is partly to blameOne of the astronauts who was stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) has said some of the blame for what went wrong lies with him.

The order also meant he would no longer have to pay $96 million in restitution and forfeiture. \n\nIt was an extraordinary plot twist for Watson. In July, he was convicted of a massive fraud in an eight-week trial which revealed how his media company Ozy—the buzzy start-up that seemed to be inexplicably everywhere and nowhere at once throughout the 2010s—had been built on lies. \n\nI spent my summer watching that trial for a three-part podcast on Watson’s rise and fall. \n\nNow, it seems, he is rising again. And dodging 10 years in federal prison might not even be the final twist in the plot. I’m told by a source close to Watson that a full pardon is still being explored and may come next.\n\nThe clemency was facilitated by Dr. Topeka Sam, a prison reform activist, who was introduced to Watson by his spokesperson Juda Engelmayer. \n\nSam is perhaps best known for bringing attention to the case of Alice Marie Johnson, a mother of five who was then serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug offense, ultimately inspiring Kim Kardashian to lobby the first Trump administration on her behalf. \n\nJohnson’s sentence was commuted in 2018 and she was granted a full pardon 2 years later. She currently serves as the Trump administration’s “pardon czar.” Sam and Johnson remain close, according to Engelmayer.\n\nFor a Black man who will tell you himself he embodies the American dream - born to teachers of modest means in Florida and educated at Harvard and Stanford – his sudden turn to Trump is a shocking turn but not entirely surprising. Watson is a man who has always been able to talk his way into and out of anything. \n\nWhen Watson spoke at his sentencing in December, he turned his back to the judge and faced the gallery to talk directly to his family and friends. After thanking them for their support, he began to reel off a list of his accomplishments of his now defunct media company, concluding “I loved what we built with Ozy.” Eventually the judge cut him off and ordered him to turn back and face the court. \n\nIt felt more like a campaign stop—or acceptance speech—than the show of remorse or heartfelt plea for leniency one might expect from a man who had just months before been convicted of aggravated identity theft and conspiring to defraud investors of millions of dollars and facing up to 37 years in prison. \n\nAs a reminder, Carlos Watson’s company began to unravel when The New York Times published this article revealing that in Feb. 2021, Watson’s co-founder, Samir Rao, used a voice changing app to impersonate a YouTube executive on a funding call with Goldman Sachs. The call was a desperate attempt by Watson and Rao to raise $45 million because Ozy was running out of cash. \n\nInstead, it led to an FBI investigation and a criminal indictment. Rao and Watson’s former chief of staff Suzee Han were also indicted and turned on Watson, testifying at his trial that he was the driving force behind the fraud and a domineering leader who demanded total control.\n\nIn one particularly dramatic piece of testimony, Han, who was 25 when she went to work for Watson, said that at some point the pressures of the conspiracy got so great that she told Watson she could understand “why someone would want to kill themselves” and Watson’s response was to suggest that he or Rao should go to therapy with her. \n\nRao testified for 6 days, detailing a number of lies he helped Watson tell investors. Watson told them that Oprah was investing $10 million in Ozy (she was not). \n\nThat A-Rod and Jennifer Lopez were leading an investment round (they were not). \n\nThat Google’s CEO had offered to buy the company for $600 million (he testified at trial that he had not). \n\nProsecutors also said that Watson lied about the size of Ozy’s audience; about TV shows he never sold; and about revenue numbers, doubling and tripling them to show enormous growth that did not exist. And because of those lies, investors put at least $75-100 million into Ozy Media over the course of 6 years (Notably, Laurene Powell Jobs, who he had been friends with for 20 years, was his lead investor at launch.) \n\nBut in court, Watson conceded nothing. He stood by everything he has said – even when presented with clear evidence to the contrary. He took the stand and said he did nothing that others in digital media and Silicon Valley more broadly weren’t doing and that his company was brought down by ruthless competitors (The New York Times and Buzzfeed) intimidated by his enormous success. He insisted that the company was poised for a comeback when he was arrested in 2023, even though it had lost the majority of its board, investors and staff.\n\nHe repeated those claims in his statement Friday, calling the cases “baseless” and saying he was the victim of “a malicious campaign orchestrated by a jealous competitor at a rival media company.” But he also took them a step further, saying that “OZY... was on the brink of becoming Silicon Valley’s first Black-owned publicly traded company before these wrongful actions derailed our progress.” \n\nThere’s no evidence that Ozy was on the brink of any such thing and plenty of evidence that it was not. It’s that very tenuous relationship to the truth, the utter lack of remorse and that complete abdication of responsibility that has left some of his former employees who I spoke to over the weekend absolutely furious at this turn of events. \n\nThey couldn’t quite believe that he had someone managed to work the system yet again and will now likely never have to admit to any wrongdoing. \n\nIt’s an interesting case for the Trump administration to take up — seemingly at odds with much of their stated views on racial issues and DEI. Watson, who is black, insisted throughout his trial and sentencing that the charges against him were racially motivated. \n\nHe launched a website called “Too Black for Business” where he has railed against “white collar racism,” pointing out that the “hostile white judge” overseeing his case was a Trump appointee and said his prosecution was “part of a broader pattern in America’s history of tearing down Black excellence.” He called the case a “modern lynching” in his sentencing speech. \n\nOther Black entrepreneurs have not rallied in his support, rejecting his racial framing of the charges. The most vocal, Roland Martin, called him “OJ two point oh” and said of Watson’s troubles “If you’re doing some illegal s---, don’t be trying to all of a sudden cloak yourself in blackness.” And it’s worth noting that U.S. Attorney Breon Peace who brought the charges against Watson is himself a Black man. \n\nWatson made no mention of any racial issues in his statement about his commutation, instead thanking the president, with whom he is not known to have a relationship, for “his unwavering commitment to fairness and justice” and saying “President Trump has once again demonstrated his courage in standing up against the weaponization of the legal system by unscrupulous actors who aim to destroy innovative companies.” \n\nWhen the judge imposed his sentence in December, he talked about Watson’s “denial of responsibility” and “striking determination” to blame others. And he said that he was concerned that Watson would likely reoffend if given the opportunity: “I don’t see any reason why, as soon as you were able to, that you wouldn’t simply repeat the behaviors that led us to this point.” \n\nThat opportunity has come now, so much sooner than even Watson dared to dream it could.\n\nListen to Susie Banikarim’s full podcast The Unraveling of Ozy Media by clicking here.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyCarlos Watson was on his way to the federal correctional facility in Lompoc, California—to serve an almost 10 year prison sentence—when President Donald Trump saved him. \n\nJust hours before Watson was to surrender last Friday, he heard that Trump had commuted his sentence.

Well, you may be facing spread of infectious diseases, measles, pertussis, drug-resistant tuberculosis from the U.S.,” he said in a virtual panel presentation.\n\n“You will also be facing spread of infections diseases globally that will increase predictably as a result of these ill-considered changes,” said Frieden, who is now president and CEO of global health agency Resolve to Save Lives.\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a U.S. virologist who has worked at the University of Saskatchewan for the last few years, said she’s particularly worried about what may happen to influenza surveillance given the threat posed by H5N1 avian flu, which has sickened dozens of people in the United States — mostly from contact with infected poultry or cattle — and hospitalized a Canadian teenager in British Columbia.\n\n“If H5N1 does manage to make the leap into being transmitted efficiently from person to person, then our ability to contain that is going to be completely dependent on us catching an early cluster of infection very fast and being able to send people out and contain it,” Rasmussen said.\n\nShe said she’s been speaking to many colleagues in the United States who work for or are funded by Health and Human Services agencies on the Signal private messaging app because they’re under a communications ban.\n\n“They’re risking their jobs and their livelihoods if they violate it,” said Rasmussen.\n\n“Many of them are violating it anyways through these secure encrypted channels because they think that we should know what’s going on at these agencies, how it’s affecting them and how it’s actually going to affect public health in general.”\n\nRasmussen praised the CMAJ for speaking out: “Institutions need to be screaming about this.”\n\n“Canadian journals need to hold the line. They need to establish what our values are and our values are publishing great science and standing up for democracy,” she said.\n\nPatrick said medical journals should be platforms for defending science, including on topics that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to control such as gender and race.\n\n“We can’t control what the U.S. is doing to individual researchers. However, we can say, ‘Hey, we’re still here publishing science that looks at the whole picture with our standards for reporting race and ethnicity and reporting gender and all that kind of stuff,” she said.\n\nRasmussen echoed Patrick’s call for the Canadian government to shore up research in this country.\n\n“It’s not, I think, an exaggeration to say that we’re going to be entering a really profoundly bad time, almost like a modern Dark Age. Canada has the ability, I think, to try to be a little bit of light in the dark,” she said.\n\nRasmussen urged “whichever party is in power after the election” to “strongly consider increasing their investments in our long-term global health and emergency response capacity.”\n\n“The CDC is broken, the NIH is going to be broken and it’s being dismantled from the inside out. And we’re not going to have the support of my home country and one of our best allies … anymore.

The program is overseen by the Administration for Children and Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe agency said in a news release Thursday that the request is permitted under the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\n“As part of our radical transparency efforts, I will ensure the curriculum students are taught is age-appropriate and medically accurate,” said Andrew Gradison, the agency’s acting assistant secretary.\n\nAlex Pfeiffer, deputy assistant to the president, posted on the social media platform X that California was “using taxpayer money to teach kids about sex toys and role playing,” linking to a DailyMail article with the same headline.\n\nThe explanation for the probe is disingenuous, said Jorge Reyes Salinas, director of communications at Equality California, a nonprofit LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group.\n\n“This is not about transparency. This is about censorship,” Salinas said. “This attack by the federal administration is really about censorship and how to get rid of resources for people that need them the most… And this is not just about eliminating conversations about gender-affirming care…but really about keeping people in the dark about health and personal sexual health.”\n\nIn California, the Personal Responsibility Education Program funds 22 agencies – county health departments, family resource centers and Planned Parenthood – in 20 counties with the highest need for sex health education and services, according to the state health department. The program has reached over 40,000 youth throughout the state since 2012.\n\nGradison, of the Administration for Children and Families, did not elaborate on what, if any, concerns the agency had with California’s program’s materials. It said Friday the request to review California’s curriculum is “standard practice” but would not confirm whether it was the only state to receive the request.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health said in a statement Friday that it would comply with the request, but didn’t respond to a question about whether this is the first time the state has been asked to submit its materials for review.\n\nThe department receives the most grant funding of any recipient under the program — $5.8 million to teach abstinence, safe sex practices and HIV-prevention to high-needs populations, including LGBTQ youth, homeless youth, minorities, migrant farmworkers, foster youth and incarcerated youth. The program also teaches about forming healthy relationships and life skills and teaches “adolescent development,” including physical and reproductive development and identity. The program’s curriculum includes language affirming different gender identities, sexual orientations and LGBTQ youth.\n\nThe probe comes as the Trump administration has pursued efforts to target transgender protections. Since he took office in January, President Donald Trump has signed several anti-trans executive orders, including orders that only recognize two sexes, limit gender-affirming treatments for youth and prohibit transgender players from participating in high school and college sports.\n\nThe administration has cracked down on California in particular, starting six new investigations against the state on Thursday, targeting the state’s controversial transgender bill prohibiting schools from requiring staff to notify families if their child uses a different name or gender than on their school record, evaluating affirmative action policies at a handful of California universities and suppressing the state’s use of federal funding to support undocumented students, among others.\n\nWhile state law requires that students in grades 7-12 receive sexual health and HIV prevention education at least once in middle school and once in high school, California does not have a statewide sex education curriculum so school districts, school boards and county offices of education are in charge of choosing the course materials taught in classrooms. The law states the material must meet core standards and be age appropriate and medically accurate. This material is not part of the probe.\n\nSex education in California must include all genders and sexual orientations, as well as discuss gender identity and expression.\n\nSalinas, at Equality California, said he wasn’t aware of the federal government ever reviewing state sexual education materials but wasn’t surprised, based on the executive orders that have already come from the Trump administration.\n\n“This is a way to hold states’, and in particular California’s, federal money hostage to threaten taking away funding to change the narrative and to censor the most vulnerable groups,” Salinas said. “This is part of their efforts to erase transgender people from history books (and) from society.”","summary":"The probe targets California’s Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), a national, $75 million program that teaches youth and teens about abstinence and contraception to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/31/trump-targets-california-sex-ed/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SJM-L-SEXEDUC-01XX-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 23:53:59","author":"Molly Gibbs","authors":["Molly Gibbs"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.195},{"id":306255404,"title":"Stocks see wild swings in run-up to Trump’s tariff roll-out","text":"A renewed wave of volatility gripped global markets just days ahead of US President Donald Trump’s tariff roll-out, with stocks erasing losses in the final stretch of a jittery quarter. As equities bounced, bonds moved away from session highs. Gold climbed to a record.\nFrom New York to London and Tokyo, stocks were hit by intense swings. While the S&P 500 wiped out a 1.7 per cent drop, US shares saw their worst quarter since 2022. Defensive groups led gains on Monday. Energy producers joined a rally in oil after Trump suggested the US may work to curtail crude shipments from Russia. Megacaps remained under pressure.\nIt is the first time since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 that bonds rose and stocks fell in a three-month period. The dollar, long a go-to hiding place during market sell-offs, has not been acting as such lately. The US dollar saw its worst start to a year since 2017.\nThe Trump administration’s mixed messaging on what new tariffs will be unveiled on Wednesday and how they will be announced have traders flustered as they try to position around the biggest risk confronting the market in years.\nTrump will announce his reciprocal tariff push on Wednesday during an event in the White House Rose Garden. His top spokesperson said the announcement would feature “country-based” tariffs, but added that the president is also “committed” to implementing sectoral duties at another time.\n“Tariffs will likely continue to drive the market discussion,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Whether tariffs are more or less rigid than expected could go a long way toward shaping the market’s near-term momentum.”\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent. The Nasdaq 100 was little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1 per cent. Tesla and Nvidia led losses in megacaps, while Apple gained. Newsmax shares skyrocketed in their debut session. Vaccine stocks plunged after a top regulator left the US Food and Drug Administration.\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 4.22 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2 per cent. Gold topped US$3,100 for the first time.\n\nTrump’s trade war revived fears that the economy could stall, but most economists still are not anticipating the US will fall into an actual recession in the next year, but they do say the chance of an economic contraction has increased. Another worry, in the view of economists and market watchers, is the risk that a slowdown in growth will occur alongside accelerating inflation, a dreaded scenario known as stagflation.\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams told Yahoo Finance there is a risk of higher inflation this year, though his baseline view is that it will remain relatively stable.\nAmid all the concern about the economic impacts of tariffs, Goldman Sachs’ David Kostin cut his S&P 500 target, and now expects the benchmark to end the year around 5,700 versus his previous estimate of 6,200.\n“If the growth outlook and investor confidence deteriorate even further, valuations could decline much more than we forecast,” Kostin wrote in a note. “We continue to recommend investors watch for an improvement in the growth outlook, more asymmetry in market pricing, or depressed positioning before trying to trade a market bottom.”\nKeith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services noted that as the economic backdrop weakens relative to consensus expectations, earnings are likely to be reset lower at a time where valuations are improved but not compelling.\n“Investors should be more neutral and less on offence relative to recent years given a more mixed risk/reward backdrop,” he said. “Thus, we expect the choppy market environment to persist over the next several weeks and likely months, and we are not likely to see a quick return to new highs.”\nA stock-market signal is flashing a warning to investors hoping for a speedy recovery from this year’s sharp equity sell-off.\nThe correlation between individual S&P 500 – measuring the degree to which they move in tandem – stands near the lowest level in 25 years even after rising this month, according to data compiled by independent strategist Jim Paulsen.\n\nSo far, “we have had a very methodical and almost boring correction”, said Paulsen, whose four-decade career on Wall Street included stints at Leuthold Group and Wells Capital Management. “Correlation is just another component that tells me we haven’t done what we need to do to set us up for the next leg higher.”\nStock market traders have their eyes glued to some key technical charts to get a sense of where the market is headed next as the equities rout becomes increasingly intense over fears of trade uncertainty and slowing economic growth.\nThe S&P 500 briefly sank below the first ominous milestone traders were watching at the start of the session – 5,504.65, the most recent intraday low touched on March 13. But the broad equities benchmark quickly reclaimed that level. The question now is whether it stays there.\nTechnical strategists also recommend keeping an eye on market breadth, looking for more evidence of washed-out conditions. A 10 per cent or less reading in the percentage of stocks trading above their 20-day moving average would be “a good sign of a capitulation,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.","summary":"Mixed messages on new tariffs have traders flustered as they try to position around biggest risk confronting the market in years.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3304651/stocks-see-wild-swings-run-trumps-tariff-roll-out","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/01/21af6473-bfc3-4250-90e0-2c12b2611755_f507830d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 23:53:17","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":306255350,"title":"Musk reveals eye-watering amount he is giving 'baby mama' influencer Ashley St. Clair in trashy public spat","text":"Elon Musk claims he has forked out at least $2.5 million in payments to Ashley St Clair but maintains he does not know if he is the father of her child. \n\nIt comes after DailyMail.com spoke to St. Clair, who sold her $100,000 Model S Tesla, outside her Manhattan apartment on Saturday. \n\n'I need to make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son's child support,' she told a DailyMail.com reporter who witnessed her handing the $100,000 car over to a representative from the online auto sales giant Carvana.\n\nDOGE chief Musk - who is currently entangled in a custody lawsuit with St. Clair - addressed the rumors on X, the social media platform he owns, on Monday.\n\n'I don’t know if the child is mine or not, but am not against finding out. No court order is needed, he said.\n\nHe then spelled out the amount of money he has provided the conservative influencer. \n\n'Despite not knowing for sure, I have given Ashley $2.5M and am sending her $500k/year.'\n\nSt. Clair immediately clapped back, calling Musk a 'petulant man-child' who needed to take responsibility.\n\n'Elon, we asked you to confirm paternity through a test before our child (who you named) was even born. You refused,' she said.\n\nShe also clarified that it wasn't sending her money but 'sending support for your child that you thought was necessary… until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for “disobedience.” But you’re really only punishing your son.'\n\nSt. Clair then referenced his most recent move in court, an attempt to silence her, while he posts on X. \n\n'It’s ironic that your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world. It’s all about control with you, and everyone can see it.'\n\nShe dropped one last insult to the CEO of multiple companies and Donald Trump's closest ally in Washington: 'America needs you to grow up, you petulant man-child.'\n\nMusk has yet to respond directly to St. Clair on social media.\n\nSt. Clair went public in a bombshell post on Musk's social media site X last month, sensationally revealing the Tesla and SpaceX owner to be the father of her baby boy, born in September last year.\n\nShe says Musk 'slid into my DMs' in May 2023, and that the child, who has been named publicly only by his initials 'R.S.C.', was conceived early January 2024 on a trip to the island of Saint Barthélemy in the Caribbean.\n\nThe DOGE head's representatives did not immediately return a call asking for comment.\n\nMusk, 53, has not publicly acknowledged the child as his own, but has responded with cryptic emojis to posts on X about St. Clair's claims.\n\nSt. Clair filed a paternity and a custody lawsuit in a New York court on February 21, claiming Musk told her to keep the baby secret, then ghosted her and their son in the middle of child support negotiations, forcing her to go public and take legal action.\n\nA source close to the case told DailyMail.com that since going public, Musk 'retaliated' by slashing her payments in half 'unilaterally', leaving St. Clair struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe source described the billionaire's actions as 'shocking and shameful' but did not acknowledge the alleged payments admitted by Musk on Monday. \n\n'Ever since she got pregnant and then had the baby, Elon's been providing support money to her,' the source said. 'But he had a fairly specific list of requirements, including not acknowledging he's the father.\n\n'Since the moment she objected to the level of control he demanded, he's withdrawn from her completely. When she went public with the fact that the baby was his, he's never spoken to her again.\n\n'When this thing went into court for custody and paternity, he cut the support payments way back. He cut it by more than half.\n\n'It's a substantial reduction, and he obviously did it as a form of retaliation for her going into court,' the source claimed.\n\nSt. Clair also has a three-year-old son from a previous partner, New York chiropractor Johnny Alexander.\n\nShe has been raising the toddler and baby with the help of a full-time nanny at her rented three-bed apartment in downtown Manhattan.\n\n'She bought a Tesla so she'd have a car to transport both the children in. Now she's selling it because she needs to raise money to cover the expenses she has that Elon has simply not paid.\n\n'She's been living on her own. She gets no logistics assistance from Elon. And all of a sudden, she's punitively given much less money to raise this child than she's ever had.'\n\nThe alleged behavior has given some close to St. Clair a low opinion of Musk.\n\n'The richest guy in the world, to treat a woman that he made a baby with this way, is shocking and shameful,' the close source told DailyMail.com.\n\nMusk's lawyers successfully petitioned the New York judge to seal the case on March 14, keeping its details secret and limiting St. Clair's ability to speak out.\n\n'This guy, who is supposedly dedicated to transparency and accountability in government, the first thing he did when he went into court was to try to gag Ashley so that she couldn't say anything, even as he was unilaterally cutting her support,' the source said.\n\nSt. Clair's custody petition, obtained by DailyMail.com before the case was sealed, made damning claims against the confirmed father of 12 by three women.\n\nShe stated she was ready to go all-in on the relationship, agreeing to 'relocate to Austin, Texas upon the child's birth', then switching to remaining in New York at his request from July last year.\n\nBut the court documents paint a callous picture of Musk, claiming he chose not to be present at his son's birth, that he has only met him three times, and 'has had no involvement in his care and upbringing'.\n\nShe claimed Musk 'first met R.S.C. on September 21, 2024 in New York City for two hours. He then spent one hour visiting R.S.C. and me the next day, September 22, 2024.'\n\n'The next, and last time that Respondent saw our child was on November 30, 2024 in Austin, Texas, for only thirty minutes,' the February 21, 2025 filing said.\n\n'Respondent has never asked to see our child on any other occasion, he has never communicated to me about our child without my prompting, he has never asked for photos of our child or checked in after doctor's appointments.'\n\nThough filings are now sealed, the case dockets are still visible – and contain hints that the judge is sympathetic to St. Clair's case.\n\nHer attorney Karen Rosenthal filed a proposed 'order to show cause' in St. Clair's custody case on March 20, likely asking the judge to order Musk to provide responses and engage in the case or face a default judgment, along with 12 exhibits.\n\nEight days later, Judge Jeffrey Pearlman appears to have acquiesced, issuing the order.\n\nThe only filings from Musk's lawyers in the case, Alyssa Rower and Jennifer Isaacman of Rower LLC, are about having it sealed.\n\nWhen asked if she felt Musk was being 'vindictive' toward her, St. Clair, responded: 'Well, that's his modus operandi, when women speak out.\n\n'You can check the stocks, I'm not the only one who is cleaning up after his messes.\n\nShe said of anti-Tesla protests: 'The markets are catching up to what I have known for a long time.\n\nSt. Clair said the last time she tried to speak to Musk was February 13, but he did not respond.","summary":"It comes after DailyMail.com spoke to St. Clair, who sold her $100,000 Model S Tesla, outside her Manhattan apartment on Saturday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14556845/elon-musk-paying-ashley-st-clair-child-support.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/01/00/96767479-0-image-a-13_1743464249939.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/31/4852709151927321943/1024x576_MP4_4852709151927321943.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-31 23:52:02","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Listen here\n\nBy ALEX BRUMMER\n\nPublished: 00:05 BST, 1 April 2025 | Updated: 00:52 BST, 1 April 2025\n\nDonald Trump avoided introducing his latest raft of tariffs today, on April 1, for fear he would be ridiculed for bringing in such radical measures on April Fool's Day. Instead, the event he has labelled Liberation Day will fall tomorrow.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped it being greeted with horror around the world. Share prices on Wall Street suffered catastrophic falls yesterday, with Britain's FTSE100 down as well.\n\nTrump's shock and awe tariffs against friend and foe alike are sapping the wealth of investors across the globe, with the financial news service Bloomberg reporting that US shares have endured their worst quarter for 23 years.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, a champion of free markets, has gone so far as to describe the US's trade battles 'as the dumbest in history'.\n\nAnd the UK is uniquely vulnerable, as we face a double whammy this week. Next Sunday – the first day of the new fiscal year – Labour's swingeing tax increases, notably the confidence-crushing rise in employers' national insurance, will come into effect.\n\nBefore the current blitz of measures, the average US tariff on imports was 3 per cent. In Europe it is 5 per cent and in China 10 per cent. The President regards the disparity between these rates as profoundly unfair.\n\nTrump's predecessor, Joe Biden, may have gifted him a growing economy, with falling unemployment, but it came at a price. Biden's big-spending measures, notably the post-Covid $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, the $3 trillion (misnamed) Inflation Reduction Act and the $53 billion Chips Act – designed to promote domestic semiconductor manufacture – sent American borrowing and debt soaring. \n\nThe fiscal deficit climbed to 6 per cent of the entire economy and the national debt to $37 trillion – 124 per cent of total output.\n\nDonald Trump avoided introducing his latest raft of tariffs today, on April 1, for fear he would be ridiculed for bringing in such radical measures on April Fool's Day, writes Daily Mail columnist Alex Brummer\n\nShare prices on Wall Street suffered catastrophic falls yesterday, with Britain's FTSE100 down as well (Pictured: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange -- March 31, 2025)\n\nAlex Brummer (pictured) has been City Editor of the Daily Mail since 2000 and is the paper's leading economic commentator\n\nSavage cuts being engineered by Trump and Elon Musk are intended to move the dial on borrowing and debt in the opposite direction. They are also determined to return manufacturing to the US by imposing drastic tariffs.\n\nFoul play lurking in the City: No excuses for bosses who abuse their positions: ALEX BRUMMER\n\nThis combination of measures, it is hoped, will create the headroom for Congress to renew Trump's first-term tax cuts.\n\nAt first, Western leaders assumed that the White House's radical plans for a trade war were a negotiating position, to be modified once its trading partners made concessions.\n\nNo such luck.\n\nNow carmakers across the globe face a hugely damaging 25 per cent tariff on exports to the US and the very real possibility of a global recession, a downturn in growth and a rise in unemployment.\n\nIn the UK, the Office for Budget Responsibility warns Trump's trade war could knock between 0.2 and 0.6 percentage points off Britain's fragile growth rate, tipped to be just 1 per cent this year.\n\nIt could also lead to surging import prices, which will fuel inflation, postponing any hope of early cuts in UK interest rates.\n\nKeir Starmer is aiming to negotiate an exception for the UK in exchange for a far broader trade deal. \n\nNew Range Rovers are displayed at the Jaguar, Land Rover dealership showroom in Southend -- March 27, 2025 \n\nEven if he were to succeed, our carmakers, which import tariff-inflated parts and components from across the globe, would still be impacted. \n\nUnpredictability hurts most, however. City broker Investec notes that 'uncertainty looks almost certain to persist beyond April 2'. \n\nIn other words, hopes of a prolonged rally in stocks are probably misplaced.\n\nBritain, if talks on a trade deal progress satisfactorily, could shelter itself from the worst of the tariff war. \n\nEven if the UK were forced to accept a 25 per cent tariff on luxury car exports – such as Land Rovers and Bentleys – it might not be a total disaster, as distributors and consumers would absorb at least some of the hit.\n\nBut the real and present danger for Starmer, his Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Britain as a whole is an intransigent America.

Farmers that grow milling wheat have gone on strike from April 1.\n\n“They will not be loading any trucks with milling wheat and we will probably run out of flour.\n\n“So if you’re wondering why the shelves are empty, get onto your local MP and say you need to help these farmers out, you can’t carry on putting them out of business.\n\n“If there is rationing on bread and cakes and hot cross buns, it is the politicians fault, its not our fault, we can’t carry on like this or we won’t be in business.”\n\nThis comes as Britain faces a “hat-trick of horrors” with higher taxes, possible US trade tariffs and new regulation on businesses.\n\nRachel Reeves and Sir Keir Starmer are scrambling to convince Donald Trump not to clobber us with crippling trade levies on April 2.\n\nThe tariffs would drive up prices, wipe out growth, and send Labour’s economic plans into meltdown.\n\nJust four days later, on April 6, the £24 billion National Insurance tax hike comes into force potentially devastating high streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the workers rights bill – which is currently being debated by parliament – is also set to hammer firms with growth-choking red tape.\n\nKemi Badenoch warned “hat-trick of horrors” will lay waste to UK plc.\n\nWriting in The Sun on Sunday, the Tory Party leader said: “The Prime Minister needs to get a grip before this triple whammy of economic pain sticks our country in a doom loop of stagnant growth and unemployment.”\n\nBusiness chiefs warned the triple blow will drive up prices and lead to a tsunami of job losses.\n\nKate Nicholls, CEO of UK Hospitality – an umbrella group which represents pubs, clubs and restaurants – said: “Businesses are being battered by decisions made in Westminster.”\n\nThe Labour government is already on the ropes on the economy.\n\nEarlier this week, the government’s fiscal watchdog the OBR halved its growth prediction for the next year to a paltry 1 per cent.\n\nBut the grim economic picture is poised to get even worse this week.\n\nPresident Trump is threatening to slap tariffs of up to 25 per cent on all countries that impose VAT on goods – including the UK.\n\nThe PM and his team are in frantic talks with the White House to try to avoid the crippling levies – which come into force this Wednesday.\n\nIf they fail, Britain’s entire economic growth could be wiped out at one flick of Donald Trump’s pen.\n\nThis would send prices rocketing and could lead to heavy job losses.\n\nDowning Street insiders said talks will “go down to the wire” and could even carry on after April 2 – which is being dubbed Liberation Day in the White House.\n\nNo 10 does not believe a trade war is in anybody’s interests. Ministers are in talks with the US to try to avoid tariffs.\n\nTalks will continue through and after April 2 – that is not the end of the negotiations.\n\nNo10 says all options are on the table – including retaliatory tariffs.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA HOT cross bun shortage is on the cards this Easter as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: UK Faces Easter Hot Cross Bun Shortage Amid Outcry from Food Makers Over Reeves&#8217; Tractor Levy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/uk-faces-easter-hot-cross-bun-shortage-amid-outcry-from-food-makers-over-reeves-tractor-levy/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-telford-england-chancellor-rachel-983871349.jpg?strip=all&w=960","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-31 23:49:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":306257554,"title":"Greenland, eyeing independence, strengthens Danish ties","text":"Camera IconGreenland has overwhelmingly rejected Donald Trump's idea of annexing the nation.

Coyne at The Wall Street Journal, because it had “abandoned science.” In November, it posted an essay “denying the basic biological fact that all animals, including humans, have only two sexes.” It ran his rebuttal, “Biology is not bigotry,” but quickly took it down saying that was an error in judgment. “In many ways, transgender ideology is no different from the religious dogma the FFRF was founded to oppose.” It tars dissenters as “transphobes,” silences critics and “proselytizes” in schools; proponents deem themselves “morally correct.” In fact, “biological sex is a scientific issue,” but the FFRF has “abandoned science” for an “embrace of quasireligious” dogma, so “I’m proud to proclaim myself a heretic.”\n\nEd desk: Good Moms vs. Suspicious Schools\n\nPennsylvania mom Anne Trethewey is “the face of a growing band of parents fighting to force better transparency and accountability in their children’s schools,” notes The Free Press’ Frannie Block. In 2020, she began attending school board meetings after the district started indoctrinating kids with DEI. With other local parents she joined activist group Moms for Liberty and started asking questions. In 2023 the district nixed her request for info by “arguing that the DEI training materials couldn’t be shared with the public because they were ‘trade secrets.’ ” State courts rejected that claim in February; now the local court must decide “whether the DEI training materials could be considered ‘confidential proprietary information.’ ” Trethewey “still can’t access the materials she requested more than two years ago,” but “she has no intention of backing down.”\n\nFrom the right: Federal Unions’ Poison Privilege\n\n“Public sector unions have long been an affront to democratic accountability at all levels of government,” so “President Donald Trump’s executive order issued Thursday ending collective bargaining privileges for most federal agencies brings welcome focus to the issue,” cheers the Washington Examiner’s editorial board. “When government workers are given collective bargaining power, an equal and opposite amount of power has been taken away from voters.” Notably, “Trump wants to scrap” 11th-hour Biden deals with unions to let federal workers “continue to work remotely.” Trump’s new order will be fought in multiple court cases, and he “will not win them all.” Fact is, “Congress should work with the White House to remove the collective bargaining powers of all federal government employees.”\n\nForeign desk: Team Trump’s Unsung Latin Wins\n\nThe Trump administration “is focused heavily on Latin America,” with game-changing results, reports Arturo McFields at The Hill. “Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama,” which resulted in the country deciding “to end the Belt and Road Initiative with China.” “During Rubio’s visit to El Salvador, the Central American country offered to receive and reimprison criminals.” Meanwhile, “Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has also carried out a strategic visit to El Salvador, Colombia and Mexico,” building partnerships “to address migration, combat drug trafficking and reduce transnational crime.” Team Trump’s “extraordinary achievements are not making headlines, but they are making a significant difference in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nConservative: Bomb, Bomb, Bomb Iran?\n\nAfter President Trump said Sunday of Iran, “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before,” National Review’s Jim Geraghty observes: “As of Friday afternoon, there are at least five U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers at Diego Garcia,” the obvious base for hitting Iran. “That’s a quarter of the B-2s in the fleet,” and B-2s are “what the U.S. Air Force uses when it needs to drop very powerful bombs in a very stealthy manner.” Indeed, “the B-2 is the only plane that can carry” the Massive Ordinance Penetrator Bunker-Buster, “a 30,000 pound bomb that is described as ‘the most powerful and deeply burrowing non-nuclear bunker buster on earth.’ ”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“I resigned” from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, explains Jerry A.

Cable factory. Close up.\n\nLongtime Investor Alert readers have often seen me say that government policy is a precursor to change. What this means is that when policymakers act—whether through subsidies, sanctions, tariffs or regulations—markets can sometimes respond swiftly and dramatically. We’re seeing that play out right now in real time, especially in the copper market.\n\nThe headlines have been dominated by soaring gold prices, and rightly so. On Friday, the metal touched a new all-time high of $3,083 per ounce, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, massive central bank buying and President Donald Trump’s tariff agenda.\n\nBut while gold captures the spotlight, copper is quietly stealing the show.\n\nCopper and gold prices at all-time highs\nU.S. Global Investors\n\nOn Wednesday of last week, copper prices in New York hit a record high following reports that the Trump administration may impose 25% tariffs on copper imports in the coming weeks—months ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nTraders scrambled to front-run the announcement, stockpiling the metal before what Trump is calling “Liberation Day,” the April 2 deadline when many of the new tariffs are expected to take effect.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nNSA Warning—Change Your iPhone And Android Message Settings\n\nA Disappointing Update About ‘Solo Leveling’ Season 3\n\n‘The White Lotus’ Season 3, Episode 7 Recap And Review: I’m Starting To Worry About This Show\n\nThis rally is being driven by more than just demand increases for wiring or plumbing—though that’s a huge contributor. I believe it’s a full-blown policy-driven price spike, with implications that stretch across the global economy.\n\nWhy Copper? Why Now?\n\nCopper isn’t just another base metal—it’s a vital building block of the modern world. The red metal is found in everything: construction, consumer electronics, renewable energy systems, and, perhaps most crucially, the electrical wiring and grid upgrades needed to power our 21st-century lives.\n\nIt’s also one of the very few critical minerals that’s found in all clean energy technologies. Whether it’s electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind turbines or battery storage systems, copper is indispensable. That’s why some major trading houses now forecast that copper could exceed $12,000 per metric ton this year. It’s already flirting with $11,000 in London trading.\n\nSupply Shocks\n\nDemand is rising, but what about supply? According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), even under the most optimistic mining forecasts, we’re facing a significant copper supply shortfall by the end of this decade.\n\nThe IEA sees a potential gap of 4.5 million metric tons by 2030 in its most aggressive clean energy scenario. Even the base case shows we’ll need 80% more copper by 2040 just to meet the world’s current policy commitments.\n\nMajor copper supply deficit expected after 2025\nU.S. Global Investors\n\nNew mining projects take years—sometimes decades—to get off the ground. Between permitting delays, environmental reviews and rising capital costs, supply will have a hard time catching up to demand fast enough.\n\nNow, layer in Trump’s America First policy shift. A 25% tariff on copper imports could create short-term scarcity in the U.S., widening the price gap between New York and London. That spread ballooned to over $1,900 per ton, by the way.\n\nThe result? A copper-buying frenzy. Mercuria, one of the world’s top commodity traders, estimates that about 500,000 tons of copper are now on their way to the U.S.—nearly eight times the normal monthly import level. That surge could tighten global supply, especially in China, the world’s largest copper consumer, and send prices into uncharted territory.\n\nTariffs, EVs and Inflation Risk\n\nSome argue that tariffs are inflationary—and they’re right, to a degree. Copper is embedded in thousands of products, from air conditioners to automobiles.\n\nFor EVs, the impact is particularly pronounced. According to Bloomberg analysts Steve Man and Peter Lau, a 25% copper tariff could add $275 in raw material costs per electric vehicle, compared to about $68 for gasoline-powered cars. Why the difference? EVs use about four times more copper.\n\nThese cost pressures come as global EV sales hit a record 17 million units last year, with December marking the fourth straight month of record volume. U.S. EV sales also hit an all-time high in Q4 2024, with market share jumping to 12.3% in December alone, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade and lobby group.\n\nEV market share in the U.S. crossed above 12% in the fourth quarter\nU.S. Global Investors\n\nThat’s despite then-President-Elect Trump promising to pull back federal support for EV adoption. The demand is being driven by state-level incentives and falling battery costs, not mandates from Washington.\n\nStill, the tariffs could create sticker shock for some American consumers and contribute to broader inflation concerns. We’ve already seen U.S. consumer confidence fall to its lowest level in over four years, according to the Conference Board. If prices rise and growth slows, stagflation could return to the conversation.\n\nConsumer confidence at a four-year low\nU.S. Global Investors\n\nCopper Stocks Catch a Bid\n\nIt should come as no surprise that copper producers are catching a strong bid. The Solactive Global Copper Miners Index was up more than 12% year-to-date as of last Tuesday before pulling back. It’s now up around 6%, with the list of best performers occupied by mostly Chinese and Japanese producers, including Nittetsu Mining (up 51.6% year-to-date), Zijin Mining (+27.6%) and JinChuan Group (+23.1%).\n\nLessons for Investors\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of policy to move markets. Just as gold reacts to geopolitical uncertainty and central bank buying, copper prices are now responding to trade policy.\n\nEven if copper prices retreat in the second half of 2025—as Citi analysts predict, citing potential economic headwinds—the long-term picture remains bullish, I believe. The supply gap is real, and I expect the clean energy buildout to continue accelerating.\n\nOn a final note, diversify into producers. We’ve long believed that the best way to play commodities is through the companies that mine, refine and distribute them. Unlike physical commodities, mining stocks offer leverage to rising prices and cash flow.\n\nAs always, I recommend staying focused on quality and remembering that the best opportunities often arise when politics and economics collide. Right now, it appears that that collision is happening in the commodities space—and copper is leading the charge.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.
