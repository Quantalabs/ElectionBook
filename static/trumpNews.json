Critics denounced the idea as a form of ethnic cleansing and a violation of international law. Sina Toossi of the Center for International Policy warned that such a move \"would guarantee a broader regional conflict\" and shatter the U.S.'s traditional stance on a two-state solution.\nFollowing the backlash, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt clarified that the U.S. had no plans to finance Gaza's reconstruction or commit troops to the region. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Trump's proposal as a \"generous move,\" emphasizing that the displacement of Palestinians was intended to be temporary during the territory's reconstruction.\nUnclear Motives and Feasibility Concerns\nIt remains uncertain whether Trump's comments were a genuine policy proposal, a negotiation tactic, or a distraction. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and national security advisor Mike Waltz questioned the feasibility of rebuilding Gaza, calling it \"uninhabitable for years.\"\nDespite Trump's assertion that Palestinians \"would love\" to leave Gaza, experts have expressed skepticism, noting the strong historical and cultural ties Palestinians have to their land.\nImpact on the Two-State Solution\nTrump's remarks have been seen as undermining decades of U.S. foreign policy supporting a two-state solution. Brian Finucane, a U.S. foreign policy expert at the International Crisis Group, highlighted that the comments cast doubt on the administration's support for peaceful coexistence between Israel and a future Palestinian state.\nNetanyahu's Praise and Regional Implications\nNetanyahu, who opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, praised Trump's \"out-of-the-box\" thinking. However, experts warn that pursuing such a radical proposal would likely destabilize the region and complicate efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\nAs the second phase of ceasefire negotiations unfolds, it remains to be seen whether Trump will push for a diplomatic resolution or allow Israel to resume its military campaign.\nRead More : Trump And Kushner's Gaza Redevelopment Proposal Sparks Outrage And Doubts","summary":"In a surprising and provocative move, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed &#8220;taking over&#8221; the Gaza Strip and transforming it into &#8220;the Riviera of the Middle East.&#8221;","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trumps-gaza-takeover-proposal-signals-major-shift-in-us-policy/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/federal-freeze-trump-financial-aid-federal-grant-freeze-federal-funding-are-food-stamps-paused-pell-grant-trump-trump-snap-benefits-federal-student-aid-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.244},{"id":287525086,"title":"Trump-Appointed U.S. Attorney In Massachusetts Vows To Crack Down On Immigration Enforcement Obstruction","text":"Massachusetts' newly appointed federal prosecutor, Leah Foley, pledged on Wednesday to investigate state and local officials who obstruct federal immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump's administration's intensified efforts to enforce immigration laws.\n\"No one gets a pass,\" Foley declared during an event in Boston, signaling a hardline approach toward cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\nWhile expressing hopes for collaboration with Democratic Governor Maura Healey's administration and local district attorneys, Foley made it clear that she disagreed with Healey and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu on immigration enforcement strategies.\n\"Our focus will be to find and remove illegal immigrants who have committed crimes,\" Foley said, emphasizing the importance of public safety.\nTensions Over Sanctuary Policies\nGovernor Healey's spokesperson, Karissa Hand, reiterated the governor’s stance that \"violent criminals should be deported.\" Hand emphasized that state law enforcement routinely collaborates with federal authorities to maintain community safety.\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu did not respond to requests for comment, though she has defended Boston’s designation as a \"sanctuary city,\" which limits cooperation with federal immigration officials.\nFoley asserted, \"We're not asking them to do our jobs. But we expect that they don't interfere with federal agents doing theirs.\"\nJustice Department Orders and Legal History\nThe Justice Department recently instructed federal prosecutors to consider criminal investigations into state and local officials who hinder immigration enforcement.\nMassachusetts has a notable legal precedent on this issue. In 2017, the state's highest court ruled to limit how state courts and local law enforcement could assist federal immigration enforcement.\nICE has repeatedly criticized Massachusetts authorities for allegedly ignoring detention requests for non-citizens arrested on state charges.\nPast Case and Judicial Accountability\nFoley expressed concern about judicial interference in immigration matters.\n\"It is troubling that any judge would interfere with a federal law enforcement officer doing their job. That is not a judge’s role. We will investigate,\" she warned.\nHer office previously secured a 2019 indictment against Massachusetts judge Shelley Joseph, who was accused of impeding a federal immigration arrest during a courtroom hearing.\nUnder President Joe Biden's administration, prosecutors agreed in 2022 to drop the case in exchange for Judge Joseph referring herself to disciplinary authorities. A disciplinary case is still pending.\nAs the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown, Foley's appointment signals renewed federal scrutiny of local officials' cooperation with ICE and immigration enforcement.\nRead More : US Judge Halts Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order, Citing 'Irreparable Harm","summary":"Massachusetts&#8217; newly appointed federal prosecutor, Leah Foley, pledged on Wednesday to investigate state and local officials who obstruct federal immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration&#8217;s intensified efforts to enforce immigration laws.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-appointed-u-s-attorney-in-massachusetts-vows-to-crack-down-on-immigration-enforcement-obstruction/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/federal-freeze-trump-financial-aid-federal-grant-freeze-federal-funding-are-food-stamps-paused-pell-grant-trump-trump-snap-benefits-federal-student-aid.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":287525062,"title":"Argentina Follows U.S. Lead In WHO Withdrawal, Citing Pandemic Mismanagement","text":"Argentina has announced its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), citing concerns over the global body's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The move comes just weeks after the United States, under President Donald Trump, made a similar decision. Argentine President Javier Milei, who regards Trump as an \"ideological ally\" and \"hero,\" has echoed Washington’s criticisms of the WHO.\nReasons for the Withdrawal\nPandemic Management Concerns\nManuel Adorni, a spokesman for President Milei, stated that the decision was based on \"deep differences regarding health management, especially during the pandemic.\" He criticized the WHO for promoting what he described as the \"longest lockdown in the history of humanity\" and accused the organization of lacking independence from political influences.\nPreservation of Sovereignty\nAdorni emphasized that Argentina would no longer allow \"an international body to interfere in our sovereignty.\" The withdrawal, he claimed, would grant the country greater flexibility to implement health policies tailored to local contexts.\nEconomic Considerations\nArgentina’s government highlighted that the country’s contribution to the WHO amounted to $8.75 million over the past two years, with a planned contribution of $8.25 million for the 2024/25 cycle. Adorni noted that Argentina does not receive funding from the WHO, so the decision \"does not represent a loss of funds for the country.\"\nCriticism of WHO Policies\nLockdowns and Economic Impact\nIn a statement from the president's office, the WHO was accused of promoting \"endless quarantines without scientific basis.\" These lockdowns were blamed for causing \"one of the greatest economic catastrophes in world history.\"\nMilei's Ideological Alignment with Trump\nPresident Milei, a self-declared \"anarcho-capitalist,\" has been vocal about his admiration for Donald Trump. Following Trump’s lead, Milei took swift action to withdraw from the WHO. He was also the first foreign leader to visit Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate after Trump’s re-election victory.\nImpact on Argentina’s Health Policies\nFlexibility in Health Management\nThe withdrawal from the WHO is expected to give Argentina more control over its health policies. Adorni claimed that the move would allow for \"greater availability of resources\" and the ability to implement policies better suited to local needs.\nPublic Reaction and Economic Fallout\nMilei’s austerity measures, which include gutting public spending and maintaining a zero budget deficit, have already led to increased poverty levels. Critics warn that withdrawing from the WHO could further weaken Argentina’s healthcare system.\nInternational Repercussions\nPotential Diplomatic Isolation\nThe decision to follow the U.S. in withdrawing from the WHO may strain Argentina’s relations with other nations that continue to support the organization.\nArgentina’s withdrawal, like that of the U.S., could impact global health initiatives, especially those reliant on member contributions.\nArgentina’s decision to exit the WHO marks a significant shift in its approach to global health governance. While the government argues that the move will enhance sovereignty and local policy flexibility, critics warn of potential negative consequences for public health and international relations. As President Milei continues to align closely with Donald Trump’s policies, Argentina’s role on the global stage remains uncertain.\nRead More : Israel Announces Boycott Of UN Human Rights Council, Citing Anti-Semitism","summary":"Argentina has announced its decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), citing concerns over the global body&#8217;s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/argentina-follows-u-s-lead-in-who-withdrawal-citing-pandemic-mismanagement/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WHO.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.092},{"id":287525046,"title":"Trump And Kushner&#8217;s Gaza Redevelopment Proposal Sparks Outrage And Doubts","text":"President Donald Trump has revived a controversial proposal to redevelop Gaza into an international beach resort under U.S. control. The idea, originally floated by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, envisions Gaza being transformed into a luxury destination, described by Trump as potentially \"better than Monaco.\"\nThe proposal, revealed during a recent press conference, has drawn criticism from Palestinians and international observers, who argue that it amounts to a plan of ethnic cleansing and violates international law.\nSaudi Arabia and Gulf Nations Express Doubts\nA source close to the Saudi royal court dismissed the idea, stating that \"it has not been thought through and is impossible to implement.\" The Saudi foreign ministry firmly rejected any attempts to displace Palestinians from their land.\nDespite Gulf nations' potential financial capacity, they have refused investment in Gaza without a clear pathway to a Palestinian state.\nHistorical and Practical Challenges\nThe proposal has been met with skepticism given Gaza's long-standing complex land regulations derived from Ottoman, British, Jordanian, and clan-based systems. Foreign land ownership restrictions further complicate the plan.\nSteve Witkoff, Trump's special Middle East envoy and a former real-estate developer, acknowledged that Gaza remains a \"demolition site\" after prolonged bombardment, estimating that reconstruction could take up to 15 years at a cost of $100 billion.\nPalestinian and International Reaction\nPalestinian officials and Hamas condemned the remarks, recalling the trauma of the 1948 Nakba, when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced.\nTrump's comments have ignited renewed interest among Israeli settlers, who have long aspired to return to abandoned settlements in Gaza. Although Trump denied plans for rebuilding settlements, settler groups have expressed enthusiasm, urging immediate preparations for re-establishing Jewish communities in the area.\nGiven the current instability and geopolitical complexities, analysts remain doubtful about the feasibility of such a project.\nRead More : Trump-Appointed U.S. Attorney In Massachusetts Vows To Crack Down On Immigration Enforcement Obstruction","summary":"President Donald Trump has revived a controversial proposal to redevelop Gaza into an international beach resort under U.S. control.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-and-kushners-gaza-redevelopment-proposal-sparks-outrage-and-doubts/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trumpppp-2.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":287525036,"title":"US Judge Halts Trump&#8217;s Birthright Citizenship Order, Citing &#8216;Irreparable Harm&#8217;","text":"In a significant legal development, a federal judge on Wednesday blocked former President Donald Trump's executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States. The indefinite injunction prevents the nationwide enforcement of the controversial order, which was scheduled to come into effect on February 19.\nJudge Cites Constitutional Violation\nDuring the hearing in a Maryland court, District Judge Deborah Boardman stated that denying birthright citizenship would cause \"irreparable harm.\" Citing Supreme Court precedent, she emphasized that Trump's order conflicted with the \"plain language of the 14th Amendment.\"\n\"No court in the country has ever endorsed the president's interpretation,\" Judge Boardman asserted. \"This court will not be the first.\" This ruling builds upon a previous 14-day stay issued by US District Judge John Coughenour in Washington state. Judge Coughenour condemned Trump's order as \"blatantly unconstitutional,\" prompting Trump to announce his intention to appeal the decision.\nBirthright Citizenship: A Constitutional Right\nBirthright citizenship is guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, which states that anyone born on US soil is a citizen. Ratified in 1868 after the Civil War, the amendment aimed to establish equal rights for all individuals born in the United States, including former slaves. Opponents of Trump's order have pointed to the landmark 1898 Supreme Court case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark. The court ruled in favor of a Chinese-American man who had been denied reentry to the US, affirming that children born in the country, including those born to immigrant parents, are entitled to citizenship.\nTrump's Controversial Stance\nTrump's executive order argued that individuals in the United States illegally or on temporary visas were not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the country and therefore excluded from birthright citizenship. Legal scholars and civil rights advocates have widely criticized this interpretation as a misreading of constitutional law.\nDespite the legal setbacks, Trump has vowed to continue fighting for his order. Legal experts, however, note that the judicial consensus strongly favors upholding the 14th Amendment's protections. The case is likely to head to higher courts as the debate over immigration and citizenship continues to shape American political discourse.\nRead More : Argentina Follows U.S. Lead In WHO Withdrawal, Citing Pandemic Mismanagement","summary":"In a significant legal development, a federal judge on Wednesday blocked former President Donald Trump&#8217;s executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/us-judge-halts-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-citing-irreparable-harm/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Trump.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.042},{"id":287525030,"title":"Israel Announces Boycott Of UN Human Rights Council, Citing Anti-Semitism","text":"Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar announced on Wednesday that the country would boycott the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), accusing the body of perpetuating anti-Semitism and unfairly targeting Israel.\nAllegations Against the UNHRC\nSaar criticized the council for its disproportionate focus on Israel, stating that it is the only country with a dedicated agenda item and has been the subject of more resolutions than nations such as Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela combined.\n\"This body has focused on attacking a democratic country and propagating anti-Semitism, instead of promoting human rights,\" Saar wrote on X.\nUNHRC Response\nUNHRC spokesperson Pascal Sim clarified that Israel holds observer state status within the council and is not among the 47 member states. As such, Sim noted, Israel cannot formally \"withdraw\" from the council.\nDespite its criticism, Israel has historically participated in the UNHRC's periodic reviews, which all UN member states are required to submit. However, it has consistently boycotted debates concerning \"the human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories.\"\nContext of the Boycott\nThe announcement aligns with the United States' withdrawal from several UN bodies, including the UNHRC, as per an executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Tuesday. The U.S. also severed ties with the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), accusing it of providing cover for Hamas militants.\nIsrael's decision to boycott the UNHRC underscores ongoing tensions between the country and international bodies over human rights allegations and geopolitical conflicts.

The announcement has drawn widespread condemnation, with critics accusing Trump of advocating for ethnic cleansing and undermining peace efforts in the region.\nUnveiling the Proposal\nSpeaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a press conference at the White House, Trump stated that Gaza has been a \"symbol of death and destruction\" for decades. He claimed that relocating Palestinians would offer them a chance for a \"peaceful and harmonious life\" in newly developed housing in Egypt and Jordan.\n“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and do a good job with it too. We will own it, dismantle dangerous weapons, level the site, and create an economic development hub supplying jobs and housing,” Trump said.\nThe proposal was met with fierce criticism from Arab nations and human rights groups. Comparisons were immediately drawn to the Nakba of 1948, when mass displacement of Palestinians occurred.\nSaudi Arabia issued a strong statement, emphasizing its unwavering support for a Palestinian state and rejecting any infringement on Palestinian rights.\nEgypt and Jordan also rejected the idea, making it clear that they would not accept any influx of displaced Palestinians.\nDiplomatic Repercussions\nTrump's proposal marks a stark reversal of traditional American support for a two-state solution. It raises questions about the future of US diplomacy in the region and its credibility as a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nSaudi Arabia warned that the plan jeopardizes any potential normalization of ties with Israel, reiterating that a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for such negotiations.\nThe feasibility of the plan is unclear. The US has no legal authority to claim control over Gaza, and the proposal lacks congressional approval or support from NATO allies.\nLegislators from both major parties, including staunch Trump allies, have already rejected the idea, citing its impracticality and potential for humanitarian catastrophe.\nReports suggest that the idea originated with Jared Kushner, Trump's former advisor and key architect of the Abraham Accords. Kushner previously highlighted Gaza's economic potential, pointing to its waterfront location and natural gas reserves.\nUndermining Peace Efforts\nTrump's rhetoric, dismissing concerns about the two-state solution, further complicates peace negotiations. \"It doesn’t mean anything about a two-state or one-state solution. We want to give people a chance at life,\" Trump asserted.\nHe hinted at further developments regarding Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, promising an announcement in the coming weeks.\nTrump’s controversial proposal not only challenges decades of international consensus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also threatens to destabilize an already volatile region. With strong opposition from Arab nations, US lawmakers, and global observers, the plan faces insurmountable obstacles and risks deepening tensions in the Middle East.\nRead More : Israel Announces Boycott Of UN Human Rights Council, Citing Anti-Semitism","summary":"US President Donald Trump has proposed an unprecedented plan to take over the Gaza Strip, transforming it into the &#8220;Riviera of the Middle East,&#8221; while urging Palestinians to permanently relocate to Egypt and Jordan.","url":"https://www.newsx.com/world/trump-proposes-gaza-takeover-to-transform-it-into-middle-east-riviera/","image":"https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/swf.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:55:59","author":"Anirudh","authors":["Anirudh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":287525008,"title":"West Point Disbands Clubs Focused On Gender, Race, And Ethnicity Following Trump&#8217;s DEI Directive","text":"The U.S. Military Academy at West Point recently disbanded a dozen cadet clubs centered on ethnicity, gender, race, and sexuality. This move follows directives from the Trump administration aimed at dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs across federal agencies.\nAmong the disbanded clubs are:\n Asian-Pacific Forum Club\n Latin Cultural Club\n National Society of Black Engineers Club\n Society of Women Engineers Club\n Corbin Forum (a leadership club for female cadets)\n Spectrum (a gay-straight alliance)\nThese groups, previously sponsored by West Point’s diversity office, have been ordered to cease activities immediately.\nTrump's Executive Order on DEI Programs\nPresident Donald Trump's recent executive order mandated the suspension and eventual termination of federal diversity programs. This decision aligns with a broader effort to halt initiatives aimed at fostering diversity and inclusion within federal institutions.\nWest Point released a statement clarifying that over 100 clubs remain active at the academy. The leadership emphasized its commitment to providing cadets with opportunities for academic, military, and physical growth while adhering to updated Army policies.\nReview of Cultural Awareness Events\nThe Defense Department has issued guidance against using resources to host cultural awareness events such as Black History Month. The directive states that fostering unity among service members must take precedence over activities that \"divide the force.\"\nFormer West Point cadet Geoffrey Easterling expressed disappointment over the decision, emphasizing the value of these clubs. \"It was just community. There wasn’t any teaching of all these things people are worried about,\" he said.\nThese groups, according to Easterling, provided academic support, mentorship, and opportunities for cadets to connect with diverse peers.\nThe Role of DEI Programs in the Military\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have historically aimed to support marginalized communities. Critics, however, argue that these programs unfairly discriminate against other groups, including white service members.\nThe decision to disband these clubs raises concerns about the future of inclusivity within military institutions. While service academies have made strides toward diversity, female cadets and cadets of color have often faced hostility and unique challenges.\nWest Point's decision marks a significant shift in policy and underscores the impact of the Trump administration’s stance on DEI initiatives.

It would be a significant departure from current plans for the House to pass a bill first, amid infighting by House Republicans over spending levels. \"I appreciate Chairman Graham’s leadership in crafting a budget resolution that will unlock the ability to pass a reconciliation bill to secure the border, rebuild our military, and deliver a much-needed down payment on energy security,\" Thune told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement. \"I am supportive of Chairman Graham’s efforts to advance the president’s priorities in the Senate, and I look forward to continuing our conversations with our House colleagues,\" he said. SENATORS LEAPFROG HOUSE REPUBLICANS ON ANTICIPATED TRUMP BUDGET BILL Earlier on Wednesday, ahead of a lunch with key Republicans, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., unveiled his plan to advance the bill through a key procedural hurdle next week. The House planned to move a bill this week, but leaders were forced to punt after conservatives balked at what they saw as a low threshold for spending cuts to offset the cost of new funding to implement Republican border and defense policies. Now, with Thune's blessing, Graham's plan is primed to quickly maneuver through the Senate, getting a significant advantage over any competing House GOP efforts. Republicans in Washington, D.C., are preparing to use the budget reconciliation process to achieve a wide range of Trump proposals from border security to eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. The reconciliaiton process lowers the threshold to advance a bill in the Senate from 60 votes to just 51. And with a 53-vote majority in the upper chamber, Republicans are poised to push policies through with only support from the GOP conference. FORMER GOP LEADER MCCONNELL FALLS WHILE EXITING SENATE CHAMBER AFTER TURNER CONFIRMATION VOTE At the same time, with razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, the party can afford very few defectors. The first step in the crucial budget reconciliation process is marking up and advancing a bill through the Senate and House budget committees. The budget that is headed to the Senate's committee would be part of a two-pronged approach, with the first bill including Trump's priorities for border security, fossil fuel energy and national defense. This plan would see a second bill focusing on extending Trump's tax policies from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) later in the year. In a statement, Graham confirmed his plan to move forward on the two-bill plan. His office advised that next week there would indeed be a committee vote on a Fiscal Year 2025 budget resolution, which \"will be the blueprint that unlocks the pathway forward for a fully paid for reconciliation bill to secure the border, bolster our military and increase American energy independence.\" SENATE TEES UP TRUMP BUDGET CHIEF PICK RUSSELL VOUGHT FOR FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE \"To those who believe that Republicans should fulfill their promises on border security, mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens: I agree,\" Graham said. \"That is why the Senate Budget Committee will be moving forward next week to give the Trump Administration’s Border Czar, Tom Homan, the money he needs to finish the wall, hire ICE agents to deport criminal illegal immigrants, and create more detention beds so that we do not release more dangerous people into the country. This will be the most transformational border security bill in the history of our country. It’s time to act,\" he continued. While many Senate Republicans have espoused a preference for two bills to be passed this year through the key budget reconciliation process, they have faced significant opposition in the House, where the House Ways & Means Committee and House GOP leaders have pushed for one large bill with all of Trump's priorities. FORMER NFL PLAYER SCOTT TURNER CONFIRMED TO LEAD HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP House leaders had intended to make the first move in the process.

Ro Khanna on Wednesday accused Elon Musk of violating the U.S. Constitution as he carries out his mandate from Republican President Donald Trump to overhaul the federal government. Musk, the world’s richest man, responded with a crude insult.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight — which has 25 Republicans and 20 Democrats — voted on issuing a subpoena to Musk, with the motion failing 19 to 20. Khanna, responding to a post on X saying he had abstained, posted that the vote was taken without notice, and he and eight others did not make it to the committee room in Washington, D.C. in time to vote.\n\n“I would have voted yes,” Khanna said in the post, adding that he had been meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico over Trump’s tariffs. “Musk’s attacks on our institutions are unconstitutional. He should be subpoenaed & answer to our committee.”\n\nJust 16 minutes after Khanna’s post, on the platform Musk owns, Musk responded with a post saying, “Don’t be a (expletive).”\n\nKhanna on Wednesday elaborated to this news organization that he believes Musk’s work in the government has led to pauses on federal grants, plus reported firing of federal employees and “potential mass firings” in the future, that violate the Constitution by infringing on the powers it gives to Congress.\n\nMusk — CEO of Tesla and federal government contractor SpaceX — and his unofficial “Department of Government Efficiency” have provoked anger among Democratic lawmakers by gaining access to systems and databases in federal government agencies. So far, reports indicate his team, which includes a handful of young technology workers connected to Silicon Valley, has penetrated the U.S. Treasury Department, General Services Administration, Agency for International Development, and the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nFederal Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday posted on X that he had “talked to the DOGE team,” and “They are going to plug in to help upgrade our aviation system.”\n\nChris Van Hollen, a Democratic U.S. Senator from Maryland, posted Tuesday on X that he was “hearing reports” that “Musk’s cronies” were targeting the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — which forecasts weather and conducts weather and climate research — and “infiltrating key systems & locking out career employees.”\n\nLabor unions on Wednesday sued the U.S. Department of Labor and DOGE, seeking to block the Musk group’s expected attempt to access that agency.\n\nSince being named by Trump as chief of DOGE — an advisory entity Trump created by executive order — Musk has embarked on a crusade to slash federal spending, claiming this week, without providing evidence, that a quarter of U.S. government disbursements are wasteful or fraudulent.\n\nRecent posts on X by the DOGE account tout its work to cancel dozens of consulting contracts in the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Education and General Services Administration, and dozens of leases of “underutilized” buildings. One DOGE post claims more than $1 billion in savings via cancellation of contracts purportedly related to diversity, equity and inclusion at many other agencies, including the State Department, Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture and Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nMoves by the Trump administration to pause federal grants — blocked for now by federal court decisions in lawsuits — appear to be the clearest violation of the U.S. Constitution, critics say.\n\nMusk countered in an X post Wednesday quoting a thread from conservative lawyer Tom Renz that he’s operating within the law in a renamed department set up by former President Barack Obama.\n\n“We just renamed US Digital Services, created by Obama, to US DOGE Services, with a mandate to modernize all computer systems in the US government,” Musk posted. “This is something that is sorely needed!”\n\nIn an apparently DOGE-led attempt to get federal employees to resign in large numbers, civil servants received an emailed severance offer, titled “Fork in the Road” like a similar email Musk sent to employees of Twitter before he bought it and renamed it X.\n\nCongressman Jimmy Panetta, a Democrat whose district includes south San Jose, this week called the resignation-seeking emails “a dubious means to cause a mass exodus in the federal government.”\n\nLawsuits over Musk’s group continue to mount. On Monday, labor groups including the AFL-CIO sued the Treasury Department, seeking to stop “unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information contained in Defendants’ records to Elon Musk and other members of the so-called ‘Department of Government Efficiency.'”\n\nKhanna this week attacked DOGE’s incursion into the Treasury Department over access to “Social Security numbers of every American and sensitive payment information.”\n\nSan Jose Democrat Rep. Zoe Lofgren said this week she believes DOGE access into government agencies and databases breaks privacy and data-access laws. Because Republicans control the White House, the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, members of Congress seeking to rein in Musk and DOGE have few options, other than working with state attorneys general and civil-society groups that are taking legal action in the courts.\n\nMusk’s conduct, Lofgren said, “needs to be brought to a halt.”","summary":"Lawsuits appear to be the only weapon for opponents of Musk's activities in government.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/05/silicon-valley-khanna-accuses-musk-of-violating-constitution-insulted/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sjm-l-khanna-03xx-02.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:49:10","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.543},{"id":287523494,"title":"How “America” became God and Satan in Nigeria","text":"In a recent interview, ex-Osun Governor, Chief Bisi Akande, alleged that the #EndSARS movement that roiled Nigeria in 2020 was a conspiracy against his friend, Bola Tinubu. By narrating how a set of circumstances that did not begin with Tinubu became wrapped around him and his ambitions, Akande tried to increase the moral value of his electoral victory. The interesting part for me was that he claimed that those who ambushed Tinubu through EndSARS were “the Obi-dients”, a well-organised army who “came from America (the USA) with a lot of money”. I am willing to bet that Akande has no evidence whatsoever to substantiate his allegations and would demur if asked to name those Obi-dients. But stories like that do not need to be true; they only need to be believed.\n\nBut why “America”? Why did the conspiring Obi-dients that Akande conjectured come from the USA and not anywhere else? There is a significant Nigerian diaspora in the UK and Canada, could they also not have funded such a campaign? Given the outsized role regularly ascribed to the USA in our political and economic predicaments, no other country would have sufficed. The imagination that produced that allegation must be substantive to some degree to sound somewhat credible.\n\nAsk a Nigerian or an African why our countries are so poor, and it will not be long before they gravitate towards detecting Western-based institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank as why we fail at self-management. Those USA-based organisations are the physical manifestations of the transcendent forces we blame for our woes. Since there are several documented instances of their unpalatable institutional interference in economically challenged countries like Nigeria, there is a mix of truth that justifies how they have come to embody the trope of the evil that keeps Africa from attaining its destiny. That is why one of our Daddys in the Lord could pray that “Either the IMF likes it or not, I decree the naira will rise again.”\n\nThe USA is also routinely fingered in the restlessness that bedevils our society. Some people are convinced that terrorism in Nigeria is funded by the USA. I have met a few of those folks before; their attributed reasons for the USA’s supposed malevolence can be internally contradictory, but the conspiracy imagination needs not to be coherent before it rings true to those who believe them. Then there are Nigerians who also believe that the only reason that Muhammadu Buhari won the election in 2015 was because the USA sponsored him. Some of those folks, if they are reading this article, are ready to defend that assertion by pointing to one or two examples they hold as indelible proof. They need not worry. I have read all those arguments; I know where those folks are coming from.\n\nThe trouble with such speculation is that we become so invested in tracing the outlines of an alternative reality where “the spiritual determines the physical” that we lose sight of ourselves as human agents who determine our destiny. To the folks who believe that the USA masterminded the 2015 election loss by the PDP, it matters less that it was Nigerians who used their hand to vote for Muhammadu Buhari. They override the agency of fellow Nigerians, some of whom sought genuine reforms and many of whom were also motivated by religious/tribal identities, to blame a supernational force. One would think it was America that created “Febuhari” or “March for Buhari” and helped Yemi Osinbajo distribute the N10,000 pittance they used to bid for votes.\n\nThe 2015 election loss was so humiliating for the religious and tribal blocs that Goodluck Jonathan represents, that the only way they can justify the turn of events is to attribute it to a higher power. Even Jonathan himself believes that he lost to the USA, not his countrypeople who got tired of his crass ineptitude. Our society is so invested in the supernatural that if we are not leaving our human responsibility to God, we are blaming the devil for our failings. The same attitude extends to our political and economic behaviours where we always look for otherworldly forces to blame for our self-induced problems. \n\nWhat gets lost in the narrative is the temporal context. Occupy Nigeria, the anti-subsidies removal protests of 2012 that activated disaffection against Jonathan, and which his supporters (like Akande too) insist was a funded campaign by clandestine agents, also happened in different parts of the world at that time. That of Nigeria occurred in the light of the legislative probe that revealed the huge scam that the subsidy had become. In the era of Arab Spring and the #OccupyUSA movement, was it unthinkable that the young Nigerians embedded within a global media ecosystem would react to oppressive corruption like their counterparts elsewhere? Yes, certain characters like Muhammadu Buhari profited from the anti-Jonathan sentiment that the protest generated, but the emotions that drove it were not baseless.\n\nThe funny thing is that I know people who supported Buhari and campaigned for him from door to door. Imagine how amused I was when I saw some of them—against the backdrop of Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s campaign against USAID, the cultural arm of the US government—on Twitter (now called X) also crowing about how the USA imposed Buhari on Nigeria in 2015! Buhari was such a huge failure that his once devoted supporters are erasing their own participation in making him president! To distance themselves from the monumental disgrace he became, they delete their complicity.\n\nIn the same way that the anti-Buhari people have outsourced their agency in that protest to the USA, Akande too weaponises the EndSARS to blame some shadowy agents for confronting Tinubu. In doing so, he similarly erases the agency of the Nigerians who were genuinely driven to the streets because they were frustrated with the failings of a judicial institution under Buhari’s watch. The EndSARS was about Nigerian youths who had been driven to the wall by the excesses of the police, and just like OccupyNigeria in 2012, they took energies from similar protests abroad. Akande’s historical revisionism had nothing to say about the genuine issues that precipitated those protests.\n\nNotice also that even though Tinubu contested against two opponents, only Peter Obi haunts Akande’s imagination. Yes, Obi profited from the anti-establishment sentiment of EndSARS the same way OccupyNigeria helped Buhari. So immense was his popularity among Nigeria’s Gen Z that he sent the conservative political class into a tailspin. If today, Tinubu struggles with a crisis of legitimacy even as the sitting President, it is also because he lost something irrecoverable to Obi in that election. The Obi who was said to lack “structure” and his supporters who were ridiculed as “people without PVCs” stunned everyone with what they achieved. That is why Akande thinks American money and strategy had to have been involved. If Obi had been declared the winner of that election, Akande’s narrative would have held up to justify how a combination of Yoruba and Northerners, the majority of whom also happen to be Muslims, could lose to a Christian southerner whose supporters were not even taken seriously.\n\nHere is the thing: the fact that Akande’s story is laughable today does not mean it will always be. The APC will not rule forever. Many of their top brass are older men who will eventually lose their vice-like grip over the existing political structure. Nature will do its thing, and they will eventually be defeated in a hostile takeover. Those who will replace them are the current anti-establishment figures who are tweeting while waiting in the wings. From the fringes where they are sensationalising the USA as the God/Satan whose invisible hands move our history to mobilise their army of the disaffected, they will become the dominant ones. The ones in power today will look back at moments like 2020 EndSARS, pick up the narrative of “money, strategy, and America” including the one Akande put out and they too will start running with it.","summary":"In a recent interview, ex-Osun Governor, Chief Bisi Akande, alleged that the #EndSARS movement that roiled Nigeria in 2020 was a conspiracy against his friend, Bola Tinubu.

But even despite that we remain ready for talks,” Peskov said, saying that the “reality on the ground” meant that Kyiv had to “be the first to demonstrate openness and interest in such talks.”\n\n‘Clear ultimatum’\n\nAfter the interview, Zelensky posted comments Wednesday on social media saying that talks with Putin in themselves would be a “compromise” for Ukraine and its allies.\n\n“Putin is a murderer and a terrorist. This is a fact,” he said, in comments live-translated into English. “And if our allies believe that diplomacy is the way forward, let’s be honest: isn’t even a single conversation with Putin a compromise? Talking to a murderer is a compromise for Ukraine and the entire civilized world.”\n\nZelensky also said Putin “will only understand the need to end this war if he is given a clear ultimatum” by the United States, and that the “power to shape that peace depends on President Trump.”\n\nPeskov on Wednesday said contact with the new US administration had “intensified” but gave no indication of when a possible meeting or call between Putin and Trump could take place.\n\nPeskov also slammed Zelensky for suggesting that Ukraine should be allowed to have a nuclear deterrent if it is unable to join NATO.\n\nZelensky had said Ukraine would need an alternative “package” of protection, including nuclear weapons, if it cannot join NATO or the process drags on.\n\n“Let’s put it this way: give us nuclear weapons back, give us strong missile systems, partners, help us fund a million-man army,” Zelensky said.\n\nPeskov said that “such statements are bordering on madness”, citing international rules on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n‘Very difficult’\n\nKyiv has struggled to hold back Russian forces and Zelensky has conceded that it is unlikely his army will be able to recapture territory seized by Russia.\n\nMoscow on Wednesday said its troops took two more Ukrainian villages in the country’s east and northeast.

Linda Sánchez calls for targeted trade policies, says tariffs hurt everyday Americans","text":"Rep. Linda Sánchez, a pro-labor Democrat from Whittier, said this week that while tariffs can be useful for targeting certain industries of concern, blanket tariffs end up hurting everyday Americans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s threats of tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China have divided Congress. While Trump paused tariffs on Mexico and Canada in exchange for border security promises, the 10% tariff on China is in place.\n\nAt a Politico event this week, Sánchez, a ranking member on the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, said there are “certain industries we’ve been concerned about for some time” where tariffs could be used to target them. When asked for specifics, Sánchez said some countries flood U.S. markets with artificially cheap goods produced under forced labor, subsidization policies or poor environmental standards.\n\n“Tariffs can help counteract these imbalances, allowing American companies and workers — who adhere to higher wage and labor standards — to compete,” she said.\n\nShe said Trump’s “broad tariffs” on all imports will only “spook the markets” and leave business owners and farmers wondering, “What’s next?”\n\n“Prices are going to go up for U.S. consumers, and the No. 1 pledge that Trump made … was that he was going to bring down the cost of everyday goods,” she said.\n\nSánchez is a card-carrying member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 441, a labor union in Orange County, according to her bio. The sixth of seven children born to immigrant parents from Mexico, her father worked as an industrial machinist and mechanic at a plastics and rubber plant.\n\nSánchez is also a former labor lawyer.\n\nComing from a union background, Sánchez said she supports trade agreements that don’t harm the domestic industry or create job losses for American workers.\n\n“I feel like I’m in a unique position to try to bridge the gap between the progressive wing of our caucus and the more free-trade centered part of our caucus in that I understand these trade issues and the impacts that they have on workers,” she said.\n\nOne area of potential bipartisan cooperation is on fixing “de minimis,” a rule that lets small packages valued under $800 enter the U.S. without being taxed or subject to customs duties.\n\nSánchez said there needs to be a “comprehensive solution” to de minimis in federal law.\n\nFor example, when it comes to fentanyl, which the Trump administration has pointed to as a key reason for imposing tariffs, drug traffickers have exploited the de minimis rule to bring fentanyl into the U.S. without screening, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe federal agency said the rapid growth of de minimis shipments — which make up 92% of U.S. imports — along with less thorough screening compared to larger shipments, has created an opportunity for traffickers to exploit the system.\n\nThis loophole, Sánchez said, “allows foreign bad actors to ship fentanyl and the tools necessary to produce it with less scrutiny directly to American homes.”\n\n“Most of the fentanyl that comes into this country doesn’t come through the Canadian border, nor does it come on the backs of immigrants who are coming through the Southern border,” said Sánchez. “They come through the ports of entry.”\n\nSánchez said Congress needs to address transshipment, where goods are routed through a third country or port to bypass tariffs or import restrictions, in order to resolve the issue.\n\nFor example, if goods made in China are sent to a country with lower tariffs, then those goods might be re-labeled and shipped into the U.S. as if they came from that third country to avoid the higher taxes.\n\nEven among Republicans, including Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, there is concern that tariffs will hit American consumers with high prices. McConnell, in a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview, warned that tariffs will drive up the costs of everything.\n\nSánchez also took aim at tariffs in Trump’s first term. “Tariffs are a tool; they are not a weapon,” she said during her State of the Nation address in Norwalk in 2018.\n\nShe argued that broad tariffs hurt both “friends” and “cheaters of trade.”\n\n“We can find balanced trade policies that promote fairness and protect the workers, but we can’t do that by just broadly slapping tariffs on products meant to punish the cheaters of trade, but we’re also punishing our friends who don’t cheat in trade,” she said.\n\nSánchez represents California’s 38th Congressional District, which includes portions of Los Angeles and Orange counties.","summary":"The Whittier Democrat said that broad tariffs hurt both \"friends\" and \"cheaters of trade.\"","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/05/rep-linda-sanchez-calls-for-targeted-trade-policies-says-tariffs-hurt-everyday-americans/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/OCR-L-INF-SANCHEZ-2.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:40:46","author":"Hanna Kang","authors":["Hanna Kang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":287523164,"title":"Keir Starmer could strike a US free trade deal within months if he chooses to prioritise it over the EU, former Conservative trade secretary says","text":"Keir Starmer could strike a lucrative free trade deal with Donald Trump within months if he chooses to prioritise it, a former trade secretary said yesterday.\n\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan said a 'a big, punchy, broad ranging trade deal', which could generate billions for the British economy, remained on the table in Washington if Labour decides to pick it up.\n\nMrs Trevelyan, who was negotiating a trade deal with the US when President Trump left office in January 2021, said the two sides had been 'about halfway' to finalising the agreement at the time.\n\nTalks then went into the deep freeze after Joe Biden made clear he had no interest in striking new trade agreements.\n\nMr Trump has signalled that he is interested in reviving the idea of a trade deal with the UK. \n\nBut Labour has so far taken little action, with Sir Keir choosing to prioritise a new deal with the EU.\n\nMrs Trevelyan told Sky News there is potential to negotiate a deal with Washington more quickly than Brussels, with ministers potentially able to reach an agreement within months if they build on the last government's work.\n\n'I think absolutely that's possible,' she said.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JASON CHESTER FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:18 GMT, 6 February 2025 |Updated:00:32 GMT, 6 February 2025 \n\nLiam Payne's bereaved girlfriend says she fell in love with the tragic star as a child after becoming a fan of his former band, One Direction. \nThe singer fell to his death from a third floor balcony following a drink and drug binge while staying at the upscale CasaSur hotel in Palermo on October 16, prompting a lengthy investigation into his movements and the actions of hotel employees during his final hours. \nPayne's American girlfriend Kate Cassidy had originally accompanied him to Argentina, ostensibly to watch his touring former bandmate Niall Horan perform at Buenos Aires venue Movistar Arena. \nBut the influencer had boarded a flight back to her Florida home little more than 24-hours before his death, aged just 31. \nReflecting on their relationship with The Sun, Cassidy, 25, admits she had a soft spot for the singer long before they met and embarked on a relationship that would see her accompany him on trips across the world. \nShe said:'Liam was my childhood crush. I have loved him since I was ten. I think we were meant to meet.\n\nLiam Payne 's bereaved girlfriend says she fell in love with the tragic star as a child after becoming a fan of his former band, One Direction\n\nThe singer shot to fame in 2010 on XFactor with former bandmates Niall Horan , Zayn Malik , Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson , despite initially auditioning separately.\n'Growing up, I had posters on walls. I think I had a One Direction one but I don’t know if I had his solo poster. But I did have him at some point on my wall.\n'He was genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. I didn’t care about the other stuff. Our relationship was full of love and laughter and light.'\nCassidy originally met the singer in 2022 - six years after One Direction broke up - during a night out at a bar in Charleston, South Carolina. \nAfter swapping numbers they went bowling on their first date, but the influencer insists she didn't think it would blossom into a relationship. \nShe recalled: 'I was definitely kind of starstruck but mainly I was thinking about the connection we had. \n'We lived on different sides of the world. It didn’t occur to me we might end up dating.'\nPayne's medical cause of death has now been announced to be 'polytrauma', a term which means a person has multiple traumatic injuries to their body.\nFive people have been charged over his death in Argentina after he fell from a third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Hotel.\n\nCassidy is pictured attending late boyfriend Payne's funeral in Amersham on November 20 \n\n'He was genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met in my life. I didn’t care about the other stuff. Our relationship was full of love and laughter and light'\n\n Liam Payne's heartbreaking final words on son Bear before shock death at age 31 \nThe hotel's manager, a receptionist and a friend of Payne have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office previously said in a statement.\nThey are reported to be hotel manager Gilda Martin, receptionist Esteban Grassi and Payne's friend Roger Nores. Two other people have been charged over the supply of drugs.\nBut due to the ongoing investigation, Cassidy could not divulge too much information and did not confirm whether or not she had spoken to Roger.\nShe insisted, however, that when she left Argentina, Payne was in 'such a good headspace' and the couple were more in love than ever.\nCassidy has dismissed cruel accusations that she abandoned the singer before his death, revealing that she had only returned to their Florida home to look after their rescue dog, Nala.\n\nPayne's American girlfriend Kate Cassidy had originally accompanied him to Argentina, ostensibly to watch his touring former bandmate Niall Horan perform in Buenos Aires\n\n Video shows Liam Payne singing and dancing at former bandmate Niall Horan's concert just days ago \nShe was home when she received the call telling her Payne had died.\nShe said it felt like a 'blackout moment', struggling to believe the news at first. She even tried calling his phone - and it still rang.\nThe content creator admitted she felt blessed that she did not receive the harrowing news via social media.\nInstead she had been in the comfort of their home with their beloved dog before one of Liam's friends called her.\nShe then contacted her boyfriend's family and her mother caught the first flight out to visit her grieving daughter as she attempted to process the devastating news.\nShe later realised that her last text to Payne had been completely ordinary: \"I can't wait for you to get home and see the house.\" She had spent time decorating for Halloween, excited to show him.\n\nThe influencer had boarded a flight back to her Florida home so she could take care of their rescue dog, little more than 24-hours before his death, aged just 31\n\nPayne's devastated fans embrace one another outside the CasaSur hotel in Buenos Aires following his tragic death last October \nThree days after his death, a worker she had hired to fix the decorations messaged, asking if Payne had liked the Halloween surprise.\nThat was the moment, she said, when it finally sank in that he was never coming home. \nPayne had spoken openly about his mental health struggles and past battles with addiction. He had tried both therapy and rehab.\nOn the night of his death, his hotel room was littered with drug paraphernalia and an opened champagne bottle.\nCassidy said his relapse seemed to come 'out of nowhere', and she had never imagined he was in such a fragile state.\nStill grieving, she has been seeing a grief therapist and struggles to listen to Liam's music. \n'Maybe one day,' she said, 'but not right now.'\n\nOne DirectionKate CassidyFloridaBuenos Aires\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLiam Payne's bereaved girlfriend Kate Cassidy says she was 'meant to meet' the tragic star after falling in love with him as a 10-year old One Direction fan - before embarking on a relationship 'filled with love and light'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

Wrong neighborhood,' a bystander then tells him.\n\nBy the time Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene, Martinez was lying in a prone position to surrender himself to the authorities, who quickly handcuffed him and escorted him into the back of a police vehicle.\n\nBut he could be heard protesting in Spanish, 'I haven't stolen anything, seriously,' Fox 11 reports. \n\nStolen property, however, was not what the residents were concerned about.\n\nThey instead told officers they saw Martinez - who was wearing black and hiding in the brush - start a fire at around 4.30pm on Woolsey Canyon Road, and followed him as he tried to flee the scene.\n\nMeanwhile, the fire Martinez allegedly ignited grew to around 100 square feet in size before it was extinguished by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, according to KTLA.\n\n'Thank God there were no strong winds, because it could have gone much worse,' videographer Gabe Cortez told the Los Angeles Times in the aftermath.\n\n'Given all the recent fires, communities and people are just so much more aware of these types of things now and they're on high alert.'\n\nBrandon Taylor, a photographer with Traffic News LA who recorded the incident, added that the 'residents were furious.'\n\n'They've gone through the Woolsey Fire, which started just a mile from there,' he explained. 'With the dry vegetation, they were really concerned about him starting another fire and losing their homes.'\n\nThe deadly infernos, which are now mostly contained, burned through more than 57,000 acres in Southern California, killing 29 people and destroying more than 16,000 homes and businesses last month.\n\nInvestigators are still working to determine what may have caused the fires, with some suggesting it may have been the work of arsonists.\n\n'We had numerous fires in the LA County region almost simultaneously, which leads us to believe that these fires were intentionally set by a person,' LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone told BBC, adding that about half of the brush fires he responds to were intentionally set. \n\nAt least eight people have already been arrested in connection with starting the recent fires, according to CNN.\n\nMartinez now joins the growing list as he was due to appear in court on Wednesday.\n\nHe was being held on a $75,000 bail, and the LA Times reports that there was a warrant out for his arrest at the time the brave civilians detained him - though it is unclear what the warrant was for.\n\nHis day in court came as California Gov. Gavin Newsom was scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump to discuss whether residents will receive any federal aid after State Farm General asked the state government to approve emergency price hikes to its insurance policies.\n\nThe company sent a four-page letter to the California Department of Insurance on Monday pleading with regulators to allow an average rate increase of 22 percent for homeowners. \n\nState Farm, a California-based subsidiary of the much larger State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, also wants to be able to slap condo owners and renters with a 15 percent increase. \n\nThose who rent out units to tenants should be hit with a 38 percent increase, according to the letter, which was signed by top-level executives at the company including CEO Dan Krause.\n\n'We are requesting that you take emergency action to help protect California’s fragile insurance market by immediately approving interim rate increases...with rates to be effective May 1, 2025,' the letter read.\n\nState Farm General justified this by saying it had received more than 8,700 claims related to the wildfires as of February 1 and has now paid over $1billion to customers as a result.","summary":"Furious Los Angeles residents who survived last month's deadly wildfires were caught on camera chasing down and apprehending alleged arsonist Alejandro Martinez, 41.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14365543/Los-Angeles-residents-chase-apprehend-arsonist-Alejandro-Martinez.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/06/00/94910581-0-image-a-13_1738800307143.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:32:27","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":287525664,"title":"Zoe Ball departed her Radio 2 breakfast show with her biggest audience in almost two years","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nBritish Olympic star begs Keir Starmer to follow Donald Trump and ban trans athletes from women's sport\n\nDeath toll in Congo uprising nears 3,000 including scores of female inmates who were raped and burned alive with their children when women's jail was stormed: Corpses pile up in streets as Rwanda-backed rebels go on rampage\n\nTHIS is washing up on UK beaches and could kill your dog: Urgent warning as at least four pets die with more sickened\n\nWe've all seen those 2am texts between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni - and we all know what they REALLY mean: AMANDA PLATELL\n\nGrenfell Tower to be demolished: Bereaved families are told by Angela Rayner that 24-storey block will be ripped down nearly eight years after 72 people were killed in fire\n\nTantrum... but no tiara!

'Australia will make our own decisions, and our position's the same as when I woke up yesterday morning. \n\n'We support a two-state solution in the Middle East, the right of Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security side-by-side. \n\n'That has been the long-standing bipartisan position, I know that the Coalition said the same thing yesterday, confirmed that remained their position.'\n\nSunrise co-presenter Matt Shirvington pressed the prime minister further, asking: 'If Donald Trump does go into a conflict in the Middle East, we're going to say no, we're not going to be a part of it?'\n\n'We make our own decisions as a sovereign nation and let's not get ahead of ourselves here,' said Mr Albanese. \n\nBarr then inquired if Mr Albanese had phoned Trump following the announcement.\n\n'When he makes an announcement like this, that quite frankly, has made the world reel, do you get on the phone to him? Because we are tied to America, aren't we? And this is out of the box.'\n\nMr Albanese responded: 'We have an important economic relationship, an important defence relationship, including through AUKUS. \n\n'We engage on matters that directly affect that relationship, and it's a constructive one. They're an important nation for us, and indeed, for the world.'\n\nMr Albanese was also quizzed about whether Trump's plans for Gaza would spark tensions here.\n\n'One of the things that people don't want in Australia, our multicultural, harmonious country that we have the great privilege of living in, is for conflict to be brought here,' Mr Albanese explained.\n\n'So people of course have a right to express their views, and they will do that. \n\n'People have different views about the Middle East, but that should be done peacefully and respectfully, and we shouldn't bring conflict here in a way that breaks up that unity that we have as a nation.'\n\nMeanwhile opposition leader Peter Dutton said Mr Trump, did not become a highly successful businessman and two-time president 'by being anything other than shrewd'.\n\n'A lot of people ... are coming to grips with it as well, as he's a big thinker and a deal maker,' the opposition leader told Sydney radio 2GB on Thursday.\n\n'You've seen it in his business life, and the art of the deal is incredibly important to him, that both sides of the deal are contributing, that nobody's ripping each other off.\n\n'There's a desire for peace here from every reasonable person and hopefully it can be achieved.'\n\nMr Dutton said the president was trying to disrupt the cycle of violence and reprisals between the two sides by giving the nations in the region to consider other possibilities.\n\n'It is about how do you leverage the best possible outcome to provide that peace and stability,' he said.\n\nJewish groups in Australia have already rejected Mr Trump's initial proposal to relocate the Palestinian residents.\n\n'The question of whether some Gazans choose to remain in the territory through this process, temporarily relocate or are permanently absorbed by neighbouring states is ultimately a decision for those affected, most of all, Gaza's civilian population,' Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Daniel Aghion said.\n\nThe Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council said it was hopeful the cycle of violence in the region could be broken but expressed 'strong concern over any hint that the US president is suggesting forcibly evacuating Gazans'.\n\nMr Trump on Wednesday repeated his previous call for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Gazans, saying Palestinians there had no alternative but to abandon the strip, adding he would support resettling Palestinians 'permanently'.","summary":"'We're tied to the US, so we could be involved couldn't we?'

During his first day in office late last month, Trump signed an executive order that said his administration would use \"clear and accurate language and policies that recognize women are biologically female, and men are biologically male.\"Trump later signed another executive order directing federal government health insurance such as Medicaid to exclude coverage for gender-affirming care, including surgery, puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for those under 19 years old.

It also shut down the Corbin Forum, a decades-old leadership club for female cadets, and Spectrum, a gay-straight alliance.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last month signed an executive order aimed at halting diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government and ordered the federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave and eventually be laid off.\n\nThe West Point memo also ordered all other cadet clubs to pause activities until officials can review the groups to ensure that they comply with Trump administration rules.\n\nThe U.S. Military Academy at West Point released a statement that said it is reviewing programs affiliated with its former office of diversity and inclusion and that the clubs that were shut down were sponsored by that office.\n\n“More than one hundred clubs remain at the U.S. Military Academy, and our leadership will continue to provide opportunities for cadets to pursue their academic, military, and physical fitness interests while following Army policy, directives, and guidance,” the statement reads.\n\nThe Department of Defense directed questions on the memo to the Army and West Point but sent a link to recent Defense Department guidance that said “Going forward, DoD Components and Military Departments will not use official resources, to include man-hours, to host celebrations or events related to cultural awareness months” such as Black History Month.\n\n“Efforts to divide the force — to put one group ahead of another — erode camaraderie and threaten mission execution,” the Defense guidance reads.\n\nWest Point graduate Geoffrey Easterling, who was a member of one of the now-disbanded clubs when he was at the academy, said the groups were open to all cadets and provided a way for students to interact with people from different cultures and build relationships with classmates.\n\n“It was just community. There wasn’t any teaching of all these things people are worried about,” he said. “You could find help with your homework from upperclassmen, get help to know the military.”\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion programs are intended to provide support for communities that have been historically marginalized. But such initiatives have been criticized by conservatives who argue they are discriminatory against white people.\n\nThe nation’s military service academies have slowly become more racially diverse and have admitted more women in recent decades, but female cadets and cadets of color have spoken out about having to overcome hostility.","summary":"The move is in response to President Trump's DEI policies","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2025/02/west-point-shuts-down-cadet-clubs-based-on-gender-race-and-ethnicity.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/5LCZAGL4CZHXHANSSA2OJT7SLM.jpg?auth=b2b802eab318ccda372fee2dbdfdd9c0b6784b1c7425bdd074fd85be37dafd52&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:19:01","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":287518872,"title":"Nancy Pelosi to Face 2026 Challenge from Former AOC Chief of Staff","text":"Saikat Chakrabarti, former chief of staff for Rep.

Some of her friends have advised her to go it alone and leave him,' the source shared.\n'His behavior is sometimes unacceptable. She's put up with a lot.'\nThe insider said Hailey and those close to her were hopeful that he would change after the arrival of their first child, son Jack Blues Bieber, in August 2024, but despite being there for her, little has changed.\n\nA source recently told DailyMail.com that Justin's weary look may be the result of him becoming 'borderline reclusive'; Bieber seen on January 30\n\nSources tell DailyMail.com that Hailey's friends are growing increasingly concerned about Justin's 'unacceptable behavior,' with some reportedly urging her to leave the musician\n'When the baby was born he was there for her and she thought being a father would change him for the better, but it hasn't stuck,' they added.\nLast week, Justin also attempted to debunk rumors of marital woes between him and his wife after setting the record straight about unfollowing her on Instagram.\nJust hours after insisting that his social media account was hacked, he returned to the app to share loved-up photos with Hailey from their trip to Aspen, Colorado.\nMystery surrounding the couple's marriage has intensified ever since he unfollowed his father-in-law Stephen Baldwin, furthering speculation of relationship woes and concern for the star after he also shared a picture of a bong.\nJustin BieberiPhoneGrammysHailey Baldwin\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Bieber covers up at spa amid concerns over his appearance and Hailey divorce rumors\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTantrum - no tiara!

The president initially backed Los Angeles during his first administration when the city bid for the 2024 Games that were awarded to Paris.\n\nOfficials with the LA28 organizing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLA28 organizing committee chairman Casey Wasserman reportedly met with Trump in Florida last month before Trump’s second term began, with Wasserman saying afterward both were looking forward to delivering a successful Games.\n\nThe IOC has largely stayed out of the discussion around transgender athletes, letting the international governing bodies for each sport set the parameters for gender participation.\n\nThe rules can run the gamut. Entities like World Aquatics have very strict guidelines, while World Triathlon rules are more liberal.\n\nThe IOC’s stance could change considerably in the near future following Bach’s retirement. Among the candidates to replace Bach is former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.\n\nTwo years ago, track and field under Coe banned transgender athletes from international competition — adopting the same rules as swimming — and adopted new regulations requiring some athletes to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.\n\nThe rhetoric around transgender athletes heated up at the Paris Olympics last summer, with Trump eagerly entering the fray.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump frequently mislabeled two Olympic female boxers as men and said their ability to participate in the Paris Games was “demeaning to women” even though both Imane Khelif of Algeria and Li Yu-ting of Taiwan were assigned female at birth and identify as women.\n\nTrump referenced both athletes again on Wednesday.\n\n“They had two women or two people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very convincingly,” Trump said. “But all of that ends today because with this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over.”\n\nThe question going forward is what kind of leverage the United States can use to influence the IOC. Given the volatile nature of the issue, Trump’s order could begin a groundswell among international federations for the IOC to come up with a uniform standard.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-trials","summary":"President Donald Trump is ready to take his fight against transgender athletes to the International Olympic Committee.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/sports/olympics-and-paralympics/trump-administration-plans-to-pressure-the-ioc-to-come-up-with-a-uniform-transgender-athlete/article_e828d0d5-f243-586d-a2fd-05f58785f710.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/34/2347333f-d34b-5761-b533-e9efd8f012fe/67a3ff060122b.image.jpg?crop=1617%2C849%2C0%2C115&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:12:27","author":"Will Graves The Associated Press","authors":["Will Graves The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"CA","sentiment":0.15},{"id":287520302,"title":"Trump signs executive order barring transgender athletes from girls’, women’s sports","text":"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday intended to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.\n\nThe order, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\n\n“With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over,” Trump said at a signing ceremony in the East Room that included lawmakers and female athletes who have come out in support of a ban, including former collegiate swimmer Riley Gaines.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order “upholds the promise of Title IX” and will require “immediate action, including enforcement actions, against schools and athletic associations” that deny women single-sex sports and single-sex locker rooms.\n\nThe timing of the order coincided with National Girls and Women in Sports Day, and is the latest in a string of executive actions from the Republican president aimed at transgender people.\n\nTrump found during the campaign that the topic resonated beyond the usual party lines. More than half the voters surveyed by AP VoteCast said support for transgender rights in government and society has gone too far. He leaned into the rhetoric before the election, pledging to get rid of “transgender insanity,” though his campaign offered little in the way of details.\n\nThe order offers some clarity. For example, it authorizes the Education Department to penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to compete, citing noncompliance with Title IX, which prohibits sexual discrimination in schools. Any school found in violation could potentially be ineligible for federal funding.\n\nEnforcing Trump’s orders will be a priority of the embattled department. In a call this week, the acting director of the Office for Civil Rights told staff they would need to align their investigations with Trump’s priorities, according to people who were on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to AP for fear of reprisals.\n\nAlready since Trump took office, the department has opened an inquiry into Denver public schools over an all-gender bathroom that replaced a girls’ bathroom, while leaving another one exclusive to boys.\n\nTrump also issued a warning to the International Olympic Committee ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president said he had empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make it clear to the IOC that “America categorically rejects transgender lunacy. We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.”\n\nThe IOC has essentially passed the buck on transgender participation, deferring to the international federations for each sport.\n\nThat could change, however, when a new IOC president comes on to replace the retiring Thomas Bach. Former track star Sebastian Coe, now the leader of World Athletics, is among the candidates up for election in March. Coe has been a strong proponent of limiting participation in female sports to cisgender women.\n\nTrump also said that Director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will “deny any and all visa applications made by men attempting to fraudulently enter the United States while identifying themselves as women athletes to try and get into the Games.”\n\nOrganizers for the 2028 Olympics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe order is the latest of a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting transgender people.\n\nPrevious ones have sought to have the federal government reject the idea that people can transition to a gender other than the one assigned at birth. That has implications for areas including passports and prisons. He’s also opened the door to barring transgender service members from the military; called to end federal health insurance and other funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19; and restrict the way lessons on gender can be taught in schools.\n\nThe latest order was condemned by trans-rights advocates, including the National Women’s Law Center and GLAAD.\n\n“Contrary to what the president wants you to believe, trans students do not pose threats to sports, schools or this country, and they deserve the same opportunities as their peers to learn, play and grow up in safe environments,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center.\n\nPushback on some of the administration’s initiatives has already begun in court. Transgender people have sued over several of the policies and more are likely to come. Civil rights lawyers handling the cases have asserted that in some instances, Trump’s orders violate laws adopted by Congress and protections in the Constitution – and that they overstep the authority of the president.\n\nThere could be similar questions for this order, for instance: Can the president demand that the NCAA change its policies?\n\nNCAA President Charlie Baker said its Board of Governors was reviewing the order and “will take necessary steps to align NCAA policy in the coming days, subject to further guidance from the administration.” Baker, who said last year he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender, noted the order at least provides a uniform policy instead of a patchwork of state laws.\n\nThe order came a day after three former teammates of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas filed a lawsuit accusing the NCAA, Ivy League, Harvard and their own school, Penn, of conspiring to allow Thomas to compete at conference and national championships.\n\nThe lawsuit, which makes similar allegations to those filed last year by Gaines and others, alleges the defendants violated Title IX by allowing Thomas to swim “and acted in bad faith.”","summary":"It's the latest in a string of executive actions aimed at transgender people.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/02/trump-signs-executive-order-barring-transgender-athletes-from-girls-womens-sports.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/CE4KAVJ24JCIPG4D6Z3GAJJDPQ.jpg?auth=60dc57da2ede9174896ee984b0909b6e4f27033af7c67244781bb978ea6ae927&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:09:17","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":287517790,"title":"Kanye West reveals he named new album Bully after learning son Saint, 9, kicked a child for being 'weak'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThursday, Feb 6th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy breaks silence on star's final days and reveals why she left Argentina before his death\n\nTrump declares war on women's sports is OVER as he unveils plan to ban trans athletes from Olympics\n\nDeath toll in Congo uprising nears 3,000 including scores of female inmates who were raped and burned alive with their children when women's jail was stormed: Corpses pile up in streets as Rwanda-backed rebels go on rampage\n\nTHIS is washing up on UK beaches and could kill your dog: Urgent warning as at least four pets die with more sickened\n\nWe've all seen those 2am texts between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni - and we all know what they REALLY mean: AMANDA PLATELL\n\nGrenfell Tower to be demolished: Bereaved families are told by Angela Rayner that 24-storey block will be ripped down nearly eight years after 72 people were killed in fire\n\nTantrum... but no tiara!

For the fourth quarter, it reported a net profit of $1.8 billion, up from a loss of $500 million in the year-ago quarter as pension-related costs weighed on results.\n\nThe company’s shares were down nearly 5% in after-hours trading.\n\nFord’s chief executive, Jim Farley, has been seeking to follow up a choppy 2024 with more consistent results, in a year that is already shaping up to be marred by swings in US policy.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is working to overcome persistent quality issues and lift its stock price which declined by 18% last year. It now faces uncertainty around President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada. If implemented, the measures would boost the automaker’s raw material costs and likely hurt sales demand.\n\nFarley told analysts on a conference call that Ford could weather a few weeks of tariffs, but that if 25% duties on Mexico and Canada were prolonged, “it would have a huge impact on our industry, with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out, and adverse effect on the US jobs.” \n\nFarley added he believes that Trump is aiming to strengthen the auto industry, not weaken it.\n\nThe company’s fourth-quarter revenue of $48.2 billion surpassed analyst expectations of $43 billion, according to LSEG data. Adjusted earnings per share of 39 cents also beat analyst forecasts of 33 cents per share.\n\nFarley made some significant cuts to the company’s EV plans last year, axing a much-anticipated three-row electric SUV and delaying the launch of its next generation electric F-150 Lightning truck. The company is leaning heavily on its California “skunkworks” team developing EVs from the ground up, and said the first affordably priced vehicle from that team will be a mid-sized electric pickup arriving in 2027.\n\nWhile Ford is not rolling out new EVs in the coming year, a contrast to General Motors which is introducing a blitz of new models and ramping up sales of its Blazer and Equinox EVs, Farley is leaning heavily on hybrids, which GM is not rolling out until 2027.\n\nFord’s EV losses include significant investment in future models, and it is also increasing volume while cutting costs by $1.4 billion, said Sherry House, Ford’s incoming chief financial officer.\n\nFord sold roughly double the number of hybrids compared with its EVs last year, with 187,426 hybrids sold and 97,865 EVs.\n\nThe automaker’s multi-powertrain approach “should help it mitigate any adverse impact on sales from the elimination of the federal EV tax credit, as opposed to a company such as GM who bet very aggressively on battery EVs,” said Garrett Nelson, analyst for CFRA Research.\n\n The Trump administration has eyed removing a $7,500 consumer tax credit available on certain EVs.\n\nThe company projected lower earnings before interest and taxes of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion for 2025. It met its annual guidance for 2024 after narrowing it late last year, recording annual EBIT of $10.2 billion.\n\nAmong the challenges facing Ford this year is a tougher pricing environment, House said, and the automaker is planning for about 2% lower industry pricing.\n\nTariff turmoil\n\nFord is the first major automaker to report earnings since Trump signed an executive order on Saturday stating that the US would impose 25% tariffs this week on goods from Mexico and Canada, which would affect Ford as well as cross-town rivals GM and Stellantis. However, Trump delayed the decision for a month after discussions with each country’s leader.\n\nThe automaker did not factor in tariffs to its annual outlook, executives said.\n\nFarley told analysts that any tariff policy implemented would have to be “comprehensive for our industry,” adding that Asian rivals are able to import vehicles into the US with “no incremental tariff.”\n\nTariffs on Mexico would affect Ford’s popular Maverick pickup truck, one of its most affordable vehicles, the Bronco Sport, as well as the Mustang Mach-E SUV, which are assembled in Mexican plants. Analysts have said of the Big Three Detroit automakers, Ford is the least exposed to tariffs. GM and Stellantis produce more profit-rich vehicles outside the United States.\n\nLast month, Executive Chair Bill Ford told reporters that Trump called him “out of the blue.”\n\n“He understands the importance of our industry and of Ford in the industry,” Bill Ford said, referring to Trump. The Ford chairman added that he was “very confident that Ford will have a voice, and a seat at the table.”","summary":"Ford Motor on Wednesday projected up to $5.5 billion in losses on its electric vehicle and software operations this year, a loss similar to last year and a sign of the severe difficulties in cutting costs on battery-powered models.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/05/business/ford-expects-to-rack-up-ev-losses-of-up-to-5-5b-in-2025-sending-shares-skidding/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/ford-earnings.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1738781561&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:06:38","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":287525440,"title":"As case involving Prince Harry's immigration paperwork inches forward, judge considers next steps","text":"A federal judge is considering next steps in a slow-moving court case over whether to release documents that could spell legal trouble for Prince Harry, with an influential conservative think tank seeking to reveal if he lied on his immigration paperwork about past drug use or received special treatment to enter the country. \n\nThe case before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols centers on the circumstances under which Harry — the Duke of Sussex and the son of King Charles III — entered the United States when he and his wife Meghan Markle moved to Southern California in 2020. The Heritage Foundation sued after the Department of Homeland Security largely rejected its Freedom of Information Act request to release Harry's records. Harry is not a party in the lawsuit. \n\n“We believe the American people have a right to know whether Prince Harry was truthful on his application,” said Nile Gardiner, head of the Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom. \n\nHeritage has argued there is “intense public interest” in whether Harry received special treatment during the application process, particularly after his 2023 memoir “Spare” revealed past drug use.\n\nHarry says in “Spare” that he took cocaine several times starting around age 17, in order “to feel. To be different.” He also acknowledged using cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms.\n\nThe U.S. routinely asks about drug use on its visa applications, and it has been linked to travel headaches for celebrities, including chef Nigella Lawson, singer Amy Winehouse and model Kate Moss. Acknowledgment of past drug use doesn’t necessarily bar people from entering or staying in the country, but answering untruthfully can have serious consequences. \n\n“If he lied, that gets you deported,” Heritage's attorney Samuel Dewey told reporters after the hearing. “People are routinely deported for lying on immigration forms.” \n\nDewey said it's also possible that Harry was truthful about his prior drug use on his application, and received either an internal DHS waiver or some sort of diplomatic visa from the State Department.

trade tariff hikes, report finds","text":"Nearly one in four UK businesses are hiking prices in response to the threat of tariff hikes as fears grow over a global trade war kicked off by US President Donald Trump, according to a survey.\n\nA poll of 1,500 businesses by banking giant HSBC found 39% are increasing prices in anticipation of higher tariffs.\n\nIt also revealed that half of firms are shifting their export markets to countries with lower trade barriers in an effort to side-step the worst of the hit from any trade war.\n\nFirms are also planning to adapt their supply chains to weather the storm, with 41% saying they will diversify and almost a third (31%) looking to bring the chain back in-house, while 41% said they would expand the products and services they sell to help offset any hit.\n\nThe results of the survey, which was conducted in November for the bank’s going global for growth report, comes as Mr Trump fired his opening shots over the weekend by slapping 25% trade tariffs against Canada and Mexico, and 10% on Chinese imports.\n\nCanada was quick to announce plans for retaliation, though Mr Trump announced a month-long pause before the tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico come into effect.\n\nBut with no sign of a truce with China, the trade war between the pair has since begun in earnest, with Beijing responding with a broad package of economic measures targeting the US.\n\nMr Trump also warned the European Union would be next, sending stock markets sharply lower on Monday.\n\nHe said a deal “can be worked out” with Britain, despite claiming the UK was “out of line”.\n\nA number of firms and manufacturers are bracing for a financial hit from the trade war.\n\nJohnnie Walker and Guinness maker Diageo cautioned earlier this week that Mr Trump’s proposed US tariffs could deal a 200 million US dollar (£161 million) blow to profits.\n\nThe London-listed spirits giant also scrapped a key sales target because of growing uncertainty linked to the tariffs and volatile consumer demand.\n\nBeauty firm Estee Lauder also this week revealed it is ramping up job cuts – to as many as 7,000 worldwide – to save more in costs, which it said is partly down to concerns over possible tariff increases.\n\nWhile firms are hiking prices and taking action ahead of a tariff impact, the HSBC survey showed only 15% said they would reduce their overseas trading activity.\n\nStuart Tait, head of commercial banking at HSBC UK, said: “Far from retreating to more cautious positions, our report highlights how growing businesses remain as ambitious as ever and are adapting to changes as they arise.\n\n“Businesses are finding creative ways to ensure they continue to trade overseas successfully, whether that’s looking to different international markets or diversifying their supply chains.”\n\nThe survey showed that despite Brexit, the EU remains the most popular for UK firms to buy and sell goods and services overseas, targeted by 72% of international companies, although this is down from 84% in 2023.\n\nThe US is next, where 57% of UK-based international businesses are active, followed by Canada (40%), China (34%) and the Middle East and North Africa (28%).\n\nMinister for services, small business and exports Gareth Thomas said: “It’s great to see so many British businesses trading internationally and seeking out new markets, with more aspiring to.\n\n“We are committed to doing everything we can to help them grow and increase their footprint around the world by removing barriers to trade and striking deals with global trading partners.”","summary":"A poll of 1,500 businesses by HSBC found 39% of are increasing prices in anticipation of higher

As a result, both countries succeeded,” Samaranayake said.\n“India preserved its aerial presence through civilian operators, while the Maldives’ new administration followed through on its pledge to remove foreign military presence in the country. The allocation in the budget appears to reflect this uptick in bilateral relations,” she added.\nForeign affairs specialist Robinder Sachdev told This Week in Asia that India wanted to be seen as a “North Star” for the Maldives – steady, reliable, and always present for its people and political leaders.\n“Even in the face of President Muizzu’s criticisms and attempts to recalibrate Maldives-India relations, India remained resolute, engaging with patience and strategic foresight rather than reacting to short-term turbulence,” said Sachdev, founder president of The Imagindia Institute, a non-partisan Delhi-based independent think tank and research centre.\n\n‘Committed ally’\nExperts said they believed China had a long-term agenda of dominating the Indian Ocean region.\nMuizzu is perceived to be pro-China and Beijing has been exerting its influence over the country’s sectors including infrastructure, trade and energy.\nIn January last year, the Maldives and China signed 20 key agreements, including a tourism cooperation deal, and announced a comprehensive strategic partnership. The Muizzu administration also sought to restructure more than US$1.3 billion in loans from China.\nThe Maldives last year allowed the Chinese research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 to dock in its waters, raising concerns in India.\n“Chinese foreign policy operates with a long-term, patient view of global affairs. In the case of the Maldives, India appears to be choosing to outdo and outwait China rather than engaging in immediate power struggles,” Sachdev said.\n\nMuizzu’s recent overtures to Delhi, however, showed that the Maldives was recognising that India was not the “antagonistic power” portrayed during the election campaign, analysts noted.\n“They [Maldives government] have come back to India and are seeing more support from Delhi, who is willing to invest and support the Maldives,” said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation’s strategic studies programme.\nSachdev said Delhi was also confident that its deep-rooted historical, cultural, and economic ties with the Maldives would not only endure but also outpace China’s growing influence in the region.\n“Unlike Beijing’s high-debt infrastructure projects, which often come with strategic conditions, India’s developmental partnerships are designed to be transparent, sustainable and mutually beneficial,” Sachdev said.\n“This patient and steady approach aligns with India’s broader Neighbourhood First policy, ensuring that the Maldives views India not just as a counterweight to China, but as a long-term, committed ally dedicated to its prosperity and stability.”\nMeanwhile, India’s foreign aid as a whole has risen by 20 per cent in the 2025 budget. Observers see the move as bolstering the Neighbourhood First policy, with Delhi continuing to expand its partnerships across South Asia.\nBhutan remained the largest recipient at 21.5 billion rupees, up from 20.7 billion last year, while Afghanistan was allocated 1 billion rupees.\nShivmurthy said Bhutan received a major share of funds due to Indian investments in capital projects such as hydropower in the country.\n\n“There is now more of a dedication to exploring renewable energy beyond hydropower in terms of solar and wind power energy. This increases Bhutan’s help to a greater level,” he said.\nSwaran Singh, an international relations professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, said India’s increase in foreign aid stood out against US President Donald Trump’s recent freeze on most foreign aid.\n“US foreign help drying out makes it especially instructive of things to come. With India’s economy projected to rise by 6 to 7 per cent, this trend of India’s expanding developmental aid to other countries promises to sustain and expand in coming years,” Singh said.\nSingh noted that India’s developmental aid focused on its immediate neighbours, with more than 64 per cent of the allocations in the new budget going to the region.\nSuch a move, he said, was in line with the country’s commitment to developmental aid and would help reinforce “India’s projection of itself as vishvamitr [friend of the world]”.","summary":"In a sign of an ‘uptick in bilateral relations’, India has earmarked US$69 million in financial aid for the Maldives in its latest budget.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297519/india-boosts-aid-maldives-bid-outdo-chinas-influence-region","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/05/bae78179-8d49-4771-a6d4-7d8882815f51_d9c77b66.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-06 00:00:21","author":"Junaid Kathju","authors":["Junaid Kathju"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.228},{"id":287520116,"title":"After US, Israel Halts Participation In UN Human Rights Council","text":"A day after US President Donald Trump announced America's withdrawal from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gideon Sa'ar, said on Wednesday that Israel would also join the US in its decision not to participate in the UNHRC.Sa'ar expressed Israel's support for Trump's decision, calling it a step in the right direction.In a post on X on Wednesday, Israeli Foreign Minister said, \"Israel welcomes President Trump's decision not to participate in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).

These meetings will be held over several days.During the visit of the Israeli Prime Minister, Donald Trump said during the joint conference, \"The bonds of friendship and affection between the American and Israeli people have endured for generations, and they are absolutely unbreakable.\"(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"A day after US President Trump announced America's withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Council, Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gideon Sa'ar, said on Wednesday that Israel would also join the US in its decision not to participate in the UNHRC.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/after-us-israel-halts-participation-in-un-human-rights-council-7644555","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-02/vq42eehg_india-at-un-human-rights-council_625x300_28_February_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:55:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.044},{"id":287515762,"title":"US will gain more than lose from Trump’s tariffs policy in short term — expert","text":"BERLIN, February 6. /TASS/. The United States’ economy will receive a new impetus in the short term and will gain more than lose from the tariff policy proposed by US President Donald Trump, Thorsten Polleit, former Chief Economist of Degussa, Europe's largest precious metal trading house and Honorary Professor of Economics at the University of Bayreuth, told TASS.\n\n\"It would probably be a good idea for the Americans to replace the income tax with import tariffs, as Trump proposes. They will gain more than they lose - at least in the short term,\" the expert said.\n\nIn his opinion, the side effects of such a policy will have a positive impact on the American economy. In particular, the rise in the cost of imported goods will make American goods more competitive in price, and foreign manufacturers may decide to move their production to the United States, which will contribute to the growth of employment within the country. In this regard, the Trump administration's intention to ensure the lowest corporate taxes in the world is of no small importance, the economist added.\n\n\"Taken together, this increases the purchasing power of Americans and gives the economy a new impetus,\" Polleit summed up.\n\nEarlier, Fox Business reported that during his speech in Florida on January 27, Trump proposed completely abolishing the federal income tax in order to return the United States to the \"richest period\" in its history. \"Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich foreign nations, we should be tariffing and taxing foreign nations to enrich our citizens,\" the US President said.\n\nOn February 1, Trump signed an executive order to impose tariffs on goods from Canada, China, and Mexico. According to the document, duties of 25% are imposed on imports from Mexico and Canada (10% on Canadian energy resources). Trump later suspended their introduction for a month following his phone conversations with talks with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Additional tariffs of 10% are imposed on goods from China.","summary":"The rise in the cost of imported goods will make American goods more competitive in price, Thorsten Polleit, former Chief Economist of Degussa, Europe's largest precious metal trading house and Honorary Professor of Economics at the University of Bayreuth, said","url":"https://tass.com/economy/1909297","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:53:21","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.083},{"id":287518870,"title":"Elon Musk Main Villain in Mass Anti-Trump Demonstrations","text":"Demonstrations on Wednesday erupted across America in protest of President Donald Trump's administration and the many sweeping changes it has made since the inauguration just 17 days ago.But at multiple protests, one of the president's allies was the subject of scorn even more than Trump: billionaire and tech guru Elon Musk.In Boston, outside the Massachusetts State House, hundreds of protesters stood with signs while shouting \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Elon Musk has got to go!\" and \"Deport Elon!\"In New York City, more than 100 protesters gathered outside City Hall, with one holding a sign depicting Musk as a king, while others had placards reading \"No-one voted for Elon Musk\" and \"No tech takeover!\"\"I don't trust Elon Musk. I guarantee that within two weeks, Trump the puppet will be gone and Elon Musk will be president,\" one protester who gave her name as Gale, told Newsweek. Gale declined to give her surname.Many demonstrators told Newsweek they are terrified by Musk's rise to power. \"The criminality is just spectacularly disastrous for our country,\" Maureen Devlin told Newsweek in Boston. \"It needs to be stopped.\"Why It MattersThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a nongovernmental task force run by Musk, is working to cut wasteful federal spending. DOGE has been granted access to \"sensitive Treasury data,\" including Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems, the Associated Press (AP) reported.Musk has been working as a \"special government employee,\" a White House official told the AP. He does not receive a paycheck for his work.What To KnowSince Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, Musk has been an ever-growing presence in U.S. politics, joining rallies, speaking out on social media and now heading DOGE.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent approved Musk's access to the Treasury on Friday. It allows him and his team entry into a system responsible for trillions of dollars in government payments, including Social Security checks and tax refunds.Democratic leaders, and now everyday citizens, have sounded alarms around Musk's \"shadow government.\" Kevin, a veteran in New York who did not want to disclose his last name, told Newsweek that Musk \"paid $250 million for the keys to the country.\"Beyond the Treasury, Musk announced that the U.S. Agency for International Development would shut down.He also recently urged lawmakers to vote down an original bipartisan spending bill and said any lawmaker who supported it should be voted out of office. At one point, some Republican lawmakers called for Musk to become House speaker.Protesters, in conjunction with the 50501 Movement, rallied on Wednesday throughout the nation. In Boston, police confirmed to Newsweek that over 200 people showed up.Laura Olson made a \"Re$train Musk\" poster for the rally. The opposite side of the sign read \"chaos ≠ good govt.\"\"Nobody elected Musk,\" Olson told Newsweek. \"He's destroying our government.\"Cathy Walthers had an \"F-Elon\" sign that she brought to Boston after about a two-hour drive from Cape Cod. She called Musk's involvement in the U.S. government despite not being elected to any position \"problematic.\"\"I'm worried about what's happening with our government,\" Walthers told Newsweek. \"Elon Musk, is he taking over our Treasury? There's a lot of questions, and I'd like to get some answers from that.\"Nancy Dignan carried a \"Send Musk to Mars\" sign, as she is \"furious that we allowed Musk to get into our private information and take out all of our agencies with no agency\" himself.In New York, there were chants of \"We don't trust Elon Musk!\" and signs calling to \"deport\" the Tesla CEO and to \"stop the treasury steal.\"Jess, a social worker who also did not want to disclose her last name, painted a poster of Musk as a king. She told Newsweek that he is a \"king but a joke of a king.\"\"I used to be a fan of Musk,\" Jess said. \"I feel very much duped but also not surprised ... He's high on his own ego, and he's a mess.\"The tech titans want to be in charge of everything and they don't like democracy.\"Rebecca White, who was holding a sign that read \"immigrants make America great,\" told Newsweek, \"I remember having a conversation about Elon Musk several years ago and feeling like I don't want to see the future he'd build. Now I feel like we're in that moment.\"The administration is giving him power that's puts him above the law, and wealth shouldn't put someone above the citizenry.\"Kevin, the veteran in New York, also told Newsweek that he felt Musk should be behind bars. \"I think he should be thrown in jail, as a traitor.\"Other New York protesters raised concerns regarding just how much the Trump administration had done since taking office on January 20, with many telling Newsweek they were \"terrified\" and \"overwhelmed\" by the number of executive orders and broad federal changes.What's the 50501 Movement?The 50501 Movement—or 50 states, 50 protests, one day—garnered support throughout social media over its plan to stage demonstrations across the nation to \"fight Fascism\" on February 5.The protests were against Trump and his actions during his first three weeks back in the White House.One of the moderators of the subreddit, u/honeydoulemon, told Snopes that the original idea came from another moderator, u/Evolved_Fungi.Evolved_Fungi's original post was deleted, but Snopes was provided screenshots by u/honeydoulemon, showing that the hope was to give a \"simple instruction set\" and increase participation \"exponentially.\"Each local protest is run by different participants but the overall movement was partnered with Political Revolution.Natalie Nunez, media coordinator for the movement in Massachusetts, told Newsweek that she's \"noticed a lot in the news,\" which pushed her to protest.\"I feel like a lot of executive orders and a lot of little things are being dismantled right under our noses and people are underreacting,\" Nunez told Newsweek. \"Little by little right now, Trump and his team members are trying to take away our rights.\"Nunez added that Musk and his team of \"young, tech bros\" are \"setting up a system where people are nothing but a revenue stream.\"\"It's always about money and influence and never about the people,\" Nunez told Newsweek. \"They'll bleed the country dry while convincing the masses, us, that it's for their own good. And it's not.\"Counterprotesters Arrive to Support Donald TrumpTwo counterprotesters showed up at the end of the Boston rally. Landon Costigan told Newsweek that he attended because the people complaining \"don't make a whole lot of sense.\" He said his town in Massachusetts is \"really discriminatory toward anyone who's Republican.\"\"I'm just out here to speak and tell the truth,\" Costigan said, holding a sign that read \"two genders,\" in reference to Trump's executive order.\"I'm not saying all Democrats are like this but it's people like this that give the Democrat party a bad vibe. You don't see Republicans suppressing free speech.\"As for Musk, Costigan said it is hypocritical to now be calling for his deportation because \"they only use the law when it's in their favor.\"\"I think he's a man of great power. He's very intelligent,\" Costigan, who is part of an underground conservative movement, told Newsweek. \"I don't think he would do anything harmful.\"Costigan was not going up to people, but a man did try to interrupt him and push him while he was talking with Newsweek.Newsweek did not see a counterprotest response in New York.What People Are SayingMassachusetts State Senator Sal DiDomenico at the Boston protest: \"You have allies in the State House who are going to fight back. Donald Trump wants to be a tyrant. Donald Trump is inspired, and he respects tyrants around the world because he wants to be just that. We have to fight back as a community and a nation to allow us to have a voice, not President Musk, not President Trump but the people have the voice of this country to fight back and defend democracy because we are not going to take it anymore.\"Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday: \"Elon got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good if we agree with him, and it's only if we agree with him. Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval. And we'll give him the approval where appropriate, and where not appropriate, we won't. Where we think there's a conflict, we won't let him go near it.\"Democratic U.S. Representative and Marine Corps veteran Jared Golden of Maine, on X: \"I've been getting a lot of calls over the past few days, and the interesting thing is none of them are about Donald Trump. They're all about Elon Musk. My constituents, and a majority of this country, put Trump in the White House, not this unelected, weirdo billionaire.\"Democratic U.S. Representative Dan Goldman of New York, on X: \"@ElonMusk gave Trump $250m, so Trump handed him control of America's checkbook.\"Musk and his 20-something DOGE cadre can now access your social security number, home address and more.\"This is unprecedented corruption, an invasion of privacy, and a threat to national security.\"Palmer Luckey, founder of ModRetor, on X, and reposted by Musk: \"One of the key pillars of Trump's campaign was the creation of a Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon. This is exactly what people voted for, not some kind of surprise twist!\"Vice President JD Vance on X: \"'No one voted for Elon Musk.' (They did however vote for Donald Trump who promised repeatedly to have Elon Musk root out wasteful spending in our government.)\"Follow Newsweek's live blog for real-time updates on the protests throughout the country.","summary":"Protests erupted throughout the country on Wednesday to counter the actions taken by President Donald Trump's administration just 17 days in office.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/50501-movement-protests-elon-musk-donald-trump-republican-villain-2026871","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2582306/elon-musk-poster.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:52:39","author":"Hannah Parry,Monica Sager","authors":["Hannah Parry","Monica Sager"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":287516570,"title":"Pam Bondi freezes DOJ funding for sanctuary cities, as Michelle Wu gets date to testify in front of Congress","text":"Skip to content\n\nAll Sections\n\n \n Subscribe Now \n \n\n Wednesday, February 5th 2025 \n\nE-Edition \n \n\n \n Home Page\n\nCrime & Public Safety\n\nYour Tax Dollars At Work\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBest Reviews\n\nReal Estate\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\nSubmit a Letter\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nCollege Sports\n\nHigh School Sports\n\nDonald Trump\n\nElection 2024\n\nState House\n\nBoston City Hall\n\nEntertainment\n\nEntertainment\n\nTV and Streaming\n\nMusic and Concerts\n\nFun & Games\n\nSpecial Sections\n\nRestaurants Food & Drink\n\nBoston Herald Store\n\nNews Obituaries\n\nPlace an Obituary\n\nClose Menu \n\nSign up for email newsletters\n\n Sign Up\n\nPolitics | \n\n Pam Bondi freezes DOJ funding for sanctuary… \n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\n Account Settings\n Contact Us\n Log Out\n\n Spoof a user\n\nSign up for email newsletters\n\n Sign Up\n\n Wednesday, February 5th 2025 \n\nE-Edition \n \n\nPolitics \n\nDonald Trump\n\nState House\n\nBoston City Hall\n\n Trending: \n\nPolitics | \n\n Read Howie Carr🚨 \n\nPolitics | \n\n Josh Kraft mayoral run \n\nPolitics | \n\n Snow storm \n\nPolitics | \n\n Taunton migrant shelter \n\nPolitics | \n\n Beanpot \n\nBreaking News\n \n\nPolitics | \n\n Charlestown houseboat death ruled homicide, victim identified \n\nFebruary 5, 2025 at 5:14 pm \n\nSubscriber Exclusive\n\nPolitics | \n\n Pam Bondi freezes DOJ funding for sanctuary cities, as Michelle Wu gets date to testify in front of Congress \n\n‘Sanctuary jurisdictions should not receive access to federal grants’\n\nShare this:\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\n\n Pam Bondi speaks after being sworn in as US Attorney General in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Wednesday.

120,000 visitors descend on city for Super Bowl just weeks after terror attack","text":"After a New Year’s Day terror attack struck New Orleans’ historic French Quarter, city officials say they are confident in the security plans they have in place for Sunday’s Super Bowl.\n\nMore than 125,000 visitors — including President Donald Trump — are expected to converge on the Big Easy this week for days of revelry capped off by the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome to crown this season’s NFL champion.\n\nFollowing the ISIS-inspired truck-ramming attack in which 14 people were killed and dozens more injured along Bourbon Street, one of the city’s most famous thoroughfares, alleged security lapses triggered multiple lawsuits and investigations.\n\nBut the city, the NFL and law enforcement officials insist that after more than a year of preparations, they are ready to play host.\n\n“We’re going above and beyond what we’ve seen in the past when we’ve hosted previously,” Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. \n\n“We know we’re safer than we’ve ever been before.”\n\nWhat will the security presence look like?\n\nApproximately 2,000 law enforcement officers will be present for the Super Bowl, New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters Wednesday.\n\nNo vehicle traffic will be allowed on the Bourbon Street, and the city will block intersections leading to the most popular areas, Kirkpatrick said.\n\nSecurity has had to “heighten” with Trump’s visit announced on Tuesday, and the city “will have to shut down some additional streets a little longer in order to provide a safe corridor for him,” Kirkpatrick said.\n\nDrones are prohibited above downtown New Orleans and around the Superdome in the days leading up to the game, and there will be flight restrictions up to 18,000 feet (5,486 meters), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nArmed federal air marshals will be stationed around the city’s transportation hubs, scanning for suspicious people or activities and guarding against drones, said Noel Curtin, supervisory air marshal in charge with the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nSuper Bowl events will sprawl across neighborhoods far beyond the stadium, said Homeland Security Investigations New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Eric DeLaune, who is leading federal coordination of security.\n\nFederal agencies from the FBI to the Secret Service are bringing in rooftop snipers and will position armored SWAT vehicles around the stadium, the French Quarter and downtown, DeLaune said.\n\nNo one will be allowed inside a cordoned-off area surrounding the Superdome without credentials, and the city already has begun shutting down and limiting traffic on roads near the stadium. \n\nThe perimeter will include blast barriers and trucks will be required to pass through giant X-ray machines typically used at border crossings, DeLaune said.\n\nDozens of technicians and more than 100 bomb-sniffing dogs are conducting a days-long effort to scour the 400,000 square feet (37,161 square meters) of the Superdome and each of its more than 70,000 seats prior to game day, DeLaune said.\n\n“They’re going to go from top to bottom on that building to make sure it’s clear and it’s safe. They open every door, check under every seat,” DeLaune said.\n\nMuch of the security infrastructure will carry over to the Mardi Gras season, which has been upgraded to Homeland Security’s highest risk rating to receive more manpower and resources.\n\nHow the New Year’s Day attack has changed security plans\n\nMultiple lawsuits have claimed city authorities were aware of Bourbon Street’s vulnerabilities to the kind of truck-ramming attack that the Islamic State group-inspired Shamsud-Din Jabbar carried out. \n\nHe drove his F-150 around a police car parked as a makeshift barricade and plowed into pedestrians before he crashed and was killed by police.\n\nThe bollard system of steel columns installed to block vehicle traffic was being replaced at the entrance to Bourbon Street at the time of the attack. \n\nIt remains on track for completion before the Super Bowl, officials said.\n\nAuthorities say they have brought in more types of physical barriers to protect entry points resulting from concerns that the new bollard system was not strong enough to block vehicle attacks.\n\nThe NFL and federal and city agencies “put a fresh set of eyes” on their plans post-Jan. 1, DeLaune said, noting the New Orleans Police Department hired former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his team from high-profile security firm Teneo.\n\n“No specific or credible threats” have surfaced, NFL security chief Cathy Lanier said Wednesday.\n\nIn January, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry ordered the removal of multiple homeless encampments near the stadium and moved dozens of unhoused people into a temporary warehouse shelter.\n\nHe also announced the creation of an “enhanced security zone” along Bourbon Street to bookend Super Bowl weekend and said he would deploy 350 National Guard members.\n\nAfter authorities found Jabbar had planted ice chests containing undetonated improvised explosive devices around the French Quarter, Landry declared a ban on coolers and ice chests in these areas and ordered mandatory searches of bags for anyone entering the Bourbon Street zone during Super Bowl weekend.\n\nIn accordance with state law, firearms including permitless concealed carry guns will be allowed on Bourbon Street but not inside bars, city and state police say.\n\n“Booze and firearms don’t mix” Kirkpatrick said, adding that officers will monitor for anyone ”negligently carrying,” such as having a gun tucked in a waistband instead of a holster.\n\n“People will be extremely unwise to bring a firearm into our hospitality areas,” Kirkpatrick said. \n\n“Don’t do it, there’s no need for it folks.”\n\nAI and mobile apps will play a security role\n\nThe Superdome’s owner, ASM Global, has contracted New York-based artificial intelligence firm Dataminr to monitor potential and emerging threats in real time.\n\nThe company will draw from over 1 million sources of public data across 150 languages, from social media to dark web forums to traffic cameras, Dataminr Chief Security Officer Robert Crowley said.\n\nDataminr uses generative AI to produce memos alerting Superdome officials of trending patterns, such as an influx of posts showing swelling crowds or public disturbances as they unfold.\n\n“It’s stitching together all these little pieces of the puzzle to get a holistic, comprehensive view of what has just happened,” Crowley said. \n\n“The faster you know what is occurring, the quicker you can take better action.”\n\nVisitors also can report suspicious activities and receive security updates with the city’s NOLA Ready Public Safety App.","summary":"After a New Year’s Day terror attack struck New

Trump","text":"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the saying goes, and Argentina's President Javier Milei has made clear his admiration for Donald Trump by liberally borrowing from the US president's playbook.On Wednesday, Argentina announced it would follow the United States out of the World Health Organization, echoing Trump's repeated complaints about what he called the body's mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Andrea Oelsner, professor of international relations at the University of San Andres in Buenos Aires, called Argentina's WHO exit \"another sign\" of the country's return to the policy pioneered by post-dictatorship president Carlos Menem in the 1990s of \"automatic alignment\" with Washington.She added that Milei's claim that the WHO impinged on Argentina's sovereignty \"serves to get closer to Trump.\"Here are five other issues on which Argentina's self-declared \"anarcho-capitalist\" leader has followed his US counterpart's lead:Like Trump -- who has vowed to \"drill, baby, drill\" -- Milei is a climate skeptic, who declared during campaigning for president that \"policies that blame humans for climate change are wrong.\"After Trump's re-election in November, Argentina abruptly pulled out of UN climate talks in Azerbaijan, raising fears Milei could imitate Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on curbing carbon emissions.Argentina said it was \"reevaluating\" its participation in the deal.The talks snub coincided with a visit by Milei to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, the first foreign leader to visit the Republican after his election win.But Milei nonetheless went on to sign a declaration by G20 leaders at a summit in Rio recognizing the need for \"substantially scaling up climate finance.\"Like Trump, Milei has repeatedly railed against what he calls \"woke ideology\", most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he described it as a \"cancer.\"On Wednesday, his spokesman announced he would ban gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy for transgender children, days after Trump announced restrictions on gender transition procedures for minors.Milei's government added that minors would also not be allowed to make any changes to their ID documents, including their gender, until they had reached adulthood. Milei and Trump share a deep admiration for brash billionaire Elon Musk, with Milei lavishing praise on Trump's budget-slashing consigliere as the \"Thomas Edison of the 21st century.\"Trump for his part has given the Tesla and SpaceX boss, who has turned his X platform into an echo chamber for the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, extraordinary powers as the head of a new department in charge of slashing federal spending.Musk, in turn, has championed Milei's \"chainsaw\" economics and declared Argentina to be \"experiencing a giant improvement\" since Milei took over.Both leaders have been accused of stoking hate speech and intolerance by copiously insulting critics and political opponents on social media.Milei has labeled economists who question his policies \"econochantas\" (\"eco-phonies\"), trade unionists \"garcas\" (\"crooks\") and political opponents are \"mandrills\" (a type of monkey), \"rats\" and \"parasites.\"Like Trump, he and his online shock troops have also repeatedly attacked the media and critics as \"corrupt\" -- language reminiscent of Trump's 2017 promise to \"drain the swamp\" of Washington insiders and influence-peddlers.Milei, who has professed a deep interest in Judaism and studied Jewish scripture, is one of Israel's staunchest defenders.During a visit to Israel last year he announced plans to move Argentina's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- a controversial move that echoed Trump's shock 2017 decision to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.He also likened the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel to the

as the saying goes, and Argentina's President Javier Milei has made clear his admiration for Donald Trump by liberally borrowing from the US president's playbook.\n\nOn Wednesday, Argentina announced it would follow the United States out of the World Health Organization, echoing Trump's repeated complaints about what he called the body's mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAndrea Oelsner, professor of international relations at the University of San Andres in Buenos Aires, called Argentina's WHO exit \"another sign\" of the country's return to the policy pioneered by post-dictatorship president Carlos Menem in the 1990s of \"automatic alignment\" with Washington.\n\nShe added that Milei's claim that the WHO impinged on Argentina's sovereignty \"serves to get closer to Trump.\"\n\nHere are five other issues on which Argentina's self-declared \"anarcho-capitalist\" leader has followed his US counterpart's lead:\n\n- Climate scepticism -\n\nLike Trump -- who has vowed to \"drill, baby, drill\" -- Milei is a climate skeptic, who declared during campaigning for president that \"policies that blame humans for climate change are wrong.\"\n\nAfter Trump's re-election in November, Argentina abruptly pulled out of UN climate talks in Azerbaijan, raising fears Milei could imitate Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on curbing carbon emissions.\n\nArgentina said it was \"reevaluating\" its participation in the deal.\n\nThe talks snub coincided with a visit by Milei to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, the first foreign leader to visit the Republican after his election win.\n\nBut Milei nonetheless went on to sign a declaration by G20 leaders at a summit in Rio recognizing the need for \"substantially scaling up climate finance.\"\n\n- War on 'woke' -\n\nLike Trump, Milei has repeatedly railed against what he calls \"woke ideology\", most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos where he described it as a \"cancer.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, his spokesman announced he would ban gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy for transgender children, days after Trump announced restrictions on gender transition procedures for minors.\n\nMilei's government added that minors would also not be allowed to make any changes to their ID documents, including their gender, until they had reached adulthood. \n\n- Mad about Musk -\n\nMilei and Trump share a deep admiration for brash billionaire Elon Musk, with Milei lavishing praise on Trump's budget-slashing consigliere as the \"Thomas Edison of the 21st century.\"\n\nTrump for his part has given the Tesla and SpaceX boss, who has turned his X platform into an echo chamber for the MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement, extraordinary powers as the head of a new department in charge of slashing federal spending.\n\nMusk, in turn, has championed Milei's \"chainsaw\" economics and declared Argentina to be \"experiencing a giant improvement\" since Milei took over.\n\n- Social media attacks -\n\nBoth leaders have been accused of stoking hate speech and intolerance by copiously insulting critics and political opponents on social media.\n\nMilei has labeled economists who question his policies \"econochantas\" (\"eco-phonies\"), trade unionists \"garcas\" (\"crooks\") and political opponents are \"mandrills\" (a type of monkey), \"rats\" and \"parasites.\"\n\nLike Trump, he and his online shock troops have also repeatedly attacked the media and critics as \"corrupt\" -- language reminiscent of Trump's 2017 promise to \"drain the swamp\" of Washington insiders and influence-peddlers.\n\n- Iron-clad Israel support -\n\nMilei, who has professed a deep interest in Judaism and studied Jewish scripture, is one of Israel's staunchest defenders.\n\nDuring a visit to Israel last year he announced plans to move Argentina's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- a controversial move that echoed Trump's shock 2017 decision to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nHe also likened the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel to the Holocaust.","summary":"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the

The answer is an absolute yes! Find out how!\n\nIn 2018, as WND reported, Chelsea Clinton said she “abhors” the actions of President Donald Trump in his first term, and floated the idea of her own possible run for office in the future.\n\n“At federal level, as much as I abhor so much of what President Trump is doing, I have a great amount of gratitude for what my congresswoman and my senators are doing to try to stop him at every point,” Clinton said.\n\n“While I disagree with the president … I think my family … is being really well represented,” she added. “But if that were to change, if my city councillor were to retire, if my congresswoman were to retire, my senators, and I thought that I could make a positive impact, then I think I would really have to ask my answer to that question [of whether to run for office].”\n\n“For me it’s a definite no now, but it’s a definite maybe in the future because who knows what the future is going to bring.”\n\nChelsea could not hold back on her disdain for Trump’s initial term in the Oval Office, with special emphasis on what was happening at U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n“I’m outraged every day by something our president has done or said or left undone or neglected, or who he has recently bullied on Twitter or television.\n\n“For me, sometimes, I think I’m just so fundamentally my mother’s daughter that I’m far more outraged by the Trump administration ripping children away from their families at the border and not having reunified those children with their families now for months, than I am about anything he has ever done to my families.”\n\nShe continued: “In some ways I think this is the greatest sin of the moment in our country and we very much are doing everything we can to stop this from happening.”\n\nClinton was also in the news in 2018 for controversial remarks on abortion.\n\nShe claimed the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision helped add $3.5 trillion to the U.S. economy.\n\n“It is not a disconnected fact, to address this t-shirt of 1973, that American women entering the labor force from 1970 to 2009 added three and a half trillion dollars to our economy. Right?” Clinton said. “The net, new entrance of women – that is not disconnected from the fact that Roe became the law of the land in January of 1973. So, I think, whatever it is that people say they care about, I think that you can connect to this issue.”\n\nIn direct response, evangelist Franklin Graham said on Facebook: “What a lie. Hitler probably also claimed that killing the Jews would be good for their economy.”\n\n“Legalizing abortion hasn’t added anything to our country, it has only taken away,” Graham continued. “It has cost this nation more than 60 million lives – lives precious to God. Just think of the contribution these people would have made. There will be another high cost. I believe God will judge America for allowing the heinous murder of our own children in the womb. And to everyone who has had an abortion, that is murder in God’s eyes. But I am happy to tell you the wonderful news that God will forgive you. He can take the shame and guilt you have been carrying around all these years and take it away if you are willing to turn to Him and put your faith and trust in His Son Jesus Christ. Not only will He forgive you, He will save you for eternity – and you will be reunited one day in Heaven with that child.”\n\nFollow Joe on Twitter @JoeKovacsNews","summary":"'The depravity and sickness of these people requires a public preparation for the crimes'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/wow-elon-musk-stunned-at-discovery-of-chelsea-clinton-receiving-84-million-in-taxpayer-funding/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Chelsea_Clinton_by_Lorie_Shaull_wikimedia-600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-05 23:48:43","author":"Joe Kovacs","authors":["Joe Kovacs"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":287516758,"title":"Eagles fan Jill Biden to attend Super Bowl LIX: report","text":"Jill Biden, the former first lady and a Philadelphia Eagles fan, will reportedly head to New Orleans for the Super Bowl Sunday with her grandson.
