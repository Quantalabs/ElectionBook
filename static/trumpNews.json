It'll be a lot of people, all because of the Democrats,' Trump said. \n\nIt's the biggest set of firings in government since Elon Musk's DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) purge early in Trump's second term. \n\nThe White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started in an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues.\n\nRuss Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social platform X that the 'RIFs have begun,' referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.\n\nThe White House previewed that it would pursue the aggressive layoff tactic shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review. \n\nIt said reduction-in-force could apply for federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, is otherwise not funded and is 'not consistent with the President´s priorities.'\n\nIn a court filing, the budget office said well over 4,000 employees would be fired, though it noted that the funding situation was 'fluid and rapidly evolving.'\n\nThe firings would hit the hardest at the departments of the Treasury, which would lose over 1,400 employees; Health and Human Services, with a loss of over 1,100; and Housing and Urban Development, set to lose over 400. \n\nThe departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, and Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency were all set to fire hundreds of more employees. It was not clear which particular programs would be affected.\n\nThe aggressive move by Trump's budget office goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown and escalates an already politically toxic dynamic between the White House and Congress. \n\nTalks to end the shutdown are almost nonexistent.\n\nTypically, federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends, traditionally with back pay. \n\nSome 750,000 employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown, officials have said.\n\nTrump said that, going forward, 'We´re going to make a determination, do we want a lot? And I must tell you, a lot of them happen to be Democrat oriented.'\n\n'These are people that the Democrats wanted, that, in many cases, were not appropriate,' he said of federal employees, eventually adding, 'Many of them will be fired.'\n\nStill, some leading Republicans were highly critical of the administration's actions.\n\n'I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought´s attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown,' said Maine Senator Susan Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, who blamed the federal closure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nAlaska Senator Lisa Murkowski called the announcement 'poorly timed' and 'yet another example of this administration´s punitive actions toward the federal workforce.'\n\nFor his part, Schumer said the blame for the layoffs rested with Trump.\n\n'Let´s be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,' Schumer said. \n\n'They don´t have to do it; they want to. They´re callously choosing to hurt people - the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.'\n\nThe White House had previewed its tactics shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review.\n\nIt said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are 'not consistent with the President´s priorities.'\n\nOn Friday, the Education Department was among the agencies hit by new layoffs, a department spokesperson said. \n\nA labor union for the agency´s workers said the administration is laying off almost all employees below the director level at the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, while fewer than 10 employees were being terminated at the agency´s Office of Communications and Outreach.\n\nNotices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation´s cyber and physical infrastructure, according to DHS, where CISA is housed. \n\nThe agency has been a frequent Trump target over its work to counter misinformation about the 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic. DHS said the layoffs were 'part of getting CISA back on mission.'\n\nFederal health workers were also being fired, though an HHS spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. \n\nA spokesperson for the EPA, which also has an unspecified number of layoffs, blamed the Democrats for the firings and said they can vote to reopen the government anytime.\n\nAn official for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents federal workers and is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees.\n\nThe AFGE asked a federal judge to halt the firings, calling the action an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.\n\n'It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,' AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have tried to call the administration´s bluff, arguing the firings could be illegal, and had seemed bolstered by the fact that the White House had not immediately pursued the layoffs once the shutdown began.\n\nBut Trump signaled earlier this week that job cuts could be coming in 'four or five days.'\n\n'If this keeps going on, it´ll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,' he said Tuesday.","summary":"The president previewed the pink slips in a press conference in the Oval Office earlier Friday, blaming them and the shutdown on the Democrats.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15182451/Trump-DOGE-mass-layoffs-federal-government.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/11/01/102898485-0-image-a-5_1760141665514.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:52:47","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

The message is clear: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, we will stop you cold.\" The task force is launching at the direction of President Donald Trump, he said, in the SOUTHCOM area, which covers the Caribbean and Latin America.

Attorney General Keith Ellison's office sent a letter to the Department's Office for Civil Rights and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights on Friday evening, saying it has no \"substantive response\" to the Trump administration's demands to keep biological males out of girls' sports. Ellison's letter also cited the current government shutdown for its lack of response. \"The federal government is currently shut down and I understand employees in both Offices for Civil Rights are furloughed. As a result, the Minnesota Department of Education will not provide any substantive response at this time,\" part of the letter read. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The deadline was given to the Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) after a transgender softball pitcher led a girls' high school team to a state championship in the spring. But Trump administration also cited instances of trans athletes competing in girls’ Alpine skiing, girls’ Nordic skiing, girls’ lacrosse, girls’ track and field team and girls’ volleyball in Minnesota. Ellison's office's letter also expressed that it was \"disappointed that the Joint Letter includes sensitive information about minors in a public document.\" However, information about the trans softball pitcher has been public for months, as the athlete has even done media interviews. Maine and California each declined similar ultimatums over the issue from the Trump administration earlier this year, and as a result the Department of Justice launched lawsuits against both of the state's education agencies and school sports leagues. Ellison's office's lack of substantive response to the ultimatum comes despite the fact that hundreds of Minnesota school board members penned an open letter urging the state to comply with Trump and change its policies to keep males out of girls' sports. As of Friday evening, 253 school board members across 105 Minnesota school boards signed the letter, citing concerns for girls' privacy and safety, as well as potential federal funding cuts in response to the state's noncompliance. \"As recipients of federal financial assistance, failure to correct these violations directly threatens our schools’ ability to serve our students and communities,\" the letter from the school board members read, later adding, \"Compliance with Title IX is not only a legal obligation but also essential to maintaining the integrity of our educational and athletic programs. \"Protecting fairness in women’s sports is paramount. The federal determination highlights how permitting males to compete on female teams displaces female athletes from podiums, denies them advancement opportunities, and diminishes their visibility and recognition in competitions. \"Female students in our districts and across Minnesota deserve equal chances to excel in sports, free from unfair physical advantages that biological differences confer. By entering into the resolution agreement, MDE and MSHSL can ensure equal treatment and foster an environment where female athletes can thrive.\" Ellison has already filed his own lawsuit against Trump and the DOJ for trying to enforce its policies to protect girls' sports in Minnesota. He has also bragged about \"suing them first\" regarding the issue. INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS Meanwhile, the situation involving the softball player has already prompted another lawsuit by three teenage girls who have had to compete against the trans pitcher. The lawsuit was filed by three anonymous female athletes against Ellison, Minnesota State High School League Executive Director Erich Martens, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero and Minnesota Commissioner of Education Willie Jett. One of the anonymous plaintiffs called out Ellison for supporting the policies that have allowed the trans pitcher to play against females. \"It’s really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn’t taking the rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair,\" the player previously told Fox News Digital. \"To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong.\" The trans athlete threw a complete-game shutout, allowing just three hits and striking out six in the championship game, capping off a run that saw the trans athlete pitch all 21 innings across three state tournament games, giving up just two runs. The junior allowed just two runs across 35 total innings in the postseason. One of the plaintiffs previously told Fox News Digital about what it was like playing against the trans athlete. \"Hitting against him is not only a physical challenge but a mental, too. It’s a mental battle knowing that he has an advantage in the sport that I grew up playing, making it hard to even want to hit against him,\" the player said. Former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher previously told Fox News Digital that losing to a trans pitcher in the state tournament left her in tears. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"How do you acknowledge that you lost to a biological male? How do you process those events that happened? And that was something that entire night, I still couldn't do it. … We lost to a biological male in a female state tournament,\" Kotzmacher said. Kotzmacher also pointed out Gov. Tim Walz's history as a high school football coach, and seeing the physical prowess of male high school athletes up close. \"As a coach, you should see the differences and the vast difference that there are between biological males and biological females,\" Kotzmacher told Fox News Digital.

The discussion, organised for the delegation to initiate an interaction with the Indian American community residing in New York, was attended by MPs Captain Brijesh Chowta, Nishikant Dubey, Ujjwal Deorao Nikam, S Phangnon Konyak, Dr Medha Vishram Kulkarni, Poonam Ben Maadam, Vamsi Krishna Gaddam, Vivek Tankha, Sribharat Mathukumilli, Rajeev Rai and N K Premachandran.\nAlso Read | US President Donald Trump Misses Nobel Peace Prize 2025, Winner Maria Corina Machado From Venezuela Dedicates It to Him.\nThe delegation arrived in New York City on October 7 to represent India's stance at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session. The first batch of the Non-Official Delegation is being led by BJP MP and Chairperson of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on One Nation One Election, PP Chaudhary. This group, comprising 15 Members of Parliament from various political parties, will be in New York from October 8 to 14.\nAlso Read | Did a Rat Run Across Al Jazeera Anchor's Desk During Live Broadcast? Fact Check Reveals AI-Generated Video Going Viral With Fake Claim.\nAccording to official releases, the Non-Official Delegation allows MPs to attend UN sessions, engage with India's Permanent Mission, and present India's democratic voice on international issues. The initiative reflects India's growing global role and the importance it places on parliamentary diplomacy.\nSamajwadi Party MP Rajeev Rai stated that the \"unofficial\" delegation comprises members from several political parties, thereby ensuring a balanced representation of India's parliamentary diversity.\nEarlier, PP Chaudhary, Leader of India's first delegation to the UNGA, Member of Parliament and Chairperson of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on One Nation One Election, delivered India's national statement during the General Debate in the Third Committee of the United Nations on October 8, where he sharply exposed Pakistan's record of oppression and propaganda, read a press note.\nRejecting Pakistan's baseless remarks on Jammu and Kashmir, Chaudhary reaffirmed that the Union Territory is an integral and inalienable part of India. He criticised Pakistan's habitual misuse of UN platforms to advance narrow political ends while rigging elections, jailing popular leaders, bombing its own population, and brutally suppressing popular protests. He reminded the global community that even Pakistan's own Army Chief has described the country as a \"dump truck,\" exposing the rot within its governance.\nChaudhary underlined that India's Constitution, inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, provides a rights-based framework ensuring every citizen can reach their full potential.

The question is how he might register that indignation. The White House on Friday criticised the committee's decision.“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will,” White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a post on X. “The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.”Trump has made no secret of his desire to win the Nobel. He’s frequently cited his interventions that he claimed ended seven wars. In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump told attendees that “everyone says” he should be awarded the prize. “Trump’s campaign to get the prize has been extraordinary,” Committee secretary Kristian Berg Harpviken said in Oslo on Friday after the announcement was made.Live EventsThe Nobel – globally recognized and synonymous with excellence – is iconic in a way that Trump, an obsessive arbiter of brand strength, keenly appreciates. The obsession took hold when Trump’s original political nemesis, former President Barack Obama, won the award in 2009, just months after taking office.‘Didn’t Do It for the Nobel’Even Obama’s allies conceded it was more a political repudiation of the Bush administration than a deserved honour.But for Trump, the recognition revealed a rigged game, where prestige was reserved for those already accepted by a global order that had, despite his best efforts, dismissed him as an outsider. “He won the election and then they gave him the peace prize, right?” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “My election was a much more important election.”In the hours before the announcement, Trump seemed to sense the award would once again slip out of his grip. He insisted to reporters in the Oval Office that his diplomatic efforts were born out of an earnest concern for world peace, and suggested that he didn’t expect to win.“Whatever they do is — is fine,” Trump said. “I know this, I didn’t do it for that, I did it because I saved a lot of lives.” His frustration has only deepened since his elevation to the presidency.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onNobel Peace PrizeMaria Corina MachadoVenezuelaDonald TrumpdemocracyNorwegian Nobel CommitteeWhite House\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Discovery also publicly announcing that they were ending all DEI initiatives.","summary":"The studio has suffered a string of flops in recent years after recasting previously white characters with actors of color.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15182031/Disney-set-hire-white-actress-star-latest-reboot-dumping-DEI-amid-woke-fury.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/11/01/102896199-0-image-a-8_1760140998351.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/13/5185353480200371361/1024x576_MP4_5185353480200371361.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:29:27","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":368175692,"title":"World News | Monks Offer Prayers to Sacred Buddha Relics Being Taken to Russia","text":"New Delhi [India], October 11 (ANI): National Museum Director General Gurmeet Singh Chawla and a high-level delegation of 11 senior Indian monks on Saturday offered prayers to the sacred Relics of Gautam Buddha, before departing for Russia's Kalmykia Republic for an exposition.

That’s why I made it Nov. 1,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese government restricted access to rare earth minerals, requiring foreign companies to get special approval for shipping the metallic elements abroad. It also announced permitting requirements on exports of technologies used in the mining, smelting and recycling of rare earths, adding that any export requests for products used in military goods would be rejected.\n\nOn social media, Trump described the export controls as “shocking” and “out of the blue.” He said China is “becoming very hostile” and that it’s holding the world “captive” by restricting access to the metals and magnets used in electronics, computer chips, lasers, jet engines and other technologies.\n\nTrump said in a post that “starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying.” The president also said the U.S. government would respond to China by putting its own export controls “on any and all critical software” from American firms.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment.\n\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 2.7% on worries about the rising tensions between the world’s largest economies. It was the market’s worst day since April when the president last bandied about import taxes this high. Still, the stock market closed before the president spelled out the terms of his threat.\n\nNot only could the global trade war instigated by Trump be rekindled, but import taxes being heaped on top of the 30% already being levied on Chinese goods could, by the administration’s past statements, cause trade to break down between the U.S. and China in ways that could cause growth worldwide to slump.\n\nWhile Trump’s wording was definitive, he is also famously known for backing down from threats. Earlier this year, some investors began engaging in what the Financial Times called the “TACO” trade, which stands for “Trump Always Chickens Out.”\n\nThe prospect of tariffs this large could compound the president’s own political worries, potentially pushing up inflation at a moment when the job market appears fragile and the drags from a government shutdown are starting to compound with layoffs of federal workers.\n\nThe United States and China have been jostling for advantage in trade talks, after the import taxes announced earlier this year triggered the trade war. Both countries agreed to ratchet down tariffs after negotiations in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, yet tensions remain as China has continued to restrict America’s access to the difficult-to-mine rare earths needed for a wide array of U.S. technologies.\n\nThere is already a backlog of export license applications from Beijing’s previous round of export controls on rare earth elements, and the latest announcements “add further complexity to the global supply chain of rare earth elements,” the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement.\n\nThere are other flashpoints in the trade relationship, including U.S. restrictions on China’s ability to import advanced computer chips, sales of American-grown soybeans and a series of tit-for-tat port fees being levied by both countries starting on Tuesday.\n\nTrump did not formally cancel the meeting with Xi, so much as indicating that it might not happen as part of a trip at the end of the month in Asia. The trip was scheduled to include a stop in Malaysia, which is hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit; a stop in Japan; and a visit to South Korea, where he was slated to meet with Xi ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n\nSun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said Beijing’s move was a reaction to U.S. sanctions of Chinese companies this week and the upcoming port fees targeting China-related vessels — but said there’s room for de-escalation to keep the leaders’ meeting alive. “It is a disproportional reaction,” Sun said. “Beijing feels that de-escalation will have to be mutual as well. There is room for maneuver, especially on the implementation.”\n\nGracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said China holds leverage because it dominates the market for rare earths with 70% of the mining and 93% of the production of permanent magnets made from them, which are crucial to high-tech products and the military.\n\n“These restrictions undermine our ability to develop our industrial base at a time when we need to. And then second, it’s a powerful negotiating tool,” she said.\n\nCraig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank, said Trump’s post could “mark the beginning of the end of the tariff truce” that had lowered the tax rates charged by both countries.\n\n“Mutually assured disruption between the two sides is no longer a metaphor,” Singleton said. “Both sides are reaching for their economic weapons at the same time, and neither seems willing to back down.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Stan Choe in New York, Josh Funk in Omaha, Nebraska, and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.","summary":"The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 2.7% on worries about the rising tensions between the world’s largest economies.\n\n\nThe post Trump threatens tech export limits, new 100% tariff on Chinese imports appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/business/2025/10/10/trump-threatens-tech-export-limits-new-100-tariff-on-chinese-imports/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump_Finland_85438-68e923fc17d44-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:23:21","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":368175758,"title":"Ultimate Trump Card? Melania Trump Becomes US’ New Backchannel To Putin","text":"First Lady Melania Trump revealed on Friday that she and Russian President Vladimir Putin have established an “open channel of communication” to help reunite children separated from their families during the Russia-Ukraine war. Speaking from the Grand Foyer of the White House, Melania Trump said that eight children had already been reunited with their families in the past 24 hours. “We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war,” she said, calling the effort a “shared purpose with lasting impact.” Communication Began After Letter to Putin The first lady explained that she had written a letter to President Putin earlier this year, urging him to prioritize the safety and reunification of children affected by the conflict. President Donald Trump personally delivered the letter during his meeting with Putin in Alaska in August. Putin later responded in writing, signaling his willingness to work directly with her and providing information about Ukrainian children currently residing in Russia. US And Russia Coordinating On Reunifications Melania Trump said her representative has been working closely with Putin’s team on the reunification efforts. “Russia has demonstrated a willingness to disclose objective and detailed information reflective of the current situation,” she stated. She also said she received a detailed report about the eight reunited children, confirming the information with US government sources. According to Melania Trump, three of the eight children were displaced to Russia due to front-line fighting, while the other five were separated across borders, including a girl who had moved from Ukraine to Russia. She added that she has also raised concerns for those who were minors when displaced but have since turned 18. “Their safe return requires coordinated assistance,” she said, noting that Russia has agreed to facilitate the return of those who have reached adulthood “within a short period of time.” The first lady concluded her address with an emotional appeal for global unity to protect children affected by conflict. “A child’s soul knows no borders, no flags,” she said. “We must foster a future for our children which is rich with potential, security, and complete with free will, a world where dreams will be realized rather than faded by war.” ICC’s Warrant Against Putin In 2022, the Associated Press documented the abduction of Ukrainian children, prompting the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. The ICC accused him of war crimes and personal responsibility for the deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia. Despite the tensions, Melania Trump’s announcement marks a rare gesture of humanitarian cooperation between the two countries.

Since then, President Putin and I have had an open channel of communication regarding the welfare of these children,\" the First Lady said.\nAlso Read | Did a Rat Run Across Al Jazeera Anchor's Desk During Live Broadcast?

We have agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all people involved in this war. My representative has been working directly with President Putin's team to ensure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine,\" she said.\nMelania Trump had written a \"peace letter\" to Putin in August, urging him to protect children and future generations worldwide.\nUS President Donald Trump hand-delivered the letter to Putin ahead of their summit in Alaska, as reported by Fox News. Immediately after receiving it, Putin read the letter in front of the American and Russian delegations. \"Dear President Putin,\" the letter began. \"Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation's rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.\"\n\"As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation's hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few,\" it read.\nThe First Lady further wrote, \"Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all--so that every soul may wake to peace, and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded. A simple yet profound concept, Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation's descendants begin their lives with a purity--an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.\"\nThe letter noted that \"in today's world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them--a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future.\"\n\"Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,\" she added. \"In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone--you serve humanity itself,\" as reported by Fox News.\n\"Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time,\" the letter concluded. Earlier in August, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had thanked Melania Trump for raising the issue of 'abduction of Ukrainian children'.

It’s very Trumpy. And we mean that in the worst way possible.\n\nYou can’t actually do anything yet on the website, which is hosted at TrumpRx.gov, but the photos don’t give us a lot of faith that this is going to be a reliable place to serve America’s healthcare needs.\n\nWhat’s wrong with the images on TrumpRx? For starters, the first photo you see is of Trump himself, something that may not be a huge surprise, given the way this president has put his name and face on everything. After all, this is the guy who recently launched a TV ad on Newsmax for Trump Watches, which continues his tradition of profiting from the presidency in direct violation of U.S. law.\n\nThe photo shows Trump seated in the Oval Office of the White House, where he’s sporting that signature dipshit-tough-guy face he’s been practicing since the 1980s. It’s not surprising to see his face, but it’s still gross. And it would’ve been pretty galling if President Barack Obama had done something similar under his presidency.\n\nWhen healthcare.gov was launched in 2010, Obama’s photo was nowhere to be seen on that homepage. Obamacare, the unofficial name for the Affordable Care Act, was actually coined by Republicans who opposed the law.\n\nBut the lone photo on TrumpRx that doesn’t depict Trump is also disturbing in its own way. The image looks like it was generated by artificial intelligence, a ridiculous and unnecessary choice when you can get a cheap stock photo on any number of websites. It’s also just a disturbingly alien-like image if you take a closer look.\n\nThe original image may seem normal enough at first glance, but you can just feel it’s off. Zooming in on the hands reveals it really is one of those bizarre AI images, creating distorted hands with contorted fingers.\n\nAI still often has trouble generating hands, as you can see in the image above. But the legs also give a weird vibe, with the woman’s left calf looking abnormally short, and dropping off into a weird-looking heel and foot.\n\nThe woman also appears to be holding hands with one of the children in a mess of fingers that seems physically impossible. That child’s foot doesn’t look typical either, instead sporting maybe six toes or perhaps getting mangled in some industrial accident. You can create your own backstory, but whatever happened there must’ve been painful for our imaginary AI friend.\n\nThere also appears to be some kind of deformity in the leg of the child at the very front, to say nothing of all the holes in the sand, which look much more like AI-generated circles on an alien planet than the kind of footprints that are typically made by humans.\n\nThere’s also the American flag at the top of the hill, which doesn’t appear to have any stars. Maybe it’s a signal that Trump intends to get rid of federalism, abolishing state governance as he invades states with the National Guard like it’s foreign territory.\n\nThe TrumpRx website was first launched on Friday and initially contained text that read: “Tune in to the Oval Office @5PM EST,” according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. But it got a new look when Trump started his press conference on Friday.\n\nThe site is credited to the National Design Studio, launched by Trump through an executive order in August, and says that TrumpRx will be functional in January 2026. And the National Design Studio also praises the president in really creepy ways, as you can see from the opening line at that initiative’s website:\n\n What’s the biggest brand in the world? If you said Trump, you’re not wrong. But what’s the foundation of that brand? One that’s more globally recognized than practically anything else. It’s the nation…where he was born. It’s the United States of America. \n\nEverything Trump, all the time.\n\nIt’s really weird how that became the new normal in a country that’s ostensibly a liberal democracy. But just about everything is weird now, thanks to Trump.\n\nThe president insisted during his press conference, which was livestreamed on YouTube, that it wasn’t his idea to call the website TrumpRX. And that might be true. But his army of lackeys at the White House knows very well what makes him happy.\n\nSlapping his name on everything is Trump’s thing. And if he thought it was inappropriate (which it obviously is), he could’ve stopped it. Instead, the site bears his name, and his face is the first thing you see. And the text on the one-page site includes snarky claims about him saving the day by supposedly lowering drug prices.\n\nFrom the website:\n\nPresident Trump is delivering on promises that “experts” said were impossible by taking bold action to lower prescription drug costs for American families—without sacrificing innovation. Americans have unfairly shouldered the cost of drug development for decades, only to see those same medications sold abroad for a fraction of the price paid in the U.S. This broken system hasn’t just been unfair—it’s driven up costs and hurt the most vulnerable among us. President Trump is changing that with TrumpRx.\n\nIt should be noted that Trump hasn’t actually lowered drug prices. In fact, whenever Trump announces a new deal that’s ostensibly about lowering drug prices, the major pharmaceutical companies see their stock prices go up. Why? It might have something to do with the fact that he’s not actually going to bite into their margins, and any decline in prices will only benefit a small number of Americans.\n\nMost Americans pay for medications through insurance, and the deals Trump has announced with companies like Pfizer largely target cash-paying customers. And while that’s great for people without insurance, most Americans are unlikely to see their costs go down. And with Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” more and more Americans will be paying higher premiums next year. Saving a couple of bucks on a prescription is unlikely to offset those enormous costs.\n\nTrump’s press conference on Friday had the usual suspects, including the head of Medicare and Medicaid, Mehmet Oz, along with the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously said that you shouldn’t trust experts. Kennedy also said this week that a baby grows in a woman’s placenta, the kind of ignorance that would, again, not feel so normalized in a different political era.\n\nBut we live in the Trump era. And only time will tell whether TrumpRx actually does some good in the world. We’re not going to hold our breath. The website explains that “TrumpRx doesn’t sell medications. Instead, it connects patients directly with the best prices, increasing transparency and cutting out costly third-party markups.”\n\nWe still don’t know how all of this is going to operate. But we do know that, according to the Wall Street Journal, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., is on the board of a company called BlinkRx that stands to benefit from the TrumpRx site. Don Jr. is hosting a “Future of Pharmaceuticals” summit in December, and drug company representatives are reportedly nervous because they think they’ll be forced to work with a company with close ties to the president’s son.","summary":"AI art really has become the aesthetic of grifters and fascists.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/trumprx-is-a-narcissistic-ai-generated-nightmare-2000671309","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/10/trumprx-website-e1760140421440-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:04:56","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","category":"health","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":368175668,"title":"World News | India Announces New Healthcare Projects for Afghanistan, Gifts 20 Ambulances During Taliban Minister's Visit","text":"New Delhi [India], October 11 (ANI): Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Friday that India has announced several new projects for Afghanistan as part of its ongoing healthcare cooperation.

Muttaqi arrived in New Delhi on Thursday for a visit from October 9-16, marking the first high-level delegation from Kabul to India since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Muttaqi also stated on Friday that Afghanistan and India have agreed to set up a trade committee aimed at enhancing economic cooperation. \"Both sides agreed to create a trade committee. Due to opportunities opened in Afghanistan in terms of investment, and activities in minerals and energy, we invited the Indian side to explore work in these areas,\" he said, highlighting the potential for increased business and investment ties between the two countries. Earlier this year, in April, India's special envoy to Afghanistan, Anand Prakash, visited Kabul to discuss political and trade relations. Prior to that, in January this year, Muttaqi had met with Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai. The Afghan FM also highlighted that his discussions with External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar covered a wide range of issues. \"I had a detailed meeting with EAM Jaishankar, including economic, political, diplomatic, regional and security. Some of the achievements were the Indian government's upgradation of technical presence at the embassy. And a diplomatic delegation of the Islamic Emirate will arrive in Delhi.\" \"We also agreed to strengthen the air corridor to strengthen our trade. EAM pledged to broaden health activities in Afghanistan, and we appreciate the assistance provided for the victims of the earthquake,\" the visiting minister said. Expressing his gratitude for the reception in India, Muttaqi said, \"I would like to welcome all and am glad to be in Delhi. This is my first time visiting India as the FM of Afghanistan, and I appreciate the warm hospitality shown to us by the Indian Foreign Minister and the Indian government.\" During a bilateral meeting with Muttaqi, Jaishankar announced that India would upgrade its Kabul mission to an embassy. The embassy was shut after the Taliban seized power in 2021. Earlier in the day, EAM Jaishankar handed over five ambulances as a \"gesture of goodwill\" to Afghanistan's Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, on Friday in the national capital. In a post on X, EAM Jaishankar wrote, \"Also handed over 5 Ambulances to FM Muttaqi. This is part of the larger gift of 20 ambulances and other medical equipment reflecting our long-standing support for the Afghan people.\" During the bilateral meeting between Jaishankar and Muttaqi, the EAM emphasised that, as a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in Afghanistan's development and progress.

When asked if those included Abdullah Barghouti, Hassan Salama, Ibrahim Hamed and Abbas al-Sayyed, he replied, “Yes. These are the most prominent names that the occupation always rejects.”\n\nMarwan Barghouti, 66, is widely popular and considered a potentially unifying Palestinian political figure. He’s serving five life sentences in an Israeli jail.\n\nAs the UN prepares for resumption of aid to Gaza this weekend, officials said Friday that they need Israeli officials to open additional border crossings, provide safe movement for aid workers and civilians who are returning to parts of the strip that had just recently been under heavy firing.\n\nStephane Dujarric, the UN spokesperson, told reporters that humanitarian partners have already begun to deploy an ambulance as well as fuel, medical items and other critical items through the Kerem Shalom crossing, where they also offloaded incoming supplies to replenish stocks. \n\nHe added that the ceasefire announcement has “generated a new hope for relief at last.”\n\nUN officials and Israeli authorities have been engaging in a series of discussions and negotiations in Jerusalem over the last 24 hours about the volume of aid humanitarians can bring in and through which entry points.\n\nThe International Criminal Court is seeking the arrest of Netanyahu and his former defense minister for allegedly using starvation as a method of war.\n\nA UN official says Israel has given the green light for United Nations authorities to begin delivering aid into Gaza starting Sunday.\n\nThe official was granted anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.\n\nThe aid will include the 170,000 metric tons that have already been positioned in the pipeline in neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt as humanitarian officials awaited permission from Israeli forces to restart their work.\n\nIn recent months, the UN and its humanitarian partners have only been able to deliver 20% of the aid needed to address the dire situation in the Gaza Strip, according to UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher.\n\nFollowing the announcement Wednesday of a ceasefire deal, he said Thursday that all entry points to Gaza must be opened to deliver aid at “a much, much greater scale.”\n\nIn a joint statement Friday, the leaders of France, Germany and the U.K. paid tribute to President Donald Trump’s leadership on the ceasefire plan, the planned release of hostages and the resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nThey also praised the diplomatic efforts of the mediators, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey.\n\n“It is now of utmost importance that all parties implement their obligations in full and without delay,” the statement said. The countries added that the U.N. Security Council should give its full backing to the plan and support its implementation.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin praised U.S. President Donald Trump for helping broker a ceasefire deal for Gaza and said that Russia stands ready to help implement it.\n\nPutin said that if the agreement is successfully implemented, it would mark a major achievement and a “historic event.”\n\nHe noted that Russia has close ties with the Palestinian authority and could help carry out the deal if asked.\n\n“Bearing in mind the level of trust that exists between Russia and our Arab friends, and especially Palestinian friends, of course, I believe our participation could be in demand,” Putin told reporters on a trip to Tajikistan.\n\nPutin noted that he decided to postpone a Russia-Arab summit in Moscow that had been scheduled for Oct. 15 in order “not to interfere with the process that has been initiated by President Trump.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, has tweeted that Trump “deserves it.”\n\n“The Nobel Committee talks about peace. President @realDonaldTrump makes it happen. The facts speak for themselves. President #Trump deserves it,” he wrote on X on Friday.\n\nTrump was passed over for the prestigious award on Friday despite jockeying from his fellow Republicans, various world leaders and — most vocally — himself.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the prize.\n\nA relative of one of the Israeli hostages believed to have died in captivity says the family hopes his body will be returned for burial as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal, even as the pain and disappointment of the past two years temper their optimism.\n\nStephen Brisley’s brother, Yossi, is believed to have died in an airstrike in January 2024. His sister, Lianne Sharabi, and her two teenage daughters were killed when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\n“It’s a measured sense of hope in all hostage families,’’ Brisley told The Associated Press from his home in South Wales.\n\n“It’s a guarded optimism because it’s the kind of optimism that’s born out of heartbreaking experience. We hold our hope lightly because we’ve had our hopes dashed before,” he said. “It still feels like a long way between the announcement of the deal and actually getting Yossi’s body back to bury him.’’\n\nSteve Witkoff, Trump’s top negotiator on the Gaza conflict, said the U.S. military confirmed that Israeli soldiers have pulled back as part of the ceasefire agreement on Friday.\n\n“The 72 hour period to release the hostages has begun,” Witkoff wrote on social media at 7 am ET.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in northern Turkey, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a return to conflict would “come at a very high cost.”\n\n“We are well aware of Israel’s poor track record when it comes to keeping its promises. They have broken their commitments using flimsy excuses and, unfortunately, betrayed the agreements they signed,” Erdogan told the crowd. “Returning to an environment of genocide would come at a very high cost.”\n\nTurkey has frequently accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, an accusation Israel denies.\n\nErdogan stressed the importance of swiftly getting humanitarian aid to Gaza, adding that Turkish ships were docked at a port in Egypt, waiting to deliver aid.\n\nIn an interview with the AP, the International Committee of the Red Cross says the expected hostage and prisoner release will be more challenging than previous ones given the scale and speed of the operation.\n\nChristian Cardon, chief spokesman for the ICRC, said Friday that while the group is expected to play a role as hostages are released from Gaza and Palestinian prisoners from Israel, it has not been given details in terms of when, how or where the releases would occur.\n\n“Our colleagues are preparing themselves for all possible scenarios,” said Cardon.\n\nHe said that the terms of the deal, which call for the hostages to be released from Gaza within 72 hours, was an “extremely” tight time frame.\n\nThe ICRC was involved in prisoner and hostage releases in the two previous ceasefires during the war.\n\nPalestinians who previously left Gaza will be able to return for the first time, according to an Israeli security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nPalestinians from Gaza who left the besieged Gaza Strip during the war or before the war started will be able to return to Gaza after undergoing security checks from Israel and Egypt. The official did not provide details on when Palestinians hoping to return to Gaza can begin to do so.\n\nThe measure is part of humanitarian policies that will be implemented as part of the ceasefire, the official said. Israel will revert to the same humanitarian measures that were in place during the previous ceasefire in January 2025, which include the entry of 600 trucks per day of humanitarian aid carrying food, medical supplies, shelter, cooking gas and fuel for essential services.\n\nItaly’s Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said Friday that Italian police will resume patrolling the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt next week, under the ceasefire plan agreed between Israel and Hamas.\n\n“In compliance with the Trump agreement, the Rafah Crossing Point will be opened in two directions alternately, outbound to Egypt and inbound to Gaza, on Oct. 14, 2025,” Crosetto said in a statement.\n\nThe Italian minister added that Israel is working to restore the crossing’s infrastructure as quickly as possible.\n\nCrosetto also said about 600 trucks carrying humanitarian aid will flow into Gaza from other crossings every day.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is about to achieve one of its central goals in the two-year war — the return of the hostages.\n\n“Hamas agreed to the deal only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck,” Netanyahu said on Friday. “Hamas agreed to the deal after Trump’s plan, which I agreed to with the President in Washington.”\n\n“I promised the families of the hostages, and I also promised you, citizens of Israel, that we will return everyone, without exception. We promised and we are fulfilling it,” he said.\n\nUnder the ceasefire plan agreed with Hamas, all 48 hostages still in captivity are expected to be released. Israel believes around 20 of them are alive.\n\nNetanyahu added that Israel would continue with its demilitarization of Hamas after the return of the hostages.\n\nIsrael publishes list of Palestinian prisoners to be released under ceasefire plan\n\nUnder the ceasefire deal, Israeli troops are withdrawing to new positions in Gaza — a process already underway — and all 48 hostages still in captivity are expected to be released. Israel believes around 20 of them are alive.\n\nIn exchange, Israel will release around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. A list of those prisoners published Friday by Israel did not include high-profile prisoner Marwan Barghouti, a popular Palestinian leader who has spend more than two decades imprisoned for deadly attacks.\n\nLarge crowds of people who had gathered in Wadi Gaza in central Gaza in the morning started walking north after the military’s announcement that a ceasefire had taken effect at noon local time. \n\nEarlier, Palestinians reported heavy shelling in parts of Gaza throughout Friday morning.\n\n“We want to go back,” said Fayez AlMajdoub, who was displaced from northern Gaza. \"I want to go and make sure my home is still there. That’s what I want to know.”\n\nIsraeli army spokesman says movement to northern Gaza is now allowed\n\nThe spokesman, Avichay Adraee, said that Palestinians can now return to northern Gaza by two roads, though he warned against approaching areas in northern Gaza including Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahiya, Al-Shujaiyya, and areas where troops are still present.\n\nElsewhere in southern Gaza, Adraee warned Palestinians against approaching the Rafah crossing the philadelphi corridor and all areas where troops are present in Khan Younis.\n\nHe spoke Friday as the Israeli military said the ceasefire with Hamas has taken effect.\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Gaza residents reported intensified shelling after Israel’s Cabinet approved the ceasefire plan.\n\nIn central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp, Mahmoud Sharkawy, one of the many people sheltering there after being displaced from Gaza City, said artillery shelling intensified in the early hours.\n\n“The shelling has significantly increased today,” said Sharkawy, adding that low flying military aircraft had been flying over central Gaza.\n\nIn northern Gaza, two Gaza City residents told The Associated Press that bombing went on in the early hours, mostly artillery shelling.\n\nThe managing director of Shifa hospital, Rami Mhanna, said the shelling in southern and northern Gaza City had not stopped following the Israeli Cabinet’s approval of the ceasefire plan.\n\nThe troops will help support and monitor the ceasefire deal in Gaza as part of a team that includes partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players, U.S. officials said Thursday.\n\n The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that were not authorized for release, said US Central Command is going to establish a “civil-military coordination center” in Israel that will help facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid as well as logistical and security assistance into the territory.","summary":"The Latest: Israeli military says ceasefire in Gaza has taken effect","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/11th-ld-writethru-19-1.500302265","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews%2F2025-10-10%2Ftdmpsz4p%2Fpreview.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:02:57","author":"President Trump","authors":["President Trump"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":0.002},{"id":368178724,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, October 10","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode October 10, 2025 38:25 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, October 10 \n Gaza, Donald Trump, Economy \n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Gaza, Donald Trump, Economy","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6382596820112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/7a733667-e7b5-461b-8d45-8fcb5c09c872/93161354-49fa-4554-9f1e-1469b00992db/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-11 00:00:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":368179868,"title":"Firings of federal workers begin as White House seeks to pressure Democrats in government shutdown (World)","text":"The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started, an attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown dragged into a 10th day.\n\nRuss Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said on the social media site X that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government.\n\nIn a court filing, the budget office said well over 4,000 employees would be fired, though it noted that the funding situation was “fluid and rapidly evolving.”\n\nThe firings would hit the hardest at the departments of the Treasury, which would lose over 1,400 employees; Health and Human Services, with a loss of over 1,100; and Housing and Urban Development, set to lose over 400. The departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, and Homeland Security and the Environmental Protection Agency were all set to fire hundreds of more employees. It was not clear which particular programs would be affected.\n\nThe aggressive move by Trump’s budget office goes far beyond what usually happens in a government shutdown and escalates an already politically toxic dynamic between the White House and Congress. Talks to end the shutdown are almost nonexistent.\n\nTypically, federal workers are furloughed but restored to their jobs once the shutdown ends, traditionally with back pay. Some 750,000 employees are expected to be furloughed during the shutdown, officials have said.\n\nDemocrats — and some Republicans — criticize the administration’s actions\n\nIn comments to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday night, Trump said many people would be losing their jobs, and that the firings would be focused on Democrat-oriented areas, though he didn’t explain exactly what that meant.\n\n“It’ll be a lot, and we’ll announce the numbers over the next couple of days,” he said. “But it’ll be a lot of people.”\n\nTrump said that, going forward, “We’re going to make a determination, do we want a lot? And I must tell you, a lot of them happen to be Democrat oriented.”\n\n“These are people that the Democrats wanted, that, in many cases, were not appropriate,” he said of federal employees, eventually adding, “Many of them will be fired.”\n\nStill, some leading Republicans were highly critical of the administration's actions.\n\n“I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought’s attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown,” said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the chair of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, who blamed the federal closure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nAlaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the announcement “poorly timed” and “yet another example of this administration’s punitive actions toward the federal workforce.”\n\nFor his part, Schumer said the blame for the layoffs rested with Trump.\n\n“Let’s be blunt: nobody’s forcing Trump and Vought to do this,” Schumer said. “They don’t have to do it; they want to. They’re callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.”\n\nNotice of firings has already begun at several federal agencies\n\nThe White House had previewed its tactics shortly before the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, telling all federal agencies to submit their reduction-in-force plans to the budget office for its review.\n\nIt said reduction-in-force plans could apply to federal programs whose funding would lapse in a government shutdown, are otherwise not funded and are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”\n\nOn Friday, the Education Department was among the agencies hit by new layoffs, a department spokesperson said. A labor union for the agency’s workers said the administration is laying off almost all employees below the director level at the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, while fewer than 10 employees were being terminated at the agency’s Office of Communications and Outreach.\n\nNotices of firings have also taken place at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which leads federal efforts to reduce risk to the nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure, according to DHS, where CISA is housed. The agency has been a frequent Trump target over its work to counter misinformation about the 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic. DHS said the layoffs were “part of getting CISA back on mission.”\n\nFederal health workers were also being fired, though an HHS spokesman did not say how many or which agencies were being hit hardest. A spokesperson for the EPA, which also has an unspecified number of layoffs, blamed the Democrats for the firings and said they can vote to reopen the government anytime.\n\nThreats of more cuts across the federal workforce\n\nAn official for the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents federal workers and is suing the Trump administration over the firings, said in a legal filing Friday that the Treasury Department is set to issue layoff notices to 1,300 employees.\n\nThe AFGE asked a federal judge to halt the firings, calling the action an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.\n\n“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats have tried to call the administration’s bluff, arguing the firings could be illegal, and had seemed bolstered by the fact that the White House had not immediately pursued the layoffs once the shutdown began.\n\nBut Trump signaled earlier this week that job cuts could be coming in “four or five days.”\n\n“If this keeps going on, it’ll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said Tuesday.\n\nWorkforce cuts appear unhelpful to bipartisan shutdown negotiations\n\nMeanwhile, the halls of the Capitol were quiet on Friday, the 10th day of the shutdown, with both the House and the Senate out of Washington and both sides digging in for a protracted shutdown fight. Senate Republicans have tried repeatedly to cajole Democratic holdouts to vote for a stopgap bill to reopen the government, but Democrats have refused as they hold out for a firm commitment to extend health care benefits.\n\nSome Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that Vought's threats of mass layoffs have been unhelpful to bipartisan talks.\n\nAnd the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, said in a statement that the “shutdown does not give Trump or Vought new, special powers” to lay off workers.\n\n“This is nothing new, and no one should be intimidated by these crooks,” she added.\n\nStill, there was no sign that the top Democratic and Republican Senate leaders were even talking about a way to solve the impasse. Instead, Senate Majority Leader John Thune continued to try to peel away centrist Democrats who may be willing to cross party lines.\n\n“It’s time for them to get a backbone,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday.\n\nThe Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan organization that tracks federal service, says more than 200,000 civil servants have left since the start of this administration in January due to earlier firings, retirements and deferred resignation offers.\n\n“These unnecessary and misguided reductions in force will further hollow out our federal government, rob it of critical expertise and hobble its capacity to effectively serve the public,” said the organization’s president and CEO, Max Stier.","summary":"The White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started, an attempt by President Donald Trump's administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown dragged into a 10th day.

But now, one of Türkiye’s most influential right-wing leaders is calling for a turn East – toward Russia and China. His proposal may mark the country’s clearest ideological break with Atlanticism since joining the Alliance.\n\nIn September, Türkiye’s political landscape was shaken by a statement that many experts called sensational and potentially transformative. Devlet Bahceli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and a long-time ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan within the People’s Alliance, proposed the establishment of a strategic trilateral alliance involving Türkiye, Russia, and China to counter the “US-Israel evil coalition.”\n\nBahceli emphasized that such an alliance is “the most suitable option, considering reason, diplomacy, the spirit of politics, geographical conditions, and the strategic environment of the new century.” The proposal extends far beyond the usual nationalist agenda, positioning Türkiye as a player capable of initiating new formats of international cooperation.\n\nTo grasp the importance of this statement, we must note the historical context. Turkish pan-Turkism has traditionally been oriented toward the West, and nationalists were seen as staunch defenders of the pro-Atlantic course. In this light, Bahçeli’s call for an alliance with Moscow and Beijing marks a symbolic break from that tradition, reflecting growing distrust toward NATO and the US within Türkiye’s political landscape.\n\nBahceli’s comments are not random. Over the past few years, he has steadily ramped up his criticism of the West, advocating for Türkiye’s sovereign development “beyond blocs and alliances.” But this is the first time he has explicitly named Russia and China as preferred partners.\n\nReactions inside Türkiye were mixed. Right-wing circles called Bahceli’s words “revolutionary,” while leftists saw them as confirmation of a broader anti-Western consensus. Internationally, the statement underscored Ankara’s growing distance from Western power centers and its gradual rhetorical shift toward the East and Greater Eurasia.\n\nShortly afterward, Erdogan made a cautious comment, saying he was “not fully familiar” with Bahceli's initiative but adding, “Whatever is good, let it happen.” The ambiguity is typical for Erdogan, who avoids publicly rejecting the ideas of key allies while keeping his political options open.\n\nOn one hand, the president is wary of provoking open conflict with Western partners, given Türkiye’s economic vulnerabilities. On the other, his comments suggest that Bahçeli’s initiative could serve as leverage – a way to pressure the US and EU by signaling that Ankara might strengthen ties with Moscow and Beijing.\n\nA day later, Bahceli clarified his position, saying, “We know what we are doing. Türkiye should not be the implementer of regional and global projects put forward by others, but rather must be the leading actor of its own unique projects.”\n\nIn other words, Bahçeli not only intensified his anti-Western rhetoric but also asserted Türkiye’s claim to be an independent power center in the emerging multipolar world order. His stance reflects the desire of part of Türkiye’s leadership to move from being a peripheral NATO ally to a pioneer of alternative alliances in Eurasia.\n\nFrom NATO loyalism to Eurasian realism\n\nFor decades, Türkiye was one of NATO’s most loyal allies. Since the Cold War, the Turkish elite believed that integration into Euro-Atlantic structures was the only viable strategy. A world order based on American leadership seemed stable and predictable.\n\nErdogan shared similar views when he first became prime minister in 2002. But as global competition intensified, disagreements with Washington deepened, and multipolar trends gained momentum, he realized that the unipolar system could not last. Türkiye, he concluded, must adapt – and play a role in shaping the new order.\n\nSeen in this light, Bahceli's proposal is more than nationalist fervor. It reflects an understanding among parts of Türkiye’s leadership that the country’s future lies in greater strategic autonomy and in building ties with alternative centers of power. His words echo those within Erdoğan’s circle who believe Türkiye can assert itself only through closer engagement with Russia and China.\n\nThis shift reveals how Türkiye’s elites have moved from trusting the stability of a Western-centric system to recognizing its limits – and searching for new frameworks in which Ankara can act as a key player rather than a subordinate.\n\nRedefining Türkiye’s place in the world\n\nBahceli’s remarks highlight deep shifts within Turkish nationalist circles and Ankara’s growing readiness to reconsider its global role. He argues that neither China nor Russia is Türkiye’s enemy, despite efforts by Western ideologues to claim otherwise. Instead, he sees the West as the true obstacle – determined to prevent Türkiye from becoming an independent power center and confining it to a role of “watchdog” in the Middle East.\n\nIn his latest statement, Bahceli stressed the need for a new strategy:\n\n“We believe that Türkiye, located at the center of Eurasia, which is the strategic focus of the 21st century, should pursue multidimensional and long-term policies aimed at strengthening regional peace and stability and developing cooperation opportunities, especially with countries in the Black Sea and Caspian Basin, including Russia, China, and Iran. Considering the changing and complex structure of international relations, producing permanent and comprehensive solutions to global issues such as terrorism, illegal migration, and climate change is a responsibility that no country can achieve alone.”\n\nEssentially, Bahceli is saying that Türkiye must transcend old constraints and stop being a tool in the hands of external forces. His stance embodies a new paradigm: only through an independent, multilateral, and Eurasian policy can Türkiye become a true architect of regional stability and a major player in the future global order.\n\nThe end of oscillation\n\nTürkiye has long oscillated between Atlantic alignment and independent ambition. These cycles rarely evolved into a lasting doctrine. But the current geopolitical environment is forcing Ankara to make a choice.\n\nEconomic dependency, regional instability, and Israel’s aggressive behavior – including attacks on Iran and Qatar – have created a sense of urgency. In Ankara, some now fear that Türkiye itself could become a target.\n\nGlobally, the old unipolar order is losing balance, and an alliance with Russia and China may offer Türkiye not guarantees, but strategic advantages – especially in securing its autonomy and status as an independent power center.\n\nAt the UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump urged Erdogan to stop buying Russian oil and even floated bringing Türkiye into the anti-Russia sanctions regime. For Ankara, that would mean economic damage and deeper dependence on the West – a risk the leadership is no longer willing to accept.\n\nBahceli's initiative, and Erdogan’s carefully measured reaction, mark a pivotal moment. Türkiye is beginning to institutionalize its search for an alternative political philosophy – one grounded in multipolarity, strategic pragmatism, and a redefined vision of its place in the 21st century.","summary":"A bold call for a Türkiye–Russia–China alliance marks the deepest ideological shift in Turkish nationalism since the Cold War \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/626210-from-natos-flank-to-eurasias-core/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.10/article/68e947bd2030272750617a63.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 23:55:08","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.355},{"id":368174888,"title":"Trump announces 100% tariffs on China on rare earth export restrictions","text":"US President Donald Trump has announced 100% tariffs on China, as the global trade war gets reignited.Trump said Friday he would hit China with a 100% additional tariff and impose new export controls on critical software products after Beijing placed sweeping restrictions on the export of rare-earth minerals.The new measures would take effect November 1, 2025, Trump said in a Truth Social post, which came after earlier threats of retaliation sparked a market selloff that sent the S&P 500 to its worst day since April..China bolsters export controls on rare-earth industry.Pentagon buys rare earths stake to tackle China’s dominance.How rare are rare earths?

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy RUTH FRANCIS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER and SARAH PACKER, CHIEF SHOWBIZ REPORTER (GLOBAL) \n Published:00:31 BST, 11 October 2025 |Updated:00:46 BST, 11 October 2025 \n\nRobbie Williams has never been afraid to speak his mind and now the pop legend has confessed he pulled the plug on his album release after realising he'd be going up against Taylor Swift.\nAt a comeback gig at London's Dingwalls, the Angels hitmaker told fans he postponed Britpop after finding out Taylor had locked in her release date and admitted there was no point trying to compete with the world's biggest star.\n'We're all pretending it's not about Taylor Swift, but it f***ing is,' Robbie told the crowd, according to The Sun. 'You can't compete with that one, that's the truth.'\nRobbie, 51, who currently shares the record for 15 UK No.1 albums with The Beatles, confessed he had one thing on his mind: beating that record. \nHe continued: 'I want 16 No.1 albums and you know Taylor then decided to put her album out the week before me and I just went for \"for f***s sake\"'.\nRobbie went on to joke that the decision was 'selfish,' but insisted: 'How many times in your life do you get to have the most No.1 albums the UK has ever had?'\n\nRobbie Williams has never been afraid to speak his mind and now the pop legend has confessed he moved his album release after realising he'd be going up against Taylor Swift \n\nAt an exclusive gig in London, the Angels hitmaker told fans he postponed Britpop after finding out Taylor had locked in her release date and admitted there was no point trying to compete with the world's biggest star\nThe singer performed both his debut Life Thru a Lens and his new record Britpop in full during the sold-out show, with strict security ensuring fans stayed in the moment by banning phones. \nThe new album, inspired by late '90s and early noughties Britpop, is expected to play a key role in Robbie's next big passion project - a stage musical about his life. \nRobbie also opened up about his 13-year-old daughter Teddy's budding songwriting talent, revealing she's been composing heartfelt tracks since she was six. \nThe star also reflected on embracing labels like ADHD and neurodivergence, saying: 'I'm so glad those things exist - at least I don't feel like a freak now.'\nThe Daily Mail has contacted Robbie's representatives for comment.\nIt comes after Robbie admitted for the first time how he has been secretly living with Tourette's syndrome. \nThe pop superstar claims his Tourette's are 'intrusive', with outbursts kept inside, yet his thoughts are so intense that not even performing for tens of thousands of screaming fans can drown them out. \nDiagnosed with ADHD and having battled several addictions since rising to fame in the early Nineties, the Angels hitmaker has endured multiple spells in rehab, notably for alcohol and drugs. \n\n'We're all pretending it's not about Taylor Swift, but it f***ing is,' Robbie told the crowd. 'You can't compete with that one, that's the truth.' \n\nRobbie, 51, who currently shares the record for 15 UK No.1 albums with The Beatles , confessed he had one thing on his mind: beating that record. \n\nHe continued: 'I want 16 No.1 albums and you know Taylor then decided to put her album out the week before me and I just went for \"for f***s sake\"'\nSpeaking on the first episode of the new season of Paul Whitehouse and Dr Mine Conkbayir's podcast I'm ADHD! No You're Not, Robbie admitted he recently took an autism test, which came back negative but revealed 'autistic traits' including anxiety triggered by leaving his safe space, his bed. \nin the deeply personal chat, the singer also admitted he's still terrified of touring despite playing in front of sold-out stadiums and arenas for decades as a solo singer, and before that, as part of boyband, Take That. \nIt follows the popularity of his Oscar-nominated film Better Man, which depicted Robbie's struggles with fame, addiction, and impostor syndrome, illustrated by his character being portrayed as a CGI chimpanzee. \nOn his latest health condition, Robbie said: 'I've just realised that I have Tourettes, but they don't come out. \n\nRobbie went on to joke that the decision was 'selfish,' but insisted: 'How many times in your life do you get to have the most No.1 albums the UK has ever had?'\n\nThe singer performed both his debut Life Thru a Lens and his new record Britpop in full during the sold-out show, with strict security ensuring fans stayed in the moment by banning phones\n\n'They are intrusive thoughts that happen, I was just walking down the road the other day, and I realised that these intrusive thoughts are inside Tourettes. It just doesn't come out. \n'Not only that, you would think that a stadium full of people professing their love to you would work as (a distraction), but whatever it is inside me cannot hear it. I cannot take it in.' \nTourette syndrome is an inherited, neurological condition which can be characterised by involuntary sounds and movements called tics. \nThe condition has also impacted fellow chart star Lewis Capaldi, which was one of the reasons why he took a hiatus from music back in 2023 after his tics prevented him from completing a performance at Glastonbury. \n\nWHAT IS TOURETTE'S SYNDROME?\n\n Tourette's syndrome is a neurological condition characterised by a combination of involuntary noises and movements called tics.\nIt usually starts during childhood and continues into adulthood. Tics can be either be vocal or physical.\nIn many cases Tourette's syndrome runs in families and it's often associated with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nTourette's syndrome is named after the French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome and its symptoms in the 19th century. \nThere's no cure for Tourette's syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. \nSource: NHS Choices \nThe BeatlesRobbie WilliamsLondon\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRobbie Williams rants 'you can't compete' with Taylor Swift as he pushes back album release to avoid clash with The Life Of A Showgirl\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Janet Mills appeared to announce the launch of her campaign for the Senate on X on Friday, but then quickly deleted the post. In a since-deleted announcement video, the 77-year-old Maine governor asked, \"Folks, do you want Democrats to take back the Senate? Well, I’m Gov. Janet Mills, and I’m running to flip Maine’s Senate seat blue.\" In the video, Mills took aim at incumbent Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, saying she has \"sold out Maine and bowed down to special interests and to Donald Trump, but that ends now.\" SUSAN COLLINS FIRES BACK AT SCHUMER-LINKED PAC ADS ACCUSING HER OF STOCK ‘GREED’ The video directed supporters to donate to an ActBlue page that has also since been deleted. On the donation page, Mills touted her bona fides, saying, \"I’ve spent my career standing up for Maine families as prosecutor, Attorney General, and Governor. I’ve taken on Big Pharma, expanded health care access, and took Donald Trump to court – and won.\" After the posts were deleted, reactions started to flood in online. \"In a now deleted tweet at 4:30pm on a Friday before a holiday weekend, Janet Mills confirms she is in fact running for Senate … Some poor digital staffer is about to get fired!\" posted National Republican Senatorial Committee staffer Joanna Rodriguez. A progressive political commentator named Jack Cocchiarella commented, \"If you thought democratic politics was missing geriatric candidates with no charisma, wait until you meet 77 year old Janet Mills Chuck Schumer’s pick for Senate. She posted this launch video today then deleted it after two hours.\" Mills’ announcement has been long anticipated. She is seen as the favored candidate by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The top Democrat in the Senate urged Mills to run and sees her as the best candidate to defeat Collins, the only Republican senator up for re-election next year in a state the Democrats carried in the presidential election. A Collins defeat would be essential for the Democrats to have any chance of winning back the Senate majority. DEM GOVERNOR'S BURIED COCAINE INVESTIGATION DOCS HIT WITH OFFICIAL INQUIRY AS QUESTIONS SWIRL OVER SENATE RUN But before she reaches the general election, Mills first has to navigate a likely competitive and divisive primary among a crowded field of contenders that includes a much younger rising star on the left who's backed by longtime progressive champion Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mills, a former elected county district attorney and former state lawmaker, made history serving as Maine's first female attorney general. She later won election in 2018 as Maine's first female governor, and, in 2022, she comfortably defeated former Republican Gov. Paul LePage by double digits to win re-election. While she will be considered the frontrunner for the Democratic Senate nomination, thanks in part to her vast name recognition in blue-leaning Maine, she could face a serious challenge from 41-year-old Graham Platner, a U.S. Marine, Army veteran and oyster farmer who launched his campaign in August. Platner, who hauled in over $3 million in fundraising during the first six weeks after declaring his candidacy, is backed by Sanders, the two-time Democratic presidential nomination runner-up, who recently stopped in Maine to headline a campaign rally. In a warning to Mills, Sanders said on social media last week that \"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins.\" FOUR KEY SENATE SEATS THE GOP AIMS TO FLIP IN NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary,\" Sanders added. Other candidates vying for the Democratic Senate nomination include Dan Kleban, a co-founder of the Maine Beer Co., and former congressional staffer Jordan Wood, who raked in roughly $3 million during the July-September third quarter of fundraising. Phil Rench, a former senior engineer for Elon Musk’s SpaceX, is running as an independent candidate. Collins first won election to the Senate in 1996 and won comfortable double-digit re-elections in 2002, 2008 and 2014.

Tails may be broken, stripped to the bone (“degloved”), even torn off. “Steer tailing” is not a standard ranching practice anywhere in the U.S., and is already banned in Alameda and Contra Costa counties (1993 and 1994), and Nebraska (2008).\n\nPassage of a California ban would likely result in a U.S. Charro Federation rule change banning “steer tailing” nationwide.

Drawing on a well of constitutional provisions and court precedents, government lawyers have sought to justify deploying the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. Some legal experts say the president has the law on his side, while others worry Trump is threatening state sovereignty. Democratic leaders have responded with outrage and indignation to Trump's attempts to send federal troops to their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established \"ICE-free zones\" across Chicago to prevent federal agents from using any city-owned property in their ongoing operations. Conservative critics have compared this action and similar opposition to the Trump administration from Democratic leaders to attempts to nullify federal law, hearkening back to the 19th century. \"Illinois's own Abraham Lincoln had some ideas about how to deal with this John C. Calhoun-esque ‘nullification,’\" attorney and conservative commentator Josh Hammer wrote on X. PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings. \"This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic,\" Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress. The high court said in that case that allowing a state to impose such a burden on a federal institution would violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal law trumps state law. The need for the National Guard During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers. \"For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,\" said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department. The rebellion statute that Trump is using to federalize the National Guard, which governors have shared authority over, can be invoked in those situations, McArthur argued. He also said it was the government's position that the courts had no say over Trump's assessment of the need for the military. Blackman made a similar point. \"The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it,\" Blackman said. States are ‘frustrating’ immigration enforcement In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution’s take care clause to \"take care\" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws. In Neagle, a U.S. marshal shot and killed a person who attacked a Supreme Court justice, and the Supreme Court found that the State of California could not prosecute the marshal for murder since the marshal was protecting a federal officer. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE Blackman said that states have for years been \"frustrating\" federal immigration enforcement and that these blue-state lawsuits trying to challenge the National Guard’s presence were an instance of that. He said the states' resistance did not \"quite rise to the level of nullification,\" like when states in the South tried to block integration of segregated schools, but that it was \"in the ballpark.\" If states were to defy court orders, that could escalate matters, Blackman said. The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement. Policing falls under ‘state's responsibilities' Like Oregon and Illinois, Matt Cavedon, a director at the CATO Institute, said the 10th Amendment is also in play in these cases and that it implies that the Trump administration cannot typically take over a state's law enforcement responsibilities. Cavedon also said it was unusual, in his view, that a Republican government would adopt a more expanded view of federal power. \"It's not usually conservatives who are arguing that there are just vast unenumerated federal powers belonging to the president, certainly in the domestic context,\" Cavedon told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cavedon said the events in the two states are \"really core issues of public security and safety, which are at the heart of what a state's responsibilities are.\" Oregon and Illinois leaders have made similar claims that nothing extraordinary was playing out crime-wise to warrant National Guard intervention. \"I think the 10th Amendment answers a question: Any powers that are not conferred on the federal government are reserved to the states, respectively,\" Cavedon added.","summary":"President Donald Trump&apos;s National Guard deployment in Oregon and Illinois faces court challenges as experts debate federal authority versus state sovereignty.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/long-held-scotus-precedents-could-undercut-portland-chicago-national-guard-lawsuits","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/f158c403-trump-national-guard-portland.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 23:26:21","author":"Ashley Oliver","authors":["Ashley Oliver"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.213},{"id":368169046,"title":"How Major US Stock Indexes Fared Oct. 10","text":"A monthslong calm on Wall Street shattered, and U.S. stocks tumbled after President Donald Trump threatened to crank tariffs higher on China.\n\nThe S&P 500 sank 2.7 percent Friday in its worst day since April.

And I hope you know, Your Excellency, that you can count on us.”\n\nThe announcement of the deal comes just weeks after Trump signed an executive order for the US to guarantee the security of Qatar — a significant commitment to a non-NATO, Arab ally. Israel had bombed Qatar several days earlier as part of an operation against Hamas officials living in Doha. But sources told CNN that the plan to build the Qatari facility has been in the works for several years, dating back to the previous administration.\n\nA US official said the agreement with Qatar is routine and something the Air Force has done for decades with other partner nations including Germany and Singapore.\n\nHegseth later on Friday wrote in a post on X, “The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today’s announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft,” emphasizing there will be no Qatari owned base in the US.\n\nBut a close ally of Donald Trump, far-right activist Laura Loomer, has posted on X more than a dozen times since the deal was announced calling it “outrageous,” “an abomination,” and a “betrayal.”\n\nThe Qatar facility specifically has been in the works for several years; a 2022 announcement from Mountain Home Air Force Base, published while President Joe Biden was in office, provided the results of an environmental assessment looking at the “potential impacts associated with the beddown of a US-led Qatar Emiri Air Force F-15QA squadron” at the base.\n\nThe “beddown” is facilities for the training squadron’s operations, the US official said, providing space for the pilots to train, brief, do their scheduling, and more. The countries who send pilots as part of this program provide the US funds through foreign military sales to build the facilities, the official added, and the military hires community labor around the bases to build them out.\n\nThe final environmental impact report published in 2022 said it was for “the beddown of 12 F-15QA permanently assigned QEAF aircraft and associated equipment, use of the Mountain Home Air Force Base airfield and special use airspace and military training routes for training, use of defensive countermeasures and ordnance, approximately 300 additional QEAF and United States Air Force personnel, and the construction and modification of facilities and infrastructure needed to support the beddown.”\n\n“We further welcome today’s signing of the letter of acceptance establishing a Qatar Emiri Air Force facility at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” al Thani said. “This step strengthens interoperabilities, enhances joint readiness, and advances our shared defense goals. Mr. Secretary, together we will continue to deepen this strategic partnership in pursuit of lasting peace and shared security.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Trump’s comment raises questions about the independence of federal prosecutors and the appearance of political motivations behind high-profile investigations.\n\nWhat To Know \n\nWhile speaking with CNN, Bacon was asked about Trump’s remarks, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue charges against several political opponents, naming former FBI Director James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and James.\n\nTrump wrote in part, “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility.” The president then followed up with praise for Bondi, stating she is “doing a GREAT job” despite apparent frustration at the pace of prosecutions.\n\nBacon said, “I think it was a mistake, as I already mentioned. Him putting out these demands for indictments—I don’t think it’s right. I think it’s again, it’s unseemly. The presidents don’t normally do this. And to me…I think it’s foolish.”\n\nThe Nebraska Republican continued: “He’s hurting his own case by making these demands, because I guarantee you, Director Comey and James here… are going to use his words against him for part of their defense during these cases. So, he’s undermined his own demands by making his demands public like that.”\n\n“It undermines the perception of fair justice,” Bacon added. \n\nTrump’s message followed the resignation and replacement of U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert with Lindsey Halligan, who presented evidence that resulted in a grand jury indictment of James on bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. James and her attorney have denied the allegations, labeling the investigation as political retaliation.\n\nBacon has recently shown consistent public criticism of Trump. He is not seeking reelection in 2026, making his comments less likely to be motivated by electoral considerations.\n\nRepresentative Don Bacon (R-NE) can be seen arriving for a House Republican conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol on May 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat People Are Saying \n\nDave Aronberg, former Palm Beach County State Attorney, to Newsweek on Friday: “President Trump’s social media post directing his Attorney General to prosecute James and Comey as payback, along with the firing of Erik Siebert and the quick appointment of Lindsey Halligan, give the defense teams strong arguments for vindictive prosecution. The fact that no career prosecutor in the office apparently wanted to touch these cases, and that Trump’s brand new Acting U.S. Attorney had to go it alone, provides further evidence that this was done to settle personal scores against old foes.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Newsweek last month: “President Trump appreciates all Attorney General Bondi is doing to Make America Safe Again. The president wants justice and accountability for the many corrupt criminals and politicians who weaponized our justice system against him and his millions of patriotic supporters.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe grand jury indictment formally initiates criminal proceedings against James. If convicted, she could face significant penalties—up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine for each count, according to the DOJ. James has denied all wrongdoing.","summary":"Trump’s public calls for action against political adversaries have drawn criticism from lawmakers and legal scholars alike.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-rips-trump-for-foolish-move-before-letitia-james-indictment-10864093","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2213144866.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-10 23:14:31","author":"Anna Commander","authors":["Anna Commander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":368179382,"title":"Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado has been an outspoken supporter of Trump","text":"María Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in promoting democratic rights. \n\nMachado has hailed Donald Trump as a 'visionary' and the 'biggest opportunity' for regime change in Venezuela. \n\nShe operates in hiding after Nicolás Maduro declared victory despite her chosen candidate winning the presidential elections by a landslide. \n\nMachado has publicly supported US military actions and sanctions against Venezuela, believing they are crucial to weakening Maduro's government. \n\nShe has called for further US pressure on Maduro's government, which she claims is close to collapse, despite the US president stating he is 'not talking' about regime change.","summary":"","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/maria-corina-machado-nobel-prize-winner-b2843550.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/10/01/Pictures_of_the_Week_Latin_America_and_Caribbean_Photo_Gallery_82374.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3qHyDUYc-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-10 23:13:10","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.359},{"id":368175766,"title":"Trump's First Comment After Maria Corina Machado's Nobel Peace Prize Win: 'She Won It for Me'","text":"US President Donald Trump spoke on Friday with Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado shortly after the 2025 award announcement. He said Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado called him to say she accepted the award in his honor. “She said that I’m accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it,” Trump told supporters, adding that she was “very nice” and that he had been “helping her along the way.” Earlier, Machado expressed gratitude to Trump in an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais and dedicated her prize “to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause.” The Nobel Committee awarded Machado for her efforts to achieve a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy in Venezuela. The opposition leader has long championed “ballots over bullets,” advocating for democratic reform despite facing personal danger. Machado was forced into hiding during President Nicolas Maduro’s crackdown on dissent, and her advocacy has drawn global attention to human rights issues in the country. US Administration Criticizes Nobel Committee Despite Trump’s private praise, the White House publicly reacted critically to Machado’s win. Communications director Steven Cheung said the committee “proved they place politics over peace.” Other Trump allies, including Richard Grenell, dismissed the Nobel Prize as having “died years ago.” Analysts suggest the committee’s decision may be a deliberate signal to encourage peaceful political change in Venezuela rather than military intervention, indirectly critiquing US policy. Lawmakers Who Nominated Machado Machado was nominated for the Nobel Prize by a group of US lawmakers, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz. In a 2024 letter, they praised her courage, moral leadership, and commitment to democracy, calling her “a most deserving candidate for this prestigious award.” Rubio has previously described Machado as “the personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism,” noting she has never backed down in her fight for a free and democratic Venezuela. Trump has previously spoken publicly about Machado, calling her a “freedom fighter” and emphasizing the need to keep her safe. The president’s administration has also repeatedly denounced Maduro and maintained a strong military presence in the region, in what many view as an effort to counter Venezuelan government influence.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously praised Machado as “the personification of resilience, tenacity and patriotism.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThree sitting U.S. presidents have received the Nobel Peace Prize: Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, Woodrow Wilson in 1919 and Barack Obama in 2009. Former President Jimmy Carter won the award in 2002, two decades after leaving office, and former Vice President Al Gore received it in 2007.\n\nObama, a Democrat and frequent target of Trump’s criticism long before the Republican’s election, earned the prize early in his presidency.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Oct. 10, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWhat to Know\n\nThere had been widespread speculation before the announcement that Trump might win the prize, fueled partly by his own comments and heightened this week by the approval of his Gaza Strip ceasefire plan.\n\nThe first phase, agreed by Israel and Hamas, includes a ceasefire, the release of Israeli captives in exchange for roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The second phase proposes a new governing authority excluding Hamas, a multinational Palestinian-Arab security force, and Arab and Islamic funding for reconstruction, with limited participation from the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn his response on Friday, Trump recognized the magnitude of this week’s Gaza deal and listed out several of the wars that he has had a hand in conflict resolution talks. \n\nThe president often brags about having ended seven other wars, having had a hand in conflict resolution talks between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Thailand and Cambodia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Serbia and Kosovo, a disputed role in mediating an end to the four-day fight between Indian and Pakistan in May and pulling the plug on the so-called “12-Day War” the following month between Iran and Israel after the unprecedented U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites.\n\n“To the mind of most, [Gaza] it’s the most important deal ever made in terms of peace. Monday’s going to be a very big deal when the hostages come back. But I’ve made eight deals, transactions of wars.”\n\n“I’m happy that I saved millions of lives.”\n\nEarlier Friday, the White House reacted sharply after the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, with officials criticizing the committee for overlooking Trump. Communications director Steven Cheung said the Nobel Committee “proved they place politics over peace” by not recognizing Trump, particularly after his administration helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza earlier this week.\n\n“Hopefully, you’re going to have success — or as I call it, everlasting success,” Trump said.\n\nTrump, who has long sought the prestigious honor, has been vocal about his desire for a Nobel Peace Prize throughout both of his presidential terms, recently citing his role in ending global conflicts. The Republican president has also questioned whether the Nobel Committee would ever grant him the award.\n\nTrump also said Friday that this year’s peace prize was “given for 2024, and I was running for office in 2024.” There’s some truth to that — the nomination deadline for the 2025 award was Feb. 1, just a week and a half into his second term.\n\nAlthough Trump received nominations, many came after the deadline. His name was formally submitted in December by Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York, who cited his role in brokering the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations.\n\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shakes hands with President Donald Trump after a news conference in the State Dining Room of the White House, Monday, Sept. 29, 2025, in Washington.

He’s the most consequential president in our lifetime, possibly in our country’s history.”\n\nSurviving Assassination Attempts: ‘Fight, Fight, Fight!’\n\nTrump’s renewed focus on peace has come in the shadow of personal peril. In July 2024, a gunman opened fire at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, narrowly missing the then-former president.\n\nThe shocking scene, captured live on camera, showed Trump being rushed from the stage by Secret Service agents — bloodied, but defiant — as he raised his fist and shouted, “Fight, fight, fight!”\n\nThe phrase quickly became a rallying cry for his supporters and a symbol of resilience. According to 911 calls obtained by Newsmax, agents and attendees scrambled for cover as law enforcement neutralized the attacker, preventing what officials later described as an “attempted assassination of a presidential candidate.”\n\nThen, in September 2024, another would-be assassin — Ryan Routh — was arrested near Trump’s Florida residence. Authorities said Routh was armed and had allegedly been plotting to kill the president, adding to a growing list of threats that have shadowed Trump’s political career.\n\nThe twin incidents, both within months of each other, underscored the volatility of the 2024 campaign and strengthened Trump’s own conviction that his mission is about more than politics. Despite the dangers, he has told supporters that “no bullet can stop the movement to save America.”\n\nA 20-Point Plan and a Turning Point for Peace\n\nAt the heart of Trump’s argument for future recognition is his 20-point peace plan, a sweeping initiative aimed at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — the longest and bloodiest struggle of the modern era.\n\nWhile questions remain about the plan’s implementation, recent breakthroughs have drawn cautious optimism even from former critics. Obama, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, wrote Thursday on X that “we should all be encouraged and relieved that an end to the conflict is within sight.”\n\nThat acknowledgment didn’t go unnoticed by Trump’s allies. Donald Trump Jr. replied: “I’ll finish it for you. ‘Thank you, Donald Trump.'”\n\nVeteran Israeli diplomat Nimrod Novik, who worked on the 1994 Oslo Accords, said Trump’s diplomatic persistence already puts him in the company of Nobel laureates.\n\n“Notwithstanding my skepticism that the second phase of Trump’s 20-point plan ever comes to fruition, I believe that Trump has won his place among Nobel laureates,” Novik told Newsmax.\n\n2025: The Year the Committee Can Right a Wrong?\n\nWhite House officials and allies believe the Nobel Committee has “placed politics over peace,” but say the president’s work will ultimately speak for itself.\n\nAstorino argues the Nobel Committee will have another chance in 2025 to “do the right thing.”\n\n“Trump has restored America’s credibility, contained Iran, and inspired hope across continents,” Astorino said. “He doesn’t just make peace deals; he changes history.”\n\nTrump’s defenders note that hundreds of millions worldwide now benefit from his diplomacy — from normalized relations in the Middle East to nuclear de-escalation in Asia and revived stability in Africa.\n\n“God had bigger plans for him,” Astorino added, likening Trump to “Godzilla marching through Tokyo — knocking down everything that does this nation harm.”\n\nHe added that in the first 200 days of his current term, Trump has “closed the border, made us safer; got the economy humming again; put a bull’s-eye on antisemitism, discrimination, and protecting our children.”\n\n‘Already Earned His Due’\n\nFor now, Trump’s Nobel ambitions remain unfulfilled. But in Washington, few doubt that his international legacy continues to expand — and that 2025 could bring long-overdue recognition.\n\n“The Nobel Committee may have denied him the medal,” Astorino said, “but history already has.”\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general assignment writer for Newsmax covering news, media, and politics. \n\nRelated Stories:\n\nWhite House: Nobel Committee Places ‘Politics Over Peace’\n\nBerlin Lauds Nobel Peace Prize Winner Machado’s ‘Commitment to Democracy’\n\n© 2025 Newsmax.

Of course she’s getting my vote, but there’s not much variety to vote for, is there really? I’m not really into politics myself, but she speaks Irish which is important and a big thing for me. She seems like a lovely woman and she actually spent time with the people in the cafe.”\n\nIn the Priory Market, also in Tallaght, quite a few people had ventured out for the evening to meet Connolly.\n\nDavid Larkin, an older gentleman from the area, said he made the trip out to the food market especially to meet “our future President of Ireland”.\n\n“When you look back at her track record in the Dáil, she speaks up for the ordinary working man and woman, she highlighted a lot of things like the homelessness crisis, the hospital crisis, the mental health crisis, the list is endless,” he said.\n\nAn 8-year-old boy called Samuel made the trip to the market with his mum, Geovanne, because he had seen a video of Connolly doing keepie uppies, and he wanted to get a chance to see her footy skills in real life.\n\nCatherine Connolly speaking to an 8-year-old who came out to see her after seeing a clip of her playing sports.\n\n“It’s his first Presidential election and he’s been taking an interest in the posters around, and then the videos of Connolly doing sports, and I just thought, wouldn’t that be great, to get a chance to see the next President of Ireland before they get elected?” his mum said.\n\nUpstairs in the market, Connolly’s supporting politicians urged members of the audience to go out leafleting for the campaign. \n\nConnolly rambled slightly at the opening of her speech, travelling to a slightly odd tangent about journalists asking questions: \n\n“After the debate the other night, on Monday night, we came straight down at twenty past eleven to 1o or 12 cameramen and journalists asking questions at twenty past eleven, and similarly on Sunday after the debate we came out to more journalists asking more questions,” she said. \n\n“That’s as it should be, but it’s just to explain why I might run out of words, so I go back to my core: ‘Why are we here? What has happened to our country that we look on 16,000 homeless as collateral damage,” she went on to say. \n\nConnolly then spoke about how she doesn’t enjoy being in the spotlight, but that she sees herself as merely a symbol of a movement that is seeking change in this country. \n\nThe Journal / YouTube\n\nHer campaign team said that they were feeling confident but also aware that this is not the time for complacency.\n\nPeople Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, chatting to The Journal on the campaign trail in Tallaght, said that the challenge is to ensure that there is a “high turnout in working class areas”.\n\n“Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael would like it if people stay at home. But I think with Jim Gavin going, that will help the turnout, I think the whole thing is now very clear, there’s a Government candidate, there’s an anti-Government candidate.”\n\nPeople Before Profit and the other left-wing parties supporting Connolly have been highly active online when it comes to getting out her message and sharing clips of her playing football, basketball, and camogie.\n\nMany voters who The Journal spoke to throughout the week brought up the clips of Connolly playing basketball. For those less engaged in the election, it was a moment that broke through because it made their social media timelines.\n\nSome Fine Gael members were markedly worried about how the Connolly campaign’s social media presence is impacting the narrative of the election.\n\nOne representative of the party said that Connolly is being helped by how the various political parties supporting her are running extensive social media operations. \n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The sports stuff, I think, has really helped her. People pay attention to that kind of thing, and then some people supporting her don’t even seem to know what her views are, which, in my view, are in some cases quite extreme,” they said.\n\nShe might pinch your ball or hop on your bike, but she’ll also speak out when required.\nThere has never been a more important time to elect a President who will be independent of Government.\nVótáil Catherine Connolly #1 pic.twitter.com/9bGwdLTsKJ— Connolly for President (@catherinegalway) October 9, 2025 \n\nAnother longtime party member voiced their concern that despite there being multiple controversies attached to Connolly “none of them appear to be sticking”.\n\nHeather Humphreys has been out and about in Dublin city centre meeting volunteers and workers this week, including on Wednesday she visited an inner city Dublin Fire Brigade station.\n\n(She emphasised that she wasn’t seeking an endorsement from firefighters whilst there, but instead wanted to chat about the work they do and the issues they face).\n\nSpeaking to the press she kicked things off by acknowledging that a lot of people will “want to know what my views are”.\n\n“I want to be a President that unifies, that brings people together. We see division in our society and I want to help heal those divisions… I spent a great day on Monday in Northern Ireland, and while we have peace in Northern Ireland, there is still division there, and I would like to build on the work of Mary McAleese,” she elaborated.\n\nInitially, reporters had been told Humphreys wouldn’t be speaking to the media but she made a beeline over to where reporters were standing as soon as she spotted them. \n\nShe later visited An Síol, a community development project in Stoneybatter.\n\nHeather Humphreys with community development workers in Stoneybatter.\n\nShe told the staff that in her time as a Minister one of her office’s had a lock on it and she requested for it to be removed: “I have an open door policy, and it will be the same in the Áras, my door will be open to you,” she told them, which was well received.\n\nMarie Harding, a community development worker with the project, told The Journal afterwards that they are an under-resourced service that is struggling to cater to the demand for their meal delivery service for older people, and their groups for children who don’t get access to out-of-school social activities.\n\nHarding and the other staff also noted that there was little in this week’s budget that would ease those pressures.\n\nOn Thursday, Humphreys was out chatting to workers at the food market on the Mespil Road by the Grand Canal.\n\nShe arrived to applause from Fine Gael members but plenty of other members of the public were happy to chat to her and wish her luck on her campaign. However, there were some notably uncomfortable moments where Humphreys appeared to struggle to make conversation.\n\n(When a group of workers from Amazon bounded over to introduce themselves, she didn’t really have follow-up questions for them, and when a stall owner offered to whip her up a bit of food, she explained that she didn’t really have the time).\n\nThe market was crowded, in fairness, and once she’d the media obligations out of the way Humphreys was able to chat to a young real estate agent who was concerned about apprenticeship pathways, to which she cited her actions as a Minister, and for a warm chat with a couple who had recently become parents. \n\nGenerally, people were happy to meet her and wished her luck.\n\nThe Journal / YouTube\n\nSpeaking to the media at the market, Humphreys appeared to have renewed energy.\n\nWhen she was asked if she is worried about her campaign suffering from a lack of momentum, she batted the notion away:\n\n“I’m happy that I’m getting out and about, I’m meeting people, telling them how I want to be a President that unites people,” she said.\n\nShe also made some of the most vociferous attacks on Connolly that she’s made to-date in the race.\n\nWhen asked for her response to Connolly saying that she would have to think about whether she would hire someone with a prior conviction for rape, and whether it is something she would have to think about, Humphreys was definitive:\n\n“Absolutely not. I was quite shocked to hear that response. I just wonder what any woman in this country would think or what she would feel if she had been a victim of rape, if they thought someone who was a convicted rapist could be employed in Áras an Uachtaráin by the next President of Ireland,” she said.\n\nHeather Humphrey’s slams Catherine Connolly for saying she would have to think about whether she’d hire someone who was convicted for rape, and says that victims need to be thought about. pic.twitter.com/wsvPok57Zx— Eimer McAuley (@eimer_mcauley) October 9, 2025 \n\nSome have pointed out that this hypothetical line of questioning being put to both candidates about whether they would hire a rapist is a reductive way to engage with the issue of rehabilitation through the justice system, and also the issue of rape itself.\n\nThe candidates on Friday then had to deal with the fallout from broadcaster Joe Brolly pretending to be a presidential candidate answering questions while mimicking oral sex on his podcast.\n\nHumphreys came out strongly on the issue, and condemned Brolly’s behaviour as “misogynistic” and “targeted at women”.\n\n“And I can tell you now I will not accept that. Many women across this country have been targeted like that, but I will stand up for the women of Ireland.\n\n“And I can tell you one thing, it won’t knock me back,” she further said.\n\nAt the food market this week, two young female tech workers said that they were considering voting for Humphreys because she has been a woman working at the top level of Government for a long time.\n\n“She seems to be a genuinely nice woman and someone who has integrity, but I haven’t made my mind up yet,” one said.\n\nThere were plenty of undecided voters on the campaign trail this week, and many who said that they still needed to properly tune into the race.\n\nWe’re yet to see how Jim Gavin’s departure will influence support for the two women in the running to be President, but Humphreys will be hoping that her lines of attack will land, and that an influx of support from Fianna Fáil voters is on the way.\n\nThe Taoiseach yesterday said that Humphreys has his vote – it’s hard to see that swinging the momentum her way considering the week he’s had.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nEimer McAuley\n\nView 3 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Humphreys denies lack of momentum as Connolly scores easy points with viral clips”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Humphreys denies lack of momentum as Connolly scores easy points with viral clips”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Here's what experts are saying","text":"Donald Trump and Xi Jinping as U.S. - China trade war erupts.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced an additional 100 percent tariff on China Friday and threatened to cancel a summit with Xi Jinping, reigniting his trade war with Beijing in a row over export curbs on rare earth minerals. Trump said the extra levies, plus US export controls on \"any and all critical software,\" would come into effect from November 1 in retaliation for what he called Beijing's \"extraordinarily aggressive\" moves. Chinese goods currently face US tariffs of 30 percent under tariffs that Trump brought in while accusing Beijing of aiding in the fentanyl trade, and over alleged unfair practices. China had said earlier on Friday that it would impose \"special port fees\" on ships operated by and built in the United States after Washington announced charges for Chinese-linked ships in April. Stock markets fell as the simmering trade war between the United States and China reignited, with the Nasdaq down 3.6 percent and the S&P 500 down 2.7 percent.Washington and Beijing engaged in a tit-for-tat tariffs war earlier this year that threatened to effectively halt trade between the world's two largest economies. Trump had threatened the tariffs hours earlier in a lengthy surprise post on his Truth Social network that said China had sent letters to countries around the world detailing export controls on rare earth minerals.Rare earth elements are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology. China dominates global production and processing of these materials.President Trump said he had not canceled the meeting with Xi but his tariff threats sent market heavyweight shares tumbling. Nvidia, Tesla , Amazon.com and Advanced Micro Devices all fell more than 2 per cent after the bell.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, in a BBC interview on Wednesday, warned of a heightened risk of a significant Wall Street correction within the next six months to two years.Live Events\"With equities at high valuations, this selloff is a sign of jitters,\" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. \"Everything is priced for perfection, so the uncertainty increases market jitters. All of this adds uncertainty to economic growth,\" Gene Goldman stated.In April, Trump's announcement of what he called Liberation Day tariffs stunned markets and sent investors scrambling, causing S&P 500 companies to shed a combined $2.4 trillion in market value.But some investors say the latest U.S.-China trade tensions are unlikely to significantly change the market trajectory, with AI remaining the driving factor.\"This is definitely a significant issue, and it could warrant a pullback but I don't necessarily see it derailing the AI theme that's been driving the market,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management.FAQsQ1.
