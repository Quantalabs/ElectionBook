Apparently I’m 40 seconds late,” Harris opened her only announced event of the day during a trip to Detroit — just 21 days before the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“Well, you are black,” the host joked about her tardiness — before launching into a question about why Harris “come[s] off as very scripted — they say you like to stick to your talking points.”\n\n“That would be called discipline,” Harris cooly replied — before proceeding to nimbly dodge a series of pointed questions from the host and guests.\n\n“There are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election. And so it requires repetition,” she insisted.\n\nMcKelvey pressed Harris hard on issues such as foreign aid to other countries, which former President Donald Trump, 78, has campaigned on restricting, on her past prosecuting marijuana offenders and her role as retiring President Biden’s point person on reducing illegal immigration, which instead surged.\n\nWhen a listener expressed concern that Trump, who is vowing to mass-deport illegal immigrants, might “put anyone that doesn’t look white in camps,” Harris brought up the border.\n\n“Yeah, so you’ve hit on a really important point and expressed it, I think so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect to make you scared,” Harris began, adding: “He prefers to run on a problem instead of fix a problem, and we got to call it out and see it for what it is.”\n\nThe host interjected: “But doesn’t the Biden administration have to take some blame for the border, though? A lot of the blame — because, I mean, the first three years y’all did get a lot of things wrong with the border.”\n\nHarris pivoted into a lengthy recitation of campaign talking points, saying that “the first thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system” — referring to legislation that would have provided a pathway to citizenship for nearly all illegal immigrants in the US, which Republicans said would prompt more to come without legal permission.\n\nBorder encounters hit record highs in each of the first three years of Harris’ role leading the federal efforts to reduce illegal immigration, before declining in recent months following a Biden order to restrict the processing of asylum claims.\n\nAsked by a listener, “What’s your stance on reparations?” Harris gave her longest answer of the interview — declining to take a firm stance before giving an exhaustive account of her various economic policies.\n\n“First of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There’s no question about that,” she said before pivoting to generally applicable policies.\n\n“You’re going to keep going?” McKelvey asked at one point\n\n“You caught that!” she said as she continued to do just that.\n\n“OK, filibuster ma’am!” he cracked.\n\nMoments later, Harris emphasized, “Everything I just talked about will benefit everybody.”\n\nThe interview featured a number of tense questions.\n\nMcKelvey at one point tore into Harris, who tweeted earlier in the day that black men should support her due to her support of marijuana legalization, over the fact that she oversaw the conviction of more than 1,900 people for pot as San Francisco district attorney between 2004 and 2011.\n\n“One of the biggest allegations against you is that you targeted and locked up thousands of black men in San Francisco for weeds. Some say you did it to boost your career. Some say you did it out of pure hate for black men. Please tell us the facts,” he said.\n\nHarris did not directly address the many pot convictions on her watch while maintaining “I was the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases and would not send people to jail for simple possession of weed.”\n\nIn another exchange, a listener asked: “Why are we sending money to other countries when we definitely need it in our own country, for homeless, housing, resources for whatever — that is my determining factor, if I vote for Kamala or not?”\n\nThe host noted to Harris, “That’s that’s one of the reasons [Trump’s] America first rhetoric resonates.”\n\n“We can do it all,” she maintained.\n\nCharlamagne tha God pressed, quoting Harris’ self-proclaimed favorite rapper Tupac as saying, “We got money for war, but can’t feed feed the poor.”\n\nHarris did get nailed down on some points.\n\nAsked why people “can’t we just say” the election is about “fascism” as manifested by Trump, she said: “Yes, we can say that.”\n\nAt another point, she addressed what McKelvey said was a “rumor that Janet Jackson is mad at you because you prosecuted her brother the late great Michael Jackson” — an apparent reference to the pop star incorrectly claiming that Harris, who is biracial, is not black and has a white father.\n\n“That’s just not true, on either count,” Harris said about. “I have not talked to her, but certainly it’s not true about her brother.”\n\nThe interview cut off mid-sentence as Harris spoke past the allotted time, saying that Trump, who recently trashed Detroit while in the Motor City “as a tendency to mention cities that either have historically black, majority population or —.”\n\nThe thought was eclipsed by dead air.","summary":"The popular radio host tried repeatedly — and with little success — to knock Harris off her talking points during the hourlong interview.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/us-news/charlamagne-tha-god-calls-out-harris-during-awkward-town-hall/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/charlamagne-tha-god-calls-out-kamala-harris-during-awkward-town-hall.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729020642&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zYn1e5Bf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:31:51","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.38},{"id":259835816,"title":"Letters: Price recall | So-called exodus | AUHSD board | RPA’s grip | Pleasanton mayor | Trump votes","text":"Price recall about\npower, not crime\n\nI’m voting no on the recall of Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price. She is committed to bringing equality, fairness and humanity to the criminal legal system. Of course, like reimagining policing, substantial changes to our criminal legal system make some uneasy, particularly those whose power is centered in a profoundly broken criminal legal system that intentionally excluded Black and Jewish jurors in high-profile cases for decades before Price’s arrival.\n\nPrice deserves a full term to attempt her vision. This recall is a cynical act that would set us back in holding corporations accountable and fighting for fairness and equal justice.\n\nPrice is not just a district attorney; she’s a force for justice, a champion for the marginalized, and a fighter who brings her own experiences to the forefront of her work. We can’t go backward.\n\nSo-called exodus\nshould free up housing\n\nRe: “Nearly half want to leave” (Page A1, Oct. 13).\n\nWhy does this paper constantly run front-page articles indicating that hordes of people are leaving, or want to leave, California or the Bay Area?\n\nIf this is the case, why don’t I see an abundance of homes for sale and rent? Why is there constant talk about housing shortages?\n\nEither way, I say go to Idaho, Texas, or any of those “square” states where homes are cheap and the cost of living is low. You know, the ones with terrible weather, that persecute or harass LGBTQ people and don’t believe in a woman’s right to choose. You know the ones.\n\nIf you want to go, stop talking about it, pack your stuff and leave. That should help with the so-called housing shortage.\n\nPaula Marshall\n\nReelect Wendy Reicher\nto Acalanes board\n\nI had the joy of working with Wendy Reicher throughout my senior year serving as the Campolindo student representative on the Acalanes Union High School District governing board.\n\nWendy isn’t just a kind, intelligent and enthusiastic board member, rather she is unique in the ways she actively listens to students’ voices and advocates for their best interest. Wendy is a critical thinker and takes many perspectives into account before acting, serving to build an environment where everyone belongs. When there were issues on the board level, she was thoughtful and considerate about how to move forward. She genuinely cares about the people she interacts with, going as far as supporting me with my college application process and regularly staying in touch with me as I started my freshman year at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe governing board — and the district as a whole — would be more than lucky to work with her again.\n\nKathrynanne Terry\n\nIt’s time to break\nRPA’s grip on Richmond\n\nRichmond voters, it is time to focus our efforts to dethrone the Richmond Progressive Alliance. I encourage you to vote for Jamelia Brown in District 1 and Shawn Dunning in District 6.\n\nThe RPA has a stranglehold on the city, and the incumbents are being endorsed by the East Bay Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Their platform is not what I want for Richmond. One item in particular includes police abolition. This is a common threadthroughout the platform of the DSA. Our police went through a horrible decrease in funding from the RPA. This created a reduction in critical departments such as homicide, property theft and others, and left officers working 18-hour shifts at times. That’s not good for anyone.\n\nI don’t want our City Council to be driven by the ideologies of an outside agenda but by the constituents of Richmond.\n\nChesteen Lindberg\n\nKarla Brown will protect\nPleasanton as mayor\n\nI have personally known Mayor Karla Brown for several years and can attest to her honesty, diligence and commitment to the residents of Pleasanton.\n\nI spent more than 30 years teaching science classes at Amador Valley High School. Often my classes were full, presenting the challenge of teaching a lab class to 36 or more seniors. They absolutely got the best instruction that I could provide, but crowded classrooms can affect learning.\n\nKarla Brown has worked tirelessly for more than 15 years to reduce the amount of growth in our city. With a hillside ordinance and a chain of lakes, there is a finite amount of space left to build new housing.\n\nVote Karla Brown for mayor and keep Pleasanton the city that first drew you here, and keep its classrooms a manageable size for students and teachers.\n\nWhat has Trump\ndone to earn votes?\n\nRe: “Harris and Democrats still losing Latinos” (Page A1, Oct. 14).\n\nI have a problem understanding why people whose families came here to escape their governments are willing to risk installing that kind of government here.\n\nMy values are integrity, decency, honesty and caring. Can anyone explain to me why I should vote for Donald Trump? Some say not to believe what he says, but is that a good thing in a leader?\n\nDiAnn Hillerman","summary":"East Bay Times Letters to the Editor for Oct. 16, 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/15/letters-1904/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SJM-L-NEWPRICE-0712-5.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:30:06","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":259835672,"title":"Georgia reports record turnout as early voting begins in US battleground state","text":"Voters in Georgia turned out in record numbers as the battleground state opened early voting for the November 5 US presidential election between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, state officials said on Tuesday.\nAt least 252,000 voters had cast ballots at early-voting sites as of 4pm, nearly double the 136,000 who participated in the first day of early voting in the 2020 election, said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s No 2 election official.\n“Spectacular turnout,” he wrote on social media.\nEarly voting, either in person or by mail, has become increasingly popular with US voters.

That's what happens when you are fake news.\"As Supreme Court justices serve for life or until they decide to retire, all presidents tend to choose relatively young but experienced judges to fill the role. Trump's appointees were between 40 and 53 when they joined the court. President Joe Biden's appointee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, was 51.The ex-president's allies frequently criticized Biden's age and cognitive state before he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris on July 21. However, Trump is the oldest person to ever be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party and has increasingly faced questions about his own physical and mental fitness for office.A Marquette Law School poll released earlier this month found that 61 percent of registered voters agreed that Trump is \"too old to be president,\" while only 13 percent said the same of Harris.In an article published by The Atlantic in September, psychiatrist Richard Friedman claimed that Trump is showing signs of cognitive decline, pointing to the former president's behavior during his September 10 presidential debate with Harris.While Friedman did not diagnose Trump with any medical condition, he argued that Trump's vocabulary, his verbal and logical coherence, his ability to adapt to new topics and his facial expressions were all \"alarming\" and may indicate that he does not have \"a healthy brain.\"Trump's behavior at a town hall event in Pennsylvania on Monday, when the former president stopped taking questions from the audience and instead danced on stage and stood awkwardly as music played for 39 minutes, prompted his Democratic opponent to weigh in on social media.\"Hope he's okay,\" Harris wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in response to video clips of the Trump town hall.","summary":"Trump, 78, was reminded of his advanced age after he spoke against appointing \"old\" judges to the Supreme Court.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-confronted-age-amid-supreme-court-justices-remark-1969628","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2496200/donald-trump-reminded-age-scotus.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:17:50","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":259835674,"title":"Beijing could soon elaborate Anti-Secession Law for ‘non-peaceful’ Taiwan reunification","text":"A former US envoy and Taiwanese lawmaker have warned that Beijing could delve into further detail regarding mainland China’s law enabling it to act towards “non-peaceful” reunification with Taiwan.\nNext year Beijing could use the 20th anniversary of its Anti-Secession Law to clarify how “non-peaceful means” may be taken against Taiwan, according to Taipei City councillor Vincent Chao.\nChao delivered his cautionary remarks at the launch of a report assessing the legal implications of the law by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, on Tuesday.\n“We believe that the further weaponisation of the Anti-Secession Law is not only possible but likely,” said Chao. “[Chinese President] Xi Jinping has already interpreted [the] Anti-Secession Law in a way that none of his successors had in the past.”\n\nEnacted in 2005, the law states that Taiwan is a part of China and allows non-peaceful means to be taken if “peaceful unification” is no longer achievable.\nIn May, Beijing’s top legal and law-enforcement bodies issued guidelines detailing legal consequences for “separatists” who could face punishment by death for taking up extreme secessionist acts that “severely endangered the state and the people”.\nCross-strait tensions have run especially high since 2016 when the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, led by former Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen, became the island’s ruling party.\nTsai’s vice-president since 2020, William Lai Ching-te, won election in January as the island’s leader. Beijing regards Lai, also of the DPP, as a “stubborn separatist”, having denied in the past that mainland China has sovereignty over Taiwan.\nIn his October 10 speech commemorating the founding of the Republic of China – the official name used by Taiwan – Lai asserted that Taiwan and mainland China were “not subordinate to each other” and that the island’s “national sovereignty cannot be violated”.\nHis remarks prompted Beijing on Sunday to launch a day of military drills surrounding the island.\n\nThe exercise involved land and sea manoeuvres around Taiwan, including by the Liaoning, a People’s Liberation Army’s aircraft carrier.\nIn recent years, Beijing has ramped up its simulation of how it would blockade the island, prompting greater concern of a conflict flaring across the Taiwan Strait.\nChao said Beijing had shown increasing capability and a clear “desire” to “annex Taiwan”.\nThe Taiwanese official called for a global response to the possible strengthening of Beijing’s legal tools against the island, which he said “destabilised” cross-strait relations.\n“In terms of what the United States and international community can do, I think it’s to call the [Anti-Secession Law] out for what it is,” Chao said. “It is a fundamentally destabilising piece of legislation.”\n“If, for example, we have hopes that cross-strait relations can be returned to the status quo, that China can continue to play a responsible role in the region, then [the Anti-Secession Law] is fundamentally in contravention.”\nChao was joined on the CSIS panel by former US officials including James Moriarty, past chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan – Washington’s de facto embassy on the island – and Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific security affairs under Donald Trump.\nSeparately, Moriarty told the Post he agreed with Chao’s assessment that Beijing could revise the Anti-Secession Law to explore ways to seek unification with Taiwan.\n\n“They don’t want to put a [timeline] on it, but I think there’s a possibility that there’s going to be more pressure in terms of coming up with a formula that implies the need for more progress towards unification,” the former envoy said.\nMoriarty believed additional “deterrence” from American partners and allies was needed to push back on Beijing yet described the task as “difficult”.\nBeijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited by force if necessary.\nMost countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with weapons.\n“Deterrence means everything,” Moriarty continued, saying it spanned “diplomacy, information, military [and] economic” matters. Yet he said it did not necessarily mean basing American troops in Taiwan, which he described as “a great way to cause war”.\nSchriver agreed that the US needed to respond with more deterrence, especially by strengthening its own legal tools or working with “concerned” nations using international law.\n“Our willingness to engage more and more in this legal space, if only to articulate the interpretation of our own laws … will help with that international piece too,” Schriver told attendees.\n“Because if something happens in the near term … most countries will want some assessment of the international standing of the actions they’re going to take.”","summary":"Cautionary remarks by former US envoy, Taipei lawmaker come after PLA unleashes blockade drills over speech by island’s ‘separatist’ leader.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3282518/beijing-could-soon-elaborate-anti-secession-law-non-peaceful-taiwan-reunification","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/16/dcb8eb6f-c9f4-481a-bd98-86b37b135223_337a82a3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:16:59","author":"Kawala Xie","authors":["Kawala Xie"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":259834656,"title":"Remembering Roy Cohn — subject of new Trump biopic ‘The Apprentice’","text":"Novel ideas for the election\n\nCould illiteracy alter our election?\n\nCandidates rely on memes, reels, half-truths, sound bites, multiple sources, propaganda vs. promotion.

Donald Trump won the state by a margin of 5.1 percent in 2016, while Joe Biden carried Georgia by a much narrower margin of 0.23 percent, or 11,779 votes, in 2020.Polls also show a tight race. Former President Trump has a one-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, per FiveThirtyEight's tracker, while RealClearPolitics shows Trump with an even narrower advantage, just half a point ahead of Harris. Still, both predictions are within the margin of error.\"Both campaigns have been suggesting that people who need to vote absentee should do so, but they are pushing early voting significantly,\" Audrey Haynes, associate political science professor at the University of Georgia, told Newsweek.Was Tuesday Good for Trump or Harris?Going into the first day of early voting, there's been a \"good deal of ground game\" from the Democrats and less for Trump's campaign, Haynes said. But she pointed out that there have been major efforts from some of the state's top Republicans, like Governor Brian Kemp and former Senator Kelly Loeffler, to establish early voting infrastructure that \"certainly work[s] for Georgia Republicans and the ticket in general.\"Harris supporters were quick to declare Tuesday a win for the Democratic nominee, repeating that the early votes outnumber the margin by which Biden won the state four years ago.\"I'm going to take this is a good sign that 11,780 votes aren't going to be nearly enough this time around,\" one supporter wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Political commentator Tristan Snell echoed those comments, tweeting that Tuesday's numbers were far higher than the record set in 2020, an election that resulted in Biden beating Trump.\"Kamala Harris is on her way to winning by a LOT more,\" Snell concluded.While it is unknown which candidate the early votes favored, information on which counties cast ballots on Tuesday could offer signs. The secretary of state's office told Newsweek that Georgia's election data hub will update with the data after polls close at 5 p.m.\"The Atlanta area favors Harris but rural Georgia is Trump country,\" political analyst Steve Schier told Newsweek.Haynes agreed that early voting in Atlanta, plus turnout in Augusta, Macon, Columbus and Savannah, would be welcome news for Harris, but that everywhere else in Georgia could spell promising signs for Trump.Some experts warned against drawing too many conclusions from the first day of early voting. Dave Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report, said on X that early voting data doesn't include which candidate Georgia residents chose, nor does it paint a picture of the final electorate. He added that the data can't be compared to the patterns observed in 2020 because voting has changed so much post-pandemic.\"Resist the temptation to draw inferences at all costs,\" Wasserman wrote.\"The campaigns are going to be working hard up to the last moment. The election is tight. And usually as we get closer to election day, it always tightens in the polls,\" Haynes said. \"But it will not be until election day (or perhaps the next one) that we will know what decision the country has made about who will govern in the White House or who will control the House or Senate or state legislatures.\"2024 Voters Are Excited\"We are seeing a significant burst of voting on the first day of in person early voting,\" Haynes said. \"The most motivated voters show up day one.\"Georgia's early voting numbers are part of a national trend that suggests Americans are highly motivated to vote in the 2024 election. A national NBC News poll conducted from October 4 to October 8 found that 5 percent of registered voters had already cast their ballots. Another 47 percent said they planned to vote early, while 3 percent were undecided on voting method, and 1 percent were not planning to vote, leaving only 44 percent planning to vote on Election Day.Early voting has become increasingly common in recent elections, especially in 2020 when election officials and political campaigns sought to expand voting access during the COVID-19 pandemic. In late October 2020, 68 percent of Americans said they planned to vote early.Democrats typically vote earlier and by mail more than Republicans, but a Harvard poll conducted from October 11 to October 13 found that Trump has a slight lead among early voters in battleground states at the moment. The survey, which included 3,145 registered voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points, found Trump with 48 percent to Harris' 47 percent.","summary":"Georgia shattered its early voting record on Tuesday.

Both Swift and Kelce had a bit of time off between commitments and they spent it together enjoying several public dinners, including a NYC date at Torrisi, as The Blast previously reported.

Lee Ermey shouts at and assaults Matthew Modine’s Private Joker. These scenes are captioned: “President Trump.”\n\nIt then cuts to footage of military officers expressing support for LGBTQ+ rights. These scenes are captioned: “Comrade Kamala.”\n\nModine has spoken out against the video, telling Entertainment Weekly in a statement that: “Trump has twisted and profoundly distorted Kubrick's powerful anti-war film into a perverse, homophobic, and manipulative tool of propaganda.\"\n\nHowever, in her own statement posted to X/Twitter, Vivian Kubrick responded directly “to those who think my father wouldn’t have wanted Trump to use” footage from Full Metal Jacket.\n\nShe wrote: “I agree in principle that an anti-war movie is incongruous with promoting the idea of a tough non-woke US military and thus war itself – however – these are very dangerous and strange times and thus using this footage is doubtless pure expedience.”\n\nAfter arguing at length that Trump is in fact a peaceful leader, she continues: “Truthfully, I believe my father (who supported Reagan), would very much approve of saving America, indeed the world, from the highly destructive Globalist forces threatening to take over this planet. \n\n“And if that footage from FMJ helps Trump make the point that the US military needs properly trained, super tough, focused, dedicated warriors, and not introduce the demoralizing effects of woke-ism, and attracting people to join up simply to have their sexual reassignments paid for, then Trump has my blessing. \n\n“Finally, knowing my father very well, I can assure you he had a profound grasp of how paradoxical human nature is! Which accounts for how at the same time he made anti-war films, he had a great passion for guns (self-defense not hunting) and he had quite a few! \n\n“My father had a great respect for life – his movies being unimpeachable evidence of his love for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness! So on that basis, I feel very confident he would be a Trump supporter and would forgive using FMJ incongruously, if it helps the cause of freedom! Capisce?”\n\nNew York-born Kubrick, who died in 1999, is widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. His movies include 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Paths of Glory and Dr Strangelove.","summary":"Republican candidate recently used footage from Kubrick’s ‘Full Metal Jacket’ in a campaign video","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/stanley-kubrick-daughter-vivian-donald-trump-full-metal-jacket-b2629880.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/23/MixCollage-15-Oct-2024-03-13-PM-5309.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 23:11:24","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":259835306,"title":"Pelosi doesn’t like saying Trump’s name as she’s Catholic: ‘It’s up there with, like, swearing’","text":"Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said she considers Donald Trump’s name a swear word and, because she is Catholic, refuses to say it. \n\nPelosi, a top Democrat from California, revealed her thoughts on saying the former president’s name and described him as “what’s-his-name” during an interview with The Guardian released Tuesday.\n\n“I hardly ever say his name,” Pelosi said.\n\n“I think [Trump is] a grotesque word…You just don’t like the word passing your lips,” she added. “I just don’t.

Fellow billionaire Mark Cuban—a vocal supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris—remained the team’s head of basketball operations and retained a 27% minority stake in the team through the deal.\n\nKey Background\n\nAdelson is the widow of Las Vegas Sands’ former CEO Sheldon Adelson, who was Trump’s largest donor in 2016. The couple also donated some $90 million to pro-Trump groups in the 2020 rate. Adelson has remained a Republican megadonor following her husband’s death in 2021. She held off donating to Trump while former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley was in the race, according to the Times, as the two were friends and have reportedly gathered for multiple meetings within the last year. Adelson’s donations to a pro-Trump group are crucial for the former president, as Harris’ campaign has raised $1 billion this year compared to the Trump campaign’s $853 million, the Times reported. However, the top 10 PACs supporting Trump have raised about $329.4 million since the start of the year compared to the $256.6 million raised by the top 10 Harris-supporting PACs, partially narrowing the gap between the two candidates.\n\n2.4 points. That’s Harris’ lead over Trump in national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight’s weighted polling average.

(Picture: Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump)\n\nHe added that she has treated her seasonal allergies with over-the-counter medication, and has used ‘allergen immunotherapy’ for her urticaria, more commonly called hives, for three years. \n\n‘Notably, she has never experienced severe symptoms, angioedema, or anaphylaxis,’ read her report. \n\nTrump took his exaggeration further by linking it to the criticism that Harris has not done many interviews with the media. \n\n‘Maybe that is why she can’t answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes, and others,’ he said. ‘What is this all about?

She is reportedly considering a sit-down with Joe Rogan, whose podcast is one of the most popular programs in the country.\n\nHer appearance in Detroit was specifically targeted towards reaching Black voters at a time when some Democrats are concerned that her support is lagging among Black men compared with President Biden’s position at this time during the 2020 election cycle.\n\nAfter the radio personality opened the conversation by asking Harris to respond to critics who accuse her of being overly reliant on talking points, the vice president replied: “That’s called discipline.”\n\nShe also pointed out that “repetition” is important in politics because it ensures that people get the message she is trying to deliver. \n\n“At my rallies, I say the same thing when I go to Detroit as I do in Philly, as I do wherever I am, to make sure that people hear and receive what critical issues that are at stake in this election,” she said.\n\nHarris also expressed confidence that she would win the upcoming election, though she conceded that the race between her and Trump remains “a margin of error” contest with just 21 days remaining. \n\nPressed on criticisms she’s received about her record as a prosecutor — a record that’s been fodder for Republicans who claim she used her power and authority to gratuitously incarcerate Black men for minor marijuana violations, she pointed out that public defenders who worked with her have called her “the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases” because she “would not send people to jail for simple possession of weed.”\n\nShe pledged that as president, she’d continue the Biden administration’s work on decriminalizing marijuana because she knows “exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations, and specifically Black men.”\n\nAsked by a guest what Harris would specifically do for Black people if elected, the vice president said her work “from the beginning of my career through today” has been about helping the Black community, including by taking on issues such as Black maternal mortality as vice president.\n\n“The work that I've done that has been about focusing on my knowledge and my experience in my life, experience of knowing, the entrepreneurship that we have in the community, the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams, and then tapping into that so that not only has my work been about ensuring that we have some of the lowest black unemployment ever in our country, but that also knowing that that should be a baseline, that everybody has a job, and what we should be invested in is also building wealth in the community,” she said.\n\nBut Harris also went after Trump in stark terms when pressed on whether the military would be available to “fight” for American freedom if Trump were to foment another violent “insurrection” by a different guest.\n\nHarris pointed out that “those who worked the closest” with Trump — including “his chief of staff, two secretaries of defense, his national security advisor and his former vice president” — have declined to endorse his bid for another four-year term.\n\nShe also said the ex-president’s “way of trying to name-call and demean and divide” is actually a sign of weakness rather than the sign of strength his supporters view it as.\n\n“The man is really quite weak. He's weak. It's a sign of weakness that you want to please dictators and seek their flattery and favor. It's a sign of weakness that you would demean America's military and America's service members. It's a sign of weakness that you don't have the courage to stand up for the Constitution the United States and the principles upon which it stands,” she said. “This man is weak and he is unfit.”","summary":"‘This man is weak and he is unfit,’ Harris told the popular radio host","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-charlemagne-tha-god-trump-interview-facism-b2629886.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/22/SEI225740998.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fLCfEUm0-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:58:26","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":259833604,"title":"Georgians Flock to Polling Locations as Early In-Person Voting Opens","text":"Early in-person voting is now underway in key swing state Georgia.\n\nAlso known as advance voting in the Peach State, the practice kicked off on Oct. 15, about a week after absentee ballots were sent out to voters who requested them. Advance voting lasts until 5 p.m. on Nov. 1, a few days before Election Day, Nov. 5.\n\nAt a press conference on the morning of Oct. 15, Georgia’s state elections director, Blake Evans, praised local elections officials for opening all early voting locations, including in counties affected by Hurricane Helene.\n\nEvans and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger suggested turnout could be high based on the large number of early check-ins before 10:30 a.m.—more than 71,000.\n\nBy 1 p.m., 154,505 advance votes had been cast according to a post on X from the secretary of state’s chief operating officer Gabriel Sterling.\n\nOutside an early voting location in Smyrna, Georgia, on Oct. 15, voter Geert Loeffen told The Epoch Times “It’s great to see so many people out, because if you’re not engaging in it, then you really shouldn’t be complaining about it.”\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 15, cars packed the parking lots ringing the Smyrna Community Center. It’s one of multiple early voting sites in Cobb County, a battleground county within the larger battleground state.\n\nLoeffen was one of multiple voters who spoke with The Epoch Times. He declined to share whether he supported former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that he is an independent.\n\nWhile he worries about ideological echo chambers, he thinks Smyrna has done well uniting locals at a time of heightened polarization.\n\n“They do so many things to bring the community together that [are] non-political,” Loeffen said.\n\nHe described the presidential race in his state as “tight.”\n\n“It’s the margins that make the difference,” he said.\n\nWhile some were hesitant to reveal their choices, Dolly Quigley and Beverly Miller, who were walking together through the parking lot after casting their ballots, were eager to share that they had not voted for Trump.\n\n“In my own personal family, there are five of us, and I have three family members who are voting for Trump. It’s just killing me,” Quigley said.\n\nMiller, who is African American, said she struggled to understand how some young black and Hispanic men could support Trump.\n\nThe two retirees both relocated to Georgia from elsewhere relatively recently—Quigley from Rhode Island and Miller from California.\n\nLawrence Freedman, a retired U.S. Customs regional director, voted at the community center in the morning. The Epoch Times caught him in the afternoon, when he was walking his dog, Oscar Bonner, along a trail near the community center.\n\n“I was happy to vote for Donald Trump. We were at peace. The economy was pretty good,” Freedman said.\n\n“I have voted for Democrats over the years, but they’re not the same Democrats that are running now.”\n\nThe former federal law enforcement officer spoke with authority on the state of the southern border.\n\n“The border has to be protected, and it’s not happening now,” Freedman said.\n\n“No election superintendent (or member of a board of elections and registration) may refuse to certify or abstain from certifying election results under any circumstance,” the judge wrote in his opinion.\n\nMcBurney held that election certification is “a purely ministerial task that gives its performer no discretion to exclude some votes while counting others.”\n\nEarly in-person voting began Oct. 9 in another battleground state, Arizona. It will start in the upcoming days and weeks in North Carolina, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin.","summary":"As advance voting hits new highs, voters speak to The Epoch Times about their choices.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/georgians-flock-to-polling-locations-as-early-in-person-voting-opens-5741943","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/15/id5741944-Georgia-Voters-2_JF_10142024-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:50:19","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002},{"id":259833146,"title":"GOP candidates follow Trump on transgender politics — and put Democrats on defense","text":"There used to be a time when Republican elected officials and candidates shied away from talking about trans issues. \n\nThey didn’t want to appear extreme or intolerant. Why bother wading in to a fraught cultural issue when there were so many other things to talk about? Deferring to “medical professionals” or “the experts” seemed the easy way out. \n\nNow, though, Republicans have emphatically found their voice.\n\nAcross the political landscape, GOP Senate candidates are hitting their Democratic opponents on their trans radicalism and have them on the run, while the Trump campaign is pounding Kamala Harris on the issue with perhaps the most prominent ad of this election cycle. \n\nThe chickens have come home to roost, and they are apparently all cis-gender. \n\nFor the longest time, Democrats have gone along with the steadily evolving trans orthodoxy as established by the cultural left.\n\nExisting in a bubble, they assumed that doubters could be isolated or embarrassed into going along, and didn’t realize just how wildly out of touch they’d become.\n\nIt’s one thing to say people should be tolerant of the choices of consenting adults; it’s another to say that minors must have access to life-altering so-called “gender-affirming” treatments.\n\nIt’s one thing to say everyone should live and let live; it’s another to say that biological males must participate in female sports, no matter how manifestly unfair it is to the girls and women. \n\nThere were plenty of flashing red lights for Democrats to heed.\n\nA Washington Post poll last year found that 57% of people say that gender is determined at birth. Roughly two-thirds of people said biological males shouldn’t compete in girls’ and women’s sports.\n\nAnd 68% opposed giving children ages 10 to 14 access to puberty-blocking medication, while 58% opposed teens age 15 to17 having access to hormonal treatments. \n\nIt’s only now, when they are getting punished on the issue, that Democrats are coming out and saying, in effect, they have favored the gender binary all along. \n\nFighting off a challenge from Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and his super PAC have targeted the congressman for his opposition to a bill called the Protecting Women and Girls Sports Act.\n\nIn a sign that the attack was working, Allard responded in his own ad, declaring, “I don’t want boys playing girls’ sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.” \n\nThis led to denunciations of Allred from the left.\n\nAccording to the LGBT publication The Advocate, Allred “embraced far-right language around gender identity in a new ad” — the offending words being “boys” and “girls.” \n\nSimilar ads have run wherever there is a competitive Senate race, many of them crafted and paid for by the Mitch McConnell campaign outfit, the Senate Leadership Fund. \n\nIn Ohio, embattled incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has also felt compelled to respond with his own ad calling the idea that he supports males competing against females in sports “a complete lie.” The ad points out that Ohio has already prohibited this practice.\n\nBut in an interview with the aforementioned Advocate last year, Brown harshly denounced such laws. \n\n“I think all this shows is that there’s still so much hate in this country,” he said, “and by extension hate in politics. Politicians who introduce and support these prohibitive bills should be ashamed of themselves, and it’s my hope that their constituents see through these ugly efforts and push back on them.”\n\nBrown wants us to believe that he has had a sudden — and surely instantly revocable, if he survives — conversion on the issue. \n\nFor his part, Donald Trump is airing an ad during football games highlighting how Kamala Harris said in 2019 she supported government-funded transition surgery for prisoners and detained illegal immigrants.\n\nAs the ad itself says, it’s hard to believe that anyone seriously seeking public office would advocate such a thing.\n\nNow, in the final weeks of an extremely tight election, she and her Democratic colleagues are being held to account for their ideological excesses.\n\nThey can cry foul all they like, but they brought it on themselves. \n\nTwitter: @RichLowry","summary":"GOP Senate candidates are hitting their Democratic opponents on their trans-radicalism and have them on the run.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/15/opinion/gop-candidates-transgender-slams-put-democrats-on-defense/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-lgrzkbzx8-1729030417162.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729016109&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:49:28","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":259833606,"title":"Biden, Harris, Walz, Vance Converge on Battleground Pennsylvania | Capitol Report","text":"Oct-15-2024\n\nTouting tariffs and vowing to take on China, former President Donald Trump details his economic plans as he campaigns in key swing states.

He added that nothing has been reported to system officials about the text, and there was no indication how many students may have received it.\n\nRiley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said in an email to The Associated Press that the commission can’t determine whether the text message violates state law because the commission hasn’t received a formal complaint about it.\n\nHowever, he called the message “concerning” and said that it certainly could leave recipients feeling intimidated. He urged recipients to contact law enforcement directly if they are worried about the message.\n\n“We understand that these third party text messages can be very frustrating for voters,” Vetterkind said. “We recommend voters rely upon official sources of election information, such as from state or local election officials. Voters are free to ignore these text messages since they are not sent or associated with an official source.”\n\nThe text message was sent as thousands of voters in Wisconsin are casting absentee ballots. As of Monday, nearly 240,000 absentee ballots had already been returned statewide.\n\nStarting Oct. 22, voters can start casting absentee ballots in person. Former President Barack Obama plans to join current vice presidential nominee Tim Walz in Madison for a rally that day to encourage early voting.\n\nWisconsin is one of the “blue wall” states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that is key to Vice President Kamala Harris’ strategy for defeating Republican Donald Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMADISON, Wis. – Voting rights advocates on Tuesday asked state and federal&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Groups advocating for voting rights call for an investigation into text messages in Wisconsin first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/groups-advocating-for-voting-rights-call-for-an-investigation-into-text-messages-in-wisconsin/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/U3XYYH6RMVEPLAWWDFYE5D3SQI.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:19:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.412},{"id":259831254,"title":"Trump’s crypto website crashed after its token went on sale","text":"Former President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency project, World Liberty Financial, launched its token sale on Tuesday — and its website crashed shortly afterward.\n\nThe whitelist for the much-hyped but still largely unexplained decentralized finance project opened on September 30th for accredited investors and non-US persons. World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Folkman claimed on Monday that “well over 100,000 people” had signed up to buy its token WLFI, according to CNBC. As of publication time, the site appeared to be back online.\n\nHowever, according to blockchain data tracked by Etherscan, just 5,317 unique wallet addresses held the token as of Tuesday afternoon, and World Liberty Financial said it sold more than 532 million tokens of the 20 billion made available for public sale.\n\nSandy Peng, a WLFI advisor, told CoinDesk that the outages resulted from excessive traffic. “The team wasn’t expecting this level of interest,” Peng said, adding that the website received 72 million unique visits in the first hour after the token launched.\n\nCoinDesk reports that the WLFI token, which will be non-transferrable for now, will be used to govern the World Liberty Financial platform. Holders will be able to have a say in protocol upgrades, technical changes, promotional partnerships, and oversight of security risks. The platform itself will let users borrow and lend cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite Trump and his associates’ promotion of World Liberty Financial as a tool to help unbanked and de-banked people, only those who meet the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) accredited investor requirements can purchase WLFI.

Johnson claimed that CBS did just that to his appearance on Sunday’s episode of ‘Face the Nation’.\n\n“I recently traveled to [North Carolina] and victims of Hurricane Helene told me nearly two weeks after landfall, the Biden-Harris Administration had STILL not provided them with all the resources they desperately needed,” Johnson wrote on X. “But CBS selectively edited OUT ENTIRELY this first-hand perspective.”\n\nHe then posted the segment as aired alongside the raw footage, which showed which parts CBS had chosen to omit.\n\n“So they’ve obligated some funds, but they’ve only distributed two percent…. The rescue and recovery effort is still going on, and then we address the rest of it,” CBS showed him as saying in the first segment.\n\nThe network omitted five other sentences in between, including that the people of North Carolina told Johnson they “had not been provided the resources, almost two weeks after the storm, that they desperately needed.”\n\nJohnson then shared another example of selective editing, in which CBS removed all references to the federal government trying to prevent a state from removing non-citizens from voter rolls.\n\n“Here’s the problem, there is a number of states that are not requiring proof of citizenship when illegals or non-citizens register to vote.

Nearly 99,000 were registered with the party in 2020.Erie, in the northwest of the battleground state, voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, but he only won by 1 percent.With fewer potential supporters this time around, Vice President Kamala Harris, who was in the county Monday night, may have a bigger job to do to secure victory.Earlier in the year, Erie was named one of the top seven swing counties in the election, meaning it could play a pivotal role in deciding the next president of the United States.\"Erie County has voted with the winner in 25 of the last 28 statewide elections, making it one of the 'swingiest' swing counties in the United States,\" Dr. Joe Morris, chair of the political science department at Mercyhurst University, told YourErie in August.The county was joined by others in swing states thought to be vital for victory, including Maricopa County in Arizona, Richmond County in Georgia, and Oakland County in Michigan.President Barack Obama took Erie in both 2008 and 2012, but it turned red for Trump in 2016, before the swing back to blue in 2020.While it only counts for 2 percent of Pennsylvania's population, its tendency to swing back and forth has captured the attention of political candidates and experts alike.When speaking Monday night, Harris went in hard on her opponent, branding him \"unstable\" and warning supporters that a second term for Trump would be dangerous for the country. Accompanied by video clips for the first time, Harris' speech was one of the strongest attacks on the Republican so far.Despite an apparent drop in registered voters, Erie County Democratic Chairperson Sam Talarico told NPR earlier in October that there had been a surge of enthusiasm since Harris became the party's nominee.\"There are a lot of people, I believe, especially younger people, that just weren't going to vote,\" he said. \"And they've been energized by Kamala Harris' entrance onto the stage.\"Trump visited the county two weeks ago, where he attacked Harris for her response to Hurricane Helene before saying he was in Erie to meet with \"the workers\", referring to the area's working-class roots. The former president reportedly still owes thousands of dollars to the area for costs related to his previous rallies.Pennsylvania's Team Trump Spokesman Kush Desai told Newsweek in a statement that the GOP's outreach in the state had been successful.\"Pennsylvanians in Erie County and everywhere else across the Commonwealth have firsthand experienced the peace, prosperity, and stability of the first Trump administration and the disaster, failure, and incompetence of the Harris-Biden administration – which Kamala Harris is running to extend by another four years,\" Desai said.\"That's why our grassroots voter outreach program has been so successful in cutting the Democrats' registered voter advantage by nearly half in Pennsylvania as we take our message of 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago' to voters wherever they are: at their doorstep, on the phone, and even on social media.\"Erie County figures showed a slight drop in Republican registrations, also, going from 74,620 four years ago to 71,439.Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes could be key for either candidate, and the race remains tight. Recent polling showed Harris with a 1-point lead over Trump, while other surveys showed a far narrower picture.\"Erie picks Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania will pick the president,\" Senator John Fetterman told CNN on Monday. \"People are discussing how Pennsylvania is a small version of the United States, and Erie is a smaller version of Pennsylvania.

Vance hints Elon Musk and Lina Khan could be in Trump admin: ‘I agree with them both on some issues’","text":"BUTLER, Pa. — Democratic billionaires can’t stand her. Republican members of Congress can’t stop investigating her. \n\nBut President Biden’s Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan may find herself some new and strange bedfellows in a Trump-Vance administration. The lower half of the ticket said so himself, floating a possible role for Khan working alongside an even more controversial figure: billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk. \n\nSpeaking to The Post, vice-presidential nominee J.D. Vance considered the possibility of the two policy lightning rods serving in the would-be Trump White House next year, working to crack down on Big Tech censorship. \n\nVance answered to the backdrop of opera filling the air at Donald Trump’s triumphant return to Butler, Pa. \n\n“I agree with them both on some issues. I disagree with them both on some issues,” he began, appearing amused by the question. \n\n“What unites the Republican ticket is a sense that we just got to get back to common sense, and it’s okay to disagree with each other,” Vance continued, mentioning Trump supporters with a variety of worldviews: ex-Democrats Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard along with Republicans nsuch as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n“You can have strong disagreements on issues. We want to facilitate that disagreement because we believe the best idea will rise to the top.”\n\nBut what hasn’t united Republicans historically is an affinity for antitrust, which sets Vance apart.\n\nIn recent days, several Republican committee chairs in the House have accused Khan of overstepping her antitrust powers, wasting taxpayer dollars and campaigning with Democrats.\n\nThe GOP has long been the party of business, but Vance is leading a new conservative vanguard aiming to check corporate power, especially Big Tech. \n\nThese “Khan-servatives,” who include Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, support the FTC chair’s work to challenge monopolies and expand the scope of US antitrust powers. They want to go beyond keeping prices low for consumers — they also see the FTC’s mission as promoting competition and innovation. \n\nWith election integrity top of mind for some Republican voters, Vance wants to crack down on Big Tech censorship he believes silences conservatives — and Khan could be his secret weapon to do just that. \n\n“I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,” Vance said in February at an antitrust conference.\n\nBuilding on Trump-era antitrust probes into Big Tech, Khan’s FTC has sued Amazon for squeezing sellers and favoring its own services on its marketplace and Meta for buying up would-be social media competitors Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nVance, formerly a venture capitalist, shares Khan’s vision to break up behemoth tech companies he says stifle smaller rivals.\n\n“She’s justifiably worried about some of the big technology companies and the concentration of power,” Vance said this summer before lauding Khan for not using the agency to advance a woke agenda. \n\nVance’s views are music to the ears of some “little tech” companies and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, especially his former employer billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who helped bankroll the Ohio senator’s political rise\n\nVance repeated calls to break up Google in August when he urged Thiel, co-founder of online-payments system PayPal and data-analytics group Palantir, to “get off the sidelines” and donate to the Trump campaign.\n\nVance, a conservative, also wants antitrust power to crack down on Big Tech censorship. \n\n“Long overdue, but it’s time to break Google up,” Vance tweeted in February, “This matters far more than any other election integrity issue. The monopolistic control of information in our society resides with an explicitly progressive technology company.”\n\nVance has also criticized Section 230, part of a statute he says protects social media companies from lawsuits if they remove third-party posts “for having the wrong political views.”\n\nThat’s where Elon Musk comes in. He lauded Trump’s pick of Vance, promised to commit $45 million to the Trump-supporting America PAC and stumped for the former president for the first time this month in Butler. \n\n“Free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don’t know what’s going on, if they don’t know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy,” Musk said to tens of thousands in Butler.\n\nThough Musk reinstated Trump’s Twitter account, he has suspended the accounts of journalists and throttled links to media competitors. Khan rebuffed a meeting with Musk as the FTC investigates Twitter’s data practices.\n\nStill, the billionaire’s avowed free-speech absolutism aligns him with the third of conservatives who say their First Amendment rights are “not at all” secure.\n\nIn August, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to Congress the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor COVID content, saying he regretted suppressing The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story, which exposed the president’s son using his father to rake in business deals.\n\nVance notes the vice president is on board with that kind of behavior.\n\n“Kamala Harris is really into censorship because she fundamentally doesn’t believe in the right of Americans to speak their mind and to say what they believe,” he told The Post. “The biggest threat to democracy in 2024 is Kamala Harris’ weird obsession with censorship.”\n\nHarris, meanwhile, is under some pressure to back off Big Tech.\n\nLast week, Harris surrogate and billionaire investor Mark Cuban said she should leave Khan out of a future Democratic administration, just as Biden’s Department of Justice considers breaking up Google’s search-engine monopoly.\n\n“By trying to break up the biggest tech companies, you risk our ability to be the best in artificial intelligence,” Cuban told Semafor.\n\nTwo Democratic billionaire donors previously pushed Harris to sack Khan, including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who sits on Microsoft’s board.\n\nKhan’s FTC is investigating Microsoft’s AI deals and $13 billion investment in OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT bot. The probe is part of the federal government’s strategy to preserve competition in the emerging technology field that could transform American society.\n\nDespite her disfavor with the donor class, Khan still has some supporters.\n\nA number of tech executives backed Khan at a recent “Little Tech for Harris” fundraiser in San Francisco with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as the headliner. \n\nProgressive lawmakers have also come to the antitrust chief’s defense. \n\n“Anyone goes near Lina Khan and there will be an out and out brawl,” tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) last week. \n\nBut if anyone does come for Khan, she might find a home in the most unlikeliest of places: a Trump-Vance White House.","summary":"BUTLER, Pa. — Democratic billionaires can&#8217;t stand her.

He noted that the former president has received some credit for saying that there’s effectively a cold war with China.\n\nThe Bloomberg editor went on to note that the US won the Cold War with the Soviet Union “because it rallied allies to it” but that Trump is suggesting “slamming allies with 20 percent, 30 percent tariffs.”\n\nMicklethwait asked how it would help the US take on China if it turned its allies against itself.\n\n“China thinks we’re a stupid country, a very stupid country,” Trump said. “They can’t believe that somebody finally got wise to them. Not one president, Bush, Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. Have you heard of him? Think of it. Not one president charged China anything.”\n\nTrump has long used Obama’s middle name in an attempt to make him appear un-American.\n\nAmid Obama’s rise, many on the right, including Trump, pushed the baseless “birther” conspiracy theory that he was a Muslim born in Kenya, and thus ineligible to be commander-in-chief.\n\nEarlier in the conversation about tariffs, Trump said: “I was the only president in 82 years that kept you out of a war, except I defeated ISIS, but I inherited that war.” \n\nThe former president explained his veering from subject to subject by returning to the concept of “the weave.”\n\n“You have the weave, as long as you end up in the right location at the end,” he said. “We have never been so close to World War III as we are right now with what's going on in Ukraine and Russia and the Middle East.”\n\n“I had no wars in the whole world ... I talked plenty of countries out of wars ... And I knocked out ISIS in a matter of weeks. It was supposed to take four to five years. I did it in a matter of weeks,” he added. “We actually have a great military but we don't know how to use it.”\n\nObama slammed Trump and some of his supporters as he hit the trail for Vice President Kamala Harris last week. \n\n“I’m sorry, gentlemen, I’ve noticed this, especially with some men who seem to think some of Trump’s behavior — the bullying and the putting people down — is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you – That is not what real strength is. It never has been,” Obama said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \n\n“Real strength is about working hard. And carrying a heavy load without complaining. Real strength is about taking responsibility for your actions and telling the truth even when it’s inconvenient,” Obama added. “Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can’t always stand up for themselves. That is what we should want for our daughters and our sons, and that is what I want to see in a president of the United States of America.”","summary":"Amid Obama’s rise, many on the right, including Trump, pushed the baseless ‘birther’ conspiracy theory that he was secretly a Muslim born in Kenya","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-barack-hussein-obama-tariffs-b2629831.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/15/20/SEI225726391.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LpoEPkNp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:04:28","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":259833786,"title":"The Secret of Trump’s Economic Message","text":"When Donald Trump speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child. China gives us billions of dollars via tariffs. American auto workers take imported cars out of a box and stick the pieces together. These are very light paraphrases of statements he made today at the Economic Club of Chicago, in a sometimes combative interview with the Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait.\n\nYet voters consistently say they trust Trump more to handle the economy than they do Kamala Harris. Why? Perhaps because, when Trump speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child. Yes, he has a reputation as a businessman, and voters consistently trust Republicans more on the issue (even though the economy fares better under Democrats). But Trump’s reductionism may be the real source of his appeal when it comes to the economy and other policy areas. (“Build the wall”; “make NATO pay their fair share.”) By restricting his discussion to the bluntest, broadest, and vaguest of terms, he sells an appealing illusion.\n\n“We’re all about growth,” he pronounced at the start of the interview, as though this were a bold, contrarian stance. A moment later, he added, “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff.”\n\nPoor Micklethwait was no match for this. The former editor of The Economist put up a valiant effort, but he was bringing facts to a rhetoric fight. Micklethwait asked Trump about the cost of tariffs to the American economy, and Trump responded with a long “sir” story about a supposed friend named John who builds car factories. (“I will not give his last name, because he might not like it.”) Micklethwait asked about how a trade war would affect the 40 million American jobs that rely on trade, and Trump told stories about John Deere and a conversation he had with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel. None of these answered the question, and it didn’t matter.\n\n“You keep bringing up these individual examples, but the overall effect is going to be dramatic,” a frustrated Micklethwait said.\n\n“I agree it will have a massive effect, positive,” Trump shot back.\n\nWhen the interviewer asked whether a trade war would endanger relationships with allies, Trump rejected the premise of alliances. “Our allies have taken advantage of us, more so than our enemies,” he said. He praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and all but confirmed reporting by Bob Woodward that the men have remained in touch since he left office (“If I did, it’s a smart thing”), and deemed the poor pariah nation North Korea “a very serious power.”\n\nTrying another tack, Micklethwait warned that a trade war could endanger the use of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, thus weakening American economic power. “If I’m elected, the dollar is so secure,” Trump said. “Your reserve currency is the strongest it’ll ever be.” He gave no explanation for what this could mean or why it might be true. But it sure sounds nice, doesn’t it?\n\nThe impulse to bluff comes from Trump’s many decades of business experience. For Trump the businessman, confidence and bombast have always been more important than facts and reason. This has generally worked out for Trump, who is, after all, a billionaire. But at times, it has been disastrous, as his four corporate bankruptcies demonstrate.\n\nTrump’s record as president is similarly mixed. He imposed some tariffs on China, but a deal he struck to encourage Chinese imports of American goods flopped. His trade war disproportionately disadvantaged his own supporters. He did not deliver on his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. His main success was a broad tax cut. During the last year of his term, Trump saw the American economy collapse because of COVID, though he cannot take all of the blame for that.\n\nConsidering the former president’s checkered history, Micklethwait’s desire to probe him on the facts is understandable, but it’s also futile. Trump is selling a fantasy, not a white paper. As he repeatedly danced around the questions today, he joked about his oratorical approach: “I call it the weave. As long as you end up at the right location in the end.” Trump believes that the right location for him is the White House. The weave just might get him there again.","summary":"When he speaks about the economy, he sounds like a child—which might be the source of his appeal.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-economic-message-secret/680264/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/k4ppnWEFO8DD7MgrOncuq3QRfc8=/0x57:2696x1461/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/10/2024_10_15T181949Z_78051342_RC20LAAPC4IZ_RTRMADP_3_USA_ELECTION_TRUMP-1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 22:03:00","author":"David A.

The owners approved of the Jacksonville Jaguars stadium renovations, and they also finally approved Tom Brady becoming a part-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.Read more: Tom Brady Officially Approved as Minority Owner of Las Vegas RaidersBrady had been waiting a year for his approval after NFL owners expressed issues with Brady being an analyst while also being a part-owner of an NFL team. The Patriots legend was hit with multiple restrictions like not being granted access to other teams' facilities or practices, along with broadcast production meetings.Despite the steep restrictions, the NFL owners approved Brady's request, making him an official part owner of the Raiders. Brady joined Tom Wagner, the co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management, in purchasing a 10 percent stake in the Raiders. Brady now owns approximately five percent of the team.With the excitement surrounding Brady being a part-owner of the Raiders, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodwell was approached about the possibility of an even bigger star potentially becoming an NFL owner.Goodell was asked if pop sensation and current NFL diehard Taylor Swift would be approved to be a part-owner of the Kansas City Chiefs.According to Albert Breer, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, with Tom Brady approved as a Raiders limited partner, was asked if anyone has approached Taylor Swift about buying a piece of the Chiefs. He laughed and said, 'If she's interested, I think she has the ability to do it.'\"Swift has become one of the biggest celebrities in the world, along with being a huge celebrity for the NFL. She began dating the Chiefs' star tight end and has stolen the spotlight in every game that she has attended. Though there is no telling how long the pair's relationship will last, it appears Swift has become a mega fan of football.Goodell might have laughed at the idea, but his statement of Swift having \"the ability to do it\" might tie directly into her fandom and the droves of fans she has brought along to the NFL.More news: Chiefs Star Endorses Donald Trump for PresidentAnytime that Swift appears at a game, the broadcast immediately cuts to her showing some sort of reaction to the plays being made. Naturally, she goes wild anytime the Chiefs make a great play — including any to Kelce.The Chiefs organization might want to think about adding Swift as a part-owner, simply because of the exposure the team has gotten since she arrived.For more on the Chiefs, head to Newsweek Sports.","summary":"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reacted to the idea of Taylor Swift becoming part-owner of the Chiefs after Tom Brady became part-owner of the Raiders.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/roger-goodell-responds-idea-taylor-swift-becoming-part-owner-chiefs-1969664","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2496188/taylor-swift-chiefs-game.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:59:31","author":"James Brizuela","authors":["James Brizuela"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.247},{"id":259829992,"title":"Trump Says 'Obnoxious' Tariffs Will Bring Factories To US","text":"US Republican candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday said that companies will drop plans to build factories overseas when faced with the threat of high tariffs on shipping goods to the United States.\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States,\" the former president Trump told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago.\"You make it so high, so horrible, so obnoxious\" companies will \"come right away,\" he added.The economy has emerged as one of the main issues ahead of the November 5 US election, where Trump is in a dead heat with Vice President Kamala Harris, according to polls.The former president has vowed a 10 percent to 20 percent across-the-board tariff on imports and a 60 percent rate on Chinese goods -- and more recently threatened a 200 percent levy on automobiles made in Mexico.During the hour-long interview, Trump pushed back at arguments that tariffs would hike costs for consumers and punish businesses faced with higher-priced imports.\"To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,\" Trump said.","summary":"US Republican candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday said that companies will drop plans to build factories overseas when faced with the threat of high tariffs on shipping goods to the United States.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-says-obnoxious-tariffs-will-bring-factories-us-3746785","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4554304/republican-presidential-candidate-donald-trump-pushed-back-arguments-that-tariffs-would-hike-costs.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:56:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":259830080,"title":"Day in Photos: Defamation Lawsuit, Rain Havoc, and Egyptian Mega-Museum","text":"People sign in to cast their votes on the first day of early voting at East Point First Mallalieu United Methodist Church in Atlanta, Ga., on Oct. 15, 2024.

It was Harris’ 10th visit to Pennsylvania this campaign season, and Trump’s Monday town hall in suburban Philadelphia came after visits last week to Scranton and Reading.\n\nHarris is highlighting what she says are examples of Trump’s increasingly “unstable and unhinged” behavior. It’s part of her effort to win over a small universe of undecided voters and tear away even a small slice of traditionally Republican voters in the fight for Pennsylvania and six other closely contested states that are expected to determine who wins next month’s election.\n\nShe argued that Trump’s comments in a Fox News “Sunday Morning Futures” interview are the latest example of threatening rhetoric from the former president that should concern Americans about what a potential second Trump term could look like.\n\nTrump made the comment in response to a question about “outside agitators” potentially disrupting Election Day, pivoting to what he said is a foe closer to home.\n\n“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump said. He added: “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big – and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”\n\nTrump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, defended Trump’s comments during a campaign stop in Minneapolis earlier Monday.\n\n“Is it a justifiable use of those assets if they’re rioting and looting and burning cities down to the ground? Of course it is. Right?” Vance told reporters. “I think the question is, is it a justifiable use of assets, depends on what’s actually happening.”\n\nHarris and Trump have thrown themselves fully into the race for Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump beat Hillary Clinton by more than 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania on his way to winning the presidency in 2016. But Joe Biden, a Scranton native, beat Trump by about 80,000 votes in the state four years ago.\n\nBoth sides believe the race for Pennsylvania could be even closer this time.\n\nTrump spoke at a town hall Monday in suburban Oaks. Responding to a man who said his dream of homeownership feels out of reach, Trump said regulations make it too expensive to build in some places. He repeated his pledge to increase U.S. oil drilling, which he said would drive down costs, though domestic production is already at record highs.\n\n“We’re going to drill baby drill, we’re going to have so much energy and we’re going to bring prices down,” Trump said.\n\nHe also claimed that government data from crime statistics to jobless numbers is “fake,” alleging the numbers are manipulated to help the incumbent Democrats.\n\nTrump cut short his remarks after twice being interrupted by medical emergencies, turning the town hall into a concert instead. After the second incident, Trump spoke for a few more minutes and then called for music. He then stood onstage — at times swaying along — as music played.\n\nHarris’ campaign called Erie a “pivot” area, a Democratic-majority city of about 94,000 people bordered by suburbs and rural areas with significant numbers of Republicans. Erie County is often cited as one of the state’s reliable bellwether regions, where the electorate has a decidedly moderate voting record. Trump visited Erie on Sept. 29.\n\nHarris also talked up early voting during her rally. Mail-in voting is well underway in the state where some 7 million people are likely to cast votes in the presidential race.\n\n“If you have already received your ballot in the mail, please do not wait,” Harris urged her supporters. “Fill it out and return it today or tomorrow. But please get it out.”\n\nBeforehand, she stopped by a newly opened coffee shop and record store in Erie as she continues to press her case for Black men’s support.\n\nThe visit to LegendErie Records and Coffee House, a Black-owned small business, came after her campaign unveiled a plan earlier Monday to give Black men more economic opportunities and other chances. The campaign is trying to step up outreach to Black men, a key voting bloc that has some Democrats concerned about a possible lack of enthusiasm.\n\nPennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any swing state, have generated the most attention by far from the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Including Monday’s scheduled events, they will have made 46 stops in the state, according to Associated Press tracking of the campaigns’ public events.\n\nMichigan, with 33 visits, and Wisconsin, with 29, are the next most-visited states, illustrating how both campaigns are focusing on winning states that had been part of the Democrats’ so-called “blue wall” until Trump emerged as the Republican standard-bearer.\n\nDemocrats have won three straight elections for Pennsylvania governor, and both current U.S. senators are Democrats, but the state’s Legislature is closely divided.\n\nTrump rallygoer Tom Bonanno said he believed there was greater enthusiasm for Trump this year than in the former president’s two previous campaigns.\n\n”I’m feeling a shift because the economy affects everyone,” Bonanno said. “It’s not just going to be on, you’re feeling joy or happiness or whatever they’re running on. It’s about the economy once again.”\n\nLuther Manus, 97, a World War II and Vietnam veteran, walked from Harris’ Monday night rally impressed with the candidate but was circumspect about how much she’ll be able to accomplish in a polarized Washington if she wins.\n\n“I think she’s superb,” Manus said as the arena was emptying out. But he added: “If they give her a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, she’ll be able to do much of what she said. Without that, she’s going to have a problem, just like Obama and Biden.”","summary":"Democrat Harris and Republican Trump have been become fixtures in the country's largest 2024 battleground state.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/15/harris-slams-trump-for-suggesting-military-handle-enemy-from-within-as-they-vie-for-pennsylvania/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/10/Election_2024_Harris_30559_a9b740.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:52:01","author":"ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON,Adriana Gomez Licon, Will Weissert And Mark Scolforo,WILL WEISSERT and MARK SCOLFORO - Associated Press","authors":["ADRIANA GOMEZ LICON","Adriana Gomez Licon, Will Weissert And Mark Scolforo","WILL WEISSERT and MARK SCOLFORO - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":259829994,"title":"Nasdaq Stops Trading In Trump Media Stock Due To Volatility, Shares Close Down Almost 10%","text":"Shares in former President Donald Trump's social media company closed down nearly 10% Tuesday after volatility led the Nasdaq Composite to briefly halt trading of the stock.The price of Trump Media & Technology Group, which closed Friday at $29.95 a share, was up more than 13% Tuesday afternoon before it reversed course and plunged to 6% down, prompting the five-minute stoppage, CNBC reported.But the price continued to fall after trading in DJT, which owns Trump's Truth Social website, resumed at 2:47 p.m. ET, CNBC said.

The tit-for-tat strikes and uncertainty about whether Israel might strike strategically important energy and nuclear sites in Iran have raised fears about escalation into an all-out regional war.\n\nIsrael’s offensive against Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza has expanded into a ground invasion of Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy that has been firing into Israel since the conflict in Gaza started a year ago in solidarity with Hamas.\n\nBiden has said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran’s nuclear program and urged Israel to consider alternatives to hitting Iran’s oil sector. Such a strike could affect the global oil market and boost pump prices just ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThere is already a deep divide among Democrats over the war, with Vice President Kamala Harris failing to get the usual Democratic endorsement of a political action group of Arab American leaders over the weekend. Former President Donald Trump didn’t get backing from the Arab American PAC either.\n\nBiden said earlier this month that he didn’t know whether Netanyahu was holding up a Mideast peace deal to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election but noted that he was “not counting on that.” Biden also noted his administration’s support for Israel, which has long carried weight in American politics.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu spoke by phone last week for the first time in seven weeks, while Defense Secretary Austin has been speaking regularly with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant.\n\nThe Pentagon said in a readout of a call from Sunday that Austin reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel’s security but urged it to ensure protections for U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, shift from military operations to a diplomatic solution and “raised concern for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and stressed that steps must be taken soon to address it.”\n\nThe White House National Security Council declined to confirm that Netanyahu offered Biden any assurances about targets.\n\n“Our commitment to Israel’s defense is ironclad,” the White House National Security Council said in a statement. “We will not discuss private diplomatic discussions and would refer you to the Israeli government to speak to their own potential military operations.”\n\nAP reporter Julia Frankel contributed from Jerusalem.","summary":"However, the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic discussions, cautioned that Israel’s assurances are not ironclad and that circumstances could change.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/10/15/israel-assures-us-it-wont-strike-iranian-nuclear-or-oil-sites-us-officials-say/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/US_Israel_Iran_23176.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:48:52","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.06},{"id":259828238,"title":"Ted Cruz Poll Standings Ahead of Debate With Colin Allred","text":"Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz will face off against his Democratic challenger, Representative Colin Allred, on Tuesday night in their only U.S. Senate debate, just three weeks before Election Day.Polling has shown that Cruz, who is vying for a third term in office, holds a slight lead over Allred, who has represented parts of Dallas' northeastern suburbs since 2019. But the race has grown closer in recent weeks, and Democrats view Texas as a potential surprise win as both parties fight for control of the U.S. Senate.Cruz won by a slim margin when his seat was up for reelection in 2018, beating Democrat Beto O'Rourke 50.9 percent to 48.3 percent. Texas has not elected a Democratic senator since 1988.Both candidates have drawn tens of millions of dollars in campaign donations. Allred, who has been endorsed by former Republican Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, outraised Cruz by nearly $10 million in the third quarter. Cruz has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.Cruz vs. Allred: What do polls show?According to FiveThirtyEight, Cruz is ahead by 4 points (48.5 percent to 44.6 percent) on average across statewide polling. But the gap has shrunk over the past month. On September 1, Cruz was up by 5.4 points on average. On September 15, the Republican incumbent was leading by 4.5 points on average.In a statewide poll released by the University of Houston on Tuesday, Cruz was found to be leading 50 percent to 46 percent, putting his lead outside the poll's margin of error of 2.69 percentage points. The survey was conducted between September 26 and October 10 and is based on the responses of 1,329 likely voters.A poll from the New York Times and Siena College released last week gave Cruz the same 4-point lead (48 percent to 44 percent) based on the responses of 617 likely voters between September 29 and October 4.

The gray column combines responses for third-party candidates or those who responded \"other\" in the survey.Despite Cruz's lead, an internal GOP poll by the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund (SLF) raised red flags for his chances earlier this week. The PAC's October survey found that he was ahead by just 1 point, compared to his 3-point gap in September.\"We still have a lot of work to do to maximize our gains in this critical Senate election,\" SLF President Steven Law wrote in a memo that accompanied the poll, obtained by Politico.How to watch debateTuesday's debate will take place at the WFAA Studios in Dallas and is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. CDT (8 p.m. ET). It will be moderated by WFAA reporter Jason Whitley and Dallas Morning News reporter Gromer Jeffers Jr.The event will be live-streamed across TEGNA stations in Texas on the air and on the stations' digital platforms. It will also be streamed by C-SPAN here.Why is race important?There are 34 Senate seats up for grabs this election. Democrats currently hold a slim majority, even with 47 seats to the Republicans' 49. Independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Angus King of Maine and Joe Manchin of West Virginia caucus with the Democrats, while Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a former Democrat, chose not to caucus with the GOP, so the Democrats kept control of the chamber.Democrats have set their sights on flipping Cruz and Florida's Rick Scott's seats in November, while Republicans are hoping to flip seats in Ohio, Arizona and Montana.Several election models have predicted that Republicans could flip control of the Senate on Election Day. Forecaster 270toWin projects that the GOP will secure 51 of the 100 seats, with Democrats taking 48 seats, including two independents. The race in Ohio, where Senator Sherrod Brown is facing reelection, is considered a \"toss-up.\"YouGov also projected that Republicans could take control of the Senate, although Democrats are poised to take control of the House, meaning control of each chamber would flip. Per YouGov's predictions, Republicans are set to take 51 seats, including Texas. The site puts the Ohio Senate race and the race in Arizona to fill Sinema's seat in the \"toss-up\" category. Democrats, on the other hand, are set to take 47 seats, per YouGov's forecast.Cruz warned last week that Democrats \"are coming after me with everything they have\" in his race against Allred, telling Fox News' Sean Hannity, \"They were exactly right: If they take Texas, they can take over the country completely.\"When is early voting in Texas?Early voting in Texas will kick off on October 21, less than a week after the Cruz-Allred debate. Registered voters can vote early at any polling place in their county. Voters can search for early voting locations by entering their information at VoteTexas.gov.The deadline to register to vote in the state has passed, but eligible voters have until October 25 to request to vote by mail.","summary":"Cruz, the incumbent Republican, will face Allred on Tuesday night in the only debate of their Senate race in Texas.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ted-cruz-debate-colin-allred-texas-senate-election-1969580","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2496065/ted-cruz-colin-allred-poll-standings.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:46:28","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":259829692,"title":"Walz greeted by MAGA protesters during visit to Butler","text":"Butler, a solid red county that was the site of the first assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump on July 13, was visited by Walz on Tuesday for a campaign stop.

Microsoft concluded the hackers had two motives: to embarrass Israelis and make money.\n\nIn another, investigators identified a Russian criminal network that infiltrated more than 50 electronic devices used by the Ukrainian military in June, apparently seeking access and information that could aid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There was no obvious financial motive for the group, aside from any payment they may have received from Russia.\n\nFor nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, which has its own ties to hacking groups, teaming up with cybercriminals offers a marriage of convenience with benefits for both sides. Governments can boost the volume and effectiveness of cyber activities without added cost. For the criminals, it offers new avenues for profit and the promise of government protection.\n\n“We’re seeing in each of these countries this trend towards combining nation-state and cybercriminal activities,” said Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president of customer security and trust.\n\nSo far there is no evidence suggesting that Russia, China or Iran are sharing resources with each other or working with the same criminal networks, Burt said. But he said the growing use of private cyber “mercenaries” shows how far America's adversaries will go to weaponize the internet.\n\nMicrosoft's report analyzed cyber threats between July 2023 and June 2024, looking at how criminals and foreign nations are using hacking, spear phishing, malware and other techniques to gain access and control over a target's system. The company says its customers face more than 600 million such incidents every day. \n\nRussia focused much of its cyber operations on Ukraine, trying to gain entry into military and government systems and spreading disinformation designed to undermine support for the war among its allies. \n\nUkraine has responded with its own cyber efforts, including one last week that knocked some Russian state media outlets offline.\n\nNetworks tied to Russia, China and Iran have also targeted American voters, using fake websites and social media accounts to spread false and misleading claims about the 2024 election. Analysts at Microsoft agree with the assessment of U.S. intelligence officials who say Russia is targeting the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, while Iran is working to oppose former President Donald Trump.\n\nIran has also hacked into Trump's campaign and sought, unsuccessfully, to interest Democrats in the material. Federal officials have also accused Iran of covertly supporting American protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nRussia and Iran will likely accelerate the pace of their cyber operations targeting the U.S. as election day approaches, Burt said.\n\nChina, meanwhile, has largely stayed out of the presidential race, focusing its disinformation on down-ballot races for Congress or state and local office. Microsoft found networks tied to Beijing also continue to target Taiwan and other countries in the region.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington said allegations that China partners with cybercriminals are groundless and accused the U.S. of spreading its own “disinformation about the so-called Chinese hacking threats.\"\n\nIn a statement, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said that “our position is consistent and clear. China firmly opposes and combats cyber attacks and cyber theft in all forms.\"\n\nRussia and Iran have also rejected accusations that they're using cyber operations to target Americans. Messages left with representatives of those three nations and North Korea were not immediately returned on Monday. \n\nEfforts to disrupt foreign disinformation and cyber capabilities have escalated along with the threat, but the anonymous, porous nature of the internet sometimes undercuts the effectiveness of the response.\n\nFederal authorities recently announced plans to seize hundreds of website domains used by Russia to spread election disinformation and to support efforts to hack former U.S. military and intelligence figures. But investigators at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab found that sites seized by the government can easily and quickly be replaced.\n\nWithin one day of the Department of Justice seizing several domains in September, for example, researchers spotted 12 new websites created to take their place. One month later, they continue to operate.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But if the two did speak, Trump said, it would be “a smart thing” for the United States.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, was pressed on his communication with the Russian president during a wide-ranging — and sometimes contentious — interview with Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago. Woodward reports in his book “War” that Trump has had as many as seven private phone calls with Putin since leaving the White House and secretly sent the Russian president COVID-19 test machines during the height of the pandemic.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson previously denied the report. During Tuesday's interview, Micklethwait posed the question to Trump directly: \"Can you say yes or no whether you have talked to Vladimir Putin since you stopped being president?\n\n“I don’t comment on that,” Trump responded. “But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing. If I’m friendly with people, if I can have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing and not a bad thing in terms of a country.”\n\nTrump said that Putin, who invaded neighboring Ukraine and who has been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, is well respected in Russia and touted his relationship with him, as well as the authoritarian leaders of North Korea and China.\n\n“Look, I had a very good relationship with President Xi and a very good relationship with Putin, and a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,\" he said. Of Putin, he later added, \"Russia has never had a president that they respect so much.”\n\nWoodward reported that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn’t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed.\n\nTrump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the reporting false. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the reporting about the calls was “not true.”\n\nTrump’s relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. Trump publicly sided with Putin over U.S. intelligence officials on whether Russia had interfered in the 2016 election to help him, and Trump has criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia's attack.\n\nLater in Tuesday's interview, Trump refused to say whether he would commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the November election. He also claimed there was a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election, despite his supporters' violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“Come on. You had a peaceful transfer of power compared to Venezuela,” Micklethwait responded.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The space, with wood floors and exposed pipes, featured small prints set up on easels. Larger landscape photographs were displayed on the walls.\n\nHarris singled out Lindo, who has starred in films and CBS' “The Good Fight,” saying to the gathered crowd: “Delroy has been supporting me for years and years and years,” and adding that the two were both on the debate team at her alma mater, Howard University.\n\nHarris reminded the group that early voting starts in Michigan in four days. Trump, meanwhile, focused on reaching women. He planned to tape a Fox News Channel town hall featuring an all-female audience and moderated by host Harris Faulkner.\n\nHarris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, unveiled his ticket’s plan to improve the lives of rural Americans. It was yet another sign that in a razor-tight race, each side is trying to cut into the other’s margin of support with different voting blocs while shoring up traditional areas of strength.\n\nHarris, too, will appear at a town hall-style event in Detroit hosted by the morning radio program “The Breakfast Club,\" featuring Charlamagne Tha God, who is especially popular with Black males.\n\nThe push comes a day after she announced a series of new proposals dubbed the “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.” The ideas are meant to offer the demographic more economic advantages, including providing forgivable business loans of up to $20,000 for entrepreneurs and creating more apprenticeships. The plan would also support the study of sickle cell and other diseases more common in Black men.\n\nThe focus on Black men sharpened last week when former President Barack Obama campaigned for Harris in Pittsburgh and said he wanted to speak “some truths” to Black male voters, suggesting some \" just aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”\n\nThe vice president’s campaign says it doesn’t believe Black men will flip in large numbers to supporting Trump, especially after strongly backing Democrat Joe Biden, with Harris as his running mate, in 2020. They are more concerned about a measurable percentage of Black males opting not to vote at all.\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, the first Black senator elected from the state of Georgia, issued a stark warning in Atlanta to other Black men that voting for Trump will be “literally dangerous” for them, as the former president heads there for a rally.\n\n“He will be dangerous every time you get in the car and you deal with the issue of driving while Black,” Warnock said.\n\nHe argued that Democrats’ job is to reach Black men who are deciding whether to vote at all. “The issue is folks have got to understand that if you do not vote, it’s a vote for Donald Trump,” Warnock said.\n\nHarris’ campaign has also placed special emphasis on other male voters, including creating “ Hombres con Harris,” or “Men with Harris,” a group that is using celebrities and key elected officials to organize events on her behalf meant to appeal to Hispanic men.\n\nAs she campaigns in Detroit, Harris faces other potential challenges in Michigan, including Arab activists angered by the Biden administration’s full-throated support for Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza. Dearborn, outside Detroit, is the largest Arab-majority city in the U.S.\n\nStill, the vice president's campaign expects to see strong support on Election Day from white, college-educated voters in Michigan at rates that might exceed Biden's in 2020, and she hopes to expand the margin by which Trump lost many of the state's key suburbs four years ago.\n\nShe's also seized on insults Trump made about Detroit last week while campaigning there. He said if Harris wins, “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit.\" He added, \"You’re going to have a mess on your hands.”\n\nTrump has maligned cities hosting him before, but Harris said it was proof he was “unfit to be president.” Her campaign also released an ad voiced by actor Courtney B. Vance, a Detroit native, that declares: “What Donald Trump doesn’t understand, or care to learn, is that when he said, ‘Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president.’ That he should be so ... lucky.”\n\nTrump is scheduled to return to Detroit later this week for a rally.\n\nThe former president figures to do well with rural voters, but team Harris hopes to at least keep things closer. And while Harris’ support among women is strong, Trump aims to keep her from running up the score.\n\nTrump has seen his support among women, especially in the suburbs of many key swing states, soften since his term in the White House. A September AP-NORC poll found more than half of registered voters who are women have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, while only about one-third have a favorable view of Trump.\n\nTo reverse the trend, Trump has sought to cast himself as being able to personally shield women from various threats, as when he suggested at a rally in Pennsylvania last month that women in America, “will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger.”\n\n“You will be protected, and I will be your protector,\" Trump said then. He's also suggested that, should he win, women will no longer have a reason to think about abortion, after three Supreme Court judges that he appointed helped in 2022 to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed a woman's right to the procedure.\n\nIn Chicago before members of the Economic Club, Trump defended his support for high tariffs as an economic cure-all.\n\n“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff,’” Trump told Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, who interviewed him at the event. Micklethwait has repeatedly pressed Trump on warnings from economists that the costs of high tariffs will be passed along to American consumers, raising prices.\n\nAssociated Press writers Bill Barrow in Atlanta and Jill Colvin in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The pivot to music happened after the event was briefly halted twice so people in the crowd could be tended to for medical emergencies.\n\nIf you were burning with curiosity for what songs Trump decided to entertain the crowd to wonder no longer – the playlist was just dropped.

Can It Hold?","text":"Former President Donald Trump appears to have captured the momentum from Vice President Kamala Harris just three weeks before Election Day.With a polling advantage that Harris received following her September 10 debate performance having all but evaporated, the former president has recently received a string of favorable swing state poll results, although most suggest that the contest remains a dead heat.Averages of polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight show that in recent weeks, Trump has expanded his small lead in Arizona, overtaken Harris in North Carolina and pulled to even in Nevada. The ex-president has also narrowed small leads for Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.Craig Agranoff, professor of political marketing at Florida Atlantic University, told Newsweek via text message that \"Trump's momentum in recent polls reflects his ability to tap into core voter concerns like the economy and national security, which tend to dominate in uncertain times.\"Agranoff added, however, that the former president's ability to seize on the opportunity and win on November 5 was anything but certain, with Harris retaining the ability to turn the tables and recapture the momentum.\"Sustaining this momentum until Election Day will require maintaining discipline in his messaging and avoiding controversies that could alienate undecided or moderate voters,\" Agranoff said.\"Harris, on the other hand, still has a pathway to regain ground, but it will depend on a strong, issue-based campaign that focuses on energizing key demographics and presenting a clear contrast to Trump on issues like healthcare and economic equality,\" he added.While Harris has continued to hold an advantage over Trump in national polling since shortly after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her on July 21, her lead has slipped slightly despite a recent media blitz.As of Tuesday, the vice president was leading Trump by 2.4 percentage points in the national FiveThirtyEight average, down from a 3.3 point lead on September 18.University of Kentucky political science professor D. Stephen Voss said that polling was \"going to bounce up and down a bit between now and Election Day\" in an email to Newsweek, while warning against drawing too many conclusions from polls.\"The temptation will be to try to attach interpretations to every swing up or down in a candidate's polling, but most of the time, short-term fluctuations in polling are not meaningful,\" Voss said. \"Poll respondents do not make their decisions in exactly the same way voters ultimately do.\"\"Poll respondents are more likely to go with their guts, expressing however they're feeling about the most-recent campaign events or messages, but by the time voters settle on an actual choice, they're usually reaching down deeper into their political leanings,\" he continued.Voss went on to express doubts regarding the Trump campaign's strategy of winning the election with \"very high levels of support from men who have voted for Democrats in the past,\" saying that it \"isn't impossible, but it's a lot to ask from a campaign strategy.\"But there have been some other recent indications that the former president is gaining ground. Trump's odds from online betting platforms, which are based on wagers made on candidates rather than polling data, have improved significantly over the past two weeks.Polymarket, which was funded in part by early Trump backer Peter Thiel, gave the ex-president a 58 percent chance of winning back the White House as of Tuesday afternoon. Harris and Trump were tied on the platform as recently as October 4.","summary":"Trump appears to have seized the momentum from Vice President Kamala Harris three weeks before Election Day.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-got-momentum-can-it-hold-1969565","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2495711/donald-trumps-got-momentum-can-it-hold.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-15 21:35:46","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.036}]}
