{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":24747,"news":[{"id":399868518,"title":"Factbox: Jeffrey Epstein's ties to politicians, business titans and other figures","text":"The U.S. Justice Department’s release of millions of internal documents related to Jeffrey Epstein has revealed the late financier and sex offender’s ties to many prominent people in politics, finance, academia and business – both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution charges, including soliciting an underage girl.\n\nEvidence in multiple legal and criminal cases has also shed light on these connections. Epstein was arrested again in 2019 on federal charges of sex trafficking of minors. His 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe Justice Department has said that the material could include faked images or untrue allegations, as well as pornographic material. On Monday, the department said it had removed several thousand documents that inadvertently identified some of Epstein’s victims.\n\nThe Justice Department’s No. 2 official, Todd Blanche, has said the material did not amount to evidence of criminal sexual activity by those named in the files.\n\nHere are some of the prominent people whose ties to Epstein were revealed in the newly released material.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nTrump socialized extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, and is quoted in a magazine profile during that period as saying that Epstein likes women “on the younger side.” Documents released by the Justice Department include photos of Trump with several women whose faces are redacted and a suggestive note to Epstein, framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to bear Trump’s signature. Evidence and testimony submitted in the 2021 trial of Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell indicate Trump traveled on Epstein’s plane multiple times. Epstein wrote in one email that Trump “knew about the girls,” though it is not clear what he meant.\n\nThe Republican president has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and says he broke off ties in the early 2000s, before Epstein’s plea deal. Trump denies ever flying on Epstein’s plane and says the suggestive note was faked.\n\nBill Clinton\n\nThe Democratic former U.S. president socialized with Epstein and flew on his plane several times in the early 2000s, after Clinton left office. Photos released by the Justice Department show him swimming and posing with women whose faces are redacted. Clinton has denied wrongdoing and says he regrets his past association with Epstein.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor\n\nThe former Prince Andrew, Duke of York, maintained a social relationship with Epstein and has been stripped of his royal title due to the association. The Justice Department sought his cooperation in multiple criminal investigations but was rebuffed. He also settled a lawsuit brought by one of Epstein’s victims in 2022, making an undisclosed payment without admitting wrongdoing. The Justice Department files include several photos of him with women, including one where he is kneeling over a woman and another showing him lying across the laps of several women.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing and has expressed regret for his friendship with Epstein. He has said he never saw any sex crimes.\n\nHoward Lutnick\n\nTrump’s Commerce Secretary apparently visited Epstein’s private island for lunch in 2012 and invited him to a fundraiser in 2015 for Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential election, emails show. That would contradict Lutnick’s claim that he vowed never to “be in a room” with Epstein following a 2005 incident in which the financier showed Lutnick a massage table at his townhouse and made a sexually suggestive comment. The former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO lived next door to Epstein in New York at the time. A Commerce Department spokesperson said Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and has never been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nThe billionaire Tesla TSLA.O CEO asked Epstein if he had any parties planned on his island in 2012 but apparently decided not to visit. Epstein responded that “the ratio on my island” might make Musk’s female companion uncomfortable, without elaborating further. Musk invited Epstein to visit him for drinks on another island a few days later, but it is unclear whether they met up. Musk said on Saturday he had few interactions with Epstein and turned down repeated invitations to visit the island or fly on Epstein’s plane.\n\nLarry Summers\n\nThe former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president flew on Epstein’s jet several times as far back as 1998 and met with him to discuss economic and business matters while he served as president of Harvard. The two maintained a relationship as late as 2019, when email communications show Summers soliciting advice about a romantic interest. No evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced, but Summers stepped down from positions at Harvard, OpenAI and other prominent institutions in November following the release of those documents.\n\nSummers said in November he was “deeply ashamed” of his actions and said he would step back from public commitments to “repair relationships with the people closest to me.”\n\nKevin Warsh\n\nTrump’s nominee to head the Federal Reserve appeared in an email from a publicist to Epstein listing 43 people, including celebrities such as Martha Stewart, headed to a Christmas gathering in 2010. It was not clear whether Warsh knew Epstein or why Epstein was sent the note, and Warsh has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nMelania Trump\n\nThe files include a 2002 email from Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, to Maxwell about a magazine piece on Epstein. “You look great,” the email says.\n\nThe documents indicate Gates and Epstein met repeatedly after Epstein’s prison term to discuss expanding the Microsoft MSFT.O founder’s philanthropic efforts. They also include pictures of the Microsoft founder posing with women whose faces are redacted. Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and has said it was a mistake to meet with him.\n\nThe former JPMorgan and Barclays BARC.L executive is listed as a participant in Epstein-hosted gatherings. He exchanged around 1,200 emails with Epstein between 2008 and 2012, some of which contained discussions about Disney characters and photographs of young women, according to court documents. Staley has denied knowing about Epstein’s criminal activities. He was banned from the UK financial industry and has been sued by JPMorgan, which claims he concealed information about Epstein’s misconduct.\n\nPeter Mandelson\n\nUK police say they are reviewing reports of alleged misconduct involving the veteran British politician following the release of emails suggesting he had leaked discussions on possible UK asset sales and tax changes to Epstein during the financial crash, and that Epstein had recorded payments to Mandelson or his then-partner. He was fired as ambassador to the United States last year after an earlier batch of emails showed him calling Epstein “my best pal” and advising him on seeking early jail release. Mandelson has apologized to Epstein’s victims. He has denied wrongdoing.\n\nPeter Attia\n\nThe wellness influencer’s name appears more than 1,700 times in the latest trove of documents released by the Justice Department. He said on social media he met with Epstein seven or eight times at his New York City home between 2014 and 2019, but never witnessed illegal activity or saw Epstein accompanied by anyone who appeared to be underage.\n\nThe head of the powerful Wall Street law firm Paul Weiss stepped down after emails revealed longstanding personal and business communications with Epstein through 2019. Karp attended dinners with Epstein and sought his help getting a job on a Woody Allen film, the emails show. The firm said Karp regrets his interactions with Epstein and never witnessed or participated in any misconduct.\n\nBorge Brende \n\nThe head of the World Economic Forum is under internal investigation following revelations that he attended dinners with Epstein in 2018 and 2019 and emailed with him. Brende said he would not have participated had he known about Epstein’s criminal record.\n\nCasey Wasserman\n\nThe top U.S. official overseeing the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles is facing calls to step down after the release of flirtatious emails between him and Maxwell as early as 2003. Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with Epstein.\n\nNorwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit \n\nThe spouse of the heir to Norway’s throne apologized for her extensive email correspondence with Epstein, saying she showed poor judgment.\n\nAriane de Rothschild \n\nThe head of the family-owned Edmond de Rothschild Swiss bank agreed to multiple meetings with Epstein in New York and Paris before his 2019 arrest, emails show. They do not contain any sign of criminal wrongdoing, and a spokesperson for the bank said she had no knowledge of his conduct.\n\nKathy Ruemmler \n\nGoldman Sachs’ top lawyer, a former White House counsel to Democratic President Barack Obama, accepted gifts from Epstein and gave him public relations advice between 2014 and 2019, emails show. She says she dealt with him as a defense attorney and was not aware of any ongoing criminal conduct.\n\n—Reporting by Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Craig Timberg, Will Dunham and Matthew Lewis","url":"https://interaksyon.philstar.com/politics-issues/2026/02/06/308863/factbox-jeffrey-epsteins-ties-to-politicians-business-titans-and-other-figures/","image":"https://media.interaksyon.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trump-epstein-poster-greenland.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 09:19:58","author":"Andy Sullivan","authors":["Andy Sullivan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.492},{"id":399845482,"title":"Cuba willing to talk to US, &#8216;without pressure&#8217; as fuel shortage continues","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel attends an Act of Solidarity with Venezuela, in Havana on October 17, 2025. Diaz-Canel on Sunday rebuffed US President Donald Trump’s threat against his country, vowing to defend it following Washington’s capture of the leader of his ally Venezuela. (Photo: AFP) \n\n Latest News, Regional \n\nFebruary 5, 2026\n\n\n\n\n Cuba willing to talk to US, ‘without pressure’ as fuel shortage continues \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHAVANA, Cuba (AFP) — Cuba is prepared to hold dialogue with the United States (US) but not under pressure, President Miguel Diaz-Canel insisted Thursday after months of threats from US President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has vowed to cut off Cuba’s access to oil and stated the communist island was “ready to fall” as he warned it to “make a deal” with Washington “BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”\n\nThe Republican did not say what kind of a deal he was after, but has repeatedly stated the two countries were in negotiations, which Havana has denied.\n\n“Cuba is willing to engage in dialogue with the United States, a dialogue on any topic… but without pressure or preconditions,” Diaz-Canel said on state TV and radio.\n\nHe said any talks must take place “from a position of equals, with respect for our sovereignty, our independence, and our self-determination” and without “interference in our internal affairs.”\n\nTrump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the Miami-born son of Cuban exiles, have made no secret of their desire to bring about regime change in Havana.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday: “I think the fact that the Cuban government is on its last leg and its country is about to collapse, they should be wise in their statements directed towards the president of the United States.”\n\nAsked about Cuba’s denial of the existence of negotiations, she said her boss was “always willing to engage in diplomacy and I believe that is something that is taking place, in fact, with the Cuban government.”\n\nCuba, in the grips of an economic crisis, had long relied on oil supplies from Venezuela, whose leader was ousted in a deadly US military operation last month.\n\nTrump subsequently claimed to have taken control of Venezuelan oil, vowed to starve Cuba of the commodity, and threatened tariffs on any other nation stepping in to help US-sanctioned Havana.\n\nThe pressure tactics threaten to plunge Cuba into complete darkness as its power plants struggle to keep the lights on due to fuel shortages.\n\nEarlier Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people in the country’s east were left without electricity for hours after an electricity grid failure.\n\nDiaz-Canel insisted his country still had friends, which he did not name, as it confronts what he described as an “acute fuel shortage.”\n\n“We cannot openly explain everything we are doing,” he said, but “Cuba is not alone.”\n\nHe said energy production from diesel- and oil-powered generators has been “zero” for weeks.\n\nMexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said this week that her country was using all available diplomatic channels to ensure a resumption of crude shipments to Cuba, but would not put itself at risk of punitive US tariffs.\n\nDiaz-Canel said the pressure that Cuba found itself under highlighted the importance of its drive for greener energy and reducing reliance on others.\n\nCuban officials blame US sanctions for Cuba’s worst economic crisis in decades, marked by shortages of fuel, food and medicine.\n\nBut observers say poor economic management and a tourism collapse following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the island’s woes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Cuba fuel United States

Most foreign correspondent positions are being eliminated, one of them told AFP, and media reports said that hundreds of journalists are impacted. (Photo by Eric BARADAT / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nFebruary 5, 2026\n\n\n\n\n ‘Save the Post’: Hundreds protest cuts at famed US newspaper \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — Several hundred people rallied outside The Washington Post headquarters on Thursday to protest its decision to lay off hundreds of journalists, including most of its overseas staff.\n\n“Democracy dies in darkness. And you, Jeff Bezos, have turned off the lights,” a sign at the demonstration read, referring to the newspaper’s front-page slogan and its billionaire owner, who has become close to US President Donald Trump during the Republican’s second term.\n\nThe sweeping cuts at the Post announced on Wednesday came as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits against media organisations.\n\nREAD: Washington Post announces ‘painful’ job cuts\n\n“In a time where we’ve seen unprecedented attacks on the press, and anti- or negative sentiment toward journalists for just doing their jobs, it’s dangerous to cut staff this way,” said Michael Brice-Saddler, who covered the US capital for the Post and has now been laid off.\n\n“These cuts are not the fault of our staff, yet they are the ones who bear the brunt of the cost. They lose resources, they lose the ability to tell stories that are meaningful to Washington,” Brice-Saddler said.\n\nThe Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported that approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off.\n\nMost of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent, as the war with Russia grinds on.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back, and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nBezos reined in the newspaper’s liberal-leaning editorial page and blocked an endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election — breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence.

It marks a significant shift towards greater scrutiny of royal matters after decades of deference to the centuries-old monarchy. Parliament's Public Accounts Committee will later this year launch an inquiry after reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had been paying only a token \"peppercorn\" rent on Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion on the Windsor estate, since he moved in in 2003. Andrew finally left the property on Monday following a new flood of scandalous emails released by US authorities last week which revealed excruciating details of his close ties to convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. King Charles III last year stripped his younger brother of all royal titles and honours, amid growing outrage over Andrew's friendship with Epstein. The Windsor estate is managed by the independent property company, the Crown Estate, a commercial business that operates separately to the government and the royal household. It is not the monarch's private property, and its profits go entirely into the public purse. The date of the parliamentary inquiry is not yet known, but in a letter to the Crown Estate, the committee chairman Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said MPs were \"concerned\" whether the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge were \"achieving the best value for money\". \"Any reduced income ... reduces the Crown Estate's annual surplus and therefore would be a cost to taxpayers,\" he added, asking a series of questions about the arrangements. Marsh Farm, on King Charles's private Sandringham estate, is due to be the next residence of the former prince Andrew (768x512, AR: 1.50)Andrew has now moved to a property on the Sandringham estate in remote eastern Norfolk, owned privately by the king who is funding his brother's move, rent and living costs. But these revelations have shone a light on the royal family's complex financial arrangements. The inquiry \"marks a shift in the constitutional balance between parliament and the monarchy,\" said Francesca Jackson, a PhD researcher focusing on the constitutional monarchy at Lancaster University. \"For a long time, the monarchy has escaped scrutiny, but things are changing,\" she told AFP. Norman Baker, a former Liberal Democrat MP, agreed Andrew's situation has \"opened the door\" to greater questioning of the monarchy. His new book \"Royal Mint, National Debt: The Shocking Truth about the Royals\" examines \"the real cost\" of the monarchy to British taxpayers. - Soaring costs - The Sovereign Grant, the annual public subsidy to working royals, has risen dramatically since 2011, when the funding formula was changed to link it to Crown Estate profits. Currently, the royal family receives back from the Treasury 12 percent of the Crown Estate's profits. \"The official grant was £7.9 million a year in 2011. Fourteen years later, it's £132.1 million. You don't have to be a Republican to find that sort of increase obscene,\" Baker told AFP. Britain's William, Prince of Wales and his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales, are among seven working royals, who receive an annual public subsidy (768x512, AR: 1.50)Much of the increase is due to a windfall from leasing the UK's seabeds, owned by the estate, to wind farms which has boosted profits. Parliamentary documents show the grant is predicted to rise further, to £137.9 million in 2026-2027. Baker argues the increase contradicts the king's stated aim of \"a slimmed-down monarchy\". \"What he means by that is fewer people on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Well, so what? We haven't got slimmed-down costs. The cost is going up relentlessly every year.\" AFP reached out to Buckingham Palace, which declined to comment. But monarchists counter saying the Crown Estate's profits paid to the Treasury have soared from about £240 million in 2011-2012 to a record £1.1 billion in 2024-2025. According to the government website, the Crown Estate has paid £5 billion to the Exchequer in the last decade. \"The monarchy is an amazing bargain,\" royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told AFP. He argues the cost calculations ignore unquantifiable factors, particularly the monarchy's global influence and \"soft power\". Fitzwilliams highlighted the king's role in hosting US President Donald Trump at Windsor last year, amid trade negotiations, as an example of the monarchy's wide-ranging influence. - Tax questions - Baker however also pointed to royal tax exemptions as further evidence of a lack of financial transparency. These include inheritance tax and corporate and capital gains tax on the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, the private estates that generate income for both the king and heir to the throne, Prince William. Both men pay income tax on the revenue from their duchies, but the amounts are not disclosed, although when Charles was heir to the throne he did reveal how much tax he paid. \"In the end Britons are in the dark about the true cost of their monarchy,\" Baker said. adm/mp/jkb/yad/cms","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/uk-royal-finances-in-spotlight-after-andrews-downfall-1724178274","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/100813c/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x511+0+0/resize/768x511!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6a%2F1b%2F152c9271e2b639b763517eeb03f1%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:51:05","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.301},{"id":399871144,"title":"Donald Trump issues warning to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei ahead of Oman talks","text":"He should be very worried: Donald Trump issues warning to Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei ahead of Oman talks\n\nWashington DC: United States President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, stating that ‘he should be very worried’ as Washington and Tehran are \n\n Published: February 6, 2026 7:15 AM IST \n\n ‘He should be very worried’: Donald Trump issues warning to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei ahead of Oman talks\nWashington DC: United States President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, stating that ‘he should be very worried’ as Washington and Tehran are gearing up to resume nuclear talks this week. During an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, the US President was asked whether Iran’s supreme leader should be concerned.

The warnings come as Yerevan tries to reorientate its foreign policy away from Moscow towards the West, while also seeking to mend relations with Azerbaijan after losing two wars for control of the Karabakh region, disputed for decades. Russia's influence across the former Soviet Union has been strained since its invasion of Ukraine, which has spooked many of the countries that were for decades ruled by Moscow. Armenia is formally an ally of Russia but has suspended its participation in a regional security pact over allegations Moscow did not come to its aid in the conflict with Azerbaijan. With the opposition fractured and largely unpopular, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's party is expected to come out on top in the June poll. But his pro-Western foreign policy has angered Moscow. Armenia's foreign intelligence service said in a report last month that large-scale \"malign information operations by external actors\" were under way, including the circulation of false information and conspiracy theories aimed at \"influencing the votes\". \"Overt activities are usually conducted by foreign state or government bodies, including special services and associated resources,\" it said, without naming the states it believed were involved. Analysts are in little doubt about where the campaigns come from. \"Russia is dissatisfied with Armenia,\" independent analyst Benjamin Matevosyan told AFP, adding that Moscow perceives Pashinyan's rapprochement with the West as an \"anti-Russian project that would be used against Russia\". Gegham Vardanyan, of the Media Initiatives Center, said \"hybrid information warfare has intensified alongside Armenia's changing relations with Russia\". Armenia's intelligence service said the activity also seeks to \"strip the opportunity for peace\" with Baku after the two sides initialled a peace agreement last year under mediation by the US President Donald Trump. - 'Clone sites' - Yerevan has in recent years frozen its participation in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation and has moved to deepen ties with the European Union and the United States. But cultural, linguistic and economic ties to Russia are still significant. Russia's influence across the former Soviet Union has been strained since its invasion of Ukraine (768x550, AR: 1.40)\"Russian state television channels remain accessible in Armenia, alongside the Russian state outlet Sputnik and local media that prioritise Kremlin narratives,\" Vardanyan said. He also cited evidence of activity by \"Russian-linked hacker groups,\" including Fancy Bear, also known as APT28, which has previously targeted Armenian military personnel and diplomats. Vardanyan said disinformation campaigns often rely on imitation media outlets -- so-called \"clone sites\" -- designed to resemble reputable Western publications. In one case, a fake French-language website falsely claimed that Paris was shipping nuclear waste to Armenia. Another French-language website, \"Infodu Jour\" -- designed in the style of legitimate outlet \"Info du jour\" -- spread a false report claiming that Pashinyan had purchased a luxury mansion in France. Russian and Azerbaijani outlets have also published stories alleging officials from the EU monitoring mission in Armenia were spies. Vardanyan said social media narratives adopt \"a single core message: cooperation with the West is dangerous for Armenia\". - 'Enemies of freedom' - The wave of disinformation has drawn a fiery response from officials. \"The enemies of freedom do not sleep. We must acknowledge that they can be very creative, they are ready to pump millions of dollars into propaganda machines and illegal schemes of interference,\" Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said after the publication of the intelligence services' report. US President Donald Trump has sought to push Armenia and Azerbaijan closer to an elusive peace deal (768x511, AR: 1.50)He acknowledged the \"delicate line\" between upholding freedom of the press and confronting \"malign actors\", warning the issues was likely to \"increase\" ahead of the parliamentary elections. Moscow is not the only alleged source of the disinformation. Vardanyan said information attacks were also coming from Azerbaijan and its close ally, Turkey. The European Union has allocated 15 million euros ($17.7 million) to help counter disinformation. But Samvel Martirosyan, a media expert specialising in information security, warned outside assistance is likely to be weaponised by disinformation actors. \"Armenia has effectively found itself in a swamp of hybrid warfare, and the situation is made worse by internal actors who become links in this chain,\" he added. mkh-im/jc/phz/mjw","url":"https://today.rtl.lu/news/world/diplomatic-shift-and-elections-see-armenia-battle-russian-disinformation-1312567121","image":"https://static-prod.rtl.lu/dims4/default/68dfc00/2147483647/strip/false/crop/768x512+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frtl-luxembourg-new-production-web.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fed%2F9e6dad5c2c4534480c5e1679c7d1%2F","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:41:57","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"lu","sentiment":0.184},{"id":399872210,"title":"Party or politics? All eyes on Bad Bunny at Super Bowl","text":"The argument that sport and politics should not mix could be tested at the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, when Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny performs against a backdrop of fury from right-wing critics. One week after capturing headlines at the Grammys, where he won top Album of the Year honors and delivered a searing indictment of the US government's immigration crackdown, the 31-year-old will be back in the national spotlight at the NFL's biggest game in California. The crackle of anticipation about Bad Bunny's performance -- and the question of whether the singer will use his platform to renew his criticism of President Donald Trump's administration in front of tens of millions of viewers -- is palpable. Prediction site Polymarket is taking bets on whether the star will drop an F-bomb to disparage the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on live television. While the odds are firmly against -- just nine percent, as of Thursday -- the wager underscores the balancing act faced by the National Football League as it prepares for its most-watched broadcast of the year. The league has been in the crosshairs of critics ever since Bad Bunny was announced to headline the show back in September, with former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski decrying the \"shameful\" choice of an artist \"who just seems to hate America.\" Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny led the charge among artists calling for 'ICE out' at the Grammys, in reference to the immigration crackdown that is causing controversy across the United States (768x475, AR: 1.62)Trump, who attended the Super Bowl last year but is staying away this time, recently called this year's entertainment lineup \"a terrible choice\" that will \"sow hatred.\" Also featuring in the opening ceremony of Super Bowl LX -- in which the New England Patriots play the Seattle Seahawks -- will be rock band Green Day, who have been vociferous critics of Trump for years. Right-wing political organization Turning Point USA has even organized an alternative \"All-American Halftime Show\" featuring artists including Kid Rock. - Expanding NFL audience - NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has remained steadfastly unmoved by the criticism surrounding Bad Bunny's Super Bowl appearance (768x512, AR: 1.50)The NFL has remained steadfastly unmoved by the backlash. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell this week described Bad Bunny as \"one of the great artists of the world\" and downplayed the suggestion Sunday's show could turn political, saying he expects the performance to \"unite people.\" The wildly popular Bad Bunny -- real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio -- steered clear of politics when talking about this weekend's performance at a press conference in San Francisco on Thursday. Instead, he indicated he plans to make the occasion a \"huge party.\" \"I want to bring to the stage of course a lot of my culture,\" he said. \"But I don't want to give any spoilers. It's gonna be fun and it's gonna be a party.\" While Bad Bunny's presence at the Super Bowl has antagonized political critics on the right, analysts say the choice of the entertainer reflects the NFL's broader strategy of expanding the sport's global fan base. \"The NFL knew that they would receive criticism from a certain sector of its fan base,\" said Albert Laguna, an associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale University. \"But it's obvious that when they conducted a thorough review of the pros and cons, the reach of Bad Bunny and the benefits of that expanded audience outweighed any criticism.\" The NFL has sought to expand its global profile, with games played in Brazil, Mexico and Spain (768x512, AR: 1.50)A growing number of NFL regular season games are now held overseas, with fixtures in recent months in Brazil and Spain. \"The NFL, are not idiots. They've crunched the numbers,\" said Patrick Bennett, global chief creative officer at marketing firm Jack Morton. \"They know where they're saturated in the marketplace.

In the interview, Trump was asked directly about Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the mounting pressure on Tehran from Washington and regional actors. \"I would say he should be very worried, yeah. He should be,\" Trump said, underscoring the administration's increasingly tough rhetoric toward Iran even as diplomatic contacts continue. Meanwhile, Iran has conditionally agreed to hold talks with the US to avert the threat of further military strikes, CNN reported. The push for renewed diplomacy comes after weeks of escalatory rhetoric between Washington and Tehran. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that unless Iran agrees to a deal on its nuclear program, \"bad things\" could happen, a message that has been amplified by the movement of a US carrier strike group and other military assets into the Middle East. According to CNN, the discussions are expected to be held in Oman. Iran's ISNA news agency also reported Oman as the venue for talks on Friday. Iran's top military commander asserted that the country has bolstered its deterrence capabilities through upgrades to domestically produced ballistic missile systems. Providing context to the remarks, Iranian state broadcaster Press TV reported that on Wednesday, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Abdolrahim Mousavi made the comments during a visit to a missile facility operated by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), accompanied by IRGC Aerospace Force commander Brigadier General Majid Mousavi. Describing the scope of the upgrades, Mousavi noted, \"By upgrading its ballistic missiles in all technical dimensions, Iran has been able to strengthen its deterrence power,\" during the tour.

He said some of the comments said that the restaurant had roaches, that customers found hair in their food, and that the bartenders didn’t speak English.\n\nNone of these comments were true, according to Carlson.\n\nIt turned out that the reviews stemmed from a viral video of conservative influencer Jake Lang posted of him being kicked out of a restaurant named BLVD Tavern — in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nThe video shows the restaurant removing Lang from the establishment. Lang claimed he was kicked out because he supported U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and President Donald Trump.\n\nLang tagged the Kansas City restaurant with the same name in his original post, Carlson said, telling his followers to essentially “go after these people.” This ultimately led to the BLVD Tavern in Kansas City getting swarmed with calls, emails and negative reviews. He said that they were receiving calls from people who supported ICE, but also from people who opposed ICE.\n\n“We were worried about the safety of our staff, just because in the climate that we’re in today, who knows if someone takes such offense to that, then they come in here with a gun or something,” Carlson told The Star. He said that many of the callers were threatening to harm the staff that were in the video.\n\nLang reached out and apologized to Carlson for the mistake. Carlson said that nobody has come into his establishment to cause trouble, but he was worried how much of their business would be impacted by this mistake.\n\n“This potentially could have had lasting ramifications for us. We were worried that people weren’t even going to come in this week, just because of all this taking place,” he said. “We’ve had numerous people come in here this week, so we’re definitely happy to see that.”\n\nCarlson said that Yelp and Google helped take down the negative reviews on his restaurant.\n\nThe Minnesota incident comes during an increase in federal agents patrolling the state, which led to the the killing of Renée Good, who was previously a Kansas City resident.\n\nCarlson hopes that this incident is simply a “flash in the pan type of thing.” He insisted that his establishment is a place where everyone is welcome in.\n\n“We’re just trying to provide a place that people can come in, have some food, some drinks, and enjoy each other’s company. That’s our main goal,” he said. “We’re a mom-and-pop location, we’re just trying to provide for our family, and we’re not trying to get into political space, we’re trying to stay away from that.”\n\nCarlson also asks people to “do a little bit of research before reaching out and trying to harass businesses,” especially local ones.","url":"https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article314592542.html","image":"https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/9nmj0f/picture314594169/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/food%20review%20blvd%20tavern%20tll_04.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:34:09","author":"Rashad Alexander","authors":["Rashad Alexander"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.313},{"id":399868372,"title":"US steps up aid to Cuba while choking off fuel supply","text":"WASHINGTON/HAVANA, Feb 5 - The U.S. will provide an extra $6 million in humanitarian aid to Cuba, the top State Department aid official said on Thursday, even as Washington has stepped up efforts to block oil supplies to the Caribbean island nation, causing crippling shortages.\n\nAid official Jeremy Lewin said at a news conference the new U.S. commitment would bring to $9 million the amount of assistance provided to the people of Cuba since Hurricane Melissa struck in October.\n\nThe aid is being delivered by the Catholic Church and Lewin said Cuba's communist party authorities had so far not interfered with its distribution.\n\nCuba's deputy foreign minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio called the move two-faced.\n\n\"Quite hypocritical to apply draconian coercive measures denying basic economic conditions to millions and then to announce soup & cans for a few,\" de Cossio said on social media.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said Cuba will no longer receive oil from Venezuela after the U.S. operation to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro last month, and has threatened to impose tariffs on other suppliers like Mexico if they continue to ship fuel to the island.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said earlier on Thursday his government would roll out temporary measures in the next week to deal with fuel shortages amid blackouts in several provinces.\n\nDespite the U.S. moves on oil imports, Lewin argued that the humanitarian crisis in Cuba, which goes beyond the damage from Hurricane Melissa, was the fault of Cuba's government.\n\n\"It's because the government can't, you know, put food on the shelves ...

At least the president’s abuse of the pardon power may be “one issue that is both so obviously in need of reform and potentially prone to abuse by all future presidents, that reform should be achievable across party lines.”\n\nAtkins pointed out that gradual democratic backsliding under Trump goes much further than pardons, and it remains a product of the executive branch’s “direct flouting of the law.\" He asserted that Trump violates laws and direct judicial orders only to be rescued later by the Supreme Court, “without penalty or consequence.”\n\n“This is because 1) the framers of the Constitution did not anticipate that a man of such ill character as Trump would gain office, … but also 2) they expected that a lawless Executive would be countered by a Legislative Branch that jealously guarded its power as a coequal branch,” said Atkins. “One consequence of the devolution of the conservative movement into a cult of personality around Donald Trump is that almost no Republicans remain who dare to challenge the president.”\n\nThe framers, he said, expected a president who so avariciously abused the pardon power to be impeached, “but Republicans in Congress refuse to fulfill their constitutional role.”\n\n“Meanwhile, the pardon power in the hands of a ruthlessly criminal president is the skeleton key to a dictatorship,” said Atkins. “So long as his allies in Congress refuse to impeach, a criminal president could repeatedly, openly and intentionally violate the law and order his accomplices to do likewise, with promises of infinite pardons to follow.”\n\n“Only the threat of state-level prosecutions might dissuade his minions, but many of the worst crimes Executive Branch officials can commit are covered more by federal law than state law,” Atkins added. “The pardon power, combined with the Supreme Court’s ruling that a president has immunity for all ‘official acts’ conducted while in office, functionally allows a president to rule as a tyrant. So the power itself must be curtailed.”\n\nThis would require a constitutional amendment.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia will continue with a “responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons”, adding that “of course, it will be guided primarily by its national interests”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said US and Russian delegations, who were in Abu Dhabi to discuss the war in Ukraine, reportedly also discussed extending the New START treaty for six months.\n\n“It would be an informal handshake deal as the treaty itself doesn’t allow for any further extensions,” Rattansi said.\n\n“Once that extension is in place, though, the aim is to begin formal discussions to craft an updated nuclear deal between the two countries,” he said.\n\nRecent bouts of fighting between nuclear-armed states such as India and Pakistan have unnerved analysts, who worry about the erosion of taboos and treaties meant to restrain the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.\n\nPutin also previously suggested that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to Western efforts to support Ukraine, causing alarm among observers.\n\nThe first START agreement was signed by the US and the former Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nA treaty titled New START was signed by former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, limiting each country to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles and bombers deployed and ready for use.\n\nThat deal was extended for another five years in 2021, following an agreement between Putin and then US-President Joe Biden.","url":"https://puertoricotribune.com/trump-rejects-call-from-russias-putin-to-extend-cap-on-nuclear-deployments/","image":"https://puertoricotribune.com/app/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250815__69N83U4__v1__HighRes__UsUkraineRussiaConflictSummitTrumpPutin-1770337056-UoKG36.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:30:37","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pr","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":399867522,"title":"Iran, US Prepare For Oman Talks After Deadly Protest Crackdown","text":"Muscat: Iran and the United States were preparing for talks on Friday in Oman, with Washington looking to see if there was any prospect of diplomatic progress on the Iranian nuclear programme and other issues while refusing to rule out military action. The talks -- finally confirmed by both sides late Wednesday after uncertainty over the location, timing and format -- will be the first such encounter between the two foes since the United States joined Israel's war against the Islamic republic in June with strikes on nuclear sites. President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi are due to lead their delegations at the negotiations in the discreet Gulf sultanate, which has periodically acted as a mediator between the countries. Iranian state news agency IRNA reported late Thursday that Araghchi had arrived in Muscat for the talks. Iran's foreign ministry said Thursday evening that it had a \"responsibility not to miss any opportunity to use diplomacy\" to preserve peace, adding it hoped Washington would participate in the discussions \"with responsibility, realism and seriousness\". The meeting comes just under a month after the peak of a wave of nationwide protests in Iran against the clerical leadership, which rights groups say were repressed with an unprecedented crackdown that has left thousands dead. \"They're negotiating,\" Trump said of Iran on Thursday. \"They don't want us to hit them, we have a big fleet going there,\" he added, referring to the aircraft carrier group he has repeatedly called an \"armada\". Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters and even told demonstrators \"help is on its way\". But his rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear programme, which the West fears is aimed at making a bomb. US Vice President JD Vance told SiriusXM in an interview broadcast Wednesday that Trump would \"keep his options open\". \"He is going to talk to everybody, he is going to try to accomplish what he can through non-military means and if he feels like the military is the only option then he is ultimately going to choose that,\" Vance said. 'Inflexibility' towards US demands German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, speaking in the Qatari capital Doha, urged Iran's leadership to \"truly enter talks\", saying there was a \"great fear of military escalation in the region\". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quoted by Turkish newspapers as saying: \"So far, I see that the parties want to make room for diplomacy,\" adding that conflict was \"not the solution\". There had been tensions in the run-up to the talks over whether the meeting should also include regional countries and address Tehran's support of proxies and its ballistic missile programmes, two US concerns that Iran resisted. Citing unnamed Iranian officials, the New York Times said the United States agreed the talks would exclude regional actors, and while the meeting would focus on the nuclear issue, it would also discuss missiles and militant groups \"with the goal of coming up with a framework for a deal\". \"Iran continues to show inflexibility toward addressing US demands, which reduces the likelihood that Iran and the United States will be able to reach a diplomatic solution,\" the US-based Institute for the Study of War said. With the American threats of military action still looming, the United States has maneuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region, while Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases if attacked. \"We are ready to defend and it is the US president who must choose between compromise or war,\" state television on Thursday quoted army spokesman General Mohammad Akraminia as saying, warning that Iran has \"easy\" access to US regional bases.","summary":"The talks will be the first such encounter between the two foes since the United States joined Israel's war against the Islamic republic in June with strikes on nuclear sites","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/iran-us-prepare-for-oman-talks-after-deadly-protest-crackdown-1935319","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2026/02/06/2007196-us.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:30:29","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.076},{"id":399869724,"title":"TrumpRx debuts with several dozen discounted drugs","text":"The company said in an email that it is working with drugmakers to “host and operationalize the pricing agreements they have with the administration.”\n\n“TrumpRx does not sell or dispense drugs,” GoodRx said in a press release. “Instead, TrumpRx facilitates consumer access to the selected discount, and then the underlying partner platform executes the pricing.”\n\nDrug pricing experts have questioned if current law allows purchases facilitated by the website to count toward health care deductibles. More Americans have been signing up for high-deductible health care plans in recent years.\n\n“Americans can use TrumpRx to purchase drugs in cash (outside of their insurance),” the website FAQ states.\n\nJeffrey Singer, a health policy expert at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, said that direct-to-consumer drug sales can help lower prices by exposing patients to the cost of medicines and forcing more price competition.\n\n“But a government-run platform isn’t necessary to achieve that goal,” Singer said in a statement. “Private firms are already expanding direct-to-consumer options, and federal involvement risks crowding out competition and introducing political favoritism into a market that might finally be becoming more consumer-driven.”\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Citizen also criticized TrumpRx, asserting people without insurance will not be able to afford drug prices sold at a high cash price.\n\n“But drugmakers certainly will appreciate TrumpRx’s free promotion of their products, delivered with a false veneer of price accountability,” Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen Access to Medicines director, said in a statement. “TrumpRx is designed to help Big Pharma keep its prices high by diluting the bargaining power of insurance companies, weakening an important check on pharma.”\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats argue a better approach to lower drug prices in the U.S. is to expand Medicare drug price negotiations established by former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“The reality is Donald Trump is a paper tiger when it comes to actually lowering prescription drug costs,” Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said at a Wednesday press conference.\n\nBut more changes could be on the horizon.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration unveiled a proposed consent agreement with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts that calls for the drug benefit middleman to provide coverage to TrumpRx offerings if the regulatory and legal landscape allows. That likely means Congress would need to act to open the door to direct-to-consumer drug purchases counting toward health insurance deductibles.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/05/trumprx-debuts-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-00768440","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/03e5ca6/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc9%2Fb0%2F804203384081b999fc30aec62f82%2Ftrump-10703.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:30:00","author":"David Lim","authors":["David Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":399868700,"title":"Trump rejects call from Russia’s Putin to extend cap on nuclear deployments  - Bahamas Spectator –","text":"United States President Donald Trump has shot down an offer from Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin proposing a voluntary extension of recently-expired limits on the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump said on Thursday that he wants negotiators from both countries to sit down and hammer out a new agreement, calling the old treaty “badly negotiated”.\n\n“Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump said on his social media network, Truth Social.\n\nTrump has previously stated that he would like China to be involved in the new treaty, but authorities in Beijing have shown little interest in doing so.\n\nThe expiration of the New START pact means fewer limits on the massive nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, spurring concerns over a potential arms race at a time of resurgent anxiety over nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin stated last year that he would abide by the treaty for another year if Washington would commit to doing the same.\n\nThe US, which has previously grumbled that the treaty limited its ability to deploy more missiles against Russia and China, has ignored the Russian offer.\n\nMoscow expressed regret on Thursday over the expiration of the decades-long treaty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia will continue with a “responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons”, adding that “of course, it will be guided primarily by its national interests”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said US and Russian delegations, who were in Abu Dhabi to discuss the war in Ukraine, reportedly also discussed extending the New START treaty for six months.\n\n“It would be an informal handshake deal as the treaty itself doesn’t allow for any further extensions,” Rattansi said.\n\n“Once that extension is in place, though, the aim is to begin formal discussions to craft an updated nuclear deal between the two countries,” he said.\n\nRecent bouts of fighting between nuclear-armed states such as India and Pakistan have unnerved analysts, who worry about the erosion of taboos and treaties meant to restrain the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.\n\nPutin also previously suggested that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to Western efforts to support Ukraine, causing alarm among observers.\n\nThe first START agreement was signed by the US and the former Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nA treaty titled New START was signed by former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, limiting each country to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles and bombers deployed and ready for use.\n\nThat deal was extended for another five years in 2021, following an agreement between Putin and then US-President Joe Biden.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/trump-rejects-call-from-russias-putin-to-extend-cap-on-nuclear-deployments/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250815__69N83U4__v1__HighRes__UsUkraineRussiaConflictSummitTrumpPutin-1770337056-ZXUoR8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:29:21","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":399871026,"title":"How can we survive this madness coming from the North?","text":"Breaking News\n\nPress Release\n\nFrom the Courts\n\nSpecial Features\n\nRegional / World\n\nOur Readers’ Opinions\n\nBassy – Love Vine\n\nDr. Fraser- Point of View\n\nR.

It is often said that when America sneezes, we catch a cold. The US appears to be doing more than sneezing and for us we can expect much more. After all, we are part of the Global Village and will be caught up in its different dynamics. Recently in one of my columns, I made note of the Canadian Prime Minister’s remarks at the World Economic Forum in which he made reference to the International Rules based order with the US as a central player. “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” He appeared to be singling out a role for Middle Powers in building a new order. Clearly, his remarks had President Trump as his target. This struck a responsive chord among foreign powers and also had an impact in the United States.\n\nIn Minnesota, US, we have recently been witnessing huge protests against the activities of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in what is part of America’s largest immigration crackdown, with protesters braving the cold temperatures calling for the removal of ICE agents, particularly after the death of two persons. At a local and National Musicians held concert to support families of the two persons who were shot, Bruce Springsteen, who had recently released a song dedicated to the city, “Streets of Minneapolis” was a specially invited guest.\n\n“Against Smoke and Rubber Bullets, By the dawn’s early light; citizens stood for justice, Their voices ringing through the night; And there were bloody footprints, where mercy should have stood… We’ll take our stand for this land.” One report stated “the performance built slowly, sweat, grit and conviction pouring into each note until the final chorus hit and the crowd erupted -not in cheers alone, but something closer to release. It wasn’t framed as a protest, but it felt like one.” Minneapolis was not the only city where people were protesting against the president’s immigration policies that had gone much further than many expected. There was wide community support with assistance given to those persons afraid to leave their homes because of the activities of ICE and other federal agencies. Are we beginning to see the return of what we associated with the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam protests?\n\nI had said in the past that Trump’s election to that high office will show us what America really is, for he was simply reflecting what many Americans felt especially about the immigration issue. Republicans in Congress gave him the green light to even usurp the power of Congress. We have recently been seeing a break in that Republican bond. True enough Congress had objected to some of the actions of the president which in their minds violated the constitution. Trump has moved beyond this and appears to want to stamp his image on the country. While many of his actions were taken to court, he simply resorted to others. Some judges have upheld his actions but there are many matters still outstanding.\n\nThe “John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts” is now the “Donald Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.” He is certainly no patron for the Arts! A recent decision to close the Centre for repairs seemed to have been a unilateral action taken by him. He has plans, according to the Washington Post, to install a Columbus Statue outside the White House. Would the US become a country shaped in every way by the dictates of Donald Trump? There are, fortunately, signs of a fight against his atrocities. He isn’t at the moment sitting well in the polls. At a recent Congressional election in Texas the Democrats secured victory in a district last won by the Democrats in 1992. In 2024 Trump won that district by 17 points. In 2026 the Dems won it by 15 points. Would the falling polls at this stage with the run-up to the mid-term elections force many Republicans to take a stand against his dictates? Trump at this point as the elections draw near is asking the Republicans to ‘nationalise’ voting, diminishing or removing what is the right of the States. Would the guard rails still prevail?\n\nWhile the elephants fight and, in some cases, make love, would we in the Caribbean be simply trampled grass? Do we look at permanent friends or permanent interests? In our case is there a difference? With Caribbean populations in the US larger than those at home, and as we continue to depend on remittances where do we stand? The US President has set his eyes on the acquisition of Greenland, despite its membership in Nato. How do we manoeuvre these troubled waters? No one clearly has answers to this, but we have to survive and our action as a united front is more than ever needed. They have started using our relationship with Cuba as a weapon. Marco Rubio the Secretary of State with Cuban roots is determined to roast Cuba. He clearly wants us to break that relationship. Should we not do like our leaders of the 60’s stand firm on this, recognizing that Cuba is a Caribbean country with whom we have maintained for some time, a close relationship. We have to closely follow developments not only in the US but in Europe and elsewhere and see what space they allow us hopefully, as a united group, to not only to survive but to develop. We have to put on our specially made diplomatic hats!\n\nDr Adrian Fraser is a social commentator and historian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ALSO IN THE NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Editorial \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Leaders, You are not alone! \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2026 \n\n\n In this edition, we feel compelled to return to the vexing situation facing the largest of the Antillean chain of islands- Cuba, which, along with all... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Leacock calls on youth to get off the block and find work \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n DURING A RECENT meeting between government and several members of the private sector, business people repeatedly mentioned a shortage of workers, part... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Some workers reinstated after vaccine mandate feel shortchanged after getting ‘small’ bonuses \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A JANUARY 26, 2026 dated memo signed by the Director of Finance and Planning and addressed to all permanent secretaries and heads of departments advis... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 700 people still in gov’t paid housing, says Leacock \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n GOVERNMENT SAYS it cannot just “throw out” people who are still in rental housing being paid for by the public purse, but also acknowledges that this ... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Niece urges uncle’s alleged daughter to return his US$98,000 \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n GRACIE GONSALVES,THE niece of Vincentian dementia and Alzheimer’s patient Hermus George is calling on a woman who claimed to be George’s biological da... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man who threatened to kill Massy employee placed on bond \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A BELAIR MAN, who claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol when he pointed a knife at a Massy Stores employee, and threatened to “slash” her... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n New positions added to Ministry of National Security \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A TOTAL OF 66 new positions have been added to the Ministry of National Security to help combat crime in St Vincent and the Grenadines.

Trump then campaigned for a second term on promises that he would swiftly end the fighting. Many of his proposals for peace have heavily favoured the Kremlin, including requiring Ukraine to cede territory to Russia.The restored communication channel \"will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace,\" the US European Command said in a statement. The agreement emerged from a meeting between senior Russian and American military officials in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.US Gen Alexus Grynkewich, who is the commander in Europe of both US and Nato forces, was in Abu Dhabi, where talks between American, Russian and Ukrainian officials on ending the war entered a second day.Meanwhile, Moscow escalated its attacks on Ukraine's power grid in an apparent effort to deny civilians power and to weaken public support for the fight, while hostilities continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometre front line snaking through eastern and southern parts of Ukraine.An effort to ease tensions The resumption of the military hotline marks an effort to ease tensions that soared after the start of the war and to avoid collisions between Russian and US forces.In one such incident in March 2023, the American military said it ditched an Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone in the Black Sea after a pair of Russian fighter jets dumped fuel on it, and then one of them struck its propeller while flying in international airspace.Moscow has denied that its warplanes hit the drone, alleging that it crashed while making a sharp maneuver. The Kremlin said its aircraft reacted to a violation of a no-fly zone Russia has established in the area near Crimea.Moscow has repeatedly voiced concern about intelligence flights by the US and other Nato aircraft over the Black Sea, and some Russian officials charged that the American surveillance flights helped gather intelligence that allowed Ukraine to strike Russian targets.Nato members have been increasingly worried about intrusions into allied airspace. Some European officials described the incidents as Moscow testing Nato's response.In September, a swarm of Russian drones flew into Poland's airspace, prompting Nato aircraft to scramble to intercept them and shoot down some of the devices. It was the first direct encounter between Nato and Moscow since the full-scale invasion. Later that month, Nato jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia's airspace.Russia, Ukraine exchange prisoners following talks The delegations from Moscow and Kyiv were joined on Thursday in Abu Dhabi by US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council chief, who was present at the meeting.They were also at last month's talks in the same place as the Trump administration tries to steer Russia and Ukraine toward a settlement.Officials have provided no information about any progress in the discussions.Following the talks on Thursday, however, Russia and Ukraine said they carried out a prisoner exchange.The Russian Defence Ministry said it brought 157 Russian servicemen back from Ukrainian captivity, as well as three Russian nationals captured during Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. Ukrainian officials said 150 Ukrainian servicemen and seven civilians returned from Russian captivity.The Russian Defence Ministry said the released Russian soldiers are currently in Belarus, getting medical assistance, before being taken back to Russia \"for treatment and rehabilitation.\" Ukrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said that among the 150 service members who returned from Russian captivity, 18 were \"illegally sentenced by Russia.\" He said that \"overall, those released are in a difficult psychological condition, and some are critically underweight.\" Zelenskyy says 55,000 Ukrainian troops killed in the war Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 55,000 Ukrainian troops have died since Russia's invasion. \"And there is a large number of people whom Ukraine considers missing,\" he added in an interview broadcast late on Wednesday by French TV channel France 2.The last time Zelenskyy gave a figure for battlefield deaths, in early 2025, he said 46,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.Zelenskyy has repeatedly said his country needs security guarantees from the US and Europe to deter any postwar Russian attacks.Ukrainians must feel that there is genuine progress toward peace and \"not toward a scenario in which the Russians exploit everything to their advantage and continue their strikes,\" Zelenskyy said on social media late on Wednesday.Last year saw a 31 per cent increase in Ukrainian civilian casualties compared with 2024, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a report published on Wednesday.Almost 15,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and just over 40,000 wounded since the start of the war through last December, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.Russian troops have lost access to their Starlink satellite internet terminals on the front line, Ukrainian Economic Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Thursday, after Ukraine asked Elon Musk's SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine.Russian forces have consequently lost command-and-control capabilities and navigation for drones, and assaults have stopped in many sectors, according to Fedorov's adviser Serhii Beskrestnov. Russian officials made no immediate comment.Ukraine is registering its civilian and military Starlink users on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals are disabled inside Ukraine.Also, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said during a visit to Kyiv that he agreed with Zelenskyy to develop the joint production of ammunition at plants in their countries.Zelenskyy said Poland plans to increase supplies to Ukraine of liquefied natural gas, and the countries are exploring an exchange of weaponry, with Kyiv possibly receiving Polish MiG fighter jets and Warsaw receiving Ukrainian drones.Russia fired 183 drones and two ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Three people were injured, officials said.The Russian Defence Ministry said its air defences downed 95 Ukrainian drones overnight over several regions, the Azov Sea and Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.","url":"https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/us-russia-agree-to-restore-high-level-military-dialogue-after-4-year-gap-126020600079_1.html","image":"https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-08/02/full/1722566987-9273.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:22:39","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":399866158,"title":"Hospitals And Doctors Ignore Updated Federal Vaccine Mandates As ‘Science Hasn’t Changed’","text":"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has just released its updated vaccine recommendations for children.\n\nDr. Sean O’Leary of the AAP said, “Unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government.”\n\nMeanwhile, 12 major medical and health care organizations have formally endorsed the recommendations from the AAP, while contradicting guidelines released by the federal government.\n\nThis year started with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention making major changes to the childhood immunization schedule. Among the changes, the schedule reduces the number of vaccine recommendations as directed by President Donald Trump and US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nSince the schedule was released, public health experts across the country have been speaking out about their opposition to the federal changes, as well as their intent to follow past recommendations.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics released its updated vaccine recommendations for children on January 26.\n\nDr. Pia Pannaraj, member of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases (COID) and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Diego, said, “As there is a lot of confusion going on with the constant new recommendations coming out of federal government, it is important that we have a stable, trusted, evidence-based immunization schedule to follow and that’s the AAP schedule.”\n\nThe AAP schedule will, as before, broadly recommend routine immunization against RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, rotavirus and meningococcal disease. Moreover, 12 medical and health care organizations have also endorsed its recommendations. This includes the American Medical Association, the National Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians.\n\nDr. Claudia Hoyen, pediatric infectious disease specialist, told CNN, “The science hasn’t changed. We will continue to follow the science.”\n\nDr. O’Leary, who chairs the AAP’s Committee on Infectious Diseases, said, “For now, unfortunately, we have to ignore everything about vaccines that is coming from our federal government.”\n\n“Parents should trust their pediatrician, trust the professional societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, pediatric hospitals, including the Children’s National in Washington DC, the Seattle Children’s, Texas Children’s, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles also confirmed that they will follow the recommendations of the AAP.\n\nDo not let anyone you care about follow RFK Jr’s “advice”.

Get your vaccinations, take your medications, and have a reasonable amount of carbs. https://t.co/PuxDz5hJ9h\n— John wants abolished (@Fadingarcader) February 6, 2026\n\nSpeaking for the Cleveland Clinic, a spokesperson said the hospital’s care will not change due to the new vaccine schedule. They noted that clinicians are “still offering all the vaccines and encouraging our patients and families to talk to their providers regarding any questions.”\n\nThe health policy organization KFF, states have historically followed CDC recommendations. Despite this, as of January 20, 28 states have revealed that they will deviate from federal guidelines and will instead follow the AAP recommendations.\n\n“For the first time in our country, we’re going to have really varying laws, policies and attitudes about vaccines based on where people live,” said Jen Kates, a co-author of the analysis. “It’s a major sea change in public health policy.”\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services announced in a January 5 press release that it was reducing the number of vaccines broadly recommended for US children. This decision came almost a month after Donald Trump directed HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Acting Director of CDC to look into how other developed nations schedule their childhood vaccinations while evaluating the scientific evidence underlying the practices and make updates.\n\nAmong the updates, HHS has said it will no longer recommend six vaccines – rotavirus, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and some forms of meningococcal disease and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The vaccines will now only be recommended for some high-risk groups, or the shared decision-making between parents and their healthcare providers.\n\n“After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the US childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,” Kennedy said in a statement. “This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.”\n\nHowever, the CDC still recommends that children are vaccinated for diphtheria, haemophilus influenza type B (Hib), Human papillomavirus (HPV), measles, mumps, pneumococcal disease, measles, mumps, polio, pertussis, rubella, tetanus, and varicella (chickenpox).","summary":"American Association of Pediatrics will ignore everything about vaccines coming from the federal government.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/hospitals-and-doctors-ignore-updated-federal-vaccine-mandates-as-science-hasnt-changed","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/robert-f-kennedy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:21:21","author":"Anne Sewell","authors":["Anne Sewell"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.18},{"id":399871022,"title":"Leaders, You are not alone!","text":"Breaking News\n\nPress Release\n\nFrom the Courts\n\nSpecial Features\n\nRegional / World\n\nOur Readers’ Opinions\n\nBassy – Love Vine\n\nDr. Fraser- Point of View\n\nR.

Said order alleges that the Government of Cuba “aligns itself and provides support for numerous hostile countries, transnational terrorist groups and malign actors adverse to the United States”. Those named are the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, the Government of Iran, and the Iran-allied groups,Hamas and Hizbollah, that bear the label of terrorist organisations.\n\nCuba’s response has been immediate and direct. President Miguel Diaz Canel called a press conference on Thursday morning during which he refuted the claims contained in the US Executive Order. He went further to recall the concrete example of the bombing of the Cubana Airways flight off Barbados on October 6, 1976 in which all 73 people on board died, following which the United States of America gave shelter to the confessed authors of that act of terrorism.\n\nIt was a terrorist act perpetrated against the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, which lost medical students returning to university in Cuba. Those could have been students from any of the many nations who, a few years later, took similar flights to pursue dreams of a higher education. It was an act carried out against the Korean people whose fencing team was travelling back from a sporting tournament in Guyana. It was an act against the Cuban people whose citizens were returning home.\n\nIt was also therefore an act of regional and international terrorism which impacted Trinidad and Tobago, from where the assassins boarded that ill-fated flight. It was an act of terrorism against the people of Barbados which forever would be associated with this horrendous act, often called the Crime of Barbados, when it was in fact a crime committed OFF the shores of this innocent Caribbean nation.\n\nThe Cuban president on Thursday said that any response by the people would have to be done in popular consultation with all the population, and especially with the youth. He said as well that it was the path chosen when the new Family Code was arrived at, and is the way which his government functions.\n\nWhat have been the responses so far from governments of CARICOM to the US pressure to accept deportees from the USA, and to end their relationship with the Cuban Medical Services which has for over a decade supplied trained health personnel to assist in our hospitals and clinics?\n\nHas any of our leaders gone to the people who elected them and outlined what they are being faced with from the hegemon?\n\nCertainly not St. Lucia, where its prime minister only recently received an overwhelming mandate to govern on December 2, 2025. Neither have the Bahamian people been taken into confidence to consult their thinking about ending the programme of medical assistance from Cuba. Not only have many Cubans been working in the Bahamas on contract for many years, but Cuban hospitals in Havana are choices for Bahamians seeking specialized medical attention. It would seem that, as soon as the US viceroy questioned the existence of Cuban medical personnel, the Bahamian government moved with dispatch to find personnel from Africa. Similarly Antigua and Barbuda seems to have awakened to the availability of nurses from Ghana.\n\nIndividual responses seem to be the new pattern in the CARICOM Region when our governments are faced with threats from the US. But if one scours social media, comments from throughout the CARICOM countries suggest that our people yearn for the kind of leadership we had when the giants Michael Manley, Errol Barrow, Eric Williams and Forbes Burnham banded together and affirmed the sovereignty of our region. Fractured responses can only lead to displays of weakness, and serve no one any good. Truth be told, the countries of this Region have to wake up to a new geo-political reality that is inward-looking, led by the current US administration.\n\nStill, our governments need to be speaking openly with their populations and consulting their feelings about the threats to our sovereignty. Our leaders must know that they are not alone in this battle. Just as our votes are campaigned for at elections, our leaders must take their populations into their confidence and explain the pressures they face.\n\nIn SVG Dr. Godwin Friday and his new administration certainly have major challenges as they go forward to present a Budget to the nation in the House of Assembly come Monday, February 9, 2026.\n\nBut not so far in their sights must be the questions which must be placed on their plates in the coming weeks – that of accommodating or not, deportees from the USA, and the continuation of our medical agreements with the Republic of Cuba. This honeymoon seems set to end very soon, and firm, strategic leadership will be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ALSO IN THE NEWS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Leacock calls on youth to get off the block and find work \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n DURING A RECENT meeting between government and several members of the private sector, business people repeatedly mentioned a shortage of workers, part... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Some workers reinstated after vaccine mandate feel shortchanged after getting ‘small’ bonuses \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A JANUARY 26, 2026 dated memo signed by the Director of Finance and Planning and addressed to all permanent secretaries and heads of departments advis... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 700 people still in gov’t paid housing, says Leacock \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n GOVERNMENT SAYS it cannot just “throw out” people who are still in rental housing being paid for by the public purse, but also acknowledges that this ... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Niece urges uncle’s alleged daughter to return his US$98,000 \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n GRACIE GONSALVES,THE niece of Vincentian dementia and Alzheimer’s patient Hermus George is calling on a woman who claimed to be George’s biological da... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Front Page \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Man who threatened to kill Massy employee placed on bond \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A BELAIR MAN, who claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol when he pointed a knife at a Massy Stores employee, and threatened to “slash” her... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n New positions added to Ministry of National Security \n\n\n\n\n Webmaster \n\n\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 \n\n\n A TOTAL OF 66 new positions have been added to the Ministry of National Security to help combat crime in St Vincent and the Grenadines.

Russia’s Putin to extend cap on nuclear deployments  | Barbados Gazette –","text":"United States President Donald Trump has shot down an offer from Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin proposing a voluntary extension of recently-expired limits on the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump said on Thursday that he wants negotiators from both countries to sit down and hammer out a new agreement, calling the old treaty “badly negotiated”.\n\n“Rather than extend ‘NEW START’ (A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump said on his social media network, Truth Social.\n\nTrump has previously stated that he would like China to be involved in the new treaty, but authorities in Beijing have shown little interest in doing so.\n\nThe expiration of the New START pact means fewer limits on the massive nuclear arsenals of the US and Russia, spurring concerns over a potential arms race at a time of resurgent anxiety over nuclear weapons.\n\nPutin stated last year that he would abide by the treaty for another year if Washington would commit to doing the same.\n\nThe US, which has previously grumbled that the treaty limited its ability to deploy more missiles against Russia and China, has ignored the Russian offer.\n\nMoscow expressed regret on Thursday over the expiration of the decades-long treaty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia will continue with a “responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons”, adding that “of course, it will be guided primarily by its national interests”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said US and Russian delegations, who were in Abu Dhabi to discuss the war in Ukraine, reportedly also discussed extending the New START treaty for six months.\n\n“It would be an informal handshake deal as the treaty itself doesn’t allow for any further extensions,” Rattansi said.\n\n“Once that extension is in place, though, the aim is to begin formal discussions to craft an updated nuclear deal between the two countries,” he said.\n\nRecent bouts of fighting between nuclear-armed states such as India and Pakistan have unnerved analysts, who worry about the erosion of taboos and treaties meant to restrain the use of nuclear weapons in conflict.\n\nPutin also previously suggested that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to Western efforts to support Ukraine, causing alarm among observers.\n\nThe first START agreement was signed by the US and the former Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nA treaty titled New START was signed by former US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, limiting each country to a maximum of 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 missiles and bombers deployed and ready for use.\n\nThat deal was extended for another five years in 2021, following an agreement between Putin and then US-President Joe Biden.","url":"https://barbadosgazette.com/trump-rejects-call-from-russias-putin-to-extend-cap-on-nuclear-deployments/","image":"https://barbadosgazette.com/app/uploads/2026/02/AFP__20250815__69N83U4__v1__HighRes__UsUkraineRussiaConflictSummitTrumpPutin-1770337056-MFj5ZB.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:19:22","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bb","sentiment":-0.28},{"id":399866454,"title":"Why Trump Is Hiring 20-Somethings to Fight His Battles","text":"MAGA’s inner circle is coming clean on why, exactly, the intern-to-influencer pipeline is so strong in Donald Trump’s White House.\n\nIt’s no secret that Donald Trump, 79, is now orbited by a considerably younger crowd than during his first term. \n\nIn fact, 27 appears to be something of a magic number in Trumpworld. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s director of public affairs, Benno Kass, is also 27, part of a broader crop of twenty-somethings who have rapidly ascended from intern-level obscurity to positions of real influence.\n\nWhile some of these rising stars have nepo baby ties—such as Wilson, whose father Steve Cortes is a former Trump adviser—insiders told Vanity Fair that bloodlines aren’t the main appeal.\n\n“These are sort of cradle MAGA people,” Raheem Kassam, founder of conservative news outlet The National Pulse, told Vanity Fair.\n\n“These are people now who have grown up with MAGA as the mainstream in their lives, rather than people who came to it either reluctantly or one foot in, one foot out.”\n\nFor a president who has long prized loyalty above competence or experience, the allure of a pure, ideologically pre-formed MAGA generation is obvious. During Trump’s 2024 transition, candidates were reportedly asked not just about their résumés but about their views on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the outcome of the 2020 election—less a test of facts than of fealty.\n\n“It’s not necessarily trying to win over people who are seen as opponents, rather than mock and belittle them and deride them and aggress them,” Kaseem added. \n\nLike Trump, he relies on his young, star-studded staff to be in attack-dog mode rather than answering questions. Like, Tricia McLaughlin, 31, Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, who has been caught making false claims about the criminal records of detained immigrants and the conduct of ICE agents. \n\nOthers, like former White House and DOGE aide Katie Miller, move on to spreading the MAGA message outside the Capitol. \n\nThe trend extends beyond communications alone.

Instead, it’s set up as a facilitator, pointing Americans to drugmakers’ direct-to-consumer websites, where they can make purchases. It also provides coupons to use at pharmacies. The site launches with over 40 medications, including weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nThe site is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to show it’s tackling the challenges of high costs. Affordability has emerged as a political vulnerability for Trump and his Republican allies going into November’s midterm elections, as Americans remain worried about the cost of housing, groceries, utilities and other staples of middle-class identity.\n\nTrump stressed that the lower prices were made possible by his pressuring of pharmaceutical companies on prices, saying he demanded that they charge the same costs in the U.S. as in other nations. He said prescription drug costs will increase in foreign countries as a result.\n\n“We’re tired of subsidizing the world,” Trump said at the evening event on the White House campus that lasted roughly 20 minutes.\n\nThe administration is touting substantial discounts, though it’s unclear just how much impact the changes will have for family budgets. The site includes the disclaimer that prices “may be even lower” for people with insurance, as it lists the “out-of-pocket price.” Also, some consumers might be able to use available generics that cost less than brand-name medications.\n\nStill, Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, hyped the website as being transformative. He said the lower prices for Ozempic and Wegovy would cause the country to collectively lose 100 million pounds this year. He suggested that lower prices for the fertility drug Gonal-F would trigger pregnancies nationwide.\n\n“We’re going to have a lot of Trump babies with these costs,” Oz said.\n\nThe president first teased TrumpRx in September while announcing the first of his more than 15 deals with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices to match the lowest price offered in other developed nations. He said in December the website would provide “massive discounts to all consumers” — though it’s unclear whether the prices available on drugmakers’ websites will routinely be any lower than what many consumers could get through their insurance coverage.\n\nThe website’s Thursday release came after it faced multiple delays, for reasons the administration hasn’t publicly shared. Last fall, Oz told Trump the site would share prices for consumers before the end of the year. An expected launch in late January was also pushed back.\n\nThe president has spent the past several months seeking to spotlight his efforts to lower drug prices for Americans. He’s done that through deals with major pharmaceutical companies, including some of the biggest drugmakers like Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck, which have agreed to lower prices of their Medicaid drugs to so-called “most favored nations” pricing. As part of the deals, many of the companies’ new drugs are also to be launched at discounted rates for consumer markets through TrumpRx.\n\nMany of the details of Trump’s deals with manufacturers remain unclear, and drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on many factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which shield them from much of the cost.\n\nTrump’s administration also has negotiated lower prices for several prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, through a direct negotiation program created by a 2022 law.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-trumprx-prescription-drugs_n_69853e50e4b0fa2b1702c27f?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69853e522200002cf06d992b.jpeg?cache=zqLW6krswP&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:15:05","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":399868344,"title":"World News | Iran's Supreme Leader Should Be Very Worried, Says US President Trump","text":"Washington DC [US], February 6 (ANI): US President Donald Trump delivered a forceful warning to Iran's top leadership this week, saying Iran's supreme leader \"should be very worried\" as the two countries prepare for resumed nuclear negotiations, according to excerpts from a Wednesday interview with NBC News, reported CNN.\nIn the interview, Trump was asked directly about Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the mounting pressure on Tehran from Washington and regional actors.\nAlso Read | Epstein Files: Chairman of Prominent Law Firm Paul Weiss Brad Karp Resigns After Release of Emails Linking Him to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"I would say he should be very worried, yeah.

Instead, the site acts as a clearinghouse, steering users to drugmakers’ own websites where they can purchase medicines, while also offering coupons for use at retail pharmacies. At launch, the platform features more than 40 drugs, including high-profile weight-loss treatments such as Ozempic and Wegovy.The rollout is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to show it is tackling high living costs, a growing political vulnerability for Republicans ahead of November’s midterm elections. Polls show Americans remain deeply concerned about the price of housing, groceries, utilities and health care..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Trump said the discounts were the result of pressure he personally applied to pharmaceutical companies, arguing that Americans have long overpaid for medicines compared with patients overseas.“We’re tired of subsidizing the world,” he said, adding that drug prices abroad would rise as companies adjusted to lower prices in the US.The President first teased TrumpRx in September while announcing the earliest of more than 15 agreements with drugmakers to lower US prices to match the lowest rates offered in other developed nations. In December, he promised the site would deliver “massive discounts to all consumers,” though it remains unclear whether prices on manufacturers’ websites will consistently beat what insured patients already pay.The launch comes after multiple delays that the administration has not fully explained. Last fall, Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told Trump the site would be live by the end of the year. A planned January rollout was later pushed back.According to the Associated Press, Trump has spent months spotlighting drug pricing as a signature issue, announcing deals with major pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Merck. Under those agreements, companies pledged to lower Medicaid drug prices to so-called most favored nation levels and to introduce some new drugs at discounted consumer prices through TrumpRx.Still, many details of the deals remain unclear. Actual costs for patients often depend on insurance coverage, competition between treatments and eligibility for government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which already shield many Americans from the full price of prescriptions.The administration has also negotiated lower prices for select drugs for Medicare enrollees under a direct negotiation programme created by a 2022 law — a separate effort Trump has pointed to as evidence of progress on affordability.- EndsWith inputs from Associated PressPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Feb 6, 2026Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/trump-unveils-trumprx-promising-cheaper-drugs-and-a-fortune-in-savings-2863882-2026-02-06","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202602/us-president-donald-trump-06091512-16x9_0.png?VersionId=8Bz6EZW7Bg0u5tbXpUZ8rk4GW7T28fRK?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:11:46","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":399866450,"title":"Trump Takes Fresh Jab at Kennedys After Deciding to Destroy Center","text":"Donald Trump has taken aim at the Kennedy family just days after announcing he is shuttering the iconic Kennedy Centre.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump, 79, was joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Trump made the comments Thursday in a Truth Social post while also signaling his willingness to move past tensions with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after what he described as \"very productive discussions,\" over the Indian Ocean base. Emphasizing the base’s strategic importance, Trump said the role of Diego Garcia was essential to U.S. national security.

The comments marked a slight shift in tone from Trump, who in January criticized the UK-Mauritius deal as an \"act of great stupidity\" and an \"act of total weakness,\" accusing Britain of surrendering a critical military asset. Diego Garcia serves as a hub for long-range bombers, logistics, intelligence collection and military communications across the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific and Africa, hosting around 2,500 U.S. and military and civilian personnel. The island base has been used for long-range U.S. operations such as in Afghanistan and in Yemen.

Britain has also agreed to approximately £3 billion [$4 billion] in compensation over the life of the deal, with an option to extend the lease for an additional 50 years. The agreement has also drawn criticism from Britain’s Conservative Party, which argues the deal weakens the U.K.’s strategic position and risks undermining long-standing security ties with the U.S. TRUMP HAILS 'GREAT AND VERY BRAVE' UK SOLDIERS AFTER SLAMMING NATO ALLIES' AFGHANISTAN SERVICE Mauritius has said its sovereignty over the islands is \"unequivocally recognized\" under international law and has called for swift implementation of the agreement.

A cover sheet for the warrant said the law enforcement agency was seeking all ballots and voter rolls, tabulator tapes from scanners used to tally votes, and electronic ballot images.\n\nFulton County Commissioner Marvin Arrington Jr. said the county asked the federal court to limit the warrant to provide an opportunity for an accounting of the seized documents and to request that they remain in the state.\n\nThe warrant was executed on Jan. 28 at the Fulton County Elections Hub and Operation Center in Fairburn, Georgia, not far from Atlanta.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long argued that election improprieties in the state contributed to his loss in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. Weeks after the vote, Trump called Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging him to investigate.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was declared the winner of Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in the 2020 election. Biden received 2,473,633 votes, or 49.5 percent of the statewide vote, compared with Trump’s 2,461,854 votes, or 49.3 percent of the statewide vote, according to officially certified results.\n\nIn December 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed suit against the county, seeking voting records from the 2020 election.\n\n​​Last month, when discussing the 2020 election, Trump said that “people will soon be prosecuted for what they did” but did not elaborate.\n\nCounty officials have expressed concern over Trump’s plans for the midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress.\n\nFulton County Chairman Robb Pitts said “this case is not only about Fulton County. This is about elections across Georgia and across the nation.”\n\n“The president himself and his allies, they refuse to accept the fact that they lost,” Pitts said. “And even if they had won Georgia, he would still have lost the presidency.”\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Congress have also questioned why Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was present during the search in Fulton County, given that she is not part of the law enforcement community.\n\nGabbard sent a letter to senior Democrats on the U.S. House and Senate intelligence committees on Feb. 2, saying the president asked her to attend at the search “under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security.”\n\nDemocratic officials in the state have also raised concerns about DOJ lawsuits, mostly aimed at Democratic states, that are seeking detailed voter data, including birthdates and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nTrump said on Feb. 3 that Democrat-controlled places like Atlanta, which is largely within Fulton County, have “horrible corruption on elections, and the federal government should not allow that.”\n\nTrump added that states were “agents of the federal government to count the votes. If they can’t count the votes legally and honestly, then somebody else should take over.”\n\nApproached by The Epoch Times, the DOJ declined to comment on the new motion.\n\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/fulton-county-georgia-sues-return-2020-election-documents-seized-fbi","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-02/image_80%2815%29.jpg?h=eb712d46&amp;itok=PdNP86D1","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.441},{"id":399867968,"title":"Fed Chair Jerome Powell Just Gave Good News About the Economy -- and Bad News to President Donald Trump","text":"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell concluded the Fed's January meeting, as he always does, with a press conference to go over the Fed's recent actions and answer reporters' questions about the economy. The market keeps a close eye on these press conferences, looking for clues about future interest rate and balance-sheet moves by the Fed.\n\nAt the Fed's recent meeting and during the press conference, Powell provided a positive update about the economy, but that was likely bad news for President Donald Trump, who has been at odds with the Fed since the beginning of his second term.\n\nA positive update on the economy and the labor market\n\nDuring the post-meeting press conference, Powell essentially issued positive updates on the strength of the economy, inflation, and the labor market. On inflation, Powell said the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors has observed disinflation in the services sector. However, inflation in the goods sector is still elevated due to tariffs. Long-term inflation expectations are still within the Fed's preferred 2% target.\n\nPowell also said that data show solid economic activity continuing to surprise positively. Consumers remain resilient, and businesses are also continuing to boost investments, although Powell noted that housing remains a weak spot. Powell also believes the government shutdown likely weighed on economic activity, but he expects a reversal this quarter.\n\nFinally, Powell noted that labor market data suggest that things may be stabilizing after experiencing some softening in the months prior. While job growth is slowing, much of this can be attributed to slower growth in the number of available workers, driven by lower immigration and lower labor force participation, although labor demand is still weak. Job openings, layoffs, hiring, and nominal wage growth have not changed much in recent months.\n\nBad news for Trump\n\nSo why is a positive update on the economy and labor market bad news for Trump? The 47th president has been quite vocal in his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates. This data is not supportive of further rate cuts, especially on the labor side.\n\nThe Fed's dual mandate calls for stable prices and maximum employment. But prices are still high, and inflation, at 3% in January, is still high. If the Fed continues to lower rates, it will continue to stimulate the economy and risk increasing inflation more. However, the Fed has also been watching the labor market, as unemployment has risen.\n\nIf the labor market is not an issue, the Fed really has no reason to lower rates and stimulate the economy if consumers remain resilient and inflation remains elevated. While Trump may be the loudest presidential critic of the Fed, he is certainly not the only president to have wanted the Fed to change interest rates on his terms.\n\nMany people in the U.S. have been hit by an affordability crisis. Inflation has surged since the pandemic, along with the cost of living. Housing costs consume a much higher proportion of salaries, and many salaries, despite being higher, have not been enough for people to afford the cost of living while saving enough to buy a home and also stash away enough savings for retirement.\n\nThe economy is the top issue for many voters, and midterm elections are scheduled for later this year. Trump and the Republicans will want to maintain their majority in Congress to carry out Trump's agenda for the rest of his term, which is why interest rates and affordability are top of mind right now.\n\nThe market is still penciling in two Fed interest rate cuts this year. However, if data continues to support stabilization in the labor market and disinflation, there will be no need for the Fed to cut further right now, potentially hurting the stock market, which would be more bad news for Trump.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean things can't change quickly, as inflation and labor market data come out monthly and have been hard for investors to predict. There could still be more interest rate cuts than the market expects right now, but the other side of this equation is also possible, which is something for investors to keep in mind.","summary":"President Donald Trump wants lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve may not see the need for further cuts.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/05/fed-chair-jerome-powell-good-news-economy-trump/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F854191%2Ftrump-official-wh-photo-by-joyce-n-boghosian.jpg&w=1200&op=resize","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:05:00","author":"Bram Berkowitz,Joyce N.

Responding to a questionnaire from this newspaper, addressed to Rollins, on the agricultural components of the trade deal, a USDA spokesperson stated: “India has significant potential to expand imports of US agricultural products. High tariffs, unjustified non-tariff measures and other restrictions have afflicted US products across the board. Reductions in these barriers, and reforms in India’s overly generous subsidy programs, could help to level the playing field for US farmers, ranchers and producers and support more balanced, mutually beneficial trade over time.” The spokesperson stated: “USDA’s Three-Point Plan, announced in September 2025, works to chip away at the $50 billion agricultural deficit through market promotion support, rapid response to reciprocal trade agreements, and boosting rural prosperity.” Read | ‘Cash into rural America’: US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins cheers new trade deal, market access in India The statement comes a day after Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal told the Rajya Sabha that “India's key sensitivities in the food and agriculture sector have been fully taken into account” in negotiations with the US on the trade deal. Taking to X on February 3, hours after US President Donald Trump announced the deal, Agriculture Secretary Rollins had posted that the “deal will export more American farm products to India's massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America”. “In 2024, America’s agricultural trade deficit with India was $1.3 billion. India’s growing population is an important market for American agricultural products and today’s deal will go a long way to reducing this deficit,” Rollins wrote.

In 2023, India and the US settled an outstanding poultry dispute at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As a result, India agreed to reduce tariffs on certain US products, including frozen turkey, frozen duck, fresh blueberries and cranberries, frozen blueberries and cranberries, dried blueberries and cranberries, and processed blueberries and cranberries.

On Tuesday, in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Chouhan reiterated that the “Government undertakes negotiations for Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) only after carefully safeguarding the interests of Indian agriculture, allied sectors and farmers, including small and marginal farmers”. “Adequate safeguards are built in to protect sensitive sectors such as agriculture and dairy from unfair competition,” he said. On Thursday, Chouhan's office issued a statement quoting him as saying that “no market segment has been opened in a manner that could harm Indian farmers, and all major crops, food grains, fruits and dairy products remain shielded”. The statement also referred to the “confusion triggered by a recent tweet from the US Treasury Secretary about increased access for American farm products” and said Chouhan has pointed out that Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has “already clarified the facts in Parliament”.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-u-s-trade-deal-india-has-significant-potential-to-import-more-agri-products-us-10516224/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2026/02/‘Deal-will-export-more-American-farm-products-to-Indias-massive-market-US-Agri-Secy-Brooke-Rollins-had-said.-AP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:04:46","author":"Harikishan Sharma","authors":["Harikishan Sharma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.293},{"id":399868334,"title":"World News | US Retains Right to Military Secure, Reinforce American Presence in Diego Garcia: Trump on UK's Chagos Islands Deal","text":"Washington DC [US], February 6 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has held \"very productive discussions\" with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer regarding the strategically located island of Diego Garcia, which hosts a major UK-US joint military base in the Indian Ocean.\nTrump said that, though he understood the British Prime Minister had negotiated \"the best he could make\" under the circumstances, he would never allow the US presence at the military base to be \"undermined\" or \"threatened\". Also Read | Epstein Files: Chairman of Prominent Law Firm Paul Weiss Brad Karp Resigns After Release of Emails Linking Him to Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump described Diego Garcia as being of \"great importance\" to US national security due to its central location in the Indian Ocean and its role in supporting American military operations.\n\"It is the site of a major U.S. Military Base, strategically situated in the middle of the Indian Ocean and therefore, of great importance to the National Security of the United States,\" Trump said.

Trump said he understood that the British Prime Minister Starmer had negotiated \"the best he could make\" under the circumstances.\nHowever, Trump warned that the United States would take decisive action if its military presence on the island were ever threatened. \"If the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our Base, I retain the right to Militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia, \" he said. Trump also rejected what he described as \"fake claims or environmental nonsense\" being used to undermine the US presence at the base. \"Let it be known that I will never allow our presence on a Base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened,\" he added. Earlier, US President Donald Trump criticised the United Kingdom over its plans to give away the Diego Garcia island and called it an act of \"great stupidity\". He said that London's action is one of several reasons Greenland must be \"acquired\".He made the remarks on January 20 in a Truth Social post.\nThe US President said, \"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER. There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before. The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European Allies have to DO THE RIGHT THING. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"\nTrump's remarks came shortly after the third reading of the Diego Garcia Military Base and British Indian Ocean Territory Bill on January 13 in the UK Parliament.\nThe UK-Mauritius Treaty, signed in 2025, provides that Mauritius will exercise full sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, with the UK retaining rights on Diego Garcia for an initial 99-year period.\nOver the 99-year period, the UK will pay Mauritius around £3.4 billion at 2025/26 prices. The UK Government says this resolves the long-standing BIOT sovereignty dispute and secures the military base for continued operations in the long term, according to the UK House of Commons Library.\nTrump's sharp tone stood in stark contrast to the Biden administration's stance on the treaty, which hailed the historic Chagos archipelago agreement between the United Kingdom and Mauritius and highlighted how diplomacy can overcome long-standing challenges to reach peaceful, mutually beneficial outcomes.\nFormer President Biden said the agreement affirms Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago while granting the United Kingdom authority to exercise Mauritius's sovereign rights over Diego Garcia.

Then it was like a gunshot went off and the race was on. I ran toward it with everything I had,” she said.\n\nThe theater opened in 1925 and closed after nearly a century in operation. It was designed by Lewis Arthur Smith and began as a vaudeville and silent-film house before shifting to mainstream releases. It was eventually subdivided into a triplex in the 1980s.\n\nOwner Dan Akarakian told the Los Angeles Times in March 2024 the theatre was unable to recover in the post-pandemic world and he was forced to shut it down. \n\nIt closed permanently on 29 February 2024, six days before its 99th anniversary, with the final films screened including Madame Web and Bob Marley: One Love.\n\nStewart said she intended to turn the theater into a community space. \n\n“It’s an opportunity to make a space to gather and scheme and dream together. This project is about creating a new school and restructuring our processes, finding a better way forward,” the actor said. \n\n“We want to make it a family affair, something for the community. It's not just for pretentious Hollywood cinephiles,” she added. \n\n“I see it as an antidote to all the corporate bulls***, a place that takes movie culture away from just buying and selling. I think there’s a huge desire and craving for what this kind of space can offer.”\n\nThe Spencer star acknowledged the challenge and scale of the restoration work. “There are so many beautiful details that need to be restored,” she said. “There’s a way to bring the building back to life in a way that embraces its history, but also brings something new to the neighborhood and something new to the whole LA film community.”\n\nStewart’s purchase of the theater puts her in the league of film figures who have taken an active role in preserving Los Angeles’ cinema heritage. \n\nQuentin Tarantino bought the New Beverly Cinema in 2007 and the Vista Theater in 2021, telling Deadline in 2014 he bought the former theater to ensure it wouldn't get turned into a commercial multiplex and remain dedicated to film screenings. \n\nIn 2022, the Village Theater in Westwood was bought by a group of investors that included Jason Reitman, Steven Spielberg, and Bradley Cooper after fears the site could be redeveloped. \n\nRecently, while promoting her directorial debut The Chronology of Water, Stewart said “probably not” when asked if she thought she would stay in the US while Donald Trump was president. \n\n“Reality is breaking completely under Trump,” the actor, 35, told The Sunday Times. “But we should take a page out of his book and create the reality we want to live in.” \n\nShe called Trump’s threat of tariffs on films made outside the US “terrifying” for the industry and said she “can’t work freely” in the US.\n\n“But I don’t want to give up completely,” she added. “I’d like to make movies in Europe and then shove them down the throat of the American people.”","summary":"Actor says she intends to turn rundown theater into a community space","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/kristen-stewart-highland-park-theater-la-b2915043.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/02/05/9/38/GettyImages-2255477031.jpg?crop=3321,2214,x0,y109.8&trim=109,0,2659,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4df8JVcs-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:04:08","author":"Shahana Yasmin","authors":["Shahana Yasmin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.034},{"id":399869726,"title":"DHS watchdog details extensive probes into Trump's immigration crackdown","text":"The spate of investigations comes as the Trump administration faces an uproar from Democrats and a growing number of Republicans over its immigration enforcement operations in several states, which have at times turned violent. Senate Democrats are currently holding up DHS funding over a list of demands for reforms to ICE and CBP, including requirements that federal officers wear body cameras and IDs. The administration has also refused to budge on a demand that immigration enforcement agents do not wear masks.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin dismissed the probes, writing in a statement that “the supposed number of ongoing matters doesn’t say anything about their disposition or the facts.”\n\n“DHS’s job is to secure the homeland, and we do so in line with federal law and the Constitution,” she said. “The Trump administration is committed to transparency, and we have no problem with honest and impartial oversight.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump purged independent watchdogs for several government agencies during the first month of his second term, but Joseph Cuffari — the inspector general for DHS nominated by Trump during his first term — remains in place.\n\nDozens of congressional Democrats wrote last week to Cuffari urging him to expedite his probe into “whether ICE investigates allegations of use of excessive force,” which his office opened in June.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Cuffari’s office said the timeline for conducting an oversight review “is affected by several variables.” The office has an internal goal of completing audits within 397 days but routinely misses the benchmark, according to a report released by the Government Accountability Office last month.\n\n“If, however, during our work we find matters that warrant immediate attention and action (such as those posing serious risk or imminent threat to safety, health, property, or continuity of operations), DHS OIG has mechanisms to promptly inform the Department and Congress, rather than waiting for a final report,” the office said.\n\nDozens of Democratic lawmakers have also called for the removal of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in recent weeks, although an impeachment resolution is unlikely to garner sufficient bipartisan support in the House.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/05/dhs-watchdog-probe-trump-immigration-00768311","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/0dc4989/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F80%2F9f%2F05cb035e417f89e90d48e57aec41%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-63575.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-06 01:04:00","author":"Jacob Wendler","authors":["Jacob Wendler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":399864298,"title":"Agreement signed for Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority","text":"Agreement signed for Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority India \n 1 hr ago\n\n This is an AI assisted summary.\n\n The Centre and Nagaland government signed an agreement for the formation of 'Frontier Nagaland Territorial Authority' (FNTA) in the presence of CM Neiphiu Rio and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

However, regulatory pressure on Coupang intensified further after the e-commerce giant suffered a data breach perpetrated by a former Chinese employee in November.\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung openly called for tougher penalties and higher fines against Coupang “so severe that they go out of business,” while his party threatened to criminally indict a Coupang executive who’s a U.S. national.\n\n“Over the past few months, the KFTC and other agencies within the Korean government have escalated their discriminatory attacks on American technology companies, including by threatening U.S. citizens with criminal charges,” Jordan wrote in a letter before stating the purpose of the subpoena.\n\n“To develop effective legislation, including new laws protecting American companies and citizens from foreign governments’ discriminatory laws and enforcement decisions, the Committee must investigate the extent and nature of these efforts and the effect they have on Americans’ right to due process and U.S. companies’ ability to effectively compete in the global market,” he continued.\n\nCongress has repeatedly expressed concern about South Korea’s treatment of Coupang and other U.S. tech companies in letters and hearings. Thursday’s move reflects lawmakers’ significant interest in how foreign allies treat American companies.\n\nBeyond the requested records, the House Judiciary chairman is requiring Coupang Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel Harold Rogers to appear for a deposition at a future date.\n\nIn response to the congressional request, Coupang affirmed its compliance.\n\n“Coupang will fully cooperate with the U.S. House Judiciary Committee investigation, including production of documents and witness testimony as required by the subpoena,” the company said.\n\nTensions are straining between the United States and South Korea despite both nations having agreed to a comprehensive trade deal last fall.\n\nThe trade agreement specifically protects U.S. companies from discrimination by foreign governments and trade barriers in “terms of laws and policies concerning digital services, including network usage fees and online platform regulations,” according to a White House joint fact sheet on the deal.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be taking notice of the situation.\n\nLast month, Vice President JD Vance met with South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok to speak about how the dispute involving Coupang might be resolved. Days later, President Donald Trump raised his tariffs on South Korea by 10% because the country “is not living up” to the trade deal.\n\nTRUMP RAISES TARIFFS ON SOUTH KOREA BY 10% OVER FAILURE TO ENACT TRADE DEAL\n\n“President Lee and I reached a Great Deal for both Countries on July 30, 2025, and we reaffirmed these terms while I was in Korea on October 29, 2025,” he wrote in a Jan. 26 Truth Social post. “Why hasn’t the Korean Legislature approved it?”\n\nTrump did not specifically mention Coupang in that announcement, but the company’s predicament likely influenced his tariff hike on South Korea. The president similarly threatened additional tariffs on the European Union over the 27-member bloc’s digital regulations and taxes that critics argue are disproportionately harming U.S tech companies.","summary":"The House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed e-commerce giant Coupang on Thursday to obtain its documents and communications with the South Korean government regarding the country’s alleged discrimination against the U.S. technology company.

There is no higher honor than the Congressional Medal of Honor.'\n\nThe president comforted the parents by suggesting how proud their son would be. \n\n'He's going to get it and Michael is looking down on you right now and saying \"My mom and dad are handling this pretty well,\"' Trump added. \n\nRobert flashed a wide, beaming smile: 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. You have no idea the happiness we have.'\n\nLinda chimed in: 'Thank you for facilitating this! This is so wonderful of you. We are so thrilled because we have been working on it for so long and spoken to so many people and you made it happen.'\n\nTrump thanked the Ollis family for their years of effort in lobbying for their son to receive such an honor.\n\n'Otherwise, how are we going to know, right? You know, people don’t know. So I think that’s fantastic,' the president said.\n\nTrump then made an admission to Ollis' mother: 'You did a good job and he did a better job.

Yes, let's do this MAGA!' \n\nTrump simply responded: 'Hey Robert, bring them all down.' \n\nThe White House confirmed to The Daily Mail that President Trump will be honoring Ollis in the near future. \n\nThe Ollis family has spent over a decade attempting to get further recognition for their son. \n\nOllis was serving with the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division (Light) out of Fort Drum. \n\nHis platoon was attacked in the middle of the night on August 28, 2013, as a car bomb blasted a hole in the wall of their army base.\n\nThey then came under fire from Al-Qaeda rebels who fired mortar shells, shoulder-fired rockets and hand grenades into the base.\n\nTen suicide bombers made into the base as Ollis and Lieutenant Karol Cierpica fought to save their platoon.\n\nEight of the bombers were killed while a ninth was shot. But it was a surprise tenth bomber who hid behind some containers and took the pair of them by surprise.\n\nOllis stepped forward to protect Cierpica. The bomber detonated his vest and killed Ollis, 24, who received a posthumous Silver Star for his heroism\n\nHe also received the Distinguished Service Cross, as well as the highest honor that can be bestowed on a foreign soldier by the Republic of Poland. \n\nYears later, Cierpica, the Polish soldier that the 24-year-old from Staten Island saved on the battlefield would also give the ultimate tribute to his American counterpart: he named his son Michael.\n\n'Every generation has its heroes,' said US Army General James McConville while presenting the Distinguished Service Cross.

stake?","text":"Dubai: Iran and the United States are set to hold high-stakes talks in Oman starting Friday, their first formal negotiations since last year’s war between Iran and Israel and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities..The meeting comes amid soaring tensions following Tehran’s deadly crackdown on nationwide protests and fresh warnings from Donald Trump, who has not ruled out renewed military action if diplomacy fails..While both sides say they are open to talks, they remain sharply divided on what should be discussed — and how far any deal should go..Here’s a breakdown of the key issues..Who is taking part in the talks?.Iran will be represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, a veteran diplomat known for his role in earlier nuclear negotiations..Trump warns Iran’s supreme leader should be ‘very worried’ as nuclear talks resume in Oman.The US side will be led by Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff..The talks are being hosted by Oman, which has long played the role of mediator between Tehran and Washington..Trump ramps up threats against Iran: Next attack will be 'far worse',\n 'hopefully', won't need military action.What does Iran want?.Tehran is insisting that negotiations focus only on its nuclear programme and the lifting of US-led sanctions..Khamenei warns of ‘regional war’ as Trump confirms talks with Tehran.Iran argues it has the right to pursue civilian nuclear energy under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and says it has no intention of building a bomb..Before last year’s war, Iran was enriching uranium to 60 per cent purity — far above limits set under the 2015 nuclear deal but still short of the 90 percent needed for a nuclear weapon.5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE IRAN-US TALKSIran wants nuclear-only talks: Tehran insists negotiations focus strictly on its nuclear programme and lifting sanctions — nothing else.The US wants a broader deal: Washington is pushing to include Iran’s ballistic missiles, regional influence and human rights concerns.Uranium enrichment is the main dispute: Iran had enriched uranium up to 60%, far above past limits but below weapons-grade levels.Stockpiles remain unclear after strikes: US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites last year left the fate of highly enriched uranium uncertain.Military pressure is rising alongside diplomacy: The US has boosted its regional military presence, while Iran has warned of retaliation if attacked. .Iran says it is willing to scale back enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief..It has firmly rejected:.Discussing its ballistic missile programme.Its regional influence and support for militant groups.Calling these issues matters of national defence..What does the US want?.Washington wants a much broader deal..US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said talks must include:.Iran’s nuclear programme.Its ballistic missiles.Its support for militant groups across the Middle East.Its treatment of protesters at home.The US argues the 2015 nuclear deal failed because it ignored missiles and regional security..Trump has repeatedly called for a complete halt to uranium enrichment, a tougher demand than previous agreements..What about Iran’s uranium stockpile?.After US strikes last year on key nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, the whereabouts of Iran’s highly enriched uranium remain unclear..Iranian officials say much of the material is buried under rubble and too dangerous to retrieve for now..Some countries have offered to store Iran’s uranium abroad as a safeguard, but Tehran has refused — insisting it can manage the stockpile itself if sanctions are lifted..Why are tensions so high now?.Relations worsened dramatically after:.Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran last June.The US bombed Iranian nuclear facilities.Iran later halted enrichment temporarily.Nationwide protests erupted in Iran, followed by a violent crackdown.Trump has warned Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be “very worried” as talks begin..The US has also deployed a major naval force, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, to the region..Iran has threatened retaliation against US bases if attacked..Why is the nuclear issue so sensitive?.Iran insists its programme is peaceful..But Western powers fear its advanced enrichment levels could allow it to quickly build a bomb if it chooses..Under the 2015 nuclear deal (which Trump withdrew from in 2018):.Enrichment was capped at 3.67%.Uranium stockpiles were tightly limited.Since then, Iran has steadily expanded its programme..What could happen next?.Best case: A limited deal where Iran scales back enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief..Middle ground: Talks drag on with no breakthrough but no immediate conflict..Worst case: Talks collapse — followed by fresh US or Israeli military strikes and Iranian retaliation..Bottom line.Iran wants sanctions relief and nuclear-only talks..The US wants a broader agreement covering missiles, militias and nuclear limits..With both sides sticking to red lines and military pressure building, the Oman talks could either open a path back to diplomacy — or push the region closer to another conflict.","summary":"Iran-US talks begin today: What each side

A collection of some of the summary comments: Businesslike, calm-collected, short, boring and good. Over 95 per cent approval rating — something I have not witnessed in over 36 years of active Budget-watching. I was asked to write this article on Budget day, but politely refused. Reason: Bitter experience that there was always a wicket-taking googly in the budget. Only after the dust of euphoria had settled did the googly emerge in the form of yet another retrospective tax — starting April 2026, there will be a new tax on capital gains made via the purchase of SGBs or sovereign gold bonds. The SGBs were introduced in 2015-16 when gold prices were low and stable (even declining from their local peak in 2011-12). This scheme of annual issuance of gold bonds was stopped in 2024 — well before the parabolic surge in international gold prices. The terms of the SGB agreement with the citizen and voter was that you buy paper gold, and you are returned paper money when you sell. Capital gains, and losses, with the investor. No tax was to be paid if the price of gold went up, and if the price of gold went down, your loss. Now, retrospectively, because gold prices have shot up, you will pay a long-term capital gains tax of 12.5 per cent. Paraphrasing Khrushchev, the government’s attitude is: What is mine is mine — what is yours is also mine. Besides being greedy and unfair — retrospective taxes should be illegal — the government is also being petty, and can one dare say it, stupid and counterproductive. Nothing is gained and much is lost in terms of investor confidence via this new tax. It will net about Rs 200 crore a year — about .005 per cent of our tax receipts in 2025-26. Several benefits have accrued to the government via gold bonds. SGBs lowered imports (less physical gold imports), and via a higher current account balance, helped keep the rupee stable, if not to appreciate. And don’t cry for the government because of the trivial tax loss. My estimate is that the government made upwards of Rs 50,000 crore from borrowing from the investor (at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent) rather than 7 per cent from the market. And it wants to get Rs 200 crore more — I give up. A simple Occam’s razor rule for the Finance Minister: Any retrospective tax is bad policy, by definition, morally, and otherwise. Retrospective taxes reflect very badly on the process of Budget- and decision-making in India. As I have been shouting to whoever has been within earshot, the secret decision-making of the Budget is a relic of several bygone eras. We did so when we were ruled by a colonial power, and we are doing it today when we are ostensibly on the road to Viksit Bharat. For the last decade or so, I have advocated an open policy towards Budget presentation. There is no need to follow the 200-year-old legacy of secret preparation (though the halwa should stay). Budget preparation should be an open, collaborative effort, with the final decision resting, obviously, with the policymakers. Excluding the retrospective tax, Budget 2026 is a very good example of good policymaking. Major policies were announced before the Budget. Income tax reform was announced last year, GST reform in September. The latter is still incomplete, with promises to keep. And for all the bravado (and incorrect and inappropriate) talk of self-reliance, India has acted in a welcome opposite direction. In the short space of a few months, it has become considerably more open — look at the just-announced trade deals! Major trade reforms are now outside the Budget (unlike 1991). And major deregulation, as advocated in a NITI Aayog report (again, outside the Budget), is likely to become policy. In the run-up to the Budget, most commentators, both within and outside the government, expected the Centre to take significant steps towards addressing the number one ailment of the Indian economy — lack of growth of private investment. The share of private investment in GDP is down about 10 percentage points from its earlier peak of 30 per cent. Indian investment is going abroad and foreign investment is not coming to India. Net FDI is falling, is barely positive, and is at the lowest level (as a percentage of GDP) since our mega-crisis year, 1990. The last three months’ net FDI has been negative. Stated bluntly, the investment climate is bad — and the new retrospective tax makes it worse. Indians want to invest abroad, and foreigners don’t want to invest in India. And don’t blame US President Donald Trump’s tariffs or the unstable global environment for this. Indeed, world growth is higher this year and world inflation is lower. Further, many countries have managed the uncertainty extraordinarily well. So, Indian policymakers do not deserve the extra credit heaped on them by domestic experts for “good” growth. Private investment is down big-time because of the UPA’s retrospective taxation in 2012 and the BJP’s Model Bilateral Investment Treaty of 2015 (an extraordinarily bad model). The latter stipulated that a divorce agreement between a foreign and a domestic firm could only be achieved if two conditions were met — a five-year cooling and negotiation period, failing which, adjudication by an Indian judge. Seeing these requirements, the foreign investor decided to vote with her feet. (The new, revised BIT recommends a three-year cooling period and maybe an international judge — some improvement). Do we know of any divorce that faces these stringent conditions? No. Then why did two bad laws made by the two leading and contrasting political parties happen? Because the source of these decisions was the same — Indian politicians, advised by our Yes Minister all-powerful bureaucrats, who believe that India will and can do as it pleases because the world cannot do without us. It would be funny if it weren’t so sad. Bhalla is chairperson of the Technical Expert Group for the first official Household Income Survey for India.
