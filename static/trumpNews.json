Come on, please.’\nHer illicit operation was one of several fake guarantor schemes the Mail found being run by Albanians in the UK in what has become a booming market to meet the scores of immigration bail applications going to court every week.\nOur investigation also found:\n:: The Home Office translator organising the scam appeared on primetime TV in her homeland to criticise the treatment of Albanian migrants in the UK - even as she plotted with our reporter to dupe the British authorities.\n:: Checks on guarantors during immigration bail hearings often take just a few minutes and involve a few basic questions.\n:: Guarantors often dial into court on their mobile phones while sitting in cars and bail is granted even when their answers to questions from the Home Office representative are inaudible and their explanation for large sums of cash paid into their bank accounts taken at face value.\n:: Other Albanians post videos on social media showing how to cut off tracking tags sometimes imposed as part of immigration bail conditions.\n\nThe scam means immigrants who have arrived in the UK on small boats, backs of lorries or using fake passports can pay a stranger to vouch for them in court and say they will live with them\n\nMs Legisi said the scam was '100 per cent successful' because her work translating for the Home Office, police and the courts meant she knew ‘everything’ about how the immigration system worked from the inside\n\n Con artist lambasts 'chaotic' UK asylum system on Albanian TV while running scheme to defraud it \nHome Office legal guidance for immigration judges state that a ‘Financial Condition Supporter’ who guarantees bail for immigrants in detention centres must be a UK based adult with indefinite leave to remain who has a ‘personal connection with the [detained] person, or be acting on behalf of a reputable organisation which has an interest in the person’s welfare.’\nJudges should assess the ‘reliability and standing’ of any Financial Condition Supporter and, where appropriate, whether the migrant has a suitable settled address before granting bail, the guidance says.\nBut families of migrants in detention routinely post requests for guarantors on Facebook groups set up for Albanians in the UK, often stressing urgency as their relative is due to be deported imminently.\nEglantina Legisi, a UK based freelance interpreter who via translation agencies does work for the Home Office, courts and police, as well as for a solicitor involved immigration cases, responded to three of these requests urging those needing a guarantor to get in touch with her.\nThe interpreter, who herself came to the UK smuggled in the back of a lorry after using a fake passport to escape Albania, subsequently explained how the scam worked to an undercover reporter at a meeting near her home in Welling, Kent.\nShe told the journalist, who posed as the friend of an Albanian in detention after being caught entering the UK illegally, that for £3000, plus £1,000 for the surety, he could hire another interpreter who did work for the Home Office to act as a guarantor.\nMs Legisi reassured the reporter not to be ‘scared’ about the scam being discovered, saying said she and the solicitor would brief them ahead of the bail hearing and they would only be asked a few basic questions at the hearing.\nAs long as he was bailed without a tag he could live anywhere and unofficially work, she added.\nShe said the solicitor she would refer the case to knew they would be using a fake guarantor and ‘everything’ they were doing.\n\nShadow Home Secretary Chris Philp branded the scam a 'disgrace' and called for urgent action after the Mail expose\n\nMs Legisi responded to three posts requesting bail guarantors on Facebook groups set up for Albanians in the UK\n\nHassan Malik, solicitor from HM Legal Ltd, said he was happy to proceed with a bail application despite the reporter three times raising his concern that the immigrant and guarantor would not know each other, and being aware that the guarantor was being paid £3000 \n\n EXCLUSIVE Lawyers charging £10,000 to make fake asylum claims: Special investigation exposes staff at immigration law firms briefing clients on how to LIE to the authorities to win the right to stay in Britain \nIn a later meeting with Hassan Malik from HM Legal Ltd at his offices in Rainham, Essex, he was happy to proceed despite the reporter three times raising his concern that the migrant and guarantor would not know each other, and being aware that the guarantor was being paid £3000.\nHe told us he would charge £3,500 in fees and the reporter would need to discuss directly with Ms Legisi about the guarantor and ‘whatever she's asking for that’.\nUp to 12,800 Albanians who entered the UK illegally broke their bail conditions between January 2022 and May 2023.\nShadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: ‘These reports are a disgrace.\n‘These interpreters are paid to maintain the integrity of the system, but are in fact cheating the system and cheating the British public - often to help illegal immigrants stay in the country.’\nHe called for the translators to be ‘immediately’ fired and an investigation for suspected fraud and contempt of court.\n‘The whole immigration system is being exploited by illegal immigrants on an industrial scale and radical reform is needed.’\nA Solicitors Regulation Authority spokesperson said: “All solicitors must meet the high professional standards the public expects.\n‘This report raises serious concerns.\n‘We are investigating, and if we find evidence of wrongdoing, we will take action to protect the public.”\nMr Malik denied any wrong doing saying he did not know about any payments to the guarantor who he said he had been told would know the detainee because they were both Albanian. He said Miss Legisi did not work for his firm and her comments did not represent his or the firm’s position.\nMs Legisi did not respond to repeated request for comment.\n\nCats and cars - the curious world of Immigration Tribunal bail hearings \n\nChecks on guarantors during Immigration bail hearings often take just a few minutes and involve a few basic questions.\nScores of immigration bail applications, frequently involving Albanian nationals, are held at every week at First-tier Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chambers.\nWhen the Mail attended the Taylor House in Farringdon Central London earlier last month two bail applications were granted with the minimum of fuss.\nAll parties apart from the judge appeared via video link, with the guarantors dialling in from their phones while sitting in car.\nThere is no suggestion that any of the guarantors in these cases were part of the scam.\nThe most dramatic moment in the first hearing came when a cat jumped onto the neck of a barrister as she addressed the judge on behalf of the applicant.\nShe smiled and shooed the pet off her shoulder and a few moments it later it could be seen on her screen slinking away allowing the case to continue.\nDon Marcantonio-Goodhall, for the Home Office, confirmed there was ‘no negativity’ with the £1,000 surety lodged with the court by the guarantor or the bail address he had provided.\n\nChecks on guarantors during immigration bail hearings often take just a few minutes and involve a few basic questions (Pictured: Stock Image of a Judge)\n\nWhen the Mail attended the Taylor House (above) in Farringdon, Central London, earlier last month two bail applications were granted with the minimum of fuss\n\nAt the second hearing, Home Office lawyer Don Marcantonio-Goodhall raised a concern about an ‘an unexplained payment of £1,500’ (Pictured: Home Office Stock Image) \nThe guarantor was later called to make sure he understood the conditions.\nDressed in a white t-shirt underneath a turquoise blue zip up top and glasses the Financial Condition Supporter appeared on the screen while sitting what appeared to be people carrier.\nThe judge asked: Are you sat in your car?'\nHe responded: 'Yes, I am at work but have moved away so no one can hear me.'\nThe guarantor confirmed that the migrant would be 'staying at my address' and that he would make sure he attended his bail appointments, adding he was his ‘friend.’\nThe Judge granted bail on the condition he lived at the home, reported to the Home Office when required and did not work.\nThe migrant nodded to indicate he understood the conditions and said 'thanks' before leaving the call.\nAt the second hearing Mr Marcantonio-Goodhall said he had no issue with the address provided by the guarantor but raised a concern about an 'an unexplained payment of £1,500 that needs to be cleared up.'\nUnfortunately, by this point they discover the guarantor has left the online call.\nHis solicitor had to hurriedly call him and asked him to get back on the call ASAP.\nThe guarantor returned to be asked where the £1,500 deposited into his account in late January came from and answered it was from his work as he ‘self-employed plasterer and renderer.”\nMr Marcantonio-Goodhall appeared to accept the explanation and no further checks were requested.\nBut when he asked the guarantor to confirm he knew he was responsible for making sure the detainee attended appointments if he is bailed interference on the call made the response inaudible to the court.\nNo one attempted to get him to repeat what he has said and Judge Mohammed Hussain announced that nothing has emerged from the questions that ‘would lead me to alter my bail decision.'\nHe granted the detainee bail on the same condition that he doesn’t work, lives at the guarantor’s home and attends bail appointments when required.\nThe Home Office\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nExposed: Home Office translators running a lucrative scam to spring illegal immigrants from detention\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

I always thought that was very important,” Trump said, acknowledging the constitutional constraints preventing him from seeking a third term. But he added that some people want him to serve a third term, which is prohibited by a constitutional amendment passed in 1947.\n\n“I’m looking to have four great years and turn it over to somebody, ideally a great Republican, a great Republican to carry it forward,” he added.\n\nHere are the key stories at a glance:\n\nTrump says he doesn’t know if he needs to uphold constitutional due process\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said that he does not know whether he must uphold the US constitution, the nation’s founding legal document.\n\nIn a wide-ranging NBC News interview Meet the Press, moderator Kristen Welker asked if people in the United States – citizens and non-citizens alike – deserve the due process of law, as the US constitution states. Trump said: “I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know.”\n\nPressed more generally on whether he believes he needs to uphold the supreme law of the land, Trump repeated: “I don’t know.”\n\nIn the same interview the US president also said he saw himself as leaving office at the end of his current term and not seeking a third one\n\nTrump ‘doesn’t rule out’ using military force to control Greenland\n\nDonald Trump would not rule out using military force to gain control of Greenland, the world’s largest island and an autonomous territory within Denmark, a fellow Nato member with the US.\n\nSince taking office, the US president has repeatedly expressed the idea of US expansion into Greenland, triggering widespread condemnation and unease both on the island itself and in the global diplomatic community. Greenland is seen as strategically important both for defence and as a future source of mineral wealth.\n\nIn his interview with NBC’s Meet The Press, Trump was asked whether he would rule out using force against the territory.\n\n“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,” Trump said.\n\nNPR and PBS push back against Trump’s order to cut funding\n\nThe heads of embattled US public broadcasters, National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), defended themselves against efforts by the Trump administration to cut off taxpayer funding, with both telling a Sunday political talkshow they were looking at legal options.\n\nPBS’s chief executive, Paula Kerger, told CBS News’s Face the Nation that Republican-led threats to withdraw federal funding from public broadcasters had been around for decades but are “different this time”.\n\nKerger said: “They’re coming after us on many different ways … we have never seen a circumstance like this, and obviously we’re going to be pushing back very hard, because what’s at risk are our stations, our public television, our public radio stations across the country.”\n\nTrump announces 100% tariffs on movies ‘produced in foreign lands’\n\nDonald Trump on Sunday announced on his Truth Social platform a 100% tariff on all movies “produced in Foreign Lands”.\n\nIn his post, he claimed to have authorised the Department of Commerce and the US trade representative to immediately begin instituting such a tariff, although he gave no details on how it would be implemented.\n\n“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat,” Trump said in the Truth Social post. “It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!”\n\nArts agency terminates dozens of grants after Trump proposes eliminating NEA\n\nDozens of US arts organisations have been notified that offers of government grants have been terminated, hours after Donald Trump proposed eliminating federal agencies that support arts, humanities and learning.\n\nThe cancellation of grant offers were reported from organisations across the US, including a $25,000 offer to a playhouse in Portland, Oregon, hours before the opening of a new production, August Wilson’s Joe Turner’s Come and Gone.\n\nTrump feels tug of political gravity as economy falters and polls plunge\n\nThe president started his second term fast and furious with a flurry of activity – much of it legally dubious – but analysts say the honeymoon is over, writes the Guardian’s David Smith.\n\nAfter a hundred days in which Trump at times appeared invincible, political gravity is exerting itself. A majority of Americans regard him as both a failure and a would-be dictator. From the courts to the streets, from law offices to college campuses, revolt is swelling. Republicans are eyeing next year’s midterm elections with nervousness.\n\n“The honeymoon is over,” said John Zogby, an author and pollster. “He actually squandered his hundred days, perhaps you can argue, by doing too much, not succeeding with much of it and overplaying his hand. At the end of the 100 days his polling numbers reflect an unsuccessful quarter. Every poll that I know of, including mine, has him upside down.”\n\nWhat else happened today:\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he was directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to rebuild and reopen the infamous Alcatraz prison in the San Francisco Bay to “house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.”Trump said he was considering naming his deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller as national security adviser and expects to appoint a successor to Mike Waltz within six months. Trump made the comments while speaking to reporters on Air Force One.An ultranationalist who opposes military aid to Ukraine, has vilified the EU’s leaders, and calls himself Donald Trump’s “natural ally” has won the first round of Romania’s rerun presidential vote.\n\nCatching up?

The President fired off a grave statement contending that other nations are snatching filmmakers from Hollywood with attractive financial enticements, sending the US movie industry into turmoil. Describing the situation as a \"national security threat\" Mr Trump declared: \"Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.\" He suggested the concerted actions by international competitors are not only economic but also strategic in terms of \"messaging and propaganda,\" stressing an urgent need for America to shield its film sector. In an assertive move, Mr Trump has given the green light to the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to commence \"the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.\" He punctuated his announcement with a clarion call: \"WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!\" This bombshell policy marks one of Trump's boldest steps yet in asserting America's cultural dominance and framing global competition under the lens of national security. He said he was authorizing the U.S. Trade Representative to process the institution of the tariff because the United States' movie industry is dying \"a very fast death.\" He further explained this was due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmaker's and studios. Hollywood, long viewed as a soft power asset for the United States, has recently been grappling with escalating production costs, international competition, and evolving viewer habits, reports the Express . Mr Trump's warning is set to ignite intense debate within the entertainment industry, with detractors suggesting that protectionist tariffs could inflate consumer costs and hinder international collaborations. However, proponents argue that such a move could stimulate investment in US-based productions and re-establish the nation's position as a global leader in cinema. With a potential return to the White House on the horizon, Mr Trump's stance sends a clear signal: he plans to prioritise America's cultural exports in his economic strategy.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump has declared the American film industry is &quot;dying a very fast death&quot; as he announced his administration would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made movies","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/donald-trump-declares-foreign-films-35169933","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35161288.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/2_TOPSHOT-US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:53:36","author":"Michael Carroll,Michael D.

In a Truth Social post Sunday evening, the president called to “REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!”\n\n“For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” Trump wrote. “When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be.”\n\n“No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets,” he said, adding that he’s directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, “to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.”\n\nThe president then made his latest attack on judges, some of whom had recently ruled against the Trump administration related to his massive deportation operation.\n\n“We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally,” the president said. “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, quickly rejected Trump’s plan.\n\n“Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than sixty years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President’s proposal is not a serious one,” she wrote on X.\n\nThe directive comes after a district judge in Texas ruled that the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to summarily deport Venezuelan immigrants accused of being gang members is “unlawful.”\n\nThe Trump administration has sent planes carrying immigrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador known as CECOT.\n\nThe country’s president, Nayib Bukele, told Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last month that he plans to expand CECOT, which has been attacked by human rights groups as a “tropical gulag” rife with abuses. The prison already holds 40,000 prisoners.\n\nTrump last month told Bukele that the “homegrowns” are next, referring to American citizens. “You gotta build about five more places … It’s not big enough.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-ordered-reopening-expansion-001728354.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/cccab0569f39f66b193f29d40d48dd8d","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:49:40","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":317836162,"title":"Scruffy Hollywood charmer is unrecognizable while filming with much younger actress","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, May 5th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations come to a crashing halt at 3:35am after noise complaints as Victoria shares a glimpse of the lavish four days of celebrations\n\nMajor terror attack 'was just HOURS away' before it was foiled by the special forces and police: Seven Iranians arrested in raids after 'biggest counter-state threat in years'\n\nTrump orders Alcatraz prison to be reopened and expanded to house the 'dregs of society'\n\nCocaine addiction wrecked my life, reveals TikTok agony aunt HANNAH VINEY in unsparing detail.

Trump replied, “I think we’re not going to ever get to that point. Something could happen with Greenland. I’ll be honest, we need that for national and international security.”\n\n“But not with Canada?” Welker asked.\n\n“It’s highly unlikely,” Trump replied, laughing. “I just don’t see it with Canada, I have to be honest with you.”\n\nTrump said that action against Greenland was also unlikely, but added he could see circumstances where he would be open to it.\n\n“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything,” Trump said.\n\n“We need Greenland very badly ... for international security,” he added, promising that the United States would “cherish” the “the very small amount of people” currently inhabiting the Arctic mega-island.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump maintained that he was serious about the proposal and believed it would be to both countries’ benefit.\n\nAsked whether he would discuss the prospect of adding Canada to the United States with newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump replied, “I'll always talk about that.”\n\n“If Canada was a state it wouldn’t cost us. It would be great,” he said.\n\nSpeaking about a hypothetical map after a U.S.–Canada merger, Trump said, “I’m a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that [map] without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago ... What a beautiful country it would be.”\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, would gain from no longer having to subsidize Canada’s defense spending as a foreign power, Trump said.\n\nTrump has long had ambitions to add Greenland as a U.S. territory, first floating the idea of purchasing it from Denmark, which currently has control over the territory, in 2019 during his first term.\n\nThere are several reasons for his interest in the sparsely populated Arctic island.\n\nGaining American control of Greenland has been a central focus of Trump’s foreign policy, which has been compared to the Monroe Doctrine in its focus on increasing American influence on Western Hemisphere geopolitics.\n\nRussia’s northern coastline circles the Arctic, and the adversary has long taken an interest in the region.\n\nSince October, the two leading U.S. rivals have been conducting joint patrols in the region, an escalation from China’s previously minimal involvement with Arctic affairs.\n\nVance said Denmark, which currently rules Greenland, has not “devoted the resources necessary to keep this base, to keep our troops, and ... to keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China, and other nations” in the region.\n\nAside from that, Pituffik Space Base is crucial to America’s missile defense strategy, as the Arctic represents the shortest distance an ICBM missile would need to fly to strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nChina currently dominates the international market over several of these, making the United States heavily reliant on its leading adversary in this domain.\n\nThe area also neighbors several crucial shipping and strategic channels in the Arctic, increasing its potential value to the United States.","summary":"President Donald Trump said military action in either case is unlikely, but said he's less certain about Greenland.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-military-annexation-of-canada-highly-unlikely-but-possible-for-greenland-5852253","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/05/02/id5851592-GettyImages-2212352958-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:37:56","author":"Joseph Lord","authors":["Joseph Lord"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":317831586,"title":"Trump says he will hit non-US movies with 100% tariffs","text":"US President Donald Trump says he plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with a 100% tariff.\n\nTrump said he was authorising the US Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".\n\nHe blamed a \"concerted effort\" by other countries that offer incentives to attract filmmakers and studios, which he described as a \"National Security threat\".\n\n\"It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. \"WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr7e2z1rxyo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d581/live/77ff8460-2942-11f0-9515-3ddbe8dc45b3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:29:44","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":317832108,"title":"Looking forward to lower oil prices","text":"For more than five years now, Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest oil exporter and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (Opec+) kingpin — has been striving to balance the global oil demand and supply by controlling output. Riyadh has been at the forefront of this effort and has been shouldering the major weight of the Opec+ output cut mechanism. \n\nIn recent months, Opec+ cut its crude oil output by over five million barrels, some five per cent of the global supply. Saudi Arabia was contributing two-fifths of this output cut.\n\nThe effort, aimed at propping up the global oil market prices, was essential to meet the ever-growing budgetary requirements of major oil producers, Saudi Arabia included. Most Opec economies are often termed as single-product economies, with oil earnings staying crucial to meeting the needs of these petro-states.\n\nBut Riyadh now seems fed up with its act of propping up the oil markets by playing the role of a swing producer. Reuters reported last week that Saudi officials have been briefing allies and industry experts in recent days that they were unwilling to prop up oil markets with further supply cuts.\n\n Inventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s\n\nThere seems to be some logic behind the Saudi desperation. Despite the Opec+ output cuts, markets have not been able to stabilise much. Crude has shed about 19pc this year, briefly touching a four-year low last month, as the Trump administration’s tariffs fanned concerns that energy demand will fall.\n\nHowever, to some extent, oil busters within Opec+ had to be blamed for this market weakness. Some Opec+ members have been overshooting their allocated output quotas — apparently at Riyadh’s cost.\n\nSaudi Arabia is not ready to tolerate it any further. “Opec’s decision framework appears to be fueled by persistent cheating, particularly from the likes of Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia, among others,” TD Cowen strategists, including Dan Ghali and Bart Melek, said in a note to clients. \n\nInventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s, Bloomberg quoted them as saying in the note. Riyadh is also not ready to concede its market share any further.\n\nThis carries ramifications for the health of the oil markets and the oil revenues of the major producers over the coming months. Many years back, while Ali Al-Naimi was at the helm of the Saudi Petroleum Ministry and fed up with quota cheating by other Opec oil producers, Riyadh had to adopt the same path to protect its market share. \n\nThe growing shale output from the US was also an apparent target of the Saudi policymakers then. Mr Naimi had told American drillers in February 2016 that they could “lower costs, borrow cash or liquidate” in the face of sub-$50-a-barrel prices. \n\nThe result was disastrous in some sense. Market prices collapsed. This ultimately resulted in a ceasefire among the producers.\n\nToday can’t be any different. Saudis are not ready to continue sharing the burden of the oil output cut, almost single-handedly, any further. With several fellow Opec+ members failing to adhere to their output targets and to compensate for oversupply in recent months, a frustrated Riyadh is changing tack, Opec+ sources told Reuters.\n\nThis possible shift in Saudi policy could suggest a move toward producing more and expanding its market share, a major change after five years spent balancing the market through deep output as a leader of the Opec+ group of oil producers.\n\nDespite its dependence on cash flow from oil sales, Saudi officials have been emphasising in recent weeks that the kingdom can live with the fall in prices by raising borrowing and cutting costs, media reports said, quoting several sources. “The Saudis are ready for lower prices and may need to pull back on some major projects,” one of the sources said.\n\nSaudi Arabia needs oil prices above $90 to balance its budget, higher than other large Opec producers, such as the United Arab Emirates, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nTheories on the reasons behind the apparent change in Saudi strategy range from punishing Opec+ members for exceeding their quotas to a move to fight for market share after ceding ground to non-Opec producers such as the United States and Guyana.\n\nHigher output may also be a fillip to US President Donald Trump, who has called for Opec to boost output to help keep US gasoline prices down. Some feel that Riyadh needs to oblige President Trump for political reasons. That may also have pushed Riyadh to change its track on crude output.\n\nAll these have an impact on the economies of the major oil producers. The IMF has downgraded its economic growth forecast for the oil exporters in the Middle East to 2.3pc from 4pc projected last October due to the slide in oil prices.\n\n“Across the region, rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty are adding to the impact of conflicts and extended oil production cuts to weaken growth prospects,” the IMF said in its Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nIn the meantime, the IMF has also downgraded Saudi Arabia’s GDP growth forecast to 3.0pc this year, lower than a previous forecast of 3.3pc economic growth, following the 13pc decline in oil prices over the past month.\n\nIn a welcome change, the projected lower oil prices could take some pressure off the balance of payments of oil consumers, like Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, May 5th, 2025","summary":"For more than five years now, Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest oil exporter and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (Opec+) kingpin — has been striving to balance the global oil demand and supply by controlling output.

[We’re guessing Conway meant 2028.]\n\nTrump had posted that foreign nations are luring Hollywood’s best talent, and that made it a national security issue, so he might decide to levy a tariff on foreign films. Never mind that Trump, on multiple occasions, attacked movie stars and the industry because it has lined up against him in most instances. Recruiting filmmaking outside the U.S., where movies have been made for decades, hardly constitutes a national emergency.\n\nThe raving tweet was senseless on its face, but even sillier against a backdrop of a staggering economy, military conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, a globe-wide trade war, a willy-nilly dismantling of the federal government and more.\n\nIs Trump merely trying to distract Americans from the tariffs that already are costing jobs and driving up prices across the board?\n\n“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump posted. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”\n\nEarlier in the day, former MAGA Rep. Joe Walsh tweeted, “There should be coverage of Trump’s cognitive decline. Massive coverage. Because it’s an issue. A huge issue.”\n\nThe national media, for the most part, has ignored Trump’s decay — and certainly has not focused on it the way it castigated Biden for every gaffe or misstep.\n\nOn Sunday alone, Trump said he was mulling the reopening of Alcatraz, one of the nation’s most notorious prisons that housed only 300 prisoners at its peak. While most saw the prison as a cruel and evil place, Trump insists, “It’s a symbol of law and order.”\n\nWhen asked whether everyone in the U.S. was entitled to due process — a fifth-grade civics question — Trump said, “I don’t know. I’m not a lawyer.” Does he need to uphold the Constitution (according to his oath)? “I don’t know,” he said.\n\nAnd when asked about the economy, he said, “I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy.”\n\nAnd did we mention that he tweeted an image of himself as pope?\n\nBut, hey, the guy passed all those cognitive tests, right?\n\nThe again, maybe Conway did mean 2026.","summary":"They're reading the signs, they say","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/05/trump-watchers-like-george-conway-and-joe-walsh-are-betting-on-this-tragic-ending.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/LC7W5V5DWRCTRAWEDYIUAHPP4E.jpg?auth=32bdef48fa8f372d3129bbfb3e9e0760387143b7a76a811d33ac8d9893a2d10b&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:24:24","author":"Kevin Manahan","authors":["Kevin Manahan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":317831772,"title":"Trump announces 100% tariff on movies produced outside US to save Hollywood 'dying a very fast death'","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would be imposing a 100 percent tariff on any movie produced outside of the United States.\n\nBy doing so, the president wants to save America's movie industry from 'dying a very fast death.\n\n'Other countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,' he claimed on his Truth Social platform.

JASMINE CROCKETT ROASTED FOR WORRYING ABOUT EFFECT OF DEPORTATION ON OTHER COUNTRIES Crockett, a first-term Democrat who has been criticized for several controversial comments this year, often voices her opinions on social media — where she has accumulated more than a million followers. In March, she was scorched online for failing to apologize for calling Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who uses a wheelchair, \"Governor Hot Wheels.\" She claimed on X that she was not thinking about the paralyzed governor's condition when she made the remarks, but then took shots at Trump supporters — calling her gaffe \"yet another distraction.\" SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS OVER JASMINE CROCKETT 'GASLIGHTING' ABOUT CALLING ABBOTT 'GOVERNOR HOT WHEELS' \"I’m even more appalled that the very people who unequivocally support Trump—a man known for racially insensitive nicknames and mocking those with disabilities — are now outraged,\" she wrote in the post. \"Keep that same energy for all people, not just your political adversaries. \"Finally, this is yet another distraction. Instead of obsessing over and hanging on to my every word, maybe my political foes should focus on doing the work of the people who elected us to improve their lives.\" REP. JASMINE CROCKETT SAYS DEMOCRATS NEED TO BE 'OK WITH PUNCHING' IN RACES AGAINST TED CRUZ, REPUBLICANS Randy Weber, R-Texas, Crockett's fellow delegation member, responded to her explanation by telling her \"words have meanings & actions have consequences. \"I look forward to introducing my resolution to censure you for your words and actions,\" Weber wrote. Crockett also previously called for DOGE head Elon Musk to be \"taken down,\" and said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, should be \"knocked over the head, like, hard.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The White House and Crockett did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. \n\n“This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda! \n\n“Therefore, I am authorizing the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands. \n\n“WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”\n\nLast month, China reportedly began weighing up a ban on all US films in retaliation for Trump raising tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump had introduced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, including a massive 104 per cent duty on Chinese goods.\n\nBloomberg News reported that in China, two widely followed bloggers with links to the local authorities shared identical lists of measures that could be introduced by Chinese authorities in response. These included “reducing or banning the import of US films.”\n\nThe bloggers, Liu Hong, a senior editor at the Xinhua News Agency, and Ren Yi, grandson of former Guangdong Province Communist Party chief Ren Zhongyi, both attributed the plans to sources familiar with the Chinese state’s planning.\n\nIn 2024, US films grossed around $585 million in China. This represents around 3.5 per cent of China's total $17.71 billion box office. A significant proportion of that haul was attributable to the success of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which made $132 million in China.\n\nThe total US and Canada domestic box office for the same period was around $8.56 billion.\n\nThe film sector represents a sizeable US trade surplus with China, as Chinese films do not tend to be as popular overseas. However, in March some American-based Chinese campaigned for animated hit Ne Zha 2 to get an IMAX release in the US.\n\nThe animated blockbuster has already landed a release date for 37 territories across Europe, including the UK and Ireland.\n\nNe Zha 2, made on an $80 million budget, has already become the highest-grossing animated film in history after making $2.06 billion in China, overtaking last year’s US-made Inside Out 2, which made $1.7 billion worldwide.","summary":"‘We want movies made in America, again!’ proclaimed the President","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/trump-tariffs-movies-foreign-films-b2744829.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/03/10/newFile.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nMKKhSZZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:11:19","author":"Kevin E G Perry","authors":["Kevin E G Perry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.116},{"id":317831540,"title":"“The Ideal Way Things Should Be”","text":"NEW YORK — President Donald Trump has announced that he is ordering his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison located on an island in California.\n\nPosting on his Truth Social site Sunday evening, Trump stated, “America has suffered too long from vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who contribute nothing but Misery and Suffering.

Previously, in February, a lawsuit targeted Chicago and Illinois, accusing local authorities of obstructing and complicating the duties of federal immigration officers.\n\nThe lawsuit against Denver and Colorado highlights incidents in the Mile High City and surrounding areas, such as Aurora, pointing specifically to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua as evidence of the shortcomings of “sanctuary” laws.\n\n“At the end of last year, the nation was shocked by images and videos of members of Tren de Aragua seizing control of apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado,” the DOJ’s complaint says.\n\n“The fact that a foreign terrorist organization could gain such a foothold in the United States of America is unacceptable,” the department alleges. “It is the direct byproduct of the sanctuary policies pushed by the State of Colorado, and certain of its subdivisions. This is a suit to put an end to those disastrous policies and restore the supremacy of federal immigration law.”\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nResponding to the lawsuit, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement saying that if the courts were to deem “any Colorado law” as being not valid, then the state would follow the ruling. The City of Denver, meanwhile, said it “will not be bullied or blackmailed, least of all by an administration that has little regard for the law and even less for the truth,” according to The Denver Post.\n\nColorado, much like Illinois, has become one of the epicenters for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations since President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nThe DOJ says Colorado’s policies, specifically, have “tied the hands of law enforcement, emboldened dangerous criminals and left [Colorado’s] communities vulnerable,” according to its complaint.\n\n“Local communities in Colorado have borne the brunt of these policies,” the complaint alleges. “In the words of Douglas County Colorado Commissioner Kevin Van Winkle: ‘We swore an oath to protect public safety, but these laws prevent us from doing so. … These laws require us to conceal the identity of those who committed a crime and are here illegally. That’s a serious public safety issue.””\n\nMore from Law&Crime: ‘Literally in the middle of the night’: Justice Alito slams SCOTUS for issuing ‘unprecedented’ relief by stopping Trump deportations carried out under wartime law\n\nFor its Illinois suit, the Trump administration cribbed from the Barack Obama administration’s playbook and sourced legal theories from a 2010 lawsuit filed by the Obama administration against Arizona S.B. 1070, a statute widely known as the “show me your papers” law. The Obama-era lawsuit ultimately made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2012 case stylized as Arizona v. United States. The result was largely a victory for federal authorities, applying the theory that most of the state law conflicted with or was otherwise preempted by federal immigration law on point.\n\nIn 2018, the first Trump administration filed a lawsuit against California over its sanctuary policies. That lawsuit ultimately went nowhere, though, as the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in the Golden State’s favor and the nation’s high court denied the government’s petition for writ of certiorari.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on “Meet the Press” Sunday, Dec. 8, 2024 (NBC&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump DOJ Files Lawsuit Against Additional State and &#8216;Sanctuary&#8217; City first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/trump-doj-files-lawsuit-against-additional-state-and-sanctuary-city/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NYs-highest-court-wont-stop-Trumps-hush-money-sentencing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:04:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":317831580,"title":"Trump orders notorious prison of Alcatraz to re-open","text":"US President Donald Trump says he is directing the Bureau of Prisons to rebuild and reopen the infamous Alcatraz prison in the San Francisco Bay to \"house America's most ruthless and violent offenders\".\n\n\"REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!\" he posted on the Truth Social platform. \"When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm.\"\n\nThe closure of the federal prison in 1963 was attributed to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.\n\nIt is now one of San Francisco's most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe prison — infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it — was known as the \"The Rock\" and housed some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly.\n\nIt has long been part of the cultural imagination and has been the subject of numerous movies, including \"The Rock\" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.\n\n\"Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering.

Its supporters say it targets antisemitic actions, including boycotts of Israel.The bill has bipartisan support but also faces bipartisan opposition.What To KnowAccording to the lawmakers who introduced the bill, Lawler and Gottheimer, H.R. 867 \"amends the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to include international governmental organizations (IGOs) in existing anti-boycott laws.\"The congressmen said in a January press release that the change \"targets harmful and inherently antisemitic\" boycott efforts undertaken at IGOs while also \"extending protections already in place for boycotts instigated by foreign countries.\"However, critics warn the bill threatens the constitutional rights of Americans. The penalties under the legislation include civil penalties, criminal fines of up to $1 million and imprisonment of up to 20 years for supporting calls to boycott Israel.A number of prominent MAGA lawmakers said Sunday they plan to vote against the legislation.The legislation comes amid ongoing protests against Israel, with university campuses in the spotlight due to students demonstrating against and criticizing the Middle Eastern ally of the U.S.Supporters of the protests say they are standing up for Palestinian rights amid Israel's war in Gaza. Critics of the protests, which often call for boycotting Israel, saying the demonstrators are antisemitic and threaten Jewish students. Meanwhile, some Jewish students and groups also participate in the protests against Israel.Israel's current war against Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, began in the aftermath of the Palestinian militant group's October 7, 2023, attack that left more than 1,200 people dead in Israel. Since the war started, more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed and over 100,000 injured.What MAGA Critics of H.R. 867 SayRepresentative Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, on X: \"H.R. 867, up for a vote tomorrow, aims to curb antisemitism but threatens First Amendment rights. Americans have the right to boycott, and penalizing this risks free speech. I reject and vehemently condemn antisemitism but I cannot violate the first amendment.\"Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, on X: \"I will be voting NO. It is my job to defend American's rights to buy or boycott whomever they choose without the government harshly fining them or imprisoning them. But what I don't understand is why we are voting on a bill on behalf of other countries and not the President's executive orders that are FOR OUR COUNTRY???\"Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, on X responding to Greene: \"I agree with @RepMTG. I'll be voting No on this bill as well.\"Former Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, on X: \"If this bill becomes law, how many Israeli products do I need in my home to avoid fines or prison? If I leave an Israeli-made product outside my home, is it the 2025 version of lambs blood that keeps my family safe?\"Steve Bannon, a prominent Trump ally and host of the War Room podcast, shared Gaetz post on Gettr, and wrote: \"Fact Check: TRUE\"What Supporters of H.R. 867 SayLawler in a January statement: \"I'm proud to reintroduce the IGO Anti-Boycott Act, a bipartisan effort to protect U.S. citizens, businesses, and our allies, particularly Israel, from discriminatory boycotts. This bill closes a critical loophole by ensuring that international organizations cannot enable harmful BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions] efforts. This legislation is essential to safeguarding Israel's security and economy from unjust attacks\"Gottheimer in a January statement: \"International organizations can't get away with targeting our key democratic ally, Israel. That's why we are introducing the bipartisan IGO Anti-Boycott Act to counter the blatant anti-Israel bias in international organizations like the United Nations, which has a long history of targeting the Jewish state. Democrats and Republicans must continue working together to combat efforts to isolate, delegitimize, and demonize our key ally, Israel.\" American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in a January statement: \"AIPAC strongly supports the IGO Anti-Boycott Act which makes clear the U.S. will not countenance U.N. instigated boycotts of our ally Israel.\"What Happens NextH.R. 867 is slated to come up for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow.

It housed well-known criminals of the time including Al Capone and George “Machine-Gun” Kelly.\n\nIt closed due to soaring maintenance costs, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which estimated an additional $3-5 million was needed at the time to keep the prison running outside of daily operational costs.\n\n“No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our street,” Trump wrote in his Sunday post. “That is why, today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent Offenders.”\n\nTrump flagged that even judges who failed to work with his administration were at risk of incarceration.\n\n“We will no longer be held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally,” the president said. “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”","summary":"Nathan Howard / REUTERSDonald Trump appears to have taken the advice of his eldest son after announcing the reopening of America’s most famous prison.\n\nThe president revealed his intentions to “rebuild and open” Alcatraz just months after Donald Trump Jr. made the suggestion on social media.\n\n“For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday night.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-takes-don-jrs-advice-with-plan-to-reopen-infamous-prison/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/QBWUVBG4ABBU5ATZO6YWOPKD7I.JPG?smart=true&auth=500f804b8c20a917accb400b3eba6b2194f77517ae1dfbbb821db2c0d40ce85d&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-05 00:00:15","author":"Matt Young","authors":["Matt Young"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":317830726,"title":"Controversial military personnel nominee faces Senate panel this week","text":"Senate lawmakers on Tuesday will consider the controversial nomination of retired Army Brig.

No longer will we tolerate these Serial Offenders who spread filth, bloodshed, and mayhem on our streets.'\n\nTrump said reopening Alcatraz will free him and hardworking Americans from being 'held hostage to criminals, thugs, and Judges that are afraid to do their job and allow us to remove criminals, who came into our Country illegally.'\n\nThe order comes as Trump has repeatedly clashed with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members and illegal migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador. \n\nSeveral judges have ruled he must grant deportees due process. Trump has also floated potentially sending American citizens there and to other foreign prisons. \n\nNow, it appears he's found a new solution which could save him the trouble of battling with judges about the legality of deportations. \n\nAlcatraz was a maximum security federal prison off the coast of San Francisco which was closed in 1963 after 29 years of operation.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), an estimated $3 million to $5 million was needed just for restoration and maintenance work to keep the prison open. \n\n'That figure did not include daily operating costs - Alcatraz was nearly three times more expensive to operate than any other Federal prison (in 1959 the daily per capita cost at Alcatraz was $10.10 compared with $3.00 at USP Atlanta).' \n\nThe main expense was due to the fact that Alcatraz was an island and all of the goods had to be shipped there by boat. \n\nThe BOP added: 'The island had no source of fresh water, so nearly one million gallons of water had to be barged to the island each week. \n\n'The Federal Government found that it was more cost-effective to build a new institution than to keep Alcatraz open.' \n\nFollowing the announcement of its closure, signed off by U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Alcatraz's population was slowly whittled down, with inmates redistributed to other federal prisons. \n\nThere were 1,576 prisoners held in Alcatraz over that time and it was notorious for its primative conditions.\n\nBank robbing trio Frank Morris, Clarence Anglin, and John Anglin famously escaped in 1962, leaving behind dummy heads made of plaster and human hair to fool the guards. \n\nThey were never found. Some suspect they didn't survive the frigid waters and strong currents, but their daring escape also sparked wild theories that they'd made it ashore and adopted new lives. \n\nThe brothers and Morris tunneled out their cells, crept through ventilation ducts and through an unguarded utility door before fleeing into the shark-infested bay on a handmade raft.\n\nBefore Alactraz permanently closed its doors in 1963, there were a total of 14 separate escapes involving 36 inmates.\n\nAccording to reports 23 were captured, six were shot and killed during the attempt, two drowned and five were never found. \n\nHistoric photos reveal what life was like at the island-bound jail, also known as The Rock, with everything from the cultivated gardens to the bustling mess hall and the bulletproof main guard's office on show. \n\nOne image captures a prison chef standing still for the camera with a Christmas menu from 1950 outlined above him. Some of the kitchen delights the inmates had to look forward to during their festive meal included roast turkey, giblet gravy, candied sweet potatoes, raisin nut dressing, whipped potatoes, and bread with butter substitute 'oleo.'\n\nIn 1972, Alcatraz was added to the newly created Golden Gate National Recreation Area and was opened to the public in 1973 as a historical landmark.\n\nToday the former prison welcomes more than 1.5 million visitors a year.\n\nTickets sell out nearly every day, sometimes weeks in advance, for audio tours of the main cell block and recreation yard plus the chance to stroll past the island's gardens and ruined buildings.","summary":"Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to work alongside the Department of Justice, FBI and Homeland Security to 'reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt' Alcatraz.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14678117/donald-trump-reopen-alcatraz.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/05/00/98027143-0-image-a-15_1746401072700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 23:58:34","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":317831474,"title":"Trump orders feds to reopen Alcatraz to house 'America’s most ruthless and violent' criminals","text":"President Donald Trump is calling for the notorious prison and now historical landmark, Alcatraz, in San Francisco, California, to be rebuilt larger and reopened to house the country’s most ruthless and violent criminals.

THE ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ: WHAT HAPPENED, BIGGEST CONSPIRACY THEORIES SURROUNDING THE INFAMOUS PRISON BREAK Considering its 1.25-mile distance to shore, the Bay Area island was considered practically escape-proof, although there were 14 documented attempted escapes. The most notorious one was the June 11, 1962, escape by John and Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris, which inspired \"Escape from Alcatraz.\" It remains a mystery whether the three reached the shore and survived. The FBI concluded the escapees drowned due to harsh conditions. BUILDING ALCATRAZ: AMERICA'S INESCAPABLE, ISLAND-RIDDEN PRISON The three prisoners chiseled an escape route from their own jail cells and built makeshift, papier-mâché heads. The final attempted escape from the prison, almost six months later, inspired what has become the swimming route of the \"Escape from Alcatraz\" triathlon. Its most notorious inmates included gangsters James \"Whitey\" Bulger, Al Capone and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly, plus infamous \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" Robert Stroud and \"Public Enemy No. 1\" Alvin Karpis. Alcatraz ultimately closed in 1963 after its island operations proved far more costly than mainland-based prisons.

The term has been used as a way to detain cartel members more easily and limit their ability to challenge their imprisonment.\n\nThe stunning segment published on Sunday, comes as Trump administration examines whether the 'enemy combatant' designation could be applied to suspected narco-terrorists outside the States as a way to potentially give the US justification to conduct lethal strikes against them.\n\nThe administration has said it is only considering ways to use the label against suspected members of the eight groups Trump has designated as foreign terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aragua and MS-13. \n\nBut instead of focusing on the legal ramifications or victims of cartel violence, CNN’s reporter turned to the drug trafficker himself to ask how the gang member felt about the label.\n\n'Well, the situation is ugly but we have to eat,' the cartel member replied.\n\n'What's your message to Donald Trump if he's watching this?' the reporter pushed.\n\n'My respect. According to him, he's looking out for his people. But the problem is the consumers are in the United States. If there weren't any consumers we would stop.'\n\nThe online backlash was swift and brutal with those watching the exchange far from impressed with CNN's line of questioning.\n\n'I feel like these kinds of journalists fetishize criminals. It strikes me as similar to the women who would throw themselves at Ted Bundy after he was arrested,' wrote Mark Valorian. \n\n'This is absolutely evil,' stated TS Nelson. 'Interviewing cartel...the ppl that human traffik children, smuggle drugs into the US, rape, murder and rob ppl. Just when you think MSM can't sink any lower the next day happens.'\n\n'So CNN is concerned about hurting the cartel's feelings? This isn't the flex they think it is. It's offensive to Americans,' tweeted Patty Free.\n\n'That 'journalist' is an enabler. She's enabling terrorists. She should be arrested,' demanded one. \n\n'Well, we need to be respectful and not hurt the cartel members feelings,' mocked another X user.\n\n'The point of labeling them as terrorists isn't just to be able to go after them but to go after those, banks in particular, that do business with the cartels. The cartels are about to find out what happens when their money gets frozen and taken,' explained one on X.\n\nThe Republican president has touted his immigration crackdown as he marked his 100th day in office this week. \n\nTrump won the White House election last November in large part on promises to combat what he repeatedly claimed is an invasion of criminal migrants.\n\nTrump has sent troops to the Mexican border, imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada for allegedly not doing enough to stop illegal crossings, and designated gangs like TdA and MS-13 as terrorist groups. \n\nIn March Trump invoked the little-known Alien Enemies Act and flew two planeloads of alleged Tren de Aragua members to El Salvador's notorious maximum security CECOT prison.\n\nIn a proclamation, Trump said Tren de Aragua was engaged in 'hostile actions' and 'threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,' adding that Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro was pulling the strings.\n\nIn the most publicized case to date, Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to CECOT before the Trump administration admitted he was sent there due to an 'administrative error.'\n\nLast week, Trump said he has not spoken to El Salvador's president about returning Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn an ABC News interview on Tuesday, Trump said he could help return the. man with a single phone call but would not, despite the US Supreme Court's April 10 order for his administration to 'facilitate' his release.\n\nTrump's administration has argued that only El Salvador can act to return him.\n\nAbrego Garcia, 29, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland with a work permit, was detained by U.S. immigration officers in March and questioned about alleged gang ties before being sent on one of three deportation flights to El Salvador with Venezuelan migrants despite a protective order allowing him to remain in the U.S.\n\nThe White House has repeated the unproven accusation that Abrego Garcia is part of criminal gang MS-13, which the administration has designated a foreign terrorist group. \n\nHis lawyers deny any gang affiliation, saying he left El Salvador at age 16 to escape such violence and received a protective order in 2019 to continue living in the US.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin made the administration's position known.\n\n'The facts are clear: Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a violent illegal alien who abuses women and children. He had no business being in our country and we are proud to have deported this violent thug.'\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said he was unsure whether people in the US are entitled to due process rights guaranteed in the US Constitution as his administration pushes aggressively to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally and other non-citizens.\n\nTrump made his comments during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker. \n\nWelker asked Trump whether he agreed with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said last month that 'of course' all people in the US are entitled to due process, which generally requires the government to provide notice and a hearing before taking certain adverse legal actions.\n\n'I don't know. I'm not, I'm not a lawyer. I don't know,' Trump said, adding that such a requirement would mean 'we'd have to have a million or 2 million or 3 million trials.'\n\nTrump added that his lawyers 'are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.'\n\nThe Fifth Amendment provides 'due process of law,' meaning a person has certain rights when it comes to being prosecuted for a crime. Also, the 14th Amendment says no state can 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'\n\nTrump said he has 'brilliant lawyers ... and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.'\n\nHe said he was pushing to deport 'some of the worst, most dangerous people on Earth,' but that courts are getting in his way.\n\n'I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts are holding me from doing it,' Trump said.\n\nOn April 19 the Supreme Court justices temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. \n\nTrump's administration, which invoked the AEA, a rarely used wartime law, has urged the justices to lift or narrow their order.","summary":"CNN is facing backlash after airing an interview with a Sinaloa cartel member who was asked how he felt about Trump labeling gang affiliates 'enemy combatants.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14677859/CNN-interviewer-terrorist-cartel-gangster-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/04/23/98024749-0-image-m-13_1746398550815.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 23:54:57","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":317827992,"title":"Trump set to explode as Mike Pence gets prestigious award","text":"An MSNBC host warned Americans on Sunday that President Donald Trump is set to go ballistic as his former vice president receives a prestigious award.\n\nMike Pence, who betrayed his commander-in-chief when he certified the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021, will receive the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum on Sunday night for his actions that day.\n\nIn announcing that Pence would receive the award - which has previously gone to former President Barack Obama and Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky - the JFK Library said Pence put 'his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power,' according to Politico.\n\nCaroline Kennedy, the former president's daughter, and her son, Jack Schlossberg, also said in a statement that Pence's decision to certify the election results - even as protesters called for him to be hanged - was an 'example of President Kennedy's belief that an act of political courage can change the course of history.'\n\nBut when MSNBC hosts discussed the award on The Weekend in the hours before the ceremony was set to start, Jonathan Capehart said he was 'most looking forward to' President Trump's reaction 'because it's totally going to be...'.\n\nHe then stopped talking, and instead mimed Trump's head exploding.\n\nCo-host Elise Jordan agreed, acknowledging: 'Truth Social is going to be lighting up.' \n\nTrump, whose first term in office had just ended, pressured his then-vice president in January 2021 to reject election results from swing states where the Republican president claimed the vote was marred by fraud. \n\nBut Pence refused, saying he lacked such authority.\n\nWhen he then stood before Congress on January 6 to accept the 2020 presidential election results, he and legislators from both parties were confronted by an angry mob - many of whom took specific aim at Pence for refusing to use his role to throw out the controversial Electoral College votes from the swing states.\n\nSome Trump supporters even erected makeshift gallows and chanted 'hang Mike Pence.' \n\nDuring the House select committee on January 6th hearings, it also came out that a confidential informant on the Proud Boys had told the FBI that if members of the group had found Pence that day they would have killed him.\n\nStill Pence refused to leave the Capitol, hiding out in a garage-like structure deemed a secure location within the complex. \n\n'The vice president did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol,' his counselor to the vice president Greg Jacob testified to committee members in 2022. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump continued to push what has been called the 'big lie' that he lost the election and hit out at his vice president. \n\n'Mike Pence didn´t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,' Trump wrote at the time on X as rioters moved through the Capitol and Pence was in hiding with his family, aides and security detail inside the building.\n\nStill, Pence stayed at the US Capitol to continue the ceremonial election certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory once the rioters were cleared. \n\nBut his decisions that day left Pence in the political wilderness.\n\nHe tried running against Trump for the 2024 nomination, but only stayed in the race through October 2023. \n\nTrump - the far-and-away frontrunner - wouldn't even participate in the GOP primary debates - so the two men never met onstage.\n\nPence then refused to endorse Trump once he secured the nomination - but also wouldn't endorse the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nInstead, his political action committee financed advertisements ahead of the 2024 election pushing Americans to vote for Republicans on issues. \n\nIt now remains unclear how much Pence has spoken with Trump since the January 6, 2021 certification.\n\nBut last year, the president chose Ohio Sen. JD Vance, rather than Pence, to serve as his running mate for his second term in office as he continued to claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\n'Against all odds, I did great in 2016. 2016, how great was that?' Trump told graduates at the University of Alabama on Thursday night, according to the Alabama Political Reporter.\n\n'And then I did much better in 2020,' he claimed. 'Sorry the election was rigged... it was a rigged election.

The only other presidents to share the unsavory distinction of being impeached are Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton.\n\nTrump has unceremoniously been the only president impeached twice. Those are just the 'official' attempts - the real number of impeachment efforts is greater than that.\n\nDemocrats, under former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, charged the president with obstruction of justice regarding a phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nThey also charged him with inciting an insurrection resulting in the January 6 Capitol riot. In both instances the Senate acquitted the president of any wrongdoing. \n\nAnd as of Monday, a third effort to impeach President Trump is underway. \n\nRep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., a low-profile rank-and-file member, proposed seven articles of impeachment against the 78-year-old, including bribery, abuse of power, obstruction of justice and more. \n\nBut that's not all - Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who famously waved his cane and disrupted Trump's joint address to Congress earlier this year, said Thursday he would bring additional articles of impeachment against Trump in coming days.\n\n'The Democrats are really out of control,' the president wrote Friday on Truth Social. 'They have lost everything, especially their minds! These radical left lunatics are into the 'Impeachment thing' again.'\n\n'They have already got two 'No Name,' little respected Congressmen, total whackjobs both, throwing the 'Impeachment' of Donald J. Trump around, for about the 20th time, even though they have no idea for what I would be Impeached,' the post continued. \n\n'Maybe it should be for cleaning up the mess that they left us on the border, or the highest inflation in our country's history or, perhaps, it should be the incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan, or Russia, Russia, Russia/Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, or the Attack of Israel on October 7th that only proceeded because they allowed Iran to regain great wealth,' the lengthy post stated. \n\nOut of the 260 Democratic lawmakers currently serving on Capitol Hill, the overwhelming majority has at least voted to impeach Trump once, and scores have voted to oust the Republican twice. \n\nIn 2019, all Democrats, 222 lawmakers, voted to impeach Trump on both articles related to his conversation with Zelensky. In the upper chamber, 47 senators voted to convict.\n\nIn 2021, nearly 230 Democrats voted to impeach Trump for his conduct regarding January 6. In the Senate, 48 Democrats voted to impeach the president in addition to seven Republicans. \n\nJust about 180 House Democrats who voted to impeach Trump years ago remain on Capitol Hill today. In the Senate, 41 Democrats who voted to impeach Trump remain.\n\nTo say that Democrats on Capitol Hill are open to impeaching Trump is an understatement, about 85 percent of them already have tried, according to an analysis by the Daily Mail. \n\nAnd though Democrats have failed to oust the Republican in their first two attempts, their appetite for Trump's removal still appears to be ravenous. \n\n'The President is attacking me because I filed Articles of Impeachment, asking 'What the hell did I do?' It's all in my seven articles of impeachment,' Thanedar posted on X clarifying his rationale for bringing the articles. \n\n'Defying a 9-0 Supreme Court ruling ... dismantling federal agencies ... imposing damaging tariffs ... violating First Amendment rights,' and more were among the Democrat's complaints.\n\n'This is not normal. Impeachment is how we fight back. I will always defend the Constitution!' the Michigan Democrat's post concluded. \n\nTrump, hitting back at the claims, argued the Democrats are impeaching him because they 'just want to do it.' \n\n'The Republicans should start to think about expelling them from Congress for all of the crimes that they have committed, especially around election time(s),' Trump's sprawling Friday Truth Social post continued.\n\n'These are total lowlifes, who hate our country, and everything it stands for. Perhaps we should start playing this game on them, and expel Democrats for the many crimes that they have committed — And these are real crimes,' Trump added. \n\nDespite their threats, Thanedar and Green face a rough road to accomplishing their twin goals of impeaching Trump. \n\nUnlike in 2019 and 2021, the House of Representatives, where all articles of impeachment begin, is now under the control of Republican Speaker Mike Johnson. \n\nAs speaker, Johnson has firm grip on what bills are allowed on the House, effectively giving him control over what does and does not receive a vote. \n\nThe two Democrats, therefore, would need, as Johnson may say it, an act of God to have their fringe attempts ever see a vote in committee, let alone a full vote on the House floor.\n\nEven if God does answer the Democrats prayers, and the vote gets a hypothetical vote on the House floor, it would surely be defeated by the Republican majority in the chamber. \n\nAnd, even if the bill somehow did pass in the GOP-held House, the Republican majority in the Senate would likely dispel the charges immediately.","summary":"President Donald Trump is no stranger to impeachment, in fact, he's the one that brought the practice back into vogue.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14672629/impeach-president-donald-trump-retaliation-lowlifes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/02/19/97965385-0-image-m-114_1746211477197.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 23:49:58","author":"Editor,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":317829156,"title":"Lady Gaga breaks her silence after bomb threat at her concert on Copacabana Beach in Brazil","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, May 5th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations come to a crashing halt at 3:35am after noise complaints as Victoria shares a glimpse of the lavish four days of celebrations\n\nMajor terror attack 'was just HOURS away' before it was foiled by the special forces and police: Seven Iranians arrested in raids after 'biggest counter-state threat in years'\n\nTrump orders Alcatraz prison to be reopened and expanded to house the 'dregs of society'\n\nCocaine addiction wrecked my life, reveals TikTok agony aunt HANNAH VINEY in unsparing detail.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy ALESIA STANFORD FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:20:39 BST, 4 May 2025 |Updated:00:48 BST, 5 May 2025 \n\nJennifer Garner and her boyfriend John Miller were spotted on a rare outing together Saturday in Los Angeles. \nThe couple, who have been dating on off since 2018, stepped out for a quick grocery run. \nGarner, 53, looked relaxed in a black hoodie and leggings with white sneakers and sock with a pink and yellow trim. \nHer long, chestnut locks were pulled back in a ponytail and covered with a black billed hat.\nMiller, 47, donned a gray crewneck sweater, jeans and brown boots for the trip to Vicente Foods. \nIt comes after a report claimed the couple, who have been dating on-off since 2018, are now essentially living together, but 'part time.' \n\nJennifer Garner, 53, and her boyfriend John Miller, 47, were seen on a rare outing together in Los Angeles on Saturday \n'John is basically living with Jennifer,' a source told UsWeekly on Wednesday, noting it was only 'part time.'\nThe site also claimed he moved out of his Los Angeles home after the wildfires ravaged several neighborhoods in the Southern California city, and he has yet to find a new pad.\n'He has an office in L.A. and splits his time between staying there and at Jennifer’s home,' the source said.\n'But he’s been staying with Jennifer more often [and] doesn’t want to impose, so he’s looking for his own place… [and] deciding whether he’ll rent or buy.'\nJennifer gave fans a glimpse into her relaxing Saturday morning activities.\nGarner shared a snap of a golden brown 'weekend focaccia'.\nThe scrumptious-looking bread was fresh out of the oven and perhaps John enjoyed a slice. \nThe 13 Going On 30 star was previously married to actor Ben Affleck from 2005 to 2018 and they share kids Violet, 19, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 13. \nThe pair have remained friendly since their 2018 divorce. They are the parents of three; Violet, 19, Fin, 16, and Sam, 13, and will sometimes do family activities together. \nAffleck recently bought a house just minutes away from Garner's to be closer to his children following his divorce from Jennifer Lopez. \nEarlier in the day, the Alias star shared some information on Day 17 of her effort to run a mile a day for 67 days to draw attention to the needs of suffering children around the world. \n'So, why is famine such a huge problem right now in Eastern Africa?' she asked rhetorically, while huffing through her neighborhood. \nTrying to make the situation relatable she said, 'A lot of this sounds very familiar to California; drought, then wildfire, then flooding, mudslides, so that is stuff we all know about.' \nThose problems result in 'loss of livestock. Loss of crops. War', adding 'thank God that is not an issue we are living through right now.'\nShe then spoke about what happens when these kinds of catastrophes begin their domino effect. \n\nThe couple have been dating since 2018 and are reportedly now living together\n\nThe couple may have been picking up ingredients for a delicious Italian dinner, as the Deadpool & Wolverine actress later shared a snap of a golden brown 'weekend focaccia'\n\nThe Alias star shared information as she ran a mile on day 17 of 67 to draw attention to the needs of suffering children around the world.

He will face off against pro-EU Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan in the May 18 runoff who received a 20.9% share of the vote while the governing coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu, missed out on the showdown after garnering 20.3% of the ballots cast.\n\n\"I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all those who chose to vote (for me) with the number one position on the ballot paper,\" Simion said in a recorded message.\n\n\"It was an act of courage, trust and solidarity. I am grateful and assure them that their trust will not be betrayed.\"\n\nSimion opposes EU leadership\n\nThe original vote last year was canceled because of widespread concerns over Russian interference in favor of far-right Calin Georgescu, who has been placed under investigation and has been disbarred from running for office.\n\nGeorgescu ally, Simion, who is 38 years old, opposes military aid to neighboring Ukraine and is critical of European Union leadership.\n\nSimion says he's aligned with the US President Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" movement and appears to be riding a similar wave of popular anger in the European Union and NATO member country of Romania.\n\nHe told DW that he wants Romania to have \"a strategic partnership with the US\" but the \"EU Commission should not meddle\" with policies regarding \"cultural and sexual aspects.\"\n\nWhy was the Romanian election annulled?\n\nNovember's vote, which saw far-right, pro-Russian outsider Calin Georgescu surprisingly come out on top in the first round, was annulled by Romania's constitutional court which found irregularities in the financing and organization of the leading campaign.\n\nAlleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of previously inactive social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of an \"aggressive Russian hybrid attack,\" which Moscow denies.\n\nRomanian public prosecutors in February opened an investigation into Georgescu, who was banned from standing again in Sunday's re-run.\n\nRomanian election: who are the favorites?\n\nWhile it was considered unlikely that any candidate would win a majority when polls closed in the first round of voting, Georgescu ally George Simion from the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR) was expected to progress to a second-round runoff on May 18.\n\nSimion's campaign has counted on support from disgruntled Georgescu voters concerned not only by high inflation and the increasing cost of living in the European Union country, but is now also influenced by populist conspiracy theories regarding the cancelation of the original vote.\n\n\"The anti-establishment sentiment is not an anarchic movement; it is against the people who destroyed this country,\" Simion told the Associated Press, claiming that Romania is \"not a democratic state anymore.\"\n\nSimion has described his AUR party, which promotes \"family, nation, faith and freedom,\" as \"perfectly aligned with the MAGA [Trump's 'Make America Great Again'] movement\" in the United States and has not ruled out appointing Georgescu as prime minister should he win.\n\nGeorgescu was present as Simion cast his own vote in the capital, Bucharest, on Sunday morning.\n\nWho are Romania's pro-western candidates?\n\nAccording to local opinion polls, Simion's main challengers appeared to be incumbent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan and Crin Antonescu of the current governing coalition.\n\nDan, a 55-year-old mathematician and former anti-corruption activist who founded the Save Romania Union party (USR) in 2016, ran on a pro-EU \"Honest Romania\" ticket.\n\nAcknowledging the issues facing Romanians, he said the Eastern European country needs a president \"who has the will and the ability to reform the system.\"\n\nVeteran centrist Antonescu, 65, also put the protection of Romania's pro-Western orientation at the center of his campaign, as has Elena Lasconi, who surprisingly came second to Georgescu in November's original first round.\n\nThe decision to annul the election and ban Georgescu from the re-run was criticized by US Vice President JD Vance and US President Donald Trump's advisor Elon Musk, as well as the Kremlin which has publicly supported Georgescu's candidacy.\n\nDoes Romania support Ukraine?\n\nBucharest has supported Ukraine since the Russian invasion not only through the supply of military equipment but also via its Black Sea ports.\n\nHowever, the arrival of flocks of Ukrainian refugees in Romania, many of whom moved to other EU countries, has prompted a right-wing populist backlash.\n\nPresidential candidate Simion told Radio Europa in April: \"Until we bring Romanian citizens out of poverty to an acceptable degree, I will no longer support other nations in Romania.\"\n\nNevertheless, when US President Trump temporarily halted military aid to Ukraine in February, interim President Ilie Bolojan insisted: \"NATO is our strongest defense pillar, and Romania remains a committed and reliable ally. We must step up investments to strengthen our defense capability.\"\n\nEdited by: Rana Taha and Zac Crellin","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/romania-election-run-underway-vote-071000172.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/o6pHySCOEdVboONITCrPQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deutsche_welle_articles_124/2466005e0525461520d8ed85e3658bd3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-04 23:44:00","author":"Roshni Majumdar, Matt Ford with Afp, Ap","authors":["Roshni Majumdar, Matt Ford with Afp, Ap"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":317827890,"title":"Donald Trump Wants to Reopen and Expand Infamous Alcatraz Prison","text":"President Donald Trump announced plans Sunday to reopen and expand the historic Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary to house \"America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\" The former prison, which operated from 1934 to 1963 and once held notorious criminals like Al Capone, would be \"substantially enlarged and rebuilt\" according to Trump's statement.Trump posted this message on his Truth Social platform: \"REBUILD, AND OPEN ALCATRAZ!
