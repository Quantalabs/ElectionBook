We are engaging the world diplomatically, and we assure all of you that we will defeat terrorism,” the President declared shortly before the council entered a closed door session.\n\nThe remarks came days after United States President Donald Trump designated Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern over alleged widespread killings of Christians and rising religious intolerance, threatening military action and aid cuts if the government fails to curb the violence. The Federal Government has described the designation as a misrepresentation of Nigeria’s evolving security situation.\n\nPresident Tinubu’s statement represents his first public response to the US designation and military threat. He stressed that his administration is actively engaging global leaders to strengthen cooperation in counterterrorism, stability, and economic development.\n\nThe President’s comments followed an economic briefing by Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, Wale Edun, who reported that Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 4.23 percent in the second quarter of 2025, according to official figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). This represents the strongest expansion in a decade outside the post COVID 19 rebound.\n\nEdun explained that 13 sectors expanded by more than seven percent, up from nine in the previous quarter, providing evidence of broad based economic resilience. The industrial sector nearly doubled its growth from 3.72 percent to 7.45 percent, reflecting rising productivity and renewed investor interest in Africa’s largest economy.\n\nPresident Tinubu highlighted the recent oversubscription of Nigeria’s 2.35 billion dollar Eurobond issuance as confirmation of international confidence in his economic reforms. The issuance attracted orders worth 13 billion dollars on Wednesday, representing an oversubscription rate of 453 percent or 10.65 billion dollars, despite political anxieties and Trump’s military threats.\n\n“Despite the political headwinds and fears, our partners have continued to engage with confidence. The success of the 2.3 billion bond oversubscribed is the most at this stage,” President Tinubu said.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) successfully priced the two tranche Eurobond with 1.25 billion dollars allocated to the 10 year maturity expiring in 2036 and 1.10 billion dollars placed in the 20 year tranche maturing in 2046. The notes were priced at coupon yield rates of 8.6308 percent and 9.1297 percent respectively.\n\nThe transaction attracted participation from investors across the United Kingdom, North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Nigeria. The DMO described the broad participation as a strong vote of confidence in Nigeria’s macroeconomic reforms and prudent fiscal and monetary management.\n\nMinister Edun expressed gratitude to the President and cabinet members for their support during his recent illness, stating that ongoing reforms, though challenging, were driven by a clear objective to build a competitive economy that creates jobs and lifts millions out of poverty.\n\nThe Finance Minister stressed the need to mobilize greater domestic and foreign investment to achieve the administration’s target of a one trillion dollar economy by 2030, noting that growth must reach seven percent annually by 2027 to significantly reduce poverty levels.\n\nPresident Tinubu acknowledged the immense scale of security and economic challenges confronting the nation but reaffirmed his administration’s resolve to move forward with unity and purpose. “The task ahead is to move forward with clarity of purpose guided by the Renewed Hope Agenda to build a prosperous Nigeria,” he stated.\n\nThe President also presided over the swearing in of two new Ministers before the FEC meeting. He commended members of his cabinet for their commitment to implementing key government reforms despite prevailing political and security pressures.\n\nThursday’s FEC meeting came against a backdrop of diplomatic engagement with the Trump administration. Minister of Foreign Affairs Yusuf Tuggar said on Wednesday that Nigeria was explaining its constitutional protection of religious freedoms and efforts to combat extremist attacks to US officials.\n\nThe Eurobond proceeds will be used to finance the 2025 fiscal deficit and support other government financing needs, including refinancing 1.1 billion dollars in maturing Eurobonds due November 21, 2025. Nigeria mandated Chapel Hill Denham, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, and Standard Chartered Bank as joint bookrunners, while FSDH Merchant Bank Limited acted as financial adviser.\n\nThe successful capital market access demonstrates resilience in Nigeria’s economic reform trajectory despite geopolitical tensions. Foreign reserves have risen above 43 billion dollars, the highest level since 2019, while inflation has moderated to 18.02 percent after six consecutive months of decline, according to recent economic data.\n\nPresident Tinubu emphasized that terrorism would be crushed and peace restored nationwide, assuring Nigerians that the task ahead involves building a prosperous, inclusive, and resilient nation through the Renewed Hope Agenda despite current challenges.","summary":"President Bola Tinubu President Bola Tinubu on Thursday, November 6, assured Nigerians that his administration remains firmly committed to defeating terrorism across the country, despite ongoing security challenges and recent international pressure over religious violence.

ZELLER - DAILYMAIL.COM REPORTER\n\nPublished: 23:42 GMT, 6 November 2025 | Updated: 00:51 GMT, 7 November 2025\n\nSydney Sweeney earned major support from the conservative community after coolly shutting down critics of her American Eagle 'good genes' ad.\n\nThe Euphoria actress, 27, sparked a cultural firestorm earlier this year when the denim brand released the campaign, which cheekily played on her 'good jeans' and 'good genes.'\n\nWhat began as a lighthearted slogan quickly ignited outrage online, with detractors accusing the ad of promoting 'white supremacy,' 'eugenics,' and even 'Nazism.'\n\nThe backlash was intensified by reports that the blonde beauty is a registered Republican, which only fueled more criticism from woke corners of social media. \n\nNow, with a new GQ interview, Sweeney impressed MAGA community members and right-wing followers with her measured refusal to apologize.\n\n'I did a jean ad. The reaction definitely was a surprise, but I love jeans. All I wear are jeans. I’m literally in jeans and a T-shirt every day of my life,' she began, unbothered by the backlash.\n\nSydney Sweeney won strong backing from MAGA and right-wing fans after coolly shutting down critics of her American Eagle 'good genes' ad\n\nNow, with a new GQ interview, Sweeney impressed followers with her measured refusal to apologize after detractors accusing the ad of promoting 'white supremacy,' 'eugenics,' and even 'Nazism'\n\nWhen pressed about Donald Trump calling the ad ‘fantastic,’ Sweeney stayed poised, seemingly sidestepping the leading question and simply noting she was surprised by all the attention while staying focused on her work.\n\n'It was surreal… it’s not that I didn’t have that feeling, but I wasn’t thinking of it like that. Or like, of any of it. I kind of just put my phone away. I was filming (Euphoria) every day,' she explained.\n\nSydney Sweeney goes braless under sheer sparkly dress at Variety event in LA\n\nThen came the moment fans are calling a masterclass in grace under pressure. \n\nWhen given the chance to address claims the ad condoned 'genetic superiority,' Sweeney simply replied, 'I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.'\n\nThe understated line instantly went viral — hailed as a mic-drop response that turned the conversation on its head.\n\nSupporters flooded social media with praise for the actress’s composure and confidence. \n\n'Seriously we’re at the point for a young woman needing to be apologetic about being attractive because she inferred she likes her genetic code,' one fan wrote. \n\nAnother added, 'The Sydney Sweeney ‘has good genes’ ads aren’t about white supremacy. There is no ‘racist undertone,’ unless you choose to put it there.'\n\nSupporters flooded social media with praise for the actress’s composure and confidence\n\nOthers highlighted the stark contrast between Sweeney’s quiet strength and her interviewer’s uneasy tone. \n\n'Compare the two energies on display here. One nervous, ashamed, flittering, and brainwashed. The other calm, confident, alluring, and mysterious. Which way Western woman?' one fan wrote. \n\nAnother echoed, 'It’s a contrast in seeing a white person that has been shamed into disdaining her immutable qualities, versus one who couldn’t GAF less and is just living her life.'\n\nThe interview follows another viral moment for Sweeney, who recently stunned at Variety’s Power of Women event in a see-through gown — cementing her status as Hollywood's unbothered bombshell. \n\nThe Euphoria actress seemed fully back in the mix with industry heavyweights, mingling with A-listers including Sharon and Jamie Lee Curtis, but her outfit immediately divided opinion online. \n\nCritics pounced on the apparent contradiction of Sweeney wearing a revealing gown while discussing resilience and empowerment during her speech at the event. \n\n'I'm not a fighter in the ring, but I recognize something of myself in [Christy Martin],\" Sweeney said, reflecting on her role portraying the trailblazing boxer in her upcoming film Christy. \n\nShe explained that Martin’s experiences — as a gay woman navigating male-dominated boxing and surviving abuse at the hands of her husband and trainer — resonated deeply with her.\n\nThe interview follows another viral moment for Sweeney, who recently stunned at Variety’s Power of Women event in a see-through gown — cementing her status as Hollywood's unbothered bombshell\n\nControversy has followed her before, too, including a 2022 backlash after posting photos from her mother’s 60th birthday featuring 'Make Sixty Great Again' hats and family members wearing 'Blue Lives Matter' shirts \n\n'I know what it feels like to be underestimated, to have people define you before you've had a chance to define yourself. I know what it feels like to have to prove that you deserve to be here, to be seen, to be taken seriously,' she continued. \n\n'But every one of us has our own fight, and Christy reminds us all that strength doesn't look loud sometimes, and sometimes it's just about getting back up again and again, no matter who's watching.'\n\nWhile the speech earned applause in the room, social media users were far less forgiving. \n\n'You're right. No one knows hardship like a thin, blonde, straight, white woman lol,' one wrote., as another posted, 'She's literally at the Power of Women podium talking about being underestimated while wearing a dress that puts her body on display more than her message.'\n\nYet another dismissed the speech as 'a joke wrapped in a dress.'\n\nControversy has followed her before, too, including a 2022 backlash after posting photos from her mother’s 60th birthday featuring 'Make Sixty Great Again' hats and family members wearing 'Blue Lives Matter' shirts. \n\n'You guys, this is wild,' Sweeney tweeted at the time. 'An innocent celebration for my mom’s milestone 60th birthday has turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention. \n\n'Please stop making assumptions.'\n\nLater she told GQ UK, 'Honestly I feel like nothing I say can help the conversation. It’s been turning into a wildfire and nothing I can say will take it back to the correct track.'\n\nSydney SweeneyEuphoria\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nSydney Sweeney wins patriotic hearts with stunning response to criticism of her 'good genes' ad\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Sydney Sweeney earned major support from the conservative community after coolly shutting down critics of her American Eagle 'good genes' ad.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15267145/Sydney-Sweeney-wins-conservative-fans-genes-ad.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/06/22/103666803-0-image-a-15_1762469394103.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/30/519089308028323456/1024x576_MP4_519089308028323456.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:51:27","author":"Editor,T.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SONIA HORON, US ASSISTANT SHOWBIZ EDITOR \n Published:00:00 GMT, 7 November 2025 |Updated:00:41 GMT, 7 November 2025 \n\nBruce Willis was pictured holding his carer's hand during a rare public outing on Thursday amid his battle with dementia.\nThe Die Hard star, 70, who retired from acting in 2022 due to his worsening health, enjoyed a beachfront stroll in Los Angeles and appeared to be in good spirits, flashing a smile at one point.\nThe Hollywood icon — who has been moved out of his family home to a separate one-story house where he has a 24/7 care team — kept hold of his carer's hand as they walked together.\nDuring one moment, an unsteady Willis reached his other hand for the railing, appearing to use it for support. \nThe sighting comes a day after his ex-wife, Demi Moore, 62, attended a star-studded charity benefit held in his honor in New York City. Willis was not in attendance, and has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since his diagnosis.\nThe actor's family announced in 2023 that he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a form of dementia that causes a rapid decline in the areas of the brain linked to personality and language abilities. \n\nBruce Willis, 70, was pictured holding his carer's hand during a rare public outing on Thursday, amid his battle with frontotemporal dementia\n\nThe Hollywood icon — who has been moved out of his family home to a separate one-story house where he has a 24/7 care team — kept hold of his carer's hand as they walked together\n\nThe Die Hard actor stepped out for a sunny stroll along the beach in Los Angeles \nDuring Thursday's outing, Willis sported a casual look, wearing a dark grey t-shirt, khaki pants, and grey sneakers. \nHe shielded his head with a blue baseball hat and wore a pair of black sunglasses. \n\n Demi Moore shows support for ex Bruce Willis at star-studded benefit amid actor's dementia battle \nThe actor and his carer later enjoyed a chat as they took in the ocean views. \nIn August, his wife, Emma Heming Willis, 47 — with whom he shares daughters Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11 — said in an interview with Diane Sawyer that Willis has been moved into a separate one-story home away from their main house, where he has a full-time care team.\nWillis also shares older daughters Rumer, 37, Scout, 34, and Tallulah, 31 with ex-wife Demi, to whom he was married from 1987 to 2000. \nA separate family insider recently told the Daily Mail: 'He is going downhill fast.' \nWillis' wife joined his ex at the benefit in his honor on Wednesday, weeks after sharing a heartbreaking update on how their young daughters are coping with his declining health.\n'I think they're doing well, all things considered but it's hard,' she told Vogue Australia in October.\n'They grieve, they miss their dad so much. He's missing important milestones, that's tough for them - but kids are resilient, [although] I used to hate hearing that because people didn't understand what we were walking through.'\nShe added: 'I don't know if my kids will ever bounce back, but they're learning and so am I.'\nLast month, sources close to the family revealed Heming Willis is struggling to not only help manage the star's rapidly deteriorating condition but also manage his hefty estate.\n\nHe appeared to be in good spirits, flashing a smile as he walked\n\nDuring one moment, Willis reached his other hand for the railing, appearing to use it for support \n\nThe star and his carer later enjoyed a chat as they took in the ocean views\n\nWillis has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since his diagnosis\n\nDuring Thursday's outing, Willis sported a casual look, wearing a dark grey t-shirt, khaki pants, and grey sneakers\n\nHe shielded his head with a blue baseball hat and wore a pair of black sunglasses\n\nThe actor's family announced in 2023 that he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a form of dementia that causes a gradual decline in the areas of the brain linked to personality and language abilities\n\nWillis's wife, Emma Heming Willis, 47, recently shared a heartbreaking update on how their young daughters — Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11 — are coping with his declining health\n\n'They grieve, they miss their dad so much. He's missing important milestones, that's tough for them - but kids are resilient,' she told Vogue Australia\n\nHeming Willis said moving her husband into a separate residence was the best decision for their family\n\n'But among the sadness and discomfort, it was the right move — for him, for our girls, for me. Ultimately, I could get back to being his wife. And that's such a gift,' she shared\n\nEmma added it has given Bruce more independence, giving him the chance to reconnect with friends and family\n\nThe source said: 'Taking care of Bruce isn't just about keeping up his spirits and making sure he can physically get through the day. It also involves looking after the massive fortune he accrued as an A-list movie star.'\nHeming Willis herself said moving her husband into a separate residence was the best decision for their family.\nShe said moving Bruce into a new home where is supported by carers 24/7, has allowed her to go back to just being his wife.\nEmma told The Sunday Times: 'It was of the hardest decisions I ever had to make.'\n\n Emma Heming says separate homes has allowed her to 'get back to being Bruce Willis' wife' \n'But among the sadness and discomfort, it was the right move — for him, for our girls, for me. Ultimately, I could get back to being his wife. And that's such a gift.'\nEmma added it has also given Bruce more independence, giving him the chance to reconnect with friends and family.\nShe explained: 'It's made such a difference for more friends and family to have their own experience with him without it being my home, without me hovering, or my anxiety of how to manage the guest and their expectations, and then have to see their reactions - their sadness at what is.' \nWillis has an estimated $250million in the bank, which his wife is reportedly now in charge of, as his FTD is too advanced for him to manage it with his team. \nFTD eats away at the parts of the brain that control language, behavior and personality. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, patients don't lose their memory immediately but instead undergo personality changes.\nThe disease also attacks areas of the brain responsible for judgment, impulse control and decision-making, leading patients vulnerable to mismanaging their finances, which adds an extra burden on to caregivers.\nHis wife recently revealed the 'wake-up call' that forced her to rethink her husband's dementia care. \nThis week, she appeared on the HealSquad podcast with actress Maria Menounos to discuss caring for her husband.\n\nWillis has been surrounded by his blended family, including his wife as well as ex Demi Moore, and all his daughters, who have rallied around him to help him cope with his health struggles\n\nThe Hollywood legend has starred in numerous iconic films, including Die Hard (seen in a still)\n\nShe said Willis' neurologist warned her of a grim statistic: about 30 percent of caregivers die before their loved ones.\nThis could be because 40 percent of caregivers don't schedule their own medical appointments because they don't have enough support to care for their loved one.\nChronic stress from caregiving can also exacerbate pre-existing conditions by triggering the body's 'fight-or-flight' response, which leads to inflammation, high blood pressure and an increased risk of heart attack.\nHeming Willis said: 'I really needed to hear that to wake up.'\n'We are making appointments for everyone, handling, doing this. We are doing so much.'\nHeming Willis said: 'Caregivers need to know that in order to make it sustainable, you must care for yourself, that it is not selfish, it is self-preserving.'\nBruce WillisMabelEmma HemingLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFrail Bruce Willis, 70, holds carer's hand on very rare public outing amid heartbreaking dementia battle\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 86\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But as of Thursday night, Senate Democrats signaled they were prepared to block GOP plans to force a Friday vote to reopen the government — until they got more commitments on dealing with rising health care costs.\n\nThat again scrambles the plans of Senate GOP leaders, who had signaled they would soon hold votes on a newly drafted bill to reopen the government, which had been written with input from some Democrats. But that emerging deal did not include any firm commitments to resolve the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies issue at the heart of the shutdown.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said Democrats seemed to be backing away from an agreement.\n\n“My hopes and expectations are always that we’re going to have enough Democrats to actually proceed, but I don’t know we’ll see,” Thune said when asked about the expected vote Friday. “They seem to be walking back or slow walking this. That’s what they asked for.”\n\nDemocrats — after days of private talks that appeared to be picking up steam until this week’s better than expected election — are now again dug in.\n\nA top Senate Democrat said Thursday night that the GOP’s latest funding plan would fall short if it comes to the floor on Friday, signaling another major complication after days of intense talks.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said enough of his colleagues opposed proceeding with the GOP’s plan – which emerged in part with input from Democratic centrists.\n\n“I think it’s fair to say that the caucus is obviously not unanimous, but we’re pretty unified in the position that without something on health care, that the vote is very unlikely to succeed tomorrow,” Schatz said.\n\nThere are still some divisions in the party and one Senate Democratic source said the vote would likely fail but could pick up some additional Democratic votes.\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff, who is up for reelection in Georgia next year, has privately been talking about his concerns with federal workers in his state — including huge airport hubs and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – missing another paycheck, another source said.\n\nEven some Senate Democratic centrists involved in the talks have expressed frustration with the lack of progress.\n\n“We don’t know what it is,” Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware said, when asked about what the Senate may be voting on Friday. He added: “There is still no finished product. We’ve been talking for days but there is no product.”\n\nJust hours earlier, Senate leaders were moving closer to teeing up votes to end the government shutdown as negotiators of both parties met again Thursday morning in an attempt to hammer out final details, according to multiple sources in both parties.\n\nThose details were presented to Senate Democrats during a lunch session later in the day. But Democrats in the meeting appeared determined to push for stronger commitments on the health care provisions as well as other policy wins, like limiting the impact of Trump’s mass firings, according to two sources briefed on the meeting.\n\n“There are Democrats who are inclined to do the right thing. They’re under an enormous amount of pressure from the left,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters, adding that he would be awaiting results of the Democrats’ lunchtime discussion. “We’ll see if they hold sway today and hopefully we’ll know more about that as the day rolls on.”\n\nThe emerging plan was for the Senate to attach another short-term stopgap bill to a larger package of full-year bipartisan bills to fund a handful of federal agencies, according to those sources. There would also be an agreement for a date certain on a vote on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies — far short of the demand of many Democrats who want an extension in the underlying package that President Donald Trump would sign into law.\n\nMany Democrats have made clear they would be livid at any promise of a separate vote on health care that does not guarantee Trump signing anything into law.\n\n“I think voters would rightly see it as a surrender,” Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said before the party’s lunch meeting, adding that Tuesday’s elections, as well as a flood of messages from constituents, have signaled to Democrats that Americans “are saying health care matters.”\n\nThune on Thursday would not say whether he would keep the Senate in session this weekend and into next week’s scheduled Veterans Day recess if a deal is not reached.\n\n“That depends a little bit on what happens if there’s a path forward to vote whether that’s today, tomorrow, Saturday. We’ll stay and do that. If the far left wins out in this and the Dems dig in then, I don’t know. We’ll see. I think all options will be on the table,” Thune said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The number is often used to describe California’s partisan shares. Voter registration tells a different story: Democrats at over 44% and Republicans at 25%. Nearly 23% of voters have no party preference.\n\nRepublicans claimed that because they only have 9 seats (17%), our current maps are gerrymandered and Republicans are underrepresented. Really? Every Republican Congress member voted yes on the bill that would cut the funding for food stamps and Medicaid. Was that what people in their districts wanted? If not, people are not well represented by those members. If voters dislike their representatives’ job, they should elect someone else regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nElected officials should listen to their people, and voters should cast their votes according to how their representatives are working for them. That is democracy, isn’t it?\n\nKyoko Takayama\n\nCalifornians vote for\ndisenfranchisement\n\nCongratulations, California. With the passage of Proposition 50, we are now officially a one-party state.\n\nThe proponents of Proposition 50 called it an effort to save democracy. In fact, it does just the opposite. Now, millions of Californians will be disenfranchised. Their voices, opinions and thoughts will become irrelevant or no longer heard. Disenfranchisement is the cornerstone of the disintegration of democracy. Disenfranchisement causes people to “check out” and no longer participate in our democratic system of government.\n\nSadly, neither one of the political parties seems to give a damn about the people they allegedly represent. Their only motivation is power and money.\n\nState GOP must change\nafter poor showing\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin must resign. Millions of Californians are being silenced as rural communities are gerrymandered into deep blue districts. We the people once drew our own maps — now politicians do.\n\nThe GOP’s collapse on Proposition 50 proves how out of touch they’ve become. If you noticed the “No on Prop. 50” ads vanished near the end, you’re not crazy. They quit. The state party refused to energize the MAGA base or let President Trump get involved, dooming the campaign. For years, consultants have been paid to fail while grassroots conservatives carried the fight alone. Enough is enough.\n\nWe need a movement that fights for the people, not for donor contracts. Until real leadership steps up, not one more dollar should go to the state party. Don’t reward betrayal. Demand accountability and reform from within.\n\nJack Belgarde\n\n‘Mallard Fillmore’ is\nstill a comic, after all\n\nEver since the “Mallard Fillmore” comic strip appeared in this newspaper, there have been liberal opinion page writers insisting that it be removed. There has been a marked increase in that sentiment lately.\n\nI have been a subscriber to this newspaper for 50 years. Since approximately 1970, and until now, the “Doonesbury” comic strip in this newspaper and more than 1,400 newspapers worldwide has been lambasting conservatives with free rein and glee.\n\nIt won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975.\n\nIn fact, Doonesbury has been in rerun since 2014 every day except Sunday, but is still a staple for this newspaper’s comics page. During all that time, I have yet to see anyone ask for its removal. So we should ask ourselves who is really for free speech and who isn’t?\n\nAnd shouldn’t we remember that it’s a “comics” page?\n\nSteve Mahler\n\nCongress should lose\npay during shutdown\n\nCongress and only Congress can put an end to the nationwide shutdown. Some government employees are working (with a promise of back pay); some have been terminated; some are forced to work without pay. Obviously, this is not right, moral, fiscally responsible or in the best interests of our country.\n\nIronically, the legislators who can end this are not financially impacted; they are getting their full pay. Doesn’t it make sense to stop their salaries first? They aren’t doing their jobs — ending the shutdown. And the House of Representatives hasn’t even been in session for six weeks. That shows how much interest they have in trying to rectify this mess.\n\nCongress should be the first ones to be impacted by their inability to do their jobs. Where is a national referendum when we need it?\n\nWorld should unite\nover crisis in Sudan\n\nThe world is witnessing one of the most devastating humanitarian catastrophes in Sudan, yet global action remains far too limited. Credible reports indicate that the United Arab Emirates has provided support to the Rapid Support Forces, a group widely accused of atrocities against civilians. This support is believed to be exacerbating the conflict and deepening the suffering of millions of people.\n\nWe cannot remain silent while civilians endure mass violence, starvation and displacement. The United States and the international community must enforce an immediate end to all foreign assistance that enables armed actors responsible for human rights abuses in Sudan. Equally important, we must expand humanitarian access and pursue accountability for those committing crimes against innocent people.\n\nAs concerned citizens, we have a role, too. If foreign support for these forces continues, many people intend to respond peacefully by boycotting UAE-linked companies, including Emirates Airlines and UAE-owned sports organizations.","summary":"Also: Vote for disenfranchisement &#124; GOP reform &#124; Still a comic &#124; Congress pay &#124; Sudan crisis.

But Thursday’s vote, on legislation that would essentially forestall an attack on Venezuelan soil without congressional authorization, suggested Republicans are willing to give Trump leeway to continue his buildup of naval forces in the region.\n\n“President Trump has taken decisive action to protect thousands of Americans from lethal narcotics,” said Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nStill, the vote allowed Democrats to press their GOP colleagues on Trump’s threats against Venezuela. The legislation failed to advance 49-51, with Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska the only Republicans voting in favor.\n\nThe U.S. is assembling an unusually large force, including its most advanced aircraft carrier, in the Caribbean Sea, leading many to conclude that Trump intends to go beyond just intercepting cocaine-running boats. The campaign so far has killed at least 66 people in 16 known strikes.\n\n“It’s really an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change,” said Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who pushed the resolution. “If that’s where the administration is headed, if that’s what we’re risking — involvement in a war — then Congress needs to be heard on this.”\n\nSome Republicans are uneasy with Caribbean campaign\n\nRepublican leadership pressed Thursday to make sure the legislation failed, but several senators still carefully considered their vote.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, another Republican who voted against the resolution, said that he still has doubts about the campaign. He pointed out that it was expensive to change the deployment location for an aircraft carrier and questioned whether those funds could be better used at the U.S.-Mexico border to stop fentanyl trafficking.\n\nTillis said that if the campaign continues for several months more, “then we have to have a real discussion about whether or not we’re engaging in some sort of hybrid war.”\n\nSen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, said in a statement that he voted against the legislation because he didn’t believe it was “necessary or appropriate at this time.”\n\nBut he added that he was “troubled by many aspects and assumptions of this operation and believe it is at odds with the majority of Americans who want the U.S. military less entangled in international conflicts.”\n\nThe push for congressional oversight\n\nAs the Trump administration has reconfigured U.S. priorities overseas, there has been a growing sense of frustration among lawmakers, including some Republicans, who are concerned about recent moves made by the Pentagon.\n\nAt a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier Thursday, Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican chair, said that many senators have “serious concerns about the Pentagon’s policy office” and that Congress was not being consulted on recent actions like putting a pause on Ukraine security assistance, reducing the number of U.S. troops in Romania and the formulation of the National Defense Strategy.\n\nGOP senators have directed their ire at the Department of Defense’s policy office, which is led by Elbridge Colby, an official who has advocated for the U.S. to step down its involvement in international alliances.\n\n“It just seems like there’s this pigpen-like mess coming out of the policy shop,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, during another Armed Services hearing earlier this week.\n\nAs pushback has mounted on Capitol Hill, the Trump administration has stepped up its outreach to lawmakers. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held a classified briefing for congressional leaders Wednesday. The officials gave details on the intelligence that is used to target the boats and allowed senators to review the legal rationale for the attacks, but did not discuss whether they would launch an attack directly against Venezuela, according to lawmakers in the meeting.\n\nStill, Democrats have tested the unease among Republicans by forcing the vote on the potential for an attack on Venezuela under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war. A previous war powers vote pertaining to the strikes against boats in international waters also failed last month on a 48-51 vote, but Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who pushed the legislation, said he still plans to force more votes.\n\n“We should not be going to war without a vote of Congress. The lives of our troops are at stake,” Kaine said in a floor speech.\n\nDemocrats also argued that the Trump administration was using a flimsy legal defense for an expansive military campaign that is putting U.S. troops and the nation’s reputation at risk. Sen.

Gaines is joined by tennis star Martina Navratilova, former gold medalist Nancy Hogshead, an Olympian swimmer from the UK, Sharron Davies, runner Carilyn Johnson and U.S. cyclist Inga Thompson. The letter asks the United Nations, global governments, and sporting federations to step in and stop Iran from executing Vafaei Sani. \"We, athletes and sports figures from around the world, strongly condemn the Iranian regime’s decision on 4 October 2025 to uphold the death sentence of Mohammad Javad Vafaei Sani, a 30-year-old boxing champion and coach from Mashhad,\" it says. \"Mohammad Javad has spent more than five years in prison under torture and solitary confinement for taking part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests and supporting the democratic opposition PMOI (MEK). His case is not an isolated tragedy. \"Iran has a grim history of executing athletes for their beliefs, including the captain of the national football team, Habib Khabiri, and the captain of the national women's volleyball team, Forouzan Abdi, the latter executed alongside 30,000 political prisoners during the 1988 massacre. In 2020, Iranian wrestling champion Navid Afkari was executed after participating in peaceful protests in 2018.\" Iran Continues To Be An Extremist State Under Current Regime \"In recent months, the Iranian authorities have executed numerous other protesters on similar bogus charges with total impunity. These political executions are a callous attempt by the authorities to frighten and silence an increasingly restive population no longer willing to accept their corrupt and oppressive rule. \"Sport is meant to inspire hope, unity, and courage. The execution of a champion for his political views is a direct assault on these values and a warning to every athlete who dares to speak out.\" The Iranian regime continues to be an ever present danger on the international stage, which is why President Donald Trump took action to prevent them from building a nuclear weapon earlier in 2025. Their funding and support for terrorism allows Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen to continue their mission of murdering innocent people. And the oppression of the Iranian people has led to widespread dissatisfaction with the regime. Their criminalization of dissenting views led directly to this sentence. Vafaei Sani was arrested in 2020 for supporting an organization within Iran that does not support the current regime. His first death sentence was overturned, only for the Revolutionary Court to unilaterally reinstate it, with no new evidence. Now, likely as a result of pressure from the top, his sentence has been upheld. Gaines and Navratilova have wildly different political views, but have been able to come together on important issues. This sentence and the injustice it represents is one, and the protection of women's sports from transgender athletes is another. It's a valuable lesson in working together, even across party lines, to speak up for what's right.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/sports/riley-gaines-leads-athlete-coalition-demanding-iran-halt-boxers-death-sentence-execution","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2230344376-594x594-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:20:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":376557466,"title":"Teen's Emotional Testimony Goes Viral Sharing Fears He Won't 'Be Able to Say Goodbye' If ICE Snatches Parents","text":"Concerned residents of an Oregon city spoke out at a council meeting earlier this week about ICE activity in their community, including a 16-year-old boy who broke down worrying that authorities may take away his immigrant parents.\n\n “I just want to tell you guys that I’m scared for my parents to walk out their house because I might not be able to say goodbye to them if they go to work,” the boy, who was identified as Manny, told the Hillsboro City Council at a meeting held on Tuesday, Nov. 4.\n\n “I might not ever be able to say bye or see them again if you guys don’t side with us,\" he said. \"And I’m scared because of it, because they fought so hard to come here and choose a life for their kids.”\n\n The meeting consisted of three hours of public testimony from Hillsboro residents about their fears and frustrations over ICE’s controversial enforcement as part of President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration, NBC affiliate KGW and the Hillsboro News Times reported. \n\n Trump was reelected in part on a sweeping pledge to focus on illegal immigration, including vowing to conduct “the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”\n\n But the implementation of that enforcement has sparked near-constant controversy, amid reports of U.S. citizens being swept up, families divided and more. \n\n The White House insists its policies are about law enforcement. \n\n \"We don't want to have to be in the position where people are being arrested and detained. But if they're in this country illegally and they don't leave now, that's what we're forced to do,\" Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, told NPR in April.\n\n Critics have decried what they call callousness and cruelty based on ethnicity.\n\n This week, Washington County, where Hillsboro is located, declared a state of emergency due to the growing immigration enforcement, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. The declaration enables the county to set aside $200,000 in contingency funds to help impacted residents.\n\n At the city council meeting on Tuesday, Manny, in his emotional testimony, urged council members to oppose the federal enforcement. \n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n “I hope you guys do side with us because we are fighting for our rights,” he said, “and we are getting treated like animals because people judge us by the color of our skin and the way that we talk.”\n\n “I’m scared that all of us are going to have to fend for ourselves,” he also said. “I’m scared that one day at school that I’m going to be held by [officers] I don’t know — people that are covered, people that I can’t identify because they wear masks and they don’t properly ID themselves.”\n\n “I’m tired of telling my mom and dad every day after school, ‘Have you seen the new video of ICE pulling someone over because of the color of their skin?’ … I really hope you guys do something about it, because I do want something to change,” Manny said. “As a 16-year-old, I shouldn’t be scared. I should be focusing on school.”\n\n Manny’s remarks drew cheers from the audience, and two city council members stood up in applause. Clips of him speaking soon went viral on social media.\n\n PEOPLE contacted Hillsboro officials and DHS on Thursday, Nov. 6, for comment about Tuesday’s city council meeting in Hillsboro but did not immediately hear back.\n\n “The City of Hillsboro is listening to our community members and staff as they share fears and concerns about federal immigration enforcement (ICE) activities in our community,” officials said in an earlier statement, on Tuesday.\n\n “We cannot prevent federal immigration enforcement,” their statement continued, “but we want to share resources with information on your rights, how to be prepared for interactions with ICE, and where you can find help & support if you or your family are affected by immigration enforcement.”","summary":"President Donald Trump successfully campaigned on removing immigrants, but his approach has stoked controversy","url":"https://people.com/oregon-teen-speaks-out-about-never-seeing-parents-if-in-ice-immigration-custody-11845416","image":"https://people.com/thmb/xmnjKG1q3M94CRVjuwO4-nC0rLI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(723x306:725x308)/hillsboro-city-council-meeting-ice-110625-79a25b9550f64361950e0e54ca16c0a3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:16:54","author":"David Chiu","authors":["David Chiu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.029},{"id":376556812,"title":"Trump event paused in Oval Office when guest faints","text":"A representative of a pharmaceutical company fainted Thursday during a White House announcement on slashing the cost of weight-loss drugs, forcing President Donald Trump to suspend the event..As one of the bosses of the two drug companies invited to announce the price deal was speaking, the man crumpled to the ground behind him..Trump, who was seated at the time, quickly stood up and remained behind his desk while several people attended to the man, whose identity was not made public..One of those helping him was Mehmet Oz, Trump's administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a medical doctor..\"The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said..The event resumed about an hour later..Trump unveils deals to lower costs of some weight-loss drugs.Stay fit on vacation: Simple tips to enjoy travel without sacrificing health, weight-loss goals.Trump to cut drug prices: Will US drug savings drive up costs worldwide?.Trump vows US drug price cuts of up to 80% in industry blow","summary":"Trump event paused in Oval Office when guest faints","url":"https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/trump-event-paused-in-oval-office-when-guest-faints-1.500337064","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/2025-11-06/248mkovu/newsml_afp_com_20251106T182129Z_doc_83b392r.jpeg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:10:08","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":376554422,"title":"Trump Vs Zohran Mamdani: US President's Newest Showdown","text":"Donald Trump loves few things more than tackling a new political foe. But has he met his match in New York's incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani?The mouthwatering showdown between the Republican and the young Democratic socialist could define the next phase of Trump's presidency.Trump has appeared to relish having Mamdani as a foil, branding him a communist, mocking the name of the first Muslim and South Asian to lead America's largest city, and threatening to cut federal funding for New York City.But his rival has shown he can play Trump at his own game.It's rare for former reality TV star Trump to see himself upstaged, but 34-year-old Mamdani managed it at his victory rally on Tuesday night.\"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you -- turn the volume up!\" he said to huge cheers.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed to reporters traveling with Trump on Air Force One the next day that the president had indeed watched Mamdani speak.Go through all of usTrump and Mamdani are, at least partly, enemies with benefits.Leftist Mamdani used Trump as a bogeyman throughout his mayoral campaign, accusing him of \"fascism\" and comparing the billionaire property developer to the landlords he says are ripping off New Yorkers.He has also cannily positioned himself as part of the resistance to a president who has pushed his power to its limits and sent the National Guard into Democrat-run cities.\"To get to any of us, you will have to go through all of us,\" Mamdani said at the victory rally.For hapless Democrats who have struggled to find a winning message as Trump has savaged them in recent months, Mamdani represents a long-awaited chance to fight back. But for many on the right, Trump now has the ideal opponent to bash.As Republicans nursed their wounds from defeats in New York, Virginia and New Jersey, Trump said in a speech in Miami on Wednesday that Americans now faced a \"choice between communism and common sense.\"Trump also blew a dog whistle to the hard-right.\"Mandami, whatever the hell his name is,\" Trump said in the same speech -- deliberately mispronouncing Ugandan-born Mamdani's surname in the same way he did with his 2024 election rival Kamala Harris.Flashing red lightsYet the stakes are far higher than a war of words.Trump has repeatedly threatened to put New York -- his beloved home city -- in the federal crosshairs like he has previously with Los Angeles and Chicago.\"If he is a communist, there's not going to be a lot of activity,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. \"So you wouldn't need bridges and tunnels and all the different things that were being planned for New York.\"Some allies meanwhile fear Trump could be playing with fire by focusing on a man whose rise was propelled by the affordability crisis that is now hurting Republicans in the polls.\"There should be flashing red lights all over\" for Trump, former White House strategy guru Steve Bannon told Politico. \"People better understand they have a fight on their hands. This guy is a serious guy.\"Both Trump and Mamdani have also indicated they may ultimately be ready to cool things off.Trump has veered between saying he wants to \"make him succeed\" because he loves New York, and in the same breath urging Mamdani to be \"a little bit respectful of Washington.\" And Mamdani will be aware that his campaign pledges of free city bus travel, childcare and city-run grocery stores will struggle if Trump cuts federal funding.\"I continue to be interested in having a conversation with President Trump on the ways in which we can work together to serve New Yorkers,\" he said on Wednesday.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Donald Trump loves few things more than tackling a new political foe.

Kennedy, Jr., the MAHA leader with a paranoid streak about modern medical advances, has been hostile to GLP-1 drugs, the most famous of which is Ozempic, sold by Novo Nordisk. \n\nIf everyone could do as many push-ups and pull-ups as the hyper-fit 71-year-old Kennedy, perhaps we could turn our backs on GLP-1’s. \n\nCertainly, the secretary is correct that Americans should eat better and work out more.\n\nBut our body mass index has been increasing for about 150 years, as we’ve made calories cheaper and more abundant over time.\n\nAs it happens, the things we like to eat or drink that are bad for us — fast food, soda, chips, cookies — are cheap, convenient and taste good. \n\nEven if we manage to convince people that they should eat more vegetables and legumes, while getting appropriate levels of exercise, not everyone is going to do it as a matter of lifestyle constraints, individual preference or simple lack of willpower.\n\nThere’s also the fact that once you put on weight, physiological changes make it more difficult to shed it.\n\nAbout 40% of Americans are obese.\n\nWouldn’t it be great for them — and for American society at large — if there were a safe, relatively convenient way for them to slim down?\n\nLo and behold, here they are.\n\nThe GLP-1’s started out as a treatment for diabetes and have exploded in popularity as weight-loss drugs. \n\nTrump’s reflex to make it easier for people to obtain Ozempic and the like — while, not incidentally, boosting his reputation as the nation’s foremost deal-maker — is the correct one.\n\nDrug pricing is complicated, but by expanding the sale of the drugs direct to consumers, the companies can reduce prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Medicare will do more to cover the drugs, also bringing down their cost. \n\nAlready, an estimated 12% of Americans have used a GLP-1 drug at some point, an enormous increase in a short period of time.\n\nThat number will keep growing — especially if prices go down, if more oral GLP-1’s come online in addition to the injectables and if other benefits of the drugs emerge.\n\nGLP-1s easily could match the extensive saturation level of statins, the cholesterol-reducing drugs. \n\nBy all means, we should all eat more arugula. \n\nUntil then, we have a way to alleviate an ongoing health crisis — and President Trump and the drug companies are to be congratulated for creative cooperation in working to make it available to more Americans.\n\nX: @RichLowry","summary":"GLP-1 drugs make it easier to lose weight, and to avoid associated serious health problems — and President Trump's latest deal will bring down their high costs. It's a win-win-win.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/06/opinion/ozempic-for-all-trump-the-deal-maker-aims-to-make-america-slim-again/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-pjbatv1j8-1762472429476.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762454555&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:07:11","author":"Rich Lowry","authors":["Rich Lowry"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.042},{"id":376550912,"title":"Concerns across Europe that Ireland's military shortfalls could put major summit at risk","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy attended this year’s event in Denmark.\n\nThere’s been some suggestions the high-profile event could take place outside of Dublin with indications that Munster could play host to the summit. \n\nHybrid warfare\n\nSources in Ireland and abroad have said that the EU drone activity is being assessed as part of a broader hybrid warfare campaign. \n\nWhile it’s suspected Russia is behind the operations this has not been confirmed publicly but multiple police forces and intelligence agencies across Europe are now investigating.\n\nNow Ireland’s lack of air policing capability, lack of air defence and a general inability to track such aircraft is causing significant concerns at the highest levels within security agencies across Europe.\n\nSources said that this week a delegation from a Baltic country raised concerns about security with Irish officials at a meeting in Dublin. \n\nSecurity for the EU Presidency is being managed by a team in An Garda Síochána but it will involve multiple agencies and the more largescale and robust aspects will have to involve the Irish Defence Forces. \n\nSuch is the concern in Government that they are attempting to expedite a part of the much vaunted primary radar scheme in order to counter the drone threat. \n\nHowever sources have expressed concern that even if the tech is purchased there is a lack of certainty that military operators will be sufficiently trained on the specialist radar detection kit. \n\nIt has also emerged that Irish Defence Forces personnel would have to travel to Scandinavia to test fire missile systems as Ireland does not have adequate military ranges.\n\nA garda seizure of drones at an Irish prison. The remote-controlled craft have been used by criminals and protest movements as well as international state actors.Rollingnews.ie\n\nRollingnews.ie\n\nNo radar system\n\nThe Irish Defence Forces have lost a key capability in recent months as a radar system, known as Giraffe, used to direct anti-aircraft missiles has been donated to Ukraine. \n\nThe lack of this capability has had a direct impact on the ability to detect and intercept incoming malicious drones and other aircraft.\n\nIn a private meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Defence and National Security yesterday An Garda Síochána, and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of Defence sought to assure TDs and Senators that they had the operation in hand. \n\nThe meeting was attended by Garda Deputy Commissioner Shawna Coxon as well as civilian officials from the DOD’s unit for Emergency, Operations, and Infrastructure Oversight and DFAT’s EU Presidency planning section.\n\nIt is understood nothing was revealed by defence officials or gardaí about their plans or strategies to address the capability shortcomings. \n\nHowever a number of operational sources across the security sector said the assurances given to the committee ring hollow.\n\nThe shortcomings are particularly acute in air defence, they said. \n\nWe have discovered that there is a distinct lack of drone intercept capability and there are no military radars in Ireland capable of detecting drones save for a civilian system in Dublin Airport known as Dedrone. \n\nTaoiseach Micheáll Martin and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Government Buildings in Dublin.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nThere are significant concerns around the lack of air intercept capability to deal with, for example, a rogue aircraft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the threat has been assessed and a lethal attack is unlikely, it is not without precedent. During then Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Ireland in May 2011 a light aircraft had to be intercepted by Irish Air Corps PC-9 aircraft. \n\nOn that occasion it was found to be a lost pilot who drifted into a no-fly zone but security assessments carried out have found that there is a threat both from drones and light aircraft. \n\n“This is is not about a direct attack per se, the situation is that just having an aircraft in the wrong place or say a swarm of drones could cause significant difficulties as we’ve seen in Europe already,” one source said. \n\n“Imagine the arrival of dignitaries like say Donald Trump, all it would take to disrupt and embarrass Ireland is a drone and he will fly onto somewhere else – it is not a secret among security and defence people across the globe that Ireland is bottom rung on the security ladder.”\n\nThe Irish air defence capability is causing significant concerns ahead of the EU Presidency.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nThere are other difficulties – the small fleet of PC-9s are not sufficient to intercept incoming aircraft and the Air Corps pilots, sources have said, need to receive updated training in air intercepts regardless. \n\nBehind closed doors it has been mooted that there may be a need to find a European country to provide air patrols for Ireland. \n\nThere is a secret deal between Ireland and the UK in regard to overflights but sources have raised the issue of what happens should an air threat need to be shot down.\n\nAnother air defence source said: “Who issues the order and what happens if that pilot in the fighter is French or Danish or say even British?\n\n“The command and control systems are also an issue given that such an order may have to be made by a senior Government minister, will there be time for the commander of the operation to ring the Chief of Staff who then rings the Minister for Defence or even the Taoiseach?” \n\nIt is understood that during past US presidential visits an American aircraft carrier and other assets were placed close to Ireland. \n\nIn the past Irish Army Air Defence Regiments also posted .50 calibre heavy machine guns at strategic locations to take down air threats during events.\n\nMissiles could also be used to shoot down threats. However, the Irish missile capability is now diminished because the missiles used in air defence do not have a tracking capability as the aforementioned radar is now in Ukraine. \n\nThere are anti-aircraft artillery weapons but tracking systems are not available – as one source said, it would require a gunner to visually confirm the target using an ‘iron sight’ mounted at the top of a gun.\n\nA key factor contributing to all of these problems, highlighted by one well-placed source as part of our reporting, is the 2011 decision by Government to reorganise the Defence Forces in a cost saving effort, leading to the military disbanding the dedicated Air Defence regiment.\n\nAn Irish Defence Forces drone system and the Giraffe radar system donated to the Ukrainian military at a display in the Curragh in 2022.Alamy Stock Photo\n\nAlamy Stock Photo\n\nSummit planning \n\nDepending on where the major summit is held there will be a need for land-based forces and naval cover.\n\nAt a European event recently a naval destroyer with air defence capability was deployed. However sources said Ireland’s neutral status may make that more difficult. \n\nOne key concern is the treat of drones potentially being launched from so-called Shadow fleet vessels off the Irish coast. Zelenskyy himself recently said that the illicit Russian vessels were being used for this purpose in their drone sorties across Europe. \n\nDetection is also a problem for Ireland’s military vessels. The Irish navy does not have a ship with air defence radar. The only way such flights can be detected is with what military personnel call the ‘mark one eyeball’ – in other words a sailor on look out on deck.\n\nThe Irish Army Ranger Wing special forces are a positive for the Defence Forces but their role is specific to interventions and specialist military operations. \n\nThe good news, from a security perspective, is that gardaí have upskilled their national units. Particularly the Public Order Unit are now at a level comparable to other similar well resourced and trained police forces across Europe. \n\nThe Emergency Response Unit has also undergone a transformative equipment, tactical and training reorganisation. \n\nIt is understood that there has been a slight delay in the delivery of the new garda fixed-wing surveillance aircraft and helicopter but this is being looked at behind the scenes.\n\nThere is also an issue with regard to garda use of drones as they await legislative powers. \n\nThe situation, as preparations for the presidency continue, remains grave.

The current government shutdown entered its 36th day on Tuesday, becoming the longest on record with no clear signs of resolution. \n\nIt began 1 October, after the Democrat minority refused to vote for the federal budget until full funding for ACA healthcare subsidies was extended. Enhanced subsidies doubled enrolment in the programme to 24 million, and given the geographic concentration of that growth, the discontinuation supported by Republicans will disproportionately impact their own voters.\n\nDemocrats, revitalised by wins up and down the ballot on Tuesday, hope to translate those victories into leverage to end the shutdown on their terms. President Donald Trump continues to pressure his party to end the shutdown by force, invoking the so-called nuclear option. \n\nIf Republicans do so, the cost of the average healthcare premiums will more than double, likely forcing millions of already cash-strapped enrolees out of the programme and undermining healthcare resources, particularly in rural communities dominated by Republicans.","summary":"A now-pulled list of food aid resources compiled for US military personnel in Germany sparked controversy on social media, underscoring the impact of the federal shutdown\n\n\nThe post The US Army told its soldiers in Germany to use food banks if they don’t get paid appeared first on Macao News.","url":"https://macaonews.org/news/around-the-world/us-army-food-banks-germany/","image":"https://macaonews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/US-Army-Germany.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:05:15","author":"Anna O’connor","authors":["Anna O’connor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mo","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":376554550,"title":"PM vows to ‘double down’ on net zero after admitting ‘consensus is gone’","text":"Sir Keir Starmer challenged opposition critics with a promise to double down on net zero as he admitted the “consensus is gone” on climate change in a speech at the UN’s Cop30 summit.\n\nThe Prime Minister staunchly defended his Government’s clean energy agenda, but conceded unity on “science that is unequivocal” has splintered since the Paris Accord a decade ago.\n\nSpeaking at the international climate conference in Belem, Brazil’s city gateway to the Amazon, Sir Keir sought to make the economic case for net zero by arguing the green transition would create jobs and lower household bills.\n\nHe said: “Ten years ago, the world came together in Paris … united in our determination to tackle the climate crisis.\n\n“A consensus based on science that is unequivocal and this unity was not just international – it was there within most of our countries too.\n\n“There was cross-party consensus in the UK. The only question was how fast we could go. Today, however, sadly that consensus is gone.”\n\nHe described green policies as a “win-win” despite pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised Britain’s net zero agenda and who, along with leaders from China and India, snubbed the summit.\n\nIn an appeal for unity, the Prime Minister said: “The greater our collective ambition, the more progress we make in tackling the climate crisis, and the greater the opportunities we create.\n\n“Just for UK businesses … providing goods and services for the global net zero transition could be worth £1 trillion by 2030.”\n\nHe added: “The UK is doubling down on the fight against climate change as an investment in future generations, yes, of course, but also, crucially, as an investment in improving the lives of working people here and now.\n\n“So, look, my message here is that the UK is all in. Because we know you don’t protect jobs and communities by sticking with the status quo, you don’t meet a challenge like climate change by standing still.\n\n“You do it by embracing change, embracing the opportunities, and doing so together.”\n\nLabour came into government pledging to remove almost all fossil fuels from the UK’s electricity supply by 2030 as part of efforts to boost energy security, curb bills, grow investment and tackle climate change.\n\nBut the agenda has faced significant pushback from the Conservatives and Reform UK, who have pledged to ditch what they say are “expensive” net zero policies and repeal climate legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the US president has vowed to “unleash” oil and gas drilling as he pulled the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter out of the 2015 UN Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\nThe Prime Minister travelled to Belem along with Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and the Prince of Wales on Thursday, having attended William’s Earthshot Prize ceremony on Wednesday night.\n\nFollowing his speech, he met President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil for a bilateral meeting which media were not allowed into.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the pair “spoke about the importance of multilateralism and international collaboration to tackle climate change”, discussed joint efforts on clean energy and agreed on the importance of taking “transition efforts very seriously”.\n\nSir Keir also met Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley, telling her the “devastating scenes” following Hurricane Melissa “were an urgent and sobering reminder of why we cannot – and we will not – stand by and wait to tackle climate change”, according to the readout.\n\nDuring his visit, Sir Keir hailed a series of new investment deals for UK clean power, including a £100 million commitment from Jera Nex bp and En BW to Belfast Harbour to support the delivery of two offshore windfarms, which No 10 estimates will create around 600 jobs altogether.\n\nHowever, a decision not to invest in a Brazilian-led rainforest fund threatened to overshadow Sir Keir’s efforts to show UK leadership on climate action.\n\nThe Government has decided not to commit public money to the Tropical Forest Forever Fund, which Cop30 host nation Brazil wants to launch at the summit, prompting a backlash from environmental campaigners.\n\nThe UK played a key role in establishing the scheme, which would offer financial backing to countries for preserving tropical biomes.\n\nBut the Treasury reportedly questioned the potential cost as Chancellor Rachel Reeves grapples with balancing the books ahead of the Budget.\n\nDowning Street said on Wednesday the Government would continue to support the initiative and explore ways to “bring the full weight of the UK private finances sector” behind the scheme.\n\nSir Keir later insisted “there will be financial leadership” when questioned about the UK commitment to green initiative later on Thursday.\n\n“There will be financial leadership, and the turning point, if you like, the theme of Cop and all the discussions is, how do we leverage in private finance,” he said.\n\n“How do you make this an investment-led initiative, so that it’s not just about giving money or donations?”\n\nHowever, the WWF said failing to invest in the fund “falls short” of Sir Keir’s commitment for the UK to be “all in” on climate action and urged him to reconsider the move.\n\nGreenpeace said the Prime Minister should put “his money where his mouth is” and offer funding to the scheme, while ActionAid called on the UK and other nations to “ramp up their ambition” on the green transition.\n\nCo-executive director Areeba Hamid said: “Keir Starmer boasts a domestic record stronger than most, having promised to end new oil and gas here in the UK – a genuinely world-leading policy.\n\n“But, with a climate denier at the helm of the world’s biggest superpower, it is absolutely vital that the UK takes up the mantle on global climate leadership and puts his money where his mouth is.”\n\nFriends of the Earth welcomed the Prime Minister’s message, but said Britain must go “further and faster” and called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to “show she’s all in too” by providing more money for energy transition in the Budget.\n\nQuestions have been raised over the scope of summit after leaders from three of the world’s major economies – America, China and India – did not attend.\n\nBut the Prime Minister insisted the the UK “can make a difference” despite their absence, telling broadcasters: “Yes, we can make a difference, and we must make a difference.\n\n“Climate damage is one of the defining issues of our time, and it’s not going to go away.”\n\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch suggested Sir Keir should focus on the UK’s domestic issues over attending Cop.\n\nDuring a visit to Staffordshire, the opposition leader said: “Keir Starmer has gone to a conference where the four biggest polluters – the US, India, China, Russia – are not there. That means that nothing serious is going to be happening.\n\n“If those four countries aren’t doing anything, Keir Starmer should focus on fixing the domestic problems we have in our country first.”\n\nMrs Badenoch also suggested Sir Keir was the “only person” from a “serious country at that conference”, where other European leaders including France’s Emmanuel Macron are also expected to attend.\n\nThe Prime Minister later took a veiled swipe at the Tory leader, saying “those that say we shouldn’t go after green jobs in the future need to go and talk to those who are doing these jobs and tell them that they don’t really value their jobs.”\n\n“Those that say now is the time to look away… I think are just fundamentally wrong,” he said.\n\nA Labour source said the Tory leader was adopting outdated arguments to appeal to her dwindling number of supporters.\n\n“The Prime Minister has travelled to Cop with the Prince of Wales to show UK leadership on the world stage and delivering jobs and opportunity across Britain,” they said.\n\n“The Leader of the Opposition should look the 400,000 UK workers in clean energy in the eye and tell them she wants to throw it all away.\n\n“And for what? Old, rusty arguments stuck in the past that she’s forced to adopt because her dwindling number of supporters demand it.”","summary":"The Prime Minister was speaking at the Cop30 summit in Belem, Brazil.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/prime-minister-keir-starmer-brazil-donald-trump-rachel-reeves-b1256957.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/11/06/17/9ff157fb55215e7e1733e4ea9e2a1620Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzYyNTM0ODk3-2.82312323.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:02:39","author":"Nina Lloyd","authors":["Nina Lloyd"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.104},{"id":376554916,"title":"Will your airport be impacted by the GOP’s shutdown?","text":"Thought flying during a government shutdown couldn’t get any worse?

It’s still unclear whether the list is final. The FAA hasn’t issued a public order outlining the details of its restrictions, and a spokesperson declined to respond to Daily Kos’ request for comment, citing a lapse in funding that halted routine media responses.\n\n“As Secretary Duffy has said, there have been increased staffing shortages across the system. When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations,” a spokesperson said.\n\nBut in a separate comment to Politico, another FAA official said, “We haven’t put anything out. Nothing is official.”\n\n“I’m not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we’ve had a situation where we’re taking these kinds of measures,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said Wednesday. “Then again, we’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”\n\nBedford’s remark came just a day after President Donald Trump pressed Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster—a move he argued would break the stalemate. It laid bare what’s been obvious for weeks: The shutdown—and the havoc it’s wreaking—is the result of political choices, not circumstance.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Bedford insisted that air travel is safe but that internal data and pilot reports show growing fatigue among air traffic controllers. \n\n“We are starting to see some evidence that fatigue is building in the system in ways that we feel we need to work towards relieving some of that pressure,” he said.\n\nDuffy was more blunt. \n\n“There’ll be frustration. But in the end, our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible,” he said.\n\nRelated | Air travel will be 'really rough,' warns guy in charge of that\n\nThe reductions will begin at around 4% on Friday and ramp up to 10% in the coming days, mostly affecting flights between 6 AM and 10 PM—the busiest hours of the day. International routes will be exempt.\n\nBedford said that the decision was driven by safety data and concerns about fatigue, not politics. \n\n“This is not based on light airline travel locations,” he said. “This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure.”\n\nThe move follows Duffy’s warning earlier this week that parts of U.S. airspace could be forced to shut down entirely if the impasse continues. \n\n“If you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos,” he said Tuesday, blaming Congress for the lack of a deal.\n\nBut airlines are now scrambling to adjust. \n\nUnited Airlines said that long-haul international and hub-to-hub routes won’t be affected, and that customers will be eligible for refunds even on nonrefundable tickets. American Airlines said that it’s awaiting guidance from the FAA but expects that the “vast majority” of passengers won’t see major disruptions. Southwest Airlines also said that the “vast majority” of its customers won’t be affected but joined others in urging Congress to end the impasse.\n\nBoth Bedford and Duffy stressed that the move is a proactive measure, not a reaction to an existing safety issue. \n\n“We’re not going to wait for a safety problem to truly manifest itself when the early indicators are telling us we can take action today,” Bedford said.\n\nStill, with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers among the nearly 700,000 federal employees working without pay, the pressure is mounting. \n\nWhat’s worse, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday that Trump is aware of the FAA restrictions but hasn’t signaled any plans to change course.\n\nIt’s unclear how long the plan will remain in place or whether it will impact Thanksgiving travel, one of the busiest times of the year. Last year, more than 3 million passengers were screened by TSA agents on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. This year, air traffic controllers and TSA agents will have been working without pay for more than eight weeks, raising the risk of more delays and employees calling out of work.\n\nFlying is about to get even worse and more hectic—and right ahead of the holidays, with no end in sight for the GOP’s shutdown.","summary":"Thought flying during a government shutdown couldn’t get any worse?

government to distribute full SNAP benefits","text":"Nov. 6 (UPI) -- The Trump administration has one day to fully distribute Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for November, a federal judge ruled on Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell ordered the program funding after earlier requiring the Trump administration to access available money to at least partially fund SNAP benefits amid the federal government shutdown.\n\nMcConnell required the Trump administration to apprise the court on Wednesday of efforts to fund the program formerly known as \"food stamps.\"\n\n\"People have gone without for too long,\" McConnell said during an emergency hearing on Thursday, as reported by CNN.\n\n\"Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable,\" he added.\n\nHe said the Trump administration has not done enough to access an estimated $4.65 billion in contingency funds to partially fund the SNAP benefits that cost about $9 billion per month to help 42 million recipients put food on their tables.\n\nIf SNAP is not funded fully, \"people will go hungry, food pantries will be overburdened, and needless suffering will occur,\" McConnell said on Thursday, according to CNBC.\n\n\"That's what irreparable harm here means,\" he continued. \"Last weekend, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation's history.\"\n\nHe called it a \"problem that could have and should have been avoided.\"\n\nMcConnell ordered the Trump administration to provide the full amount of November SNAP benefits to respective states by Friday, which would enable them to distribute benefits to their residents within a few days.\n\nThe federal judge also referenced a Truth Social post made by President Donald Trump on Tuesday.\n\nIn that post, the president said SNAP benefits only would be funded \"when the radical-left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before.\"\n\nThe social media post served as evidence that the Trump administration would ignore McConnell's prior order requiring it to access as much funding as possible to distribute SNAP benefits.\n\nHe criticized the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision not to access contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits instead of allowing them to be suspended as of Saturday.\n\n\"Even when Nov. 1 came, [the] USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds,\" McConnell said.\n\n\"USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to the beneficiary for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.\"\n\nMcConnell is presiding over one of two federal cases filed by up to 25 states seeking to continue federal funding of SNAP benefits despite the record 37-day federal government shutdown that started on Oct. 1.\n\nNew York is party to both suits, and state Attorney General Letitia James welcomed McConnell's ruling on Thursday.\n\n\"A judge in Rhode Island just stopped the federal government from starving millions of Americans,\" James said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"I am relieved that people will get the food they need,\" she added, \"but it is outrageous that it took a lawsuit to make the federal government feed its own people.\"","summary":"The Trump administration has one day to fully distribute Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

Congratulations, “Yes on Measure A” team. You ran a good campaign, especially county Supervisor Susan Ellenberg, who did a yeoman’s work of spreading the “Yes on A” message. I opposed it, but it’s important to acknowledge the win.\n\nI hope Santa Clara County sees the final Measure A results and the message they are sending: There was sizeable opposition. People, hard-working, cash-strapped people, are struggling, and they have something to say. We need to eat and pay our bills for essentials like water and PG&E. Just as Democrats at the national level paid little attention to what the working people were trying to tell them in 2024 (and subsequently helped make No. 45 No. 47), so too it seemed that many working people were not listened to with the Measure A campaign.\n\nWe want assurances that Santa Clara County will spend this and future monies wisely.\n\nTina Morrill\n\nGuard Measure A\nfunds from Super Bowl\n\nMeasure A appears to have passed, which is meant to help alleviate the budgetary cliff our health care services are seeing due to the Trump administration. The lack of spending requirements, however, and the reporting that Santa Clara County also faces a massive fiscal hurdle in funding Super Bowl preparation, has me worried that our tax dollars may instead go toward a sports event rather than our hospitals.\n\nWith Santa Clara County battling the administration over funding to cover Super Bowl preparations and many of the fund-generating events being planned for San Francisco instead of Santa Clara County, it seems likely that we are going to get stuck with the bill — all for an event we didn’t request nor will we profit from.\n\nPerhaps the county should look at pushing for the Super Bowl to move to alleviate the budget risk and ensure our taxes go where they should.\n\nChristopher Dooner\n\nWins mean Dems can\nclaim right side of law\n\nThe blue wave at the polls on Nov. 4 comes as drone strikes continue on Venezuelan boats and Donald Trump escalates talk of war. Congress is right to demand that Trump abide by the limits of the War Powers Resolutions that bar any president from unilaterally declaring war.\n\nFurther, this demand should also extend to Gaza, where Israel continues to kill Palestinians with U.S. weapons in violation of the ceasefire agreement. California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla previously failed to denounce arms shipments to Israel. Such complicity in arming genocide as well as providing military intelligence constitutes participation in hostilities. Such U.S. actions run counter to the War Powers Resolution and the Leahy Laws that bar the U.S. from arming human rights violators.\n\nThe blue wave election signals that timid Democrats need no longer avoid taking a stand on the right side of history and U.S. law.\n\nBrian Rawson\n\nCheney’s death should\nbring Iraq War reckoning\n\nRe: “Former VP Dick Cheney dies at age 84” (Page A1, Nov. 5).\n\nDonald Trump is a master of TV screens. Even the death of one of the most influential people of our time, Dick Cheney, was minimized and relegated to the bottom or back pages.\n\nCheney was a shrewd businessman who viewed politics through the lens of profit. He was aided and abetted by Donald Rumsfeld, who shoved George W. Bush into the most destructive war of our times in Iraq. It not only drained resources but also made us ashamed in the eyes of the rest of the world.\n\nMost news outlets had relegated the news and the consequences suffered by us due to the grievous intervention. I hope someone writes about it.

The roar of Death Valley when we beat Alabama. The losses will always hurt, but I will remember all the wins.\" He was 34-14 with the Tigers over three-plus seasons, helping them reach the 2022 SEC title game. They didn't qualify for the College Football Playoff in his first three seasons, and were virtually eliminated from contention with his last loss. LSU has won three national titles this century — in 2003, 2007 and 2019. The most recent came under Kelly's predecessor, Ed Orgeron. Kelly called it a privilege to coach exceptional student-athletes, among them 2023 Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels and 39 SEC Academic Honor Roll players in 2024. Associate head coach Frank Wilson is the team's interim coach for the remainder of the season. The Tigers (5-3, 2-3 SEC) host No. 7 Alabama (7-1, 5-0 SEC) on Saturday in their first game since Kelly was fired. \"As everyone heads on their way to see the Tigers play, I wish coach Wilson, the coaches and our players the best this weekend,\" Kelly said. LSU ousted Kelly and athletic director Scott Woodward amid criticism from Gov. Jeff Landry, a smooth-talking Cajun populist and ally of President Donald Trump. The day of Kelly’s firing, Landry said he hosted a meeting in the governor’s mansion on the evening of Oct. 26 \"to discuss the legalities of the contract.\" Landry has said he is concerned his state will be on the hook to pay for Kelly’s buyout, which is about $54 million. Days after Kelly’s firing, Landry told reporters that Woodward would not select the next coach. The next day, LSU cut ties with Woodward. The 64-year-old Kelly has gone 200-76 in Division I since being hired by Central Michigan in 2004. He was 113-40 at Notre Dame and had 34-6 mark at Cincinnati. Kelly was 118-35-2 at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, winning two Division II national titles during a run of three straight trips to the championship game.

We are considering specific ways to proceed with cooperation.”\nTakaichi has long been a proponent of exploiting Japan’s reserves of minerals and rare earth elements, even though their location at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean has made them relatively difficult to access.\nAnd while Tokyo recognises that it will be costly to develop the technologies to extract rare earths – such as dysprosium, terbium, neodymium and yttrium – from the seabed, it is also acutely aware that it cannot rely on other producers to ensure an uninterrupted supply of the materials that its companies require.\n\n“China is playing the rare earths card with the US and this is not the first time they have done it,” said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo.\nRare earths were used as leverage in September 2010, when a Chinese fishing boat was involved in a clash with Japan Coast Guard vessels after it was located operating in waters around disputed islands in the East China Sea.\nCoastguard officials boarded the ship off the Diaoyu Islands, which Japan controls and knows as the Senkaku archipelago, and arrested the captain and his crew.\nThe Chinese government then cut diplomatic and trade ties with Japan, including halting supplies of rare earths critical for the production of consumer electronics, clean energy systems, medical equipment, military technology and others.\n“Japan had little choice but to kowtow then and Takaichi knows now that China produces around 70 per cent of the world’s rare earths and refines and processes about 90 per cent of the global supply,” Kingston told This Week in Asia.\n“These are elements that are critical to all sorts of hi-tech gadgets and make Japan’s hi-tech sector vulnerable to Beijing if it wants to disrupt supply chains. Any way that Japan can find to offset Chinese dominance in this sector will be welcome.”\nThe Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology has in recent years conducted a series of research operations in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, most recently in August when the deep-sea drilling ship Chikyu was deployed to a site about 100km from Minamitorishima, an island 1,848km southeast of Tokyo and the most easterly part of Japan.\nMaterial was gathered from a depth of about 5,500 metres over the course of three weeks.\nExperts said before the mission that they were hoping that each ton of seabed mud would contain an average of 2kg of rare earth elements.\n\nResearchers dredging the seabed in waters elsewhere within Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) have previously found significant deposits of minerals, with a 2018 study off the Ogasawara Islands south of Tokyo indicating that a 400 sq km area could contain as much as 16 million tons of rare earths.\nThere are high hopes that the seabed around Minamitorishima will also yield large amounts of minerals. At just 151 hectares (373 acres), the island is small but strategically important as it permits Tokyo to claim an EEZ that covers nearly 429,000 sq km of the surrounding waters and seabed, as well as any mineral or energy deposits that lie beneath the floor of the ocean.\nIn June 2023, researchers from the University of Tokyo and the Nippon Foundation carried out research around the island, identifying large deposits – an estimated 230 million tons in an area of 10,000 sq km – of nodules high in cobalt and nickel.\nThe nodules are understood to have formed over millions of years as metals transported in the ocean attach to nuclei, such as fish bones, on the seabed. The team estimated that the deposits contain about 610,000 tons of cobalt, sufficient to meet the needs of Japanese industry for around 75 years, and some 740,000 tons of nickel, about 11 years of domestic consumption.\nIn a study titled “Research on National Power” published in 2024, Takaichi indicated that she would turn Minamitorishima into a hub for processing rare earth elements harvested from the seabed nearby.\n“I aim to build a rare earth production system with Minamitorishima as a base,” Takaichi wrote, adding that if the plan was successful, “a stable domestic rare earth supply system will be realised, contributing greatly to Japan’s resource security”.\n\nThe island would appear to be an ideal base of operations. It has no permanent residents who would be inconvenienced by large-scale industrial operations, but it has infrastructure, including an airfield, as it serves as a military base.\nProcessing the raw material on the island would also reduce transport times and permit only the refined rare earths to be shipped in bulk to Japan or the US.\n“Given that rare earths have been such an issue between the US and China in recent months, plans for joint development with Japan are going to be welcomed on both sides of the Pacific,” Kingston said.\n“The gesture is also timely as it shows that Japan is willing to pitch in to help the US, but it also allows Takaichi to demonstrate to the Japanese people that Japan is contributing.”\nKohmei Harada, director of the Sustainability Design Institute and a former director at Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science, agreed that it was “critical” for Tokyo to secure adequate and reliable sources of rare earths, but sounded a note of caution about claims of vast mineral wealth just waiting to be scooped up.\n“There are many challenges still to be overcome, including how the resources can be collected from such great depths, how they can be brought to the surface safely and then transported to be refined, all without causing the pollution that many environmental experts are concerned about,” he said.\n“There is no doubt that Japan needs these resources, but I just hope they are there in the amounts that they are predicting and that they can be recovered economically.”","summary":"Japan and the United States are preparing to jointly tap deep-sea rare earth deposits near Minamitorishima, in what analysts see as a strategic bid to insulate their hi-tech sectors from China’s grip on critical minerals and fortify supply chains amid rising geopolitical rivalry.\nPrime Minister Sanae Takaichi confirmed Tokyo’s intention to cooperate with Washington on seabed exploration and resource development after meeting US President Donald Trump in Tokyo on October 28.\nThe two sides agreed...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3331818/japan-us-join-forces-mine-deep-sea-rare-earths-amid-chinas-dominance","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/11/06/30ba91c4-3eb5-4be6-9982-a6079dc5ef4b_ed0e6b8f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-07 00:00:10","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":376550570,"title":"NOVA Determines Virginia’s Democrat Sweep","text":"Virginia Democrats swept the statewide elections Tuesday night–thanks to Northern Virginia voters who accounted for 88% of Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger’s victory margin. \n\nDemocrat Ghazala Hashmi won the lieutenant governor race, and Democrat Jay Jones won the attorney general race.

The Supreme court granted the government’s request to temporarily stay rulings by a lower court that would have required the State Department to issue passports to transgender-identifying Americans based on their self-professed “gender identity,” rather than biological reality. \n\n“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,” the court said in its order.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi celebrated securing “our 24th victory at the Supreme Court’s emergency docket” in a post to X.\n\n“Today’s stay allows the government to require citizens to list their biological sex on their passport,” she continued. “In other words: there are two sexes, and our attorneys will continue fighting for that simple truth.”\n\nThe court’s three liberal-leaning justices dissented. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who infamously refused to define what a woman is at her confirmation hearing, wrote:\n\nThe Court ignores these critical limits on its equitable discretion today. The Government seeks to enforce a questionably legal new policy immediately, but it offers no evidence that it will suffer any harm if it is temporarily enjoined from doing so, while the plaintiffs will be subject to imminent, concrete injury if the policy goes into effect. The Court nonetheless fails to spill any ink considering the plaintiffs, opting instead to intervene in the Government’s favor without equitable justification, and in a manner that permits harm to be inflicted on the most vulnerable party.\n\n“Such senseless sidestepping of the obvious equitable outcome has become an unfortunate pattern. So, too, has my own refusal to look the other way when basic principles are selectively discarded,” she continued. “This Court has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any) justification. Because I cannot acquiesce to this pointless but painful perversion of our equitable discretion, I respectfully dissent.”\n\nOn President Donald Trump’s first day of his second term, he signed an executive order called “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” That order requires passports to “accurately reflect the holder’s sex” according to the administration’s definition of sex, which is “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.” \n\n‘”Sex’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘gender identity,”‘ the order reads.\n\nThe policy was quickly challenged by several transgender-identifying people, who claim the rule violates their right to equal protection under the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, as well as a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act, according to NBC News. \n\nAshton Orr, a woman who identifies as a man, is the named plaintiff in the case. She applied for a passport with a male sex marker in January, and was told by the State Department in February that she could only have a female sex marker, in accordance with reality. \n\nA federal judge in Massachusetts ruled against the Trump administration, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined to pause the ruling during litigation. \n\nThe Supreme Court wrote that the Trump administration was “likely to succeed on the merits.”\n\n“And the District Court’s grant of class-wide relief enjoins enforcement of an Executive Branch policy with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document. In light of the foregoing, the Government will suffer a form of irreparable injury absent a stay,” the court wrote.","summary":"The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to enforce a policy restricting sex designations on passports to \"male\" and \"female\" based on the sex an individual was at birth. \n\n\nThe post Supreme Court Allows Trump to Enforce Requiring Biological Sex on Passports appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/06/supreme-court-allows-trump-to-enforce-requiring-biological-sex-on-passports/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/US-Passport-with-Sex-Designation-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:58:23","author":"Katherine Hamilton","authors":["Katherine Hamilton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":376554424,"title":"Ukraine Says Talks With US On Tomahawk Missiles \"Positive\"","text":"Ukraine is engaged in \"positive\" talks about buying Tomahawk missiles and other long-range weaponry with the United States, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olha Stefanishyna, told Bloomberg News on Thursday.US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that, for now, he is not considering a deal that would allow Ukraine to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for use against Russia.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Ukraine is engaged in \"positive\" talks about buying Tomahawk missiles and other long-range weaponry with the United States, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olha Stefanishyna, told Bloomberg News on Thursday.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ukraine-says-talks-with-us-on-tomahawk-missiles-positive-9590416","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-11/amrt50q8_us-tomahawk-missile_625x300_07_November_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:56:40","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":376550832,"title":"Senate Republicans block bid to limit Trump’s war powers on Venezuela","text":"U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a resolution on Thursday that would have prevented President Donald Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional authorisation, a day after administration officials told lawmakers that Washington is not currently planning strikes on Venezuelan territory.\n\nThe Senate voted 51 to 49, largely along party lines, against a measure that would have brought the war powers resolution up for a vote.\n\nOnly two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joined Democrats in backing the measure, in a show of the party’s support for Trump’s military build-up in the southern Caribbean after two months of deadly strikes against boats off Venezuela.\n\nThe Trump administration says that since early September, U.S. forces have launched at least 16 strikes against such vessels in the Pacific and southern Caribbean, killing more than 65 people.\n\nThe prolonged campaign has heightened concern that Trump will launch an attack on Venezuela itself, prompting the introduction of the bipartisan resolution.

Gregory Bovino.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune and Chicago Public Media petitioned U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to release the recordings, which were filed under seal as part of a lawsuit led by the Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit journalism advocacy organization, and a consortium of other media groups. The journalism organizations allege federal immigration enforcement officials have systematically violated the constitutional rights of protesters and reporters during President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mission, which began in early September and shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nEllis, who issued a temporary restraining order last month, announced Thursday that she will put longer-term restrictions on federal agents’ use of chemical agents on crowds and provide enhanced protections for protesters and members of the media.\n\nThe released videos can be seen in their entirety on the Tribune’s YouTube channel, but here are some of the highlights:\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol in Chicago\n\nBovino, who is leading Trump’s immigration enforcement effort in the Chicago area, testified that he is leading roughly 220 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents as part of the so-called Operation Midway Blitz. He said he reports directly to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n‘More than exemplary’\n\nAsked by veteran Chicago civil rights attorney Locke Bowman if he stood by remarks he made to CBS that the use of force at the Broadview ICE facility has been “exemplary,” Bovino at first surprised everyone by saying, “No.”\n\n“The uses of force have been more than exemplary,” Bovino clarified.\n\nIn placing longer-term restrictions Thursday, Ellis disagreed.\n\n“The use of force shocks the conscience,” she said.\n\n‘Violent rioters’\n\nDuring the deposition, Bovino said he had not witnessed his agents using tear gas or pepper-spray balls against protesters in Broadview, but chemical agents were used against “violent rioters” and “assaultive subjects.”\n\nDefinition of a protester\n\nWhen asked to define “protester,” Bovino said it’s a person “exercising their constitutional rights to speak — to speak their opinion, to speak their mind in a peaceful fashion … in accordance with laws, rules and with the Constitution.”\n\n“We get protesters on both sides of the issue. Sometimes they protest against, say, a Title 8 immigration enforcement mission, tell us they don’t like it, we shouldn’t be there, we need to go home, use very foul language oftentimes,” he said. “And then there’s also protesters on the other side of the issue that say ‘hey, you should be there. We’re glad you’re here. Continue to be here.’ So, I look at those as peaceful individuals exercising their right to, one, be there and, two, speak their mind. It’s freedom of assembly, freedom of speech.”\n\nBovino then rattled off a list of public actions he said his agents have experienced, actions he uses to draw a distinction between protesters and “violent rioters” or “assaultive subjects”: “Removing masks, kicking agents, grabbing agents’ groins, assisting and abetting prisoners from escaping, shooting fireworks, knifing and slashing tires with weapons, throwing rocks through windows of vehicles to hurt agents and/or detainees.”\n\n‘Not a reportable use of force’\n\nOn the video, Bovino is asked about an Oct. 3 arrest he made involving a man protesting outside the Broadview facility. According to the complaint, Bovino ordered a man to move down the street after the man told him, “you love to be on television.” As the man started to move, the complaint states, Bovino “stepped across a barrier,” tackled the man and arrested him.\n\nDuring the Nov. 4 deposition, Bovino said the arrest “was not a reportable use of force. I placed him under arrest. I didn’t tackle him.”\n\nMore about Bovino’s interaction with the protester\n\nBovino was asked about an encounter with the man, Scott Blackburn, who was protesting at Broadview.

Gregory Bovino.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune and Chicago Public Media petitioned U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to release the recordings, which were filed under seal as part of a lawsuit led by the Chicago Headline Club, a nonprofit journalism advocacy organization, and a consortium of other media groups. The journalism organizations allege federal immigration enforcement officials have systematically violated the constitutional rights of protesters and reporters during President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mission, which began in early September and shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nEllis, who issued a temporary restraining order last month, announced Thursday that she will put longer-term restrictions on federal agents’ use of chemical agents on crowds and provide enhanced protections for protesters and members of the media.\n\nThe released videos can be seen in their entirety on the Tribune’s YouTube channel, but here are some of the highlights:\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol in Chicago\n\nBovino, who is leading Trump’s immigration enforcement effort in the Chicago area, testified that he is leading roughly 220 U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents as part of the so-called Operation Midway Blitz. He said he reports directly to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n‘More than exemplary’\n\nAsked by veteran Chicago civil rights attorney Locke Bowman if he stood by remarks he made to CBS that the use of force at the Broadview ICE facility has been “exemplary,” Bovino at first surprised everyone by saying, “No.”\n\n“The uses of force have been more than exemplary,” Bovino clarified.\n\nIn placing longer-term restrictions Thursday, Ellis disagreed.\n\n“The use of force shocks the conscience,” she said.\n\n‘Violent rioters’\n\nDuring the deposition, Bovino said he had not witnessed his agents using tear gas or pepper-spray balls against protesters in Broadview, but chemical agents were used against “violent rioters” and “assaultive subjects.”\n\nDefinition of a protester\n\nWhen asked to define “protester,” Bovino said it’s a person “exercising their constitutional rights to speak — to speak their opinion, to speak their mind in a peaceful fashion … in accordance with laws, rules and with the Constitution.”\n\n“We get protesters on both sides of the issue. Sometimes they protest against, say, a Title 8 immigration enforcement mission, tell us they don’t like it, we shouldn’t be there, we need to go home, use very foul language oftentimes,” he said. “And then there’s also protesters on the other side of the issue that say ‘hey, you should be there. We’re glad you’re here. Continue to be here.’ So, I look at those as peaceful individuals exercising their right to, one, be there and, two, speak their mind. It’s freedom of assembly, freedom of speech.”\n\nBovino then rattled off a list of public actions he said his agents have experienced, actions he uses to draw a distinction between protesters and “violent rioters” or “assaultive subjects”: “Removing masks, kicking agents, grabbing agents’ groins, assisting and abetting prisoners from escaping, shooting fireworks, knifing and slashing tires with weapons, throwing rocks through windows of vehicles to hurt agents and/or detainees.”\n\n‘Not a reportable use of force’\n\nOn the video, Bovino is asked about an Oct. 3 arrest he made involving a man protesting outside the Broadview facility. According to the complaint, Bovino ordered a man to move down the street after the man told him, “you love to be on television.” As the man started to move, the complaint states, Bovino “stepped across a barrier,” tackled the man and arrested him.\n\nDuring the Nov. 4 deposition, Bovino said the arrest “was not a reportable use of force. I placed him under arrest. I didn’t tackle him.”\n\nMore about Bovino’s interaction with the protester\n\nBovino was asked about an encounter with the man, Scott Blackburn, who was protesting at Broadview. The lawyer and Bovino disagreed over whether he used force when he tackled the protester.\n\n“He doesn’t like the fact that you are instructing him to move down,” the lawyer said to Bovino.\n\nBovino objected to the lawyer’s characterization, saying instead, “That individual is failing to follow instructions to vacate the area.”\n\nThe video shows Bovino tackling the protester. But Bovino characterized it a different way.\n\n“I’m imploring Mr. Blackburn, or whoever that individual was, to comply with leaving the area and to comply with instructions,” Bovino said.\n\nAsked if he was “making physical contact,” Bovino said he was.

Not the alleged victim. \n\nNot even the year of my state Senate campaign is accurate.\n\nYet Gemma actually generated fake links to fabricated news articles to support its defamatory claim.\n\nThis is not simply a technical glitch; it is a catastrophic failure of oversight of an AI model downloaded by more than 200 million people.\n\nAnd it’s emblematic of a broader pattern of bias against conservatives within Google’s products.\n\nIn September, Google scrapped a Gmail blacklist that disproportionately suppressed Republican fund-raising emails as spam.\n\nIt had been operating for years: Ahead of the 2020 election, this blacklist flagged nearly 60% more emails from GOP candidates than from Democrats, removing them from recipients’ inboxes before they even had the chance to open them.\n\nDuring last year’s presidential election, the tech giant faced accusations that it manipulated search results to boost positive articles about Kamala Harris and negative coverage of Donald Trump and his campaign.\n\nThe day after the vice-presidential debate, for example, search results for “JD Vance” in Google’s news tab showed exclusively left-leaning outlets, and the search engine also appeared to suppress searches about the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pa.\n\nIt’s not just conservatives who are raising the alarm about the tech company’s bias.\n\nGoogle itself admitted in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee in September that it colluded with the Biden administration to censor individuals who questioned Democrats’ COVID policies, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).\n\nNow, it appears Google’s political bias has infected its AI models, which have targeted other conservatives with defamation — not just me.\n\nDuring a Senate Commerce Committee hearing last week, I presented evidence to Google vice president Markham Erickson that his company’s AI models have repeatedly fabricated malicious stories about Robby Starbuck, an anti-DEI activist.\n\nIn one instance, Gemma falsely claimed that Starbuck was accused of child rape — and that I publicly defended him.\n\nGoogle’s AI models have also falsely accused Starbuck of being a former adult film actor, of facing criminal drug charges, and of shooting a man in Nashville, Tenn., in an argument over a parking space.\n\nIn response, Erickson claimed that “hallucinations” in Google’s AI models are common, and a problem the company is working to mitigate.\n\nThat response is entirely unacceptable.\n\nLast week, I sent a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai demanding an explanation as to why Gemma generated false criminal allegations against me.\n\nI also asked for a list of steps the company is taking to eliminate political bias and defamatory content from its AI models.\n\nGoogle has thus far failed to address my questions — but the company quietly removed Gemma from its AI Studio last weekend.\n\nDespite the AI model’s serious flaws, the big tech giant said it will continue to make Gemma available to developers.\n\nMy message to Google is simple: Shut your AI models down completely until you can control them.\n\nThe American public deserves AI systems that are accurate, fair and transparent — not tools that smear conservatives with manufactured criminal allegations.\n\nWhen Google launched Gemma last year, the company claimed it had developed the AI model to adhere to the company’s “rigorous standards for safe and responsible outputs.”\n\nThey have clearly failed.\n\nNow the American people deserve to see accountability.\n\nMarsha Blackburn represents Tennessee in the US Senate.","summary":"Google's Gemma large language fabricated an elaborate criminal allegation against me — and it's not the first time the company's products have smeared and targeted conservatives.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/06/opinion/us-senator-marsha-blackburn-googles-biased-ai-accused-me-of-rape-shut-down-its-rampant-lies/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-db30xbmkc-1762470957511.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1762452972&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:49:44","author":"Marsha Blackburn","authors":["Marsha Blackburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.397},{"id":376555228,"title":"Antonio Brown, Former NFL Star, Arrested on Attempted Murder Charge","text":"Former NFL star Antonio Brown has been arrested on an attempted murder charge in connection with a shooting that occurred after a celebrity boxing event in Miami, police said Thursday.\n\nBrown, 37, was taken into custody by U.S. Marshals in Dubai and flown to Essex County, New Jersey, where he is being held while awaiting extradition to Miami, according to Miami police spokesman Mike Vega. It was not immediately clear why Brown was first transported to New Jersey or how long he had been in Dubai, though he has posted on social media from the city in recent months.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nBrown has faced multiple legal troubles over the years, including battery, domestic violence, and child support cases. The latest arrest marks the most serious charge yet for the former football star, whose off-field controversies have overshadowed his once-storied career.\n\nA seven-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, Brown last played in the NFL in 2021 for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after a decade-long career highlighted by record-setting seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. His career ended abruptly after a high-profile midgame walkoff at MetLife Stadium.\n\nFormer NFL player Antonio Brown watches an NBA basketball game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors, Monday, Feb. 14, 2022, in Los Angeles. No charges will be filed against Antonio Brown following an apparent domestic incident at a Tampa, Florida, home in late November, prosecutors said Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2022. (AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill, File)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAn arrest warrant accuses Brown of grabbing a handgun from a security guard after the May 16 boxing match and firing two shots at a man he had fought with earlier in the evening. The victim, identified as Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators that one of the bullets grazed his neck. Police said the shooting took place in a crowded area near the event venue.\n\nSome social media videos show Brown in a physical altercation with multiple people at the boxing event. In one video, Brown appears to be holding a black pistol while pursuing someone, with gunshots audible off-camera shortly after. Additional footage shows Brown being escorted from the venue by police with his hands behind his back.\n\nBrown faces a second-degree attempted murder charge, which carries a potential 15-year prison sentence and up to a $10,000 fine if convicted.\n\nSince leaving the NFL, Brown has focused mainly on a rap music career, releasing the album “Paradigm” in April 2022.\n\nIn October, Brown joined Le’Veon Bell in attending Donald Trump‘s presidential campaign rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania Saturday.\n\nBrown, while sporting a Make America Great Again cap, and Bell greeted fans ahead of the rally.\n\nThe former NFL receiver even spoke at the rally to express his support for the Trump campaign.\n\n“But I’m here today representing a man who carries those same values,” Brown said. “Donald Trump, he knows success, and he knows what it takes to make America great again. And to be real, we have all experienced highs and lows. Especially me in my career as a Super Bowl champion and life as a father to seven amazing children.\n\n“I have experienced low points and have to overcome adversity. Just how I watched Donald Trump overcome adversity. No matter what the media threw at him, no matter what people say to try to bring him down, he continue to push forward and keep getting back up. And he’s always ready for the fight.”\n\nBrown also gave a shoutout to Steelers fans in his rally speech. He also acknowledged how the media has called both him and the former president “crazy.”\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nAntonio Brown wrote on X, formerly Twitter, following the March incident: “Regarding the boxing event that happened last night. I was jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me. Contrary to some video circulating, Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED.”\n\nHe added: “I will be talking to my legal council and attorneys on pressing charges on the individuals that jumped me. I will keep you all posted step-by-step on the process. Thank you for the support and love.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nIt was not immediately known whether he has an attorney or when he will be returned to Miami.\n\nUpdates: 11/6/25, 7:02 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.","summary":"Brown, 37, was taken into custody by U.S. Marshals in Dubai and flown to Essex County, New Jersey.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/antonio-brown-arrested-attempted-murder-nfl-dubai-miami-11007469","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP22355656033080.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:49:30","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":376551274,"title":"White House removes Trump-themed Knicks logo post aimed at Mamdani following team's complaint: report","text":"The White House deleted a post featuring an altered New York Knicks logo following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the city’s mayoral election after the team reportedly contacted officials about it.

He implied that he didn't trust anyone else to have more control given the possible danger to humanity.\n\nThe vote is a resounding victory for Musk, proving investors still have faith in him as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits, partially driven by Musk's on-again, off-again bromance with President Donald Trump and his foray into politics.\n\nThe vote came just three days after a report from Europe showing Tesla car sales plunged again last month, including a 50 percent collapse in Germany.\n\nStill, many Tesla investors consider Musk as a miracle man capable of stunning business feats, noting he pulled Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy a half-dozen years ago to turn it into one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThe vote clears a path for Musk to become a trillionaire by granting him new shares, but it still won't be easy. \n\nThe board of directors that designed the pay package require him to hit several ambitious financial and operational targets, including increasing the value of the company on the stock market nearly six times its current level.\n\nMusk also has to deliver 20 million Tesla electric vehicles to the market over 10 years amid new, stiff competition, more than double the number since the founding of the company. \n\nHe also has to deploy more than 1 million of his human-like robots that he has promised will transform work and home - he calls it a 'robot army' - from zero today.\n\nMusk could add billions to his wealth in a few years by partly delivering these goals, according to various intermediate steps that will hand him newly created stock in the company as he nears the ultimate targets.\n\nThat could help him eventually top what is now considered America's all-time richest man, John D. Rockefeller. \n\nThe railroad titan is estimated by Guinness World Records to have been worth $630 billion, in current dollars, at his peak wealth more than 110 years ago. Musk is worth $493 billion, as estimated by Forbes magazine.\n\nMusk's win came despite opposition from several large funds, including Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension, and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. \n\nTwo corporate watchdogs, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, also blasted the package, which so angered Musk he took to calling them 'corporate terrorists' at a recent investor meeting.\n\nCritics argued that the board of directors was too beholden to Musk, his behavior too reckless lately and the riches offered too much.\n\nSupporters said that Musk needed to be incentivized to focus on the company as he works to transform it into an AI powerhouse using software to operate hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars - many without steering wheels - and Tesla robots deployed in offices, factories and homes doing many tasks now handled by humans.","summary":"Elon Musk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders voted to give him a mammoth pay package.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15267487/Tesla-shareholders-Elon-Musk-1-trillion-pay.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/06/23/103669367-0-image-a-15_1762470578101.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:38:49","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":376548034,"title":"IDF chief: Rafah terrorists will surrender or be eliminated","text":"IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told the security cabinet Thursday night that there is “no deal” for about 200 Hamas terrorists trapped in tunnels beneath Rafah, two days after he said he would consider releasing them only in exchange for the body of fallen soldier Hadar Goldin, who has been held in Gaza since 2014. The IDF clarified that there is no evidence that Goldin’s remains are located in the same tunnels where the terrorists are hiding. “It’s either surrender or elimination,” Zamir said during the meeting. “If they surrender, we’ll take them in their underwear to Sde Teiman for interrogation.” Zamir also advised the government not to move to the next stage of the cease-fire deal until all hostages and fallen soldiers are returned, and to block any reconstruction efforts until Gaza is fully demilitarized. Ministers clash over Netanyahu’s 'model city' plan The discussion turned heated when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a proposal to build a “model city” in a demilitarized area under Israeli control in Gaza, where vetted Gazans could enter “to separate Hamas from the civilian population.” Several ministers — including Gila Gamliel, Orit Strock, Zeev Elkin, and Miri Regev — opposed the plan. Gamliel interrupted Netanyahu several times, calling the idea “dangerous.” Some ministers demanded that the city not be built on territory controlled by Israel. Netanyahu added that a planned international stabilization force would first deploy in the al-Mawasi area, which is not under Israeli control. Earlier Thursday, Egypt proposed that the trapped terrorists in Rafah provide intelligence on Hamas tunnels in exchange for safe passage to areas under Hamas control, Reuters reported, citing two sources familiar with the talks. Both Israel and Hamas have yet to respond formally, and discussions are ongoing. U.S. special envoy Steven Witkoff, representing President Donald Trump, said, “If they come out, raise their hands, and surrender their weapons, it will be a test case for Gaza’s demilitarization model.” Neither the Prime Minister’s Office nor Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem commented on the report. Sources cited by Reuters said contact with the terrorists in Rafah was lost around March and that they “may not be aware of the cease-fire.” One source claimed that their release “would serve the interest of maintaining the truce.” IDF aims to destroy the remaining tunnels before the next phase The 200 terrorists trapped in the Israeli-controlled enclave of Rafah’s Jenina neighborhood are part of a larger group of hundreds or possibly thousands of residents and fighters caught between the Israeli border and the Stage A withdrawal line under the cease-fire framework. The IDF is trying to use the limited window before the next stage of the agreement to destroy the remaining tunnels, though such operations often risk deadly encounters. Additional Hamas terrorists— numbering several dozen in some cases — remain in similar enclaves near Bani Suheila, a suburb of Khan Younis, and other areas on the Israeli side of the yellow line. Zamir recommended eliminating all of them and continuing to locate tunnel networks in those areas. However, in Rafah, an opportunity emerged: Hamas reportedly offered to assist in locating the remains of Israeli soldiers in exchange for the safe release of its 200 terrorists into Hamas-controlled territory. Netanyahu initially considered the proposal but backed down amid sharp criticism and threats from within his coalition.","summary":"Lt. Gen.

Oh, now I love her ad,” Trump told reporters. \n\nHe added, “If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”\n\nWhen the interviewer asked Sweeney if she felt “thankful” that “very powerful people” like POTUS “had [her] back in public,” she replied, “Hm, I don’t think that … it’s not that I didn’t have that feeling but I wasn’t thinking of it like that, of any of it.”\n\nVance, meanwhile, ripped Democrats for becoming unhinged over a “pretty girl” selling jeans to kids in America.\n\nMany criticised American Eagle’s “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” ad for its play on words, seemingly using “jeans” instead of “genes” to talk about the blond-haired, blue-eyed starlet.\n\n“Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue,” Sweeney said in a video for the campaign as she buttoned up her denim.\n\nIn the GQ interview, Sweeney said that she ignored the noise about the ad.\n\n“I kind of just put my phone away,” she shared. \n\n“I was filming every day. I’m filming Euphoria, so I’m working 16-hour days and I don’t really bring my phone on set, so I work and then I go home and I go to sleep. \n\n“So I didn’t really see a lot of it.”\n\nBut Sweeney did confirm that she was aware of American Eagle’s 38 per cent soaring stocks thanks to the ad.\n\n“When I saw all the headlines of in-store visits were down a certain percentage, none of it was true,” she explained. \n\n“It was all made up, but nobody could say anything because [the company was] in their quiet period. \n\n“So it was all just a lot of talk. And because I knew at the end of the day what that ad was for, and it was great jeans, it didn’t affect me one way or the other.”\n\nWhen asked if she wanted to specifically comment on the ad and why it garnered criticism, Sweeney told the reporter: “I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.”\n\nSweeney also had a pointed message to those who won’t watch her TV and film projects because of the jeans ad. Her portrayal of boxer Christy Martin in Christy hits theatres Nov. 7.\n\n“I think that if somebody is closed off because of something they read online to a powerful story like Christy, then I hope that something else can open their eyes to being open to art and being open to learning, and I’m not going to be affected by that,” she said.\n\nThis story first appeared in the New York Post and was republished with permission.","summary":"Sydney Sweeney has broken her silence on her controversial American Eagle ad, calling Donald Trump’s reaction “surreal.”","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrity-photos/surreal-sweeney-on-trumps-wild-jeans-ad-reaction/news-story/bb6f5d89a5f9a5cf87b0899326b930cd?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/373b7b4146f25444a591120fc7011676","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:35:02","author":"7 Comments","authors":["7 Comments"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.175},{"id":376550568,"title":"Economy Shows Promising Trends as Trump Prioritizes ‘Typical Hardworking Family’","text":"Even as Senate Democrats continue to prevent the end of the federal government shutdown, there are promising signs in the economy under President Donald Trump.\n\n“Our opponents are offering an economic nightmare—we are delivering an economic miracle … . They want higher spending for government and illegal aliens—we want bigger paychecks for American workers and American families,” the president said Wednesday at a business forum event in Miami. \n\nUnder the Trump administration, the United States has seen real improvements on key metrics of the cost of living, including inflation, gas prices, and tax cuts. \n\nPerhaps the most notable example is the Consumer Price Index’s measurement of a decline in the inflation rate since the president took office. The Biden administration saw inflation reach an annual rate of 9.1% in June 2022, which was about a 40-year high, and a four-year average rate of 5%. But since January, inflation as measured by the CPI has been at about an annual average rate of 2.5%.\n\nWhen it comes to gas prices, this October saw the lowest prices for the fuel for any October since 2020. That translated to an average price of $2.98 per gallon, which is 15.2 cents a gallon lower than the previous year. The price of gas was also the lowest this past Labor Day than it had been for that time of year since 2020. \n\nThe president also saw his campaign promise of “no tax on tips” made good with the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill. That legislation also provided for tax deductions for overtime pay and a tax deduction for seniors. According to the White House, the budget reconciliation legislation boosted take-home pay “for a typical hardworking family by OVER $10,000 a year.”\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats have refused repeatedly to approve a House-passed stopgap continuing resolution funding the federal government. The shutdown has led to thousands of federal workers being furloughed and essential federal personnel having to work with uncertainty over how and when they will be paid. \n\n“America’s economy is losing billions in growth. Even some homebuyers seeking their American dream are facing stalled processes,” House Appropriations Commission Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., explained recently before adding: “Every one of these harms was entirely avoidable. Instead, Democrat leadership designed this shutdown, celebrated it, and weaponized it—all while Americans lose paychecks, benefits, and critical services. They must end this chaos and reopen government.”\n\nFor his part, Trump has sought to reduce the number of Americans that need federal assistance and to boost employment. \n\n“In nine months, we’ve lifted over 600,000 Americans off food stamps. 1.9 million more American-born workers are employed today … than when I took office … and we have more people working now than at any time in the history of our country,” Trump said at the American Business Forum in Miami on Wednesday.","summary":"Even as Senate Democrats continue to prevent the end of the federal government shutdown, there are promising signs in the economy under President Donald Trump....

Dr. Bandy X. Lee, a forensic and social psychiatrist who has long studied the psychology of leadership and power, told The Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles that Trump’s behavior shows growing paranoia and that it could worsen over time.\n\n“He’s paranoid,” Lee said during her appearance on The Daily Beast Podcast. “He is doing whatever he can to make people think he’s the most powerful man on the planet. Why does he need more and more?”\n\nLee was referring to what she described as Trump’s escalating attempts to control his surroundings. She pointed to recent moves, like ordering state National Guards and expanding federal enforcement agencies, as reflections of his deep insecurity. “He’s now accumulating ICE agents as government police forces; he’s now required every state to deploy 500 National Guard members to function essentially as a guard for himself against the people,” she said.\n\nAccording to Lee, these kinds of actions stem from a “limitless insecurity,” a mindset she says becomes more dangerous when combined with age and declining health. “When he demands this kind of powerful positioning of himself, he’s doing so from a place of pathology,” she explained. “It’s not a healthy demand. So he’s doing so in a way that actually fuels his sense of insecurity, his own unfitness, his belonging, and he will become more tyrannical.”\n\nLee’s comments come as questions about Trump’s mental and physical fitness have resurfaced after a string of public stumbles and rambling moments during speeches. Though his team has dismissed the speculation as political, Lee said it would be a mistake to ignore the pattern. “He will increasingly become more defensive and more dangerous,” she warned, adding that enabling this behavior “doesn’t benefit anyone.”\n\nThe psychiatrist has been one of Trump’s most outspoken critics in her field. She gained national attention in 2017 for editing The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a collection of essays from mental health professionals who argued that the president’s behavior posed risks to democracy. Lee was later dismissed from Yale after clashing with university administrators over her public warnings, but she’s continued to speak out, framing her views as a public safety issue rather than a diagnosis.\n\nOn the podcast, Lee said Trump’s paranoia is partly self-aware. “He knows his limitations,” she said. “That’s why he’s constantly on guard.” In her view, his efforts to project dominance, through loyalty tests, threats, and public displays of strength, are actually rooted in fear. “The longer we allow this to go on, the more dangerous he will become,” she added. “We will not be keeping ourselves safe.”\n\nHer warnings, though controversial, echo a growing concern among political observers about Trump’s temperament as he navigates another term in office. Whether voters see his bluster as strength or instability could shape the coming years.\n\nFor Lee, the takeaway is less political than psychological: power doesn’t soothe Trump’s insecurities; it deepens them. And as his health and control wane, she believes his paranoia and his need to assert dominance will only grow stronger.","summary":"Psychiatrist warns Trump’s growing paranoia and declining health could fuel even more dangerous behavior.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/hes-paranoid-psychiatrist-says-trumps-health-decline-could-make-him-more-tyrannical","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump-shouting.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-06 23:30:21","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.233},{"id":376551734,"title":"Fosun brings UK particle therapy to mainland China in advanced cancer care push","text":"Fosun Pharmaceutical, a leading healthcare group, has taken a substantial step towards introducing particle therapy systems to hospitals in mainland China, aligning with Beijing’s efforts to make advanced medical treatment accessible to cancer patients across the country.\nThe Shanghai-based company, a subsidiary of China’s non-state-owned conglomerate Fosun International, formed a partnership with Leo Cancer Care on Thursday, pledging to distribute the UK firm’s Marie medical facilities in the world’s largest consumer market. The deal came three months after the UK company secured regulatory clearance for the Marie system from the US Food and Drug Administration.\nThe partnership “is not only about introducing the Marie system to China, but also about driving the evolution of China’s national therapy industry towards one that places greater emphasis on human-centred care, patient comfort and integration of advanced technology,” Stephen Towe, CEO of Leo Cancer Care, said in a media briefing.\nThe agreement was signed at the China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world’s largest import trade fair, in Shanghai.\n\nTowe said the Marie system could reduce total treatment costs by 50 per cent compared with existing therapies. “We are able to make the machine 20 times smaller than conventional radiation [technology] in conventional proton therapies,” he said.\nParticle therapy, encompassing both the proton and carbon ion methods, allows doctors to increase the dose of radiation to a tumour while minimising the effects to surrounding healthy tissue.\nA typical methodology features computed tomography (CT) scanning, pencil beam scanning, robotic positioning system, constant radioscopic and fluoroscopic imaging, and positioning software to ensure treatment is delivered to the tumour. It can be used to treat cancers of the lung, breast, abdomen and other areas.\nMarie’s upright therapy system delivers radiotherapy by rotating the patient, which requires treatment rooms with about 30 square metres of area on a single floor, compared with the traditional three-floor, 120 square metres of space.\nAt present, a proton therapy normally requires 200 tonnes of equipment, and it takes about five years to complete construction. Leading players worldwide include Siemens and Hitachi.\nThere are more than 100 proton therapy centres in about 20 countries worldwide, mostly in the US.\nThe cost of proton therapy in China can exceed 500,000 yuan (US$70,158).\nAt present, less than 1 per cent of Chinese patients whose diseases could be treated by proton therapy had access to the technology, according to analysts.\n\nSince 2020, mainland China has reported more than 4 million new cancer cases annually. The country’s National Cancer Centre has been calling for coordinated action among different organisations to strengthen cancer prevention. Health authorities are also encouraging companies to pursue technological innovation to make cancer treatment affordable to the masses.\nThe annual six-day CIIE, which opened on Wednesday at the National Exhibition and Convention Centre, drew 4,108 companies from around the world, according to its organiser, the CIIE Bureau, a unit of the Ministry of Commerce.\nChina launched the CIIE in 2018 at the beginning of a trade war with the US during Donald Trump’s first presidency, hoping increasing purchases of foreign goods and services would help convince global partners of its commitment to free trade and market access.\nAt the CIIE this year, Fosun Pharmaceutical is also displaying its latest products in the treatment of immune-inflammatory disorders, central nervous system conditions, and kidney diseases.
