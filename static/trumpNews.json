But oil analysts say there are plenty of reasons fear has receded.\n\nThe price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for crude oil, fell 7.2% to $68.51 percent per barrel on Monday after Iran announced a missile attack on Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which the U.S. military uses. \n\nTraders were relieved because Iran said it had matched the number of bombs dropped by the U.S. on Iranian nuclear sites this weekend, a possible sign of a desire to de-escalate the conflict.\n\nOn Monday evening, Trump claimed that Israel and Iran agreed to “a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,” in a Truth Social post. Israel and Iran did not immediately respond or confirm following the president’s post. \n\nMarkets were initially nervous as oil futures opened for trading Sunday. \n\nThe price of Brent crude jumped 4 percent as traders anxiously watched the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway on Iran's southern border that legislators in Tehran were demanding be closed in retaliation. That would have hit the global economy very hard because much of the world’s crude and liquefied gas passes through it. \n\nThe drop in oil Monday brings the price back to where it was before fighting between Iran and Israel began over a week ago, when a barrel of U.S. crude was just above $68.\n\nThat's good news for Trump, who wants the Federal Reserve to stop worrying about inflation and start cutting interest rates. It's also good for motorists this summer if the trend holds.\n\nDrivers were already paying higher prices at the pump before the U.S. attack. The average price nationwide is $3.18 per gallon, according to GasBuddy surveys, about 10 cents more than two weeks ago.","summary":"The price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for crude oil, fell 7.2 percent to $68.51 per barrel on Monday","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/oil-prices-iran-us-strike-b2775577.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/24/0/57/GettyImages-2221044900.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/C6nq6tzY-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-24 01:04:00","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.369},{"id":334494218,"title":"DAN HODGES: In a moment of crisis, spineless Keir Starmer is cowering. He is happy to keep his hands clean while his allies do the dirty work of keeping Iran in check... what an embarrassment","text":"Yesterday morning armed forces minister Luke Pollard appeared on LBC radio to present the Government’s view on the US strikes on Iran.\n\nUnfortunately for Pollard, his government didn’t have a view. ‘Are we opposing the action?’ Nick Ferrari asked him not once, but seven times. ‘Um...morning…um...er…let’s be absolutely clear...’ Pollard stammered.\n\nBut he wasn’t clear at all. ‘That’s not one for me to comment on,’ was the closest he came to expressing an opinion on the bombing.\n\nTo be fair to Pollard, at least he had the courage to put himself in the firing line. Unlike his Prime Minister.\n\nOver the past week Keir Starmer has stood accused of naivety, vacillation, denial and outright incompetence as he’s floundered around, desperately trying – and failing – to keep ahead of events in the Middle East. But this morning he is facing another, even more serious, charge. Rank, craven, cowardice.\n\nEver since US bunker buster bombs slammed into Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, the stance Sir Keir has adopted on behalf of the United Kingdom has been morally, diplomatically and politically bankrupt. Actually, that may be over-generous, given he hasn’t actually managed to adopt a stance of any clarity at all.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the strikes, Starmer issued a statement. ‘Iran’s nuclear programme is a grave threat to international security,’ he declared. ‘Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat.’\n\nOn the surface, it looked as if the Prime Minister had finally come off the fence and was backing his allies. But then his aides began circulating, pointing out his words didn’t contain any actual endorsement at all.\n\nThey were simply an acknowledgment of the facts on the ground. British forces and bases had not been involved, they emphasised.\n\nSo this is Starmer’s position. Or non-position. The British Government believes Iran did actually have an active nuclear programme. \n\nThe British Government’s policy is that Iran cannot be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon. The British Government recognises servicemen of our closest ally have risked their lives neutralising that threat, protecting British lives and interests in the process.\n\nBut, under orders from its Prime Minister, that government is now going to wash its hands of them.\n\nTo paraphrase Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, Keir Starmer has decided to rise and sleep under the blanket of the freedom his allies provide, then turn his back on them because of the manner in which they’re providing it.\n\n‘This is the dirty work Israel is doing for all of us,’ German Chancellor Friedrich Merz admitted last week. The US can now be added to that list. But Keir Starmer is going to do whatever it takes to keep his own precious hands clean.\n\nEven if that involves hiding behind the skirts of his own colleagues. Over the past few days Westminster has been awash with the highly convenient rumour that those fragrant Prime Ministerial palms have also been tied by the legal advice proffered by his Attorney General Lord Hermer. \n\nLast week Ministers were confidently asserting Starmer would do nothing that could place him on the wrong side of international law.\n\nBut now those same Ministers are refusing even to say whether they believe the US action was legal or not. With the effect Sir Keir is no longer just hiding behind Hermer’s skirt, he’s clambered into his laundry basket, and vowed not to come out until the coast is clear.\n\nIn reality, the Government gave de-facto legal legitimacy to the US action the moment it confirmed Iran’s WMD programme was real and active. \n\nCoupled with Iran’s flagrant breaches of its non-proliferation obligations, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recognition of its accelerating Uranium enrichment and Tehran’s ongoing regional destabilisation of the region via its proxies and terror groups, the case for action was sound.\n\nYesterday, some Starmer allies had abandoned the pretence there was any moral basis to his stance, and instead pointed to the raw politics. ‘My constituents don’t want us getting into any more foreign wars,’ one told me. ‘And if Keir keeps us out of this one he’ll get credit for it.’\n\nBut that’s a simplistic view of the wider political implications of the Prime Minister’s spinelessness. Within government there is alarm at the way Downing Street has been so utterly blindsided by recent events. \n\nAnd there is growing anger at the way Ministers are again being dispatched like the Light Brigade to defend policies and stances without any coherent line of defence.\n\nEven more significant is the way Starmer is increasingly allowing himself to be pushed around by the hard-Left of his party. And even more disgracefully, how he is now openly tailoring his Middle-East policy to try to appeal to his party’s fracturing Muslim base.\n\nIt was noticeable how his ambiguous response to the US strikes was positively Churchillian when compared to the pusillanimous equivocation he deployed after the initial Israeli attacks.\n\nAs if he was attempting to send the subliminal signal: ‘US bombs are tolerable, but Israeli bombs are beyond the pale.’\n\nIn the days ahead No 10 will attempt to present the Prime Minister’s obfuscation as part of some masterly diplomatic 3D chess. But his jelly-like irresolution will now begin to actively undermine his own stated foreign policy objectives.\n\nThis is the man who claims to want to construct a ‘Coalition of the willing’, to confront the existential threat to European peace posed by Vladimir Putin.\n\nBut who is now going to follow Keir Starmer up that treacherous hill? ‘Sorry, I know Putin is currently bombing you. But I’m just waiting on Lord Hermer’s legal advice before I send British troops to help. Hopefully he’ll be back after lunch.’\n\nPrecisely who is the past week’s flaccid statecraft meant to impress? Donald Trump, who clearly now views the Prime Minister as an annoying international second-cousin, not a key strategic partner? The Israelis, who now reportedly view him as an ‘unreliable ally’?\n\nSelf-evidently it hasn’t impressed the Iranians or their terror networks, hence yesterday’s urgent warning to British nationals in Qatar to shelter in place, just prior to Iran’s retaliatory missile strikes.\n\nOr the protesters who have taken to the streets, with their banners demanding we all stand with Iran and ‘on the right side of history’. It’s hardly going to impress our other global partners – and adversaries – who have been subject to the spectacle of Keir Starmer stumbling, fumbling and blundering as the Middle East exploded around him.\n\nMost importantly of all, it’s only a matter of time before the British people realise they have a Prime Minister whose instinct is to cower, not take a stand, when the moment of crisis comes. And how in that moment, if they seek a leader, they will need to look elsewhere.","summary":"Yesterday morning armed forces minister Luke Pollard appeared on LBC radio to present the Government's view on the US strikes on Iran.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14839953/DAN-HODGES-moment-crisis-spineless-Keir-Starmer-cowering-happy-hands-clean-allies-dirty-work-keeping-Iran-check-embarrassment.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/23/23/99652351-0-image-m-30_1750717327882.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 00:58:57","author":"Dan Hodges,Editor","authors":["Dan Hodges","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":334491164,"title":"Cobra Kai star Martin Kove kicked out of fan convention by police after BITING co-star Alicia Hannah-Kim","text":"Black Friday\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nCelebrity Big Brother\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Jun 24th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCobra Kai star Martin Kove kicked out of fan convention by police after BITING co-star Alicia Hannah-Kim\n\n Have YOU got a story?

PM Al Thani obtained Tehran's agreement during a phone call with Iranian officials, Reuters reported. Also Read | 'Reserves the Right To Respond Directly': Qatar on Iran's Retaliatory Action Against US at Al Udeid Air Base.\nThe conversation followed US President Donald Trump's communication with Qatar's Emir, in which Trump informed him that Israel had accepted the ceasefire proposal and requested Doha's assistance in convincing Tehran to agree to the deal, as reported by Reuters. The high-level discussion took place hours after Iran's missile strikes on US military installations in Qatar and Iraq earlier on Monday (local time). Also Read | Israel-Iran Conflict: Air India Express Diverts 2 Doha-Bound Flights Following Qatar Airspace Closure.\nSoon after these developments, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social that Israel and Iran had agreed to what he called as a \"complete and total\" ceasefire, stating that it would take effect in approximately six hours. \"CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!\" he wrote.\nAccording to Trump, Iran will initiate the ceasefire first, followed by Israel, resulting in a complete cessation of hostilities within the next 24 hours. He also urged both countries to remain \"peaceful and respectful\" during the overlapping ceasefire windows.\n\"Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL,\" he stated.\n\"On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, \"THE 12 DAY WAR.\" This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn't, and never will!,\" he said.\n\"God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!\" Trump added.\nThe conflict began on June 13 when Israel launched a massive airstrike on Iranian military and nuclear sites, codenamed \"Operation Rising Lion\". In retaliation, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) initiated a large-scale drone and missile campaign called 'Operation True Promise 3', targeting Israeli fighter jet fuel production facilities and energy supply centres.\nTensions escalated further after the US conducted precision airstrikes early Sunday morning on three key Iranian nuclear facilities under \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\"\nIran retaliated by launching multiple missiles at US military installations in Qatar and Iraq, including the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar--the largest US military base in the region, CNN reported.

I hope for a better world for my children. \n'They are 110 per cent my priority. I have to be there for them on their first day at school.'\nShe also spoke of her concern that younger generations are not interested in having children and insisted parenthood is always 'worth it', no matter how difficult the circumstances. \nShe said: 'I have heard a lot of young girls saying that it is too expensive to have children and they may not want them, and I have said, \"You will change your mind.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:01:41 BST, 24 June 2025 |Updated:01:54 BST, 24 June 2025 \n\nChloe Green and her famous family previously took up column inches with their headline-grabbing scandals and flashing their opulent lifestyle.\nWhile her billionaire father Philip is a well known businessman, the heiress, 34, first shot to prominence after appearing on E4 reality show Made In Chelsea.\nThe family were regularly spotted and splashed across newspaper pages on their $150million Lionheart superyacht every summer for years, in glamorous locations across the Mediterranean. \nTheir name is also synonymous with the British Home Stores (BHS) collapse, where Philip was blamed for a £500million pension hole in the company, before he agreed to put £363million of his own personal funds to cover the deficit.\nMeanwhile, Chloe's name hit the headlines when she began dating 'hot felon' Jeremy Meeks and received criticism for being linked to someone with a criminal past.\nHowever, since around 2022, the family have shunned red carpet appearances and stepped back from the spotlight and their regular yacht holidays - with their last sighting all together around a year ago.\n\nChloe Green and her famous family previously took up column inches with their headline-grabbing scandals and flashing their opulent lifestyle (pictured 2017)\n\nWhile Chloe, 35, who has now completely deleted her once very active Instagram account, was last spotted in June 2024, Philip was spotted showing off his slimline physique in the south of France last week (pictured)\n\nThe family were regularly spotted and splashed across newspaper pages on their $150million Lionheart superyacht in locations across the Mediterranean (pictured)\nWhile Chloe, 35, who has now completely deleted her once very active Instagram account, was last spotted in June 2024, Philip was spotted showing off his slimline physique in the south of France last week.\nSo what has happened to the family who were once at epicentre of British media and when did they shrink away from the spotlight?\nRise to fame\nChloe joined Made In Chelsea in 2011 as the girlfriend of long-standing cast member Ollie Locke, but the couple split just months after their romance began.\nHowever, her brief on-screen appearance was enough to attract public interest in her privileged lifestyle, which continued when the cameras stopped rolling.\nFollowing their split, she was also linked to singer Marc Anthony, the ex-husband of Jennifer Lopez, who was twice her age, and footballer Jermain Defoe. \nChloe left school at 16 and launched her first collection of shoes for Topshop - The Chloe Jade Green shoe range - at the age of 21.\n\nChloe joined Made In Chelsea in 2011 as the girlfriend of long-standing cast member Ollie Locke , but the couple split just months after their romance began\nIt was funded by the Green family and sold as a concession within the store. She said in 2013: 'Fashion has always been a huge part of my life and I have always wanted to join the family business.'\nHowever, in 2015 Tina announced that Chloe would be 'taking a year off', saying: 'Chloe's got other things to do. I'm sure she will start again, but there will be nothing this year.'\nThere was certainly no financial need: the Green fortune was reported to stand at around £4 billion, even after it was dipped into for the pension fund.\nLavish lifestyle \nChloe splashed snaps of her luxury life all over her Instagram page, as she documented lavish trips with her pals to exotic locations.\nDuring a period of uncertainty for the family, Chloe changed the settings on her Instagram account to private as BHS went bust and her father got the blame for the £571 million hole in the firm's pensions pot.\nHowever, once Sir Philip agreed to pay £363 million into the pension fund, and faster than you could say 'the unacceptable face of capitalism', Chloe had made her social media account public again.\n\nChloe splashed snaps of her luxury life all over her Instagram page, as she documented lavish trips with her pals to exotic locations\n\nDuring the time her social media was veiled, Chloe jetted to hotspots including Miami, New York, Verbier and Ibiza in an apparent year-long holiday\n\nChloe was a regular at showbiz parties and spent the summers living it up in St Tropez, where she pouted alongside models and millionaires\nDuring the time her social media was veiled, Chloe jetted to hotspots including Miami, New York, Verbier and Ibiza in an apparent year-long holiday.\nClearly keen to show off her country-hopping antics, Chloe flicked off her privacy settings for all of the world to watch her glamorous life unfold.\nChloe was a regular at showbiz parties and spent the summers living it up in St Tropez, where she pouted alongside models and millionaires.\nDespite her jetset lifestyle and her family's billionaire fortune, Chloe insisted she is 'super down to earth'. She told ELLE magazine: 'Everyone tells me that I'm very normal.\n'I'm not saying to my dad: \"Because we have a jet, can I borrow it and fly down to France?\"\n'If my dad says: \"Would you like the plane?\" then I'll say: \"Sure, if you don't mind.\" But if not, BA (British Airways) is fine.'\nControversial relationship with the 'hot felon'\nDuring 2017 period she began dating 'hot felon' Jeremy Meeks, who she had a highly publicised relationship with for two years.\nJeremy attracted the 'hot felon' nickname in 2014 after his police mugshot went viral following his arrest for firearms possession.\nThe couple met in Cannes in 2017 and reportedly became engaged in 2018. They welcomed a son named Jayden together in 2018.\nThe unlikely pairing between the billionaire heiress and the convicted criminal attracted a wealth of attention from the media and public.\nThey were regularly pictured out together as well on several envy-inducing trips together, including on Chloe's $150 million family yacht, Lionheart.\nThe relationship was met with a lot of criticism, particularly due to Jeremy's criminal record and his separation from his wife, Melissa, who he had two children with.\n\nDuring 2017 period she began dating 'hot felon' Jeremy Meeks, who she had a highly publicised relationship with for two years\nChloe felt the need to defend their romance online, sharing a selfie of the two of them together and revealing how happy they are together.\nThe Topshop heiress captioned the snap: 'Life is to short not to laugh and smile and that's all we do... @jmeeks official. #nohatejustlove #everyonedeservestobehappy.' [sic]\nPrior to this, Chloe had temporarily deleted her account after feeling the heat for publicly parading their romance when pictures of them kissing emerged.\nThey were pictured sharing an intimate kiss and snuggling up together as they waited to be taken back to their £112,000-a-week yacht in Bodrum.\nChloe and Jeremy's posts were flooded with negative comments and snake emojis, following the news that they had become romantically involved.\nWhile she reactivated her Instagram account at the time, Chloe no longer uses the photo-sharing platform and a link to her former handle @chloegreen5 shows that the page is no longer recognised.\nMoving on with Manuele Thiella \nChloe's most notable relationship since Jeremy is her romance and subsequent marriage to her husband Manuele Thiella.\nChloe and Manuele officially tied the knot in a low-key wedding on September 5, 2022, in the Mairie in Monte Carlo.\nThe discreet ceremony was attended by her immediate family as the venue only has capacity for 15 guests.\nIt is unknown how the TV personality's family celebrated, however, according to reports, there 'wasn't a big party'.\nChloe gave birth to their first child together, a girl, just days later, and wanted to 'get married before the baby arrived'.\nA source told Mail+: 'Chloe wanted to get married before the baby arrived. That was always the plan and they have now got married without any fuss or big party and are very happy.'\n\nChloe's most notable relationship since Jeremy is her romance and subsequent marriage to her husband Manuele Thiella (pictured 2021)\nChloe revealed her pregnancy in June when she unveiled a baby bump for the first time while on holiday in St Tropez.\nShe unveiled her previous pregnancy in a similar way in 2018, showing off her first bump as she enjoyed a day on her father's superyacht in Monaco.\nChloe and Manuele were revealed as a couple in 2020 - after they were spotted abroad.\nWhen she initially began seeing the businessman, a source told MailOnline: 'Chloe has known Manuele for months and they have always been very close friends.\n'They have a lot in common; they're both parents and are from similar worlds, Chloe is very happy with him. He's very much been accepted into her family.'\nManuele is the CEO of company Royal Yacht Brokers, which boasts celebrity clients such as Madonna, Chrissy Teigen and Alicia Vikander.\n\nSir Philip and his wife Tina began laying low after the collapse of Arcadia Group, which fell into administration in 2020 at the cost of more than 700 jobs and 162 store closures, plus a £500million-plus pension scheme deficit.\nSir Philip was spotted in May 2022 on a yacht off Antibes - a popular hub for celebrities at this time of the year thanks to the Cannes Film Festival - but before that had not been pictured in public for months.\nOne of his last appearances before this was in October 2021, when he was seen snarling at photographers outside Harry's Bar, an exclusive London club.\nHe was understood to have been on a brief visit to Britain, in part to have dental treatment. The mogul was accompanied by Tina, who was in the explosive Pandora Papers about offshore tax havens.\n\nSir Philip and his wife Tina began laying low after the collapse of Arcadia Group, which fell into administration in 2020 at the cost of more than 700 jobs and 162 store closures, plus a £500million-plus pension scheme deficit (pictured Philip, Tina, Brandon and Chloe)\n\nThe Greens previously sold BHS for £1 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell, who was last year sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion over the 2015 sale\nThe leaked documents appeared to show that she bought four multi-million-pound properties while BHS – the department store she once owned with her husband – teetered on the brink of collapse.\nArcadia's assets, including the luxury furnishings of Sir Philip's boardroom, are being sold, the Topshop brand was acquired by online retailer Asos, and Ikea oved into the Oxford Street building following its £378 million sale. Arcadia also oversaw the chains Dorothy Perkins, Burton and Miss Selfridge.\nThe Greens previously sold BHS for £1 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell, who was last year sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion over the 2015 sale.\nThe chain collapsed the following year, and MPs subsequently dubbed Sir Philip 'the unacceptable face of capitalism' over the affair.\nDespite the fall of the one-time high street retail king, the Greens are still worth £910 million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List, and continue to enjoy the trappings of their wealth.\nRecent appearances\nSir Philip displayed his noticeably slimmed down frame as he soaked up the sun at the Hotel Eden Roc on the French Riviera last week.\nThe Topshop founder cut a casual figure in a white T-shirt and a pair of blue patterned shorts as he enjoyed a day at the beach.\nThe businessman looked relaxed and carefree as he enjoyed the trappings of his still vast fortune.\n\nPrior to this, he was joined a year earlier by his daughter Chloe and his wife Tina onboard their family yacht in St Barts (pictured)\n\n Sir Philip Green, 73, displays his slimmed down frame as he soaks up the sun at the Hotel Eden Roc in France \nPhilip was seen alongside Elliot Grange, the CEO of Atlantic Music Group and the husband of Lionel Richie's daughter Sophia.\nPrior to this, he was joined a year earlier by his daughter Chloe and his wife Tina onboard their family yacht in St Barts.\nEx-Topshop tycoon Philip - who is worth $1billion - was enjoying the trappings of his vast fortune as he climbed aboard after driving a smaller boat to the yacht. \nHe looked casual in a light blue shirt and shorts as he made the most of his time in the sunshine.\nChloe's husband Manuele Thiella didn't appear to be with them on the day out and they were last seen together last July in Greece.\nTheir intermittent appearances are a far cry from the days where they graced the red carpet together as a family and Chloe publicly posted her life online.\nSir Philip and his daughter previously proudly posed together at prestigious events including the British Fashion Awards (2015) and GQ Men Of The Year Awards (2014).\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJust where have the Greens gone?

Despite U.S. strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites and President Donald Trump’s earlier call that “now is the time for peace,” a ceasefire was only announced after nearly 12 days of conflict, with Trump declaring an agreement between both nations to end hostilities. Meanwhile, many of Iran’s proxies in the region have been notably quiet, including multiple Iran-backed militias in Iraq that have declared their neutrality. Immediately after the initial Israeli airstrikes, Iraqi Shiite leader Muqtada al-Sadr posted a statement on X calling on Iraqis “not to be drawn into this war, as it is not their war, and Iraq does not need more wars.” The Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an Iraqi-based militia group originally established by Iran to combat the Islamic State (IS) group, canceled its 11th-anniversary celebrations in solidarity with the Iranian military commanders killed in the Israeli airstrike on Tehran. But the PMF has made no announced intention of taking military action against Israel, or of using its drones in Iraq to target Israel. Iraq’s top Shiite cleric, Ali al-Sistani, who 11 years ago called for the creation of the PMF and for jihad against IS, released a statement calling on the international community “to stop the Israeli aggression against Iran,” but made no call for any military operations against Israel. Similarly, the Iraqi Hezbollah movement declared its “solidarity with the Iranian people” and offered condolences to Iran’s supreme leader for the deaths of Iranian military leaders. However, it also refrained from mentioning any intention to engage in retaliatory military actions against Israel. Several Iranian-established Shiite militias in Iraq have remained silent on the Israeli attacks. None of their leaders have spoken out or called for retaliation against Israel in solidarity with Iran. Since 2003, Iran has established more than 100 militias and armed factions in Iraq, with unofficial estimates placing their total numbers at over half a million. Of these, 147,000 fighters are part of the PMF, which comprises 67 Shiite factions and militias. Iran also maintains several military bases in Iraq. The largest is in the Jurf Al Sakhar area, around 35 miles south of Baghdad. Spanning ​​approximately 100 square miles, it serves as the headquarters for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Quds Force. This area includes vast farmland that has been used as military bases to hide Iranian weapons and training centers. The IRGC also operates bases in Iraq’s western Anbar province, near the Syrian border. These bases were previously used to supply the Syrian regime and Iranian-backed militias in Syria with weapons and fighters. Of the hundreds of Iranian-backed militias in the region, only Yemen’s Houthis have continued to launch attacks against Israel, using ballistic missiles and drones supplied by Iran. Despite the silence of Iraq’s militias and their apparent unwillingness to fight on behalf of Iran against Israel or the United States, several missiles and drones were launched toward U.S. bases in Iraq last week. “Several drones were shot down near the Ain al-Asad base, where U.S. forces are stationed in western Iraq,” an Iraqi military source, speaking anonymously, said. He continued: “We will not allow Iraq to become a battleground for conflict between any other countries, and we will not interfere in any regional conflict.” Haider al-Abed, a political activist close to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said: “We will not allow a return to 2003 or 2006. We are following the instructions of our leader. This war is not our war, and we cannot defend anyone else.” “We cannot engage in any military action. We respond to any internal military aggression, but we will not participate in any external wars,” he said. “This is what the religious leaders call for, and we abide by what they say.” Shiite politician Safaa al-Asadi said that Iraq must not be used as a base for any military operations. “Iraq even objected to Israel’s use of Iraqi airspace to bomb Iran,” he said. “We are a peaceful country and will not interfere, nor will we allow any armed faction to carry out any military operations against any other country.” The Shiite militias may be choosing neutrality in an attempt to avoid the fate of Hezbollah and other groups that have been wiped out by Israel. “These militias have significant economic interests, and they want to survive and remain in power,” Muwaffaq Khattab, an Iraqi political analyst, said. “We don’t even rule out the possibility of them giving up their weapons, if necessary, and their soldiers, in order to remain in power and control economic resources.” Recognizing Israel’s intention to eliminate the threat from Iran and its proxies, the militias in Iraq have decided to wait out the storm, he added. Iranian political analyst Hassan Yasiri described the militias’ inaction as treason. He insisted that Iran could defend itself from threats without the militias’ support but condemned the groups for their lack of “courage and heroism.” “Unfortunately, this is the Arabs’ response after all the support Iran has provided them to preserve the Shiite sect in their countries,” he said. “They did not deserve Iranian support,” he continued. “If it weren’t for Iran, these people would have been killed by ISIS or other terrorist groups. … Now they are very passive in this war.” The story is written by Hudhaifa Ebrahim and reprinted with permission from The Media Line.

The agreement was mediated by Trump during a phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nTrump implied that the parties would be given time to finish their ongoing operations, after which the ceasefire would take effect gradually.\n“If all proceeds as planned—and it will—I want to commend both Israel and Iran for their strength, wisdom, and determination in ending what can now be known as ‘THE 12 DAY WAR,’” Trump posted on Truth Social.\nTrump's Ceasefire Announcement\nTrump Announced it through his official Truth Social handle and wrote, \"CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED! Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World.

Israel issued two evacuation alerts within a span of two hours for neighborhoods in Tehran, once late Monday and again early Tuesday.\nIsrael’s Army Radio also reported that air raid sirens were triggered in the southern Golan Heights over concerns of enemy aircraft. Earlier Monday, Trump said he would urge Israel to pursue peace, downplaying Iran’s missile strike on a U.S. air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for its prior warning.\nIran’s attack was a response to U.S. B-2 bombers dropping 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend, joining Israel’s air offensive during this 12-day conflict. Most of Tehran’s population—around 10 million people—has fled due to the bombing campaign.\nWhile Washington insists its strikes targeted only Iran’s nuclear facilities and did not intend to spark a broader war, Trump posted Sunday that the goal could also include removing Iran’s clerical leadership, in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nIsrael, on the other hand, made it clear that their attacks on sites like Evin prison and other strategic locations in Tehran aimed to cripple Iran’s ruling establishment and its grip on power.","summary":"&lt;p&gt;US President Donald Trump announced that a &quot;complete and total&quot; ceasefire had been reached between Israel and Iran, aiming to bring an end to the 12-day-long conflict, shortly after both countries had issued fresh threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Iranian official confirmed Tehran had consented to the truce, though there was no immediate statement from Israel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;According to a senior White House source, Israel agreed to the ceasefire on the condition that Iran halts further attacks.

At the time of writing fierce fighting was still taking place in Iraq with US bases being hit by unidentified assailants, bases located in Qatar had recently been bombed by Iran, and Tehran officials were warning of expected Israeli attacks. Earlier on Monday, the stakes were only heightened as Iran hit back following Donald Trump's assertion that the US executed a \"very successful\" airstrike on three nuclear sites in Iran during the weekend. The initial attack by Israel on Tehran took place on June 13, forming part of an extensive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, prompting ongoing reciprocal bombardments.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slumped $2.7, or 3.94%, to $65.46 per barrel, having hit its weakest level since June 9 earlier in the session and falling around 6%. Trump announced on Monday that Israel and Iran have fully agreed to a ceasefire, adding that Iran will begin the ceasefire immediately, followed by Israel after 12 hours. If both sides maintain peace, the war will officially end after 24 hours, concluding a 12-day conflict.

Iran is OPEC's third-largest crude producer, and the easing of tensions would allow it to export more oil and prevent supply disruptions, a major factor in oil prices jumping in recent days. Both the oil contracts settled over 7% lower in the previous session after rallying to five-month-highs after the U.S. attacked Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend, stoking fears of a broadening in the Israel-Iran conflict. \"Technically, the overnight sell-off reinforces a layer of resistance between approximately $78.40 (October 2024 and June 2025 highs) and $80.77 (the year-to-date high), and it's clear that it will take something extremely unexpected and detrimental to supply for crude oil to break through this layer of resistance,\" Sycamore added.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onoil pricesiran israel warisrael iran ceasefiretrumpcrude prices\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

I do worry it will collapse.' \nAnother claimed the development is not 'waterproof' and floods are 'routine in the basement, the electrical room and in some apartments', while the stairwells and balcony railings are 'already suffering from corrosion'.\nStephens & Stephens consists of husband and wife Paul and Helen Stephenson. \nSBP crisis management, which handles press relations for the developer, said the company has already been in touch with Cliff Edge's Residents Action Group, adding 'the ball is very much in their court'.\nA local survey of residents living in the building has been carried out, with further comments posted to Stephensandstephensfactcheck.co.uk on problems they have been facing.\nOne said: 'Two years after buying, many residents have extensive lists of outstanding issues that have yet to be addressed.\n'These include missing breakfast bars, cracked showers, significant roof leaks, malfunctioning appliances, balcony rails that have slipped down and defective flooring.'\nAnother added: 'The non stop leaks in the basement look like they have caused serious damage and Stephens and Stephens don't care. I have been lied to over and over and over again.'\n\nThose living there say conditions have got so bad that the dream has turned into a nightmare, with fears over its structural integrity and a basement that floods every time it rains\n\nProblems have got so severe, according to owners, that a website has now been set up to warn any potential buyers against investing in Cliff Edge\n\nThe buildings were quickly snapped up by owners seduced by the stunning seafront location\nOther complaints pointed out the 'poor quality of fixtures and fittings', the 'poor infrastructure, as well as the developers' alleged 'failure to acknowledge or deal with defects' to the buildings.\nOne angry owner said: 'There have been leaks throughout the building since day one that the developers have attempted to cover up and play down.\n'The apartment isn't what we bought based on the plans we bought from.'\nAnother resident claimed the building was 'not complying with fire and building regulations' and described it as having 'major structural and waterproofing defects'.\nOne infuriated home-owner added: 'On the surface, Stephens & Stephens spend a lot of effort on their brand and design, which we completely fell in love with.\n'But sadly it's a facade for a company that simply lacks care, takes shortcuts and leaves a trail of destruction.'\nAnd on the website, one resident said: 'Do not make this mistake as you will end up with unsafe and worthless property.\n'This decision will make your life a misery and you will have a lot of sleepless nights.'\n\nOne resident claimed the development is not 'waterproof' and floods are 'routine in the basement, the electrical room and in some apartments'\n\nLocals have spent three years battling issues with the properties, built by developer Stephens & Stephens\nSam Beilin from SBP crisis management added: 'There are works that need to be dealt with within the development some of which are the developer's responsibility and some of which fall to ongoing estate management.\n'We recently exchanged correspondence with the Residents Action Group and to which we await a response. \n'The reality here is that the managing agents are unable to do much because the residents have not paid their service charges which includes building insurance and warranty fees.\n'We are not building surveyors so we cannot comment on the works about which the residents complain.\n'However, the complaint over apartment design is a contractual matter in respect of which they need to take legal advice.\n'Additionally, there is nothing that we can do about the price they paid, as you know property prices go up and down and they would have had the chance to inspect and survey their apartments to confirm quality, before they completed their purchase.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFurious residents of luxury cliffside apartments left 'scared their homes could collapse' amid newbuild nightmare\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

In the wake of the U.S. attacks against the Iranian nuclear program, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a memo Sunday warning of a “heightened threat environment” in light of the attacks, warning that Iranian government affiliates could launch terrorist attacks.\n\n“The likelihood of violent extremists in the Homeland independently mobilizing to violence in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership issued a religious ruling calling for retaliatory violence against targets in the Homeland,” the memo read. “Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to U.S.-based individuals plotting additional attacks.” (RELATED: ‘Is Iran Gonna Go To The Moon?’: Marco Rubio Fires Back At CBS Host Over Her Claim About Nuke Program)\n\nTrump announced a ceasefire agreement on Truth Social Monday evening between Iran and Israel, set to go into effect at approximately 12:00 a.m. EST, which would mark an end to the ongoing twelve day conflict assuming it holds. While Iran may have indicated it is no longer interested in continuing the war in the short-term with the agreement, the regime has a considerable history of pursuing violent plots on American soil.\n\nIn 2011, two men linked to the Iranian government were charged in a plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador on American soil. One co-conspirator, Gholam Shakuri, was involved in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qods Force, a key cog of Tehran’s state-sponsored terror machine.\n\nMore recently in 2024, suspected Iranian asset Farhad Shakeri was arrested in connection to an alleged plot to surveil and murder an Iranian dissident with U.S. citizenship, as well as potentially targeting Trump himself. The attack was allegedly intended to be revenge for Trump’s decision to eliminate IRGC Qods Force Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020.\n\nAn Iranian Intelligence operative, Majid Dastjani Farahani, was suspected by law enforcement officials of trying to target key former Trump administration officials in March 2024, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nIranian novelist Salman Rushdie, the author of a book that some Islamic religious authorities found blasphemous and the subject of an Iranian fatwa, was stabbed in 2022 by a man with ties to Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy.\n\nSimone Ledeen, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that Iranian networks are a cause for major concern given their history of activity in the U.S., especially after the strikes that hammered Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend.\n\n“I think there is a real threat and it should be taken seriously,” Ledeen told the DCNF. “We have U.S. citizens and U.S. military, those are all potential targets for these sleeper cells. But I would also take a step back and look at the attempted murders that the Iranian regime has undertaken in the last decade or so.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netayahu has claimed that Iran attempted to assassinate Trump twice, but did not elaborate on the incidents to which he was referring. Trump said in February that he left “instructions” if he is assassinated by Iran, and that there would be “nothing left” of the Islamic Republic in the event that Tehran orchestrates his assassination, according to The Associated Press.\n\nLax border enforcement under former President Joe Biden allowed hundreds of Iranian nationals to enter the U.S. without much or any vetting, raising concerns that individuals on missions from Tehran could still be present in the U.S. The Biden administration apprehended 1,504 Iranian nationals at the southern border, releasing 729 into the U.S. between fiscal years 2021 to 2024.\n\n“I’m sure the FBI is all over it, but they can’t always be everywhere, so people should feel alert,” Ledeen told the DCNF.\n\nThe U.S. dropped a number of bunker buster bombs on three Iranian nuclear sites in a daring attack on Saturday night, with initial damage assessments reportedly showing considerable damage to the Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan sites in central Iran. In response, Tehran has considered blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping vein for the global oil supply.\n\nIran also launched a missile attack against a U.S. air base in Qatar Monday, with no rockets landing on target or any casualties reported.

As I say again, monitor Smarttraveller and stay in touch closely with your airline.”\n\n“This is a really, really dangerous situation.”\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said Australia did not want any further escalation.\n\n“Australia condemns Iran’s strikes on US bases in Qatar and Iraq,” she said.\n\n“We do not want to see further escalation. A full-scale war in the Middle East would be devastating for the people of the region and the world.”\n\nTrump mocks Iran’s ‘weak response’\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear in social media posts that he does not intend to retaliate to the “very weak response”.\n\n“CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!,” he said and even thanked Iranians for “giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured”.\n\n“Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same.”\n\nIran’s conduct in warning the US that the missiles were en route mirrors the 2020 attack on US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the US assassination of senior general Qassem Soleimani.\n\nIraq was given advance warning of the strikes, the Americans were ready just as they were this time to protect US personnel at Al Udeid.\n\nTravel warnings for Australians\n\nNevertheless, Australia has issued clear warnings about travel in the region.\n\n“I’ve indicated publicly this morning that I have asked my department to consider if there’s any alteration to travel advice more broadly,” Senator Wong said.\n\nWarnings for Iran, Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories, and Iraq state: “We continue to advise Australians not travel to (these countries) due to the volatile security situation and the risk it could deteriorate with little notice.”\n\n“(Airports) could close without warning, and you may be unable to leave for an extended period,” the warnings read.\n\n“The Australian government may not be able to assist you to leave.”\n\nLiberals urge Australia to ‘stand with the US’.\n\nLiberal leader Sussan Leader has urged the

weapons.\n\n“Noting reports that President Trump may be seeking meetings with IP4 nations including Australia at NATO, we continue to urge Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to attend.\n\n“Now is a time for Australia to stand with the United States and Anthony Albanese should be taking every opportunity to do so.”\n\nMr Albanese has been under fire for not unequivocally backing the US strikes on Iran on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister confirmed Australia did not support the strikes to shutdown Iran’s nuclear capabilities but stressed the attacks were “unilateral” that is America acted

trucks lined up at Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility before US air strikes","text":"The images, released by US defence contractor Maxar Technologies, captured more than a dozen cargo-style trucks lined up outside the Fordow nuclear enrichment site’s tunnel entrance on Thursday and Friday, The New York Post reported.\n\nThe vehicles, which came and went over a 24-hour stretch, appeared to move unidentified contents roughly half a mile (804 metres) away, The Free Press reported, citing US officials. \n\nFollow our live coverage of the conflict here\n\nUS and Israeli intelligence officials were aware of the movement at the time but opted not to act so they could track where the trucks headed and await President Donald Trump’s order to carry out the strikes, the officials said. \n\nMr Trump gave the green light to launch 75 precision-guided munitions, including bunker-buster bombs and more than two dozen Tomahawk missiles, against Fordow and two other Iranian nuclear sites early on Sunday. \n\nIranian state media outlets have since claimed that the Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz sites were evacuated in the lead up to the strikes. \n\nIran hasn’t officially disclosed how much damage was sustained in the attack but White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted on Monday the Trump administration was “confident” that Tehran’s nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated”. \n\n“We have a high degree of confidence that where those strikes took place is where Iran’s enriched uranium was stored,” she told ABC News. \n\n“The President wouldn’t have launched the strikes if we weren’t confident in that.\n\n“So the operation was a resounding success and administration officials agree with that, as well as Israel.” \n\nMr Trump, for his part, hailed the strikes as a “Bullseye!!!”. \n\nSatellite imagery appeared to show that the strikes had severely damaged – or destroyed – the Forlow plant and possibly the uranium-enriching centrifuges it housed. \n\n“Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran,” the President said in a Truth Social post. \n\n“The biggest damage took place far below ground level. Bullseye!!!”\n\nStill, US defence officials have said they are working to determine just how much damage the strikes did as speculation mounted that Iran could have shifted uranium from the underground military complex. \n\n“I wish the Israelis had moved quicker to disable Fordow,” David Albright, a former United Nations weapons instructor, told The Free Press in the wake of the attacks. \n\n“It’s still a mystery exactly what was in those trucks. But any highly enriched uranium at Fordow was likely gone before the attack.” \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC’s Meet the Press that he doubts Iran was able to move anything prior to the attacks but acknowledged “no one will know for sure for days”. \n\n“I doubt they moved it,” he said. \n\n“They can’t move anything right now inside of Iran. I mean, the minute a truck starts driving somewhere, the Israelis have seen it, and they’ve targeted it and taken it out.” \n\nHe added that US officials believe a significant amount of Iran’s stockpile of 60 per cent uranium had been located in the Isfahan facility when it was targeted.\n\n“Our assessment is we have to assume that that’s a lot of 60 per cent enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there is Isfahan,” Mr Rubio said. \n\nMr Rubio didn’t specifically mention Fordow or Natanz but said Iran should now bring its stockpile “out of the ground and turn it over”. \n\n“That really is the key,” he said. “Multiple countries around the world will take it and down blend it. That’s what they should do with that.” \n\nMs Leavitt, meanwhile, dismissed Iran’s threat of retaliation – insisting the US and the world were safer thanks to the President’s attack. \n\n“Just to be clear, yes, this strike on Saturday did make our homeland safer because it took away Iran’s ability to create a nuclear bomb,” she told ABC News. \n\n“This is a regime that threatens death to America and death to Israel. And they no longer have the capability to build this nuclear weapon and threaten the world. So (it’s) not just the United States that’s a safer place, but also the entire globe.” \n\nThis article was originally published on The New York Post and was reproduced with permission","summary":"Satellite images appeared to show scores of trucks lined up at Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility just days before the US carried out its large-scale air strikes.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/satellite-images-show-trucks-lined-up-at-irans-fordow-nuclear-facility-before-us-air-strikes/news-story/4aa80102365af90753b5ad8269a084ea?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/032c40673587ad8588ebf4d36b8e06da","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 00:35:34","author":"Emily Crane","authors":["Emily Crane"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":334488234,"title":"‘Pandora’s box’: Russia warns of ‘nuclear disaster’ after US bombs Iran","text":"The Russian President on Monday met with Tehran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, following Donald Trump’s announcement on Saturday that the US military had carried out massive strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Esfahan — marking the first ever US attacks on Iranian territory.\n\nRussia, which is a crucial backer of Iran, did not announce any concrete support at Monday’s meeting. \n\nMoscow so far has condemned the US-Israeli attacks on Iran, but has not swung forcefully behind its partner.\n\n“This absolutely unprovoked aggression against Iran is unjustified,” Mr Putin said in televised remarks to Mr Araghchi at the start of their meeting.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed the exchange after the talks by saying “they were unlikely to be effective” during such a “heated moment”.\n\nMr Araghchi later said the meeting was “very good” and that Russia’s stance on the issue remained “firm”, noting its role in the UN Security Council. He did not provide further details on the talks with the Russian leader.\n\nRussia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said revealing details of the Putin-Araghchi meeting would have been “irresponsible” and that Russia and Iran were working on “many directions” when asked if Tehran requested military aid from Russia.\n\nIt came after Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia delivered an ominous warning.\n\n“Through their actions, the US has opened a Pandora’s box,” Mr Nebenzia told an emergency meeting on Sunday.\n\n“No one knows what new catastrophes and suffering it will bring. Unless we stop the escalation, the Middle East will find itself on the verge of a large-scale conflict with unpredictable consequences for the entire international security system, plus the entire world might end up on the verge of a nuclear disaster.”\n\nSince Israel launched its wave of strikes on June 13, triggering Iran to respond with missiles and drones, Russia has not publicly offered military help to Tehran.\n\nRussia was “making efforts to help the Iranian people”, Mr Putin said in the Monday meeting, without elaborating.\n\nAsked what specific support Russia might offer, Mr Peskov told reporters, “It all depends on what Iran needs. We have offered our mediation services.”\n\nMr Putin has pitched himself as a mediator between Iran and Israel, an idea rejected by Mr Trump last week.\n\nMr Peskov also said the strikes on Iran would not affect bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington — with the Kremlin seeking a rapprochement with the US since Mr Trump returned to power — saying they were “different issues”.\n\nRussia had called on the US not to take military action against its ally — with Moscow-Tehran ties massively boosted during Russia’s Ukraine offensive — and speculation has grown about how the Kremlin would react.\n\nNikita Smagin, an independent expert on Russia-Iran relations, said Mr Araghchi was likely to have delivered a plea for military aid on behalf of the Iranian leadership.\n\n“I don’t think that the head of the Iranian foreign ministry rushed to Moscow just to exchange concerns on the American strike,” he told AFP in a comment.\n\nMr Smagin speculated that Russia — caught up in its more than three-year Ukraine offensive — would rather distance itself from the Israel-Iran conflict and try to reap short-term benefits, such as higher oil prices and advancing in Ukraine while the West’s focus is on the Middle East.\n\nOn Monday evening, local time, Iran launched what it called its “mighty and victorious” response to US air strikes on its nuclear sites.\n\nIran’s Revolutionary Guard said “Operation Besharat al-Faith” saw missiles fired at the US’ Al Udeid air base in Qatar. It is the US’ largest air base in the region.\n\nThe skies across Qatar’s capital Doha — familiar to many Australians who fly through on the way to Europe — were streaked with antimissile interceptors and explosions.\n\nQatar said it brought down every missile. Both the US and Qatar have said there was no damage to the base and no injuries.\n\nWriting on his Truth Social platform on Monday evening, Mr Trump said Iran had “officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.\n\n“I am pleased to report that NO Americans were harmed, and hardly any damage was done,” he wrote.\n\n“Most importantly, they’ve gotten it all out of their ‘system,’ and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE. I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”\n\nA short time later, the US President announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a “complete and total” ceasefire.\n\n“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” he wrote.\n\n“This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!

Because while we have obliterated the Iranian nuclear program, our hope and our expectation is that they’re not going to try and rebuild that program and I think that’s what the President is really trying to figure out here.”Mr Vance said Mr Trump “has been extremely clear about America’s national objective here, it is to create a world where Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon”.“We of course, destroyed the nuclear program that they had and the President told the entire team we are going to work to make sure that they don’t try and rebuild that nuclear capability in the future.”Israel and Iran are yet to confirm the ceasefire.11:43 PMJun 23, 2025 HIGHLIGHT Qatar airspace reopens after missile attackBrielle BurnsQatar has reopened its airspace after it was briefly shut over Iran’s missile attack on a US air base, the country’s civil aviation authority announced.“The Authority commends the great cooperation shown by all partners and the efforts of all state entities to ensure the safety and security of aviation in Qatari airspace,” it said in a statement.Qatar Airways has also confirmed the reinstatement of flights following the reopening of the airspace.“We are working tirelessly with government stakeholders and the relevant authorities to restore operations as quickly as possible,” it said in a statement.“The safety of our passengers and crew is the first and highest priority at all times.”Read more here.Qatar Airways confirms reinstatement of flights as airspace reopens in the State of Qatar.Our focus at this time is to help our passengers return home or reach their onward journey safely and smoothly.Weâ€™ve deployed extra ground staff at Hamad International Airport to supportâ€¦â€” Qatar Airways (@qatarairways) June 23, 2025\n\n11:38 PMJun 23, 2025 HIGHLIGHT 'Stop fighting': UN Chief condemns Iranian strikesBrielle BurnsUN chief Antonio Guterres has condemned Iran’s attack against a US base in Qatar, urging all nations involved to “stop fighting”. “From the outset of the crisis, the Secretary-General has repeatedly condemned any military escalation in this conflict, including today’s attack by Iran on the territory of Qatar,” a spokesperson for the Secretary-General said in a statement.“He further reiterates his call on all parties to stop fighting.”Mr Guterres urged Member States to uphold their obligations under the UN Charter and other rules of international law.11:32 PMJun 23, 2025'Calibrated': Nations respond to Iran's strike on US baseBrielle BurnsGermany has reacted to Iran’s retaliatory strikes on a US base, calling the attack “calibrated” and expressing hope that Tehran and Washington will enter talks to avoid further conflict.Speaking to Germany’s ARD broadcaster, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Iran’s attack was “to be condemned,” but that it was “not so strong or so uncontrolled that an escalation must follow”.“(Iran) is showing in an indirect way a certain readiness” for negotiations, he said.“At this stage we can only repeat our demand to Iran to be ready for talks.”Mr Wadephul added the attack was a “calibrated answer” to the earlier US strikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites and said he was “pleased that the American president has reacted in such a measured way”.

They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering.\n\nThe judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith’s wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman’s actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith’s death.\n\nWalls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head.\n\nOn Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband — an encounter captured on the officer's body camera.\n\n“Erin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,” said David P. Weber, one of her attorneys.\n\nWalls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is “absolutely ridiculous.”\n\n“No crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,” he said. “I'm just stunned.”\n\nAfter the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of “finality.”\n\n“You guys settle, you can move on with your lives,” the judge said.\n\nWalls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as “shocking.”\n\n“We're talking about a three-second event,” he told the judge.\n\n“It's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds,” Reyes replied.\n\nJeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot and killed himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide. \n\nThe police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he killed himself. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters’ Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the “sole and direct cause of his death,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nWalls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack.\n\nMore than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood, a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack.\n\nErin Smith's quest isn't over. She applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Trump announces Israel-Iran ceasefire","text":"Vice President JD Vance said the United States achieved its objective in destroying Iran’s nuclear program, moments after President Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that Israel and Iran had agreed to a \"complete and total ceasefire.\" Vance told \"Special Report\" Monday that he had left the White House before Trump broke the news of a ceasefire but had been aware of its developments prior to coming on air. \"First of all, the president, without, knock on wood, having a single American casualty, obliterated the Iranian nuclear program.

Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,\" he said. PENTAGON FLEXES US MILITARY'S DECOYS AND STRATEGIC DECEPTION THAT TOOK IRAN AND WORLD BY SURPRISE The United States struck Iran’s Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites Saturday evening as part of Operation Midnight Hammer, dropping 14 GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators against two target areas, Fordow and Natanz. More than two dozen Tomahawk missiles were launched at Isfahan from a U.S. submarine. \"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. Caine told reporters that the mission involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, dozens of air refueling tankers, a guided missile submarine and more. Vance told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that the United States will work to make sure Iran doesn’t try to rebuild its nuclear capability in the future after the strikes. \"Look, this is a great thing. For Israel, think about this: they've accomplished an important military objective. They've helped us destroy the Iranian nuclear program. They've also destroyed the conventional missile capability of Iran that threatened the country of Israel. For the Iranians, I think this is a new opportunity to actually pursue the path of peace. As I said yesterday, what the Iranians have showed through their support of terror networks, through their now failed effort to build a nuclear weapon, is that they're just not very good at war,\" he said. \"And I think the president really hit the reset button and said, look, let's actually produce long-term peace for the region. That's always been his goal. I actually think when we look back, we will say the 12-day war was an important reset moment for the entire region.\" Trump elaborated on the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, writing that it would go into effect in about six hours, when the two nations \"have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!\" STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUES WORLDWIDE CAUTION FOR US TRAVELERS FOLLOWING TRUMP'S IRAN STRIKES The ceasefire news comes just hours after Iran fired at least 14 missiles at the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in retaliation for the U.S. strikes.

Iran will begin the truce, followed by Israel 12 hours later, culminating in a formal cessation of hostilities after 24 hours.According to Trump, Iran will initiate the ceasefire, followed by Israel 12 hours later, with a formal conclusion to hostilities 24 hours from the initial agreement.“CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYONE! It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.“Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World.

God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!” he concluded.Shortly after Trump’s announcement, a senior Iranian official confirmed to Reuters that Tehran has agreed to the US-proposed, Qatar-mediated ceasefire. The official noted that Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani played a key role in brokering the deal through a call with Iranian officials.According to sources familiar with the negotiations and Trump, Iran provided prior warning to the US before the strike on its air bases in Qatar and Iraq, and no injuries were reported.The mediation effort reportedly began after Trump contacted Qatar’s Emir, informing him that Israel had agreed to a ceasefire and asking for Doha’s help in bringing Iran on board. Qatar, maintaining close ties with Tehran, facilitated swift communication that led to the agreement.Trump praised both sides for stepping back from the brink, suggesting the situation could have spiraled into a regional catastrophe.“This is a War that could have gone on for years, and destroyed the entire Middle East, but it didn’t, and never will!”He applauded the leaders of both nations for showing what he described as “Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence” to end the conflict.A couple of hours before the ceasefire announcement, Trump had posted calling for global peace. “CONGRATULATIONS WORLD, IT’S TIME FOR PEACE!,” the US President wrote.Earlier, after the attacks on the US base, Trump downplayed Iran’s missile strike, calling it a “very weak response.” He said that no American personnel were harmed and said it reflected Iran’s willingness to de-escalate.His comments came after a weekend of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, further fueling fears of a broader war.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump negotiates peaceIran Israel relationsceasefireTrump Truth Social announcementQatari mediationMiddle East conflictIran missile striketrump\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Following the development, Trump informed Qatar’s emir that Israel had agreed to the ceasefire as well.\n\nDespite the announcement, the situation on the ground remained tense.

Who has power of declaration?","text":"WASHINGTON — Before he ordered strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, President Donald Trump did not seek permission from Congress, to which the U.S. Constitution grants the sole power to declare war. Many Democrats and even some Republicans say that the attack was tantamount to a declaration of war and that Trump acted illegally.\n\nSeveral Trump aides say they disagree, calling the strike a limited action aimed solely at Iran’s nuclear capabilities that does not meet the definition of war. “This is not a war against Iran,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nVice President JD Vance argued that Trump had “clear authority to act to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.”\n\nHowever, later Sunday, Trump wrote online that his military aims could be much more expansive: “If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!”\n\nCriticisms of the attack, which came less than two weeks after Israel began its bombing campaign against Iran, include Trump not giving American policymakers, lawmakers and the public enough time to debate a role in a conflict that experts warn could expand quickly if Iran retaliates.\n\nThe furor over the sudden strikes follows years of bipartisan efforts in Congress to try to place greater limits on a president’s ability to order military action, efforts that arose because of disastrous American wars in the Middle East and Central Asia.\n\nSo is the United States at war with Iran? And did Trump have the authority to order his attack without consulting Congress?\n\n What does the U.S. Constitution say about war? \n\nArticle I, Section 8 of the Constitution assigns Congress dozens of powers like collecting taxes and creating post offices, as well as the power to “declare war” and to “raise and support armies.”\n\nThe American framers considered that clause a crucial check on presidential power, according to an essay by the law professors Michael D. Ramsey and Stephen I. Vladeck for the National Constitution Center. Early in American history, Congress approved even limited conflicts, including frontier clashes with Native American tribes.\n\nBut the question is complicated by Article II of the Constitution, which delineates the powers of the president, and which designates the U.S. leader as the “commander in chief” of the U.S. military.\n\nPresidents of both parties, relying heavily on legal opinions written by executive-branch lawyers, have cited that language to justify military action without congressional involvement.\n\n What are members of Congress saying about the U.S. strikes? \n\nDemocrats have almost uniformly criticized Trump for acting without legislative consent, and a few Republicans have as well.\n\n“His actions are a clear violation of our Constitution — ignoring the requirement that only the Congress has the authority to declare war,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said in a statement echoed by many of his colleagues.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told CBS News that there was no “imminent threat to the United States” from Iran.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said on the same CBS program that Congress must act this week to assert a role in any further U.S. military action.\n\n“Would we think it was war if Iran bombed a U.S. nuclear facility? Of course we would,” Kaine said. “This is the U.S. jumping into a war of choice at Donald Trump’s urging, without any compelling national security interests for the United States to act in this way, particularly without a debate and vote in Congress.”\n\nSome Democrats say Trump has already gone unforgivably far. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called Saturday night for Trump’s impeachment.\n\nHawkish Republicans rejected such talk. “He had all the authority he needs under the Constitution,” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC News on Sunday. Graham cited Trump’s power as commander in chief under Article II of the Constitution.\n\n“Congress can declare war, or cut off funding. We can’t be the commander in chief. You can’t have 535 commander-in-chiefs,” Graham said, referring to the combined number of U.S. representatives and senators. “If you don’t like what the president does in terms of war, you can cut off the funding.”\n\n What are legal scholars saying? \n\nSeveral lawyers and scholars who have studied the international law of armed conflict say the United States is without a doubt at war with Iran for purposes of application of that law, and that Trump acted in violation of international conventions.\n\n“The short answer is that this is, in my view, illegal under both international law and U.S. domestic law,” said Oona Hathaway, a professor of international law at Yale Law School who has worked at the Defense Department.\n\nBrian Finucane, a former lawyer at the State Department, agreed that Trump needed to ask Congress for authorization beforehand. He also said “there is certainly a U.S. armed conflict with Iran, so the law of war applies.”\n\nOn Sunday, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, called the U.S. attack an “outrageous, grave and unprecedented violation” of international law and of the United Nations charter, which forbids U.N. members from violating the sovereignty of other members.\n\nAraghchi did not specifically say that his country is now at war with America. Finucane also said the United States violated the U.N. charter.\n\nRyan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who has also worked at the Defense Department, said “one important matter for both domestic law and especially international law is the issue of ‘imminence.’”\n\nThe Trump administration is justifying the U.S. attack by saying Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon was imminent, Goodman noted.\n\nBut “the law would require that the attack would be imminent,” he said, and “it is very hard to see how the administration can meet that test under even the most charitable legal assessment.”\n\nEven if one were to focus on the question of a nuclear bomb, U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran had not yet decided to make such a weapon, even though it had developed a large stockpile of the enriched uranium necessary for doing so.\n\n How often have presidents sought congressional approval for war? \n\nIn the decades since Congress declared war on Japan and Germany in 1941, U.S. presidents have repeatedly joined or started major conflicts without congressional consent.\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman sent U.S. forces into Korea. President Ronald Reagan ordered military action in Libya, Grenada and Lebanon; President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama; President Bill Clinton ordered the bombing of mostly Serbian targets in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War; President Barack Obama joined a 2011 NATO bombing campaign against the government of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and led a military campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq.\n\nObama broke with this trend in September 2013 when he decided against launching a planned strike against Syria without first seeking congressional authorization. The strike was unpopular in Congress, which never held a vote, and Obama did not act.\n\nPresident George W. Bush won separate congressional authorizations for the use of military force against Afghanistan and Iraq before ordering invasions of those countries in 2001 and 2003.\n\nIn the years since the al-Qaida attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, several presidents have also ordered countless airstrikes and special operations raids on foreign soil to kill accused terrorists. Those have largely relied on broad interpretations of the two authorizations for the use of military force that Congress granted the executive branch for the so-called war on terror.\n\nEmma Ashford, a scholar of U.S. foreign policy at the Stimson Center, said that in the post-9/11 wars, “some presidents have largely stopped asking permission at all.”\n\nIn January 2020, Trump chose not to consult Congress before ordering an airstrike that killed a senior Iranian military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, while he was visiting Iraq. Many members of Congress called that a clear act of war that was likely to begin wider hostilities. Iran responded by firing 27 missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq, inflicting traumatic brain injuries on about 100 U.S. troops. But the conflict did not expand further.\n\nLast year, President Joe Biden ordered U.S. airstrikes against the Houthi militia in Yemen without getting congressional permission, and Trump did the same this year.\n\n What happens next? \n\nRepublican leaders in the House and Senate have signaled support for the strike, but Democrats and a few Republicans are demanding that Congress approve any further military action.\n\nKaine, who serves on the committees on armed services and foreign relations, introduced a Senate resolution last week requiring that Trump get explicit congressional approval before taking military action against Iran.

But she is still playing her Woodsies set.'\nPink Pantheress found fame on TikTok and has had a top 10 in the UK singles and album charts, respectively, as well as being nominated for three Brit Awards.\nThe Pink Pantheress' news comes after some of the UK's biggest politcal leaders demanded another act to be pulled from the festival lineup. \nThe Prime Minister has called for Kneecap to be dropped from Glastonbury after one of the band members was charged with a terror offence. \nFollowing similar calls from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, Sir Keir Starmer said it was 'not appropriate' for the Irish rappers to perform at the festival. \n\nShe will instead grace the Woodies Stage at 7.30pm on Friday and Roza Terenzi will from 10.30 instead\nLiam Og O hAnnaidh, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, is accused of displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah, while saying 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah' at a gig in November last year. \nThe 27-year-old appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday morning following the alleged incident at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London. \nIn an interview with The Sun, Sir Keir was asked if he thought the trio should perform at Glastonbury, to which he replied: 'No, I don't, and I think we need to come down really clearly on this.\n'This is about the threats that shouldn't be made, I won't say too much because there's a court case on, but I don't think that's appropriate.'\nIt comes after Conservative Party leader Ms Badenoch said she thought the BBC 'should not be showing' Kneecap's performance at the festival.\nMs Badenoch said in the X post, which was accompanied by an article from The Times that claimed the BBC had not banned the group: 'The BBC should not be showing Kneecap propaganda.\n\nThe Pink Pantheress' news comes after some of the UK's biggest politcal leaders demanded another act to be pulled from the festival\n\n(From left) Kneecap band members Mo Chara, JJ O'Dochartaigh and Moglai Bap at the Irish Film and Television Academy (Ifta) Awards at the Dublin Royal Convention Centre in February\n'One Kneecap band member is currently on bail, charged under the Terrorism Act.\n'As a publicly funded platform, the BBC should not be rewarding extremism.'\nMs Badenoch has previously called for the group to be banned from Glastonbury, and last year Kneecap won a discrimination case against the UK Government after she tried to refuse them a £14,250 funding award. \nKneecap took aim at Ms Badenoch in their latest single, The Recap, which was released just before their headline set at London's Wide Awake festival in May. \nThe song mocked the politician's attempts to block their arts funding and the Conservative Party's election loss.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrit popstar's Glastonbury gig is cancelled and last minute replacement is revealed\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

A lot of people were dying and it was only going to get worse. It would have brought the whole Middle East down,” he said.\n\nMr Trump said he thinks the ceasefire is “unlimited” and is “going to go forever” – adding: “I don’t believe they will ever be shooting at each other again.”\n\nJust hours earlier, people in the Qatari capital Doha had stopped and gazed up at the sky as Iranian missiles flew to the American al Udeid base and interceptors fired.\n\nOfficials said there were no casualties, and the US later confirmed it had been warned about the attack by Iran.\n\nMr Trump was in the Situation Room in the White House as the strikes took place.\n\nHe later claimed on his social network that the missiles were a “very weak response”, which the US “expected” and “very effectively countered”.\n\nThe Iranian attack came after the US dropped “bunker buster bombs” on three key nuclear sites in Iran over the weekend.\n\nIn a new interview on Fox News, US Vice President JD Vance claimed Iran is no longer able to build nuclear weapons after the American attacks.\n\n“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” he said. “Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it.”","summary":"A &#8220;complete and total ceasefire&#8221; has been agreed between Israel and Iran, according to Donald Trump.

Ministers are maintaining that preventing Iran getting a nuclear weapon was the right thing to do, without endorsing military action.\n\nIn the Commons, Mr Lammy said the UK did not have any legal advice from Attorney General Lord Hermer. That is despite claims the peer had cautioned that Britain should only be involved in defensive operations.\n\nHe also confirmed America did not request to use the Diego Garcia base as a staging post for the strikes. ‘They did not seek that advice,’ he said. \n\nMr Lammy said the situation ‘represents serious risk to British assets in the region’, telling Tehran: ‘We are prepared to defend our personnel.’\n\nHe argued that military action could not be a permanent solution because Iran had the expertise to enrich uranium.\n\n‘That knowledge is not lost… it is the stepping stone to a nuclear weapon,’ he said. \n\nEarlier, No10 denied Keir Starmer has been made to look a ‘chump’ by Mr Trump over the Iran crisis.\n\nThe PM and president spoke last night after the US strikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites. But Downing Street’s readout notably did not include any reference to the ‘de-escalation’ Sir Keir has been urging in other statements.\n\nInstead the leaders apparently agreed Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and should return to negotiations. \n\nSoon after the call Mr Trump took to social media suggesting regime change – swiping that it could be time to ‘Make Iran Great Again’.\n\nThe stance raises fresh questions about Sir Keir’s influence and the health of the Special Relationship. After meeting Mr Trump in person at the G7 in Canada last week, the premier had insisted he did not believe the US would go ahead with the attacks.\n\nIn other developments today:\n\nThe first 63 Brits have been airlifted out of Israel, as citizens in Qatar were urged to take shelter; \nMr Lammy said he was ‘confident’ the US was not seeking ‘regime change’ despite Mr Trump’s remarks; \nIran is threatening to shut the crucial Strait of Hormuz, with alarm that could cause a spike in the price of oil;\nThe UK and other US allies are braced for potential retaliation attacks by Iran, which has flagged ‘heavy consequences’;\nRussia has warned that Mr Trump could have opened ‘Pandora’s Box’ in the Middle East; \nQuestions have been raised over whether Mr Trump will attend a Nato summit in Brussels starting tomorrow evening. \n\nMinisters again refused to say explicitly this morning whether Britain supported the action taken by the US. \n\nChallenged at a briefing that Sir Keir was being made to look silly, the PM’s spokesman said the leaders had ‘an excellent relationship’.\n\n‘My answer to that is he acknowledges that it is a very fast-moving situation, he has an excellent relationship with President Trump, as detailed at the G7 last week when the President spoke about the strength of that relationship, but it is a fast-moving situation,’ the spokesman said.\n\n‘The Prime Minister has been consistent that de-escalation and diplomacy for him is the order of the day.’\n\nAmerica did not ask to use the Diego Garcia base for the bombing raid, amid speculation that Attorney General Lord Hermer had advised UK participation would be illegal.\n\nMr Trump took to his Truth Social site in the early hours this morning to post satellite images that he claimed showed Iranian nuclear facilities were ‘obliterated’.\n\nHe said: ‘It’s not politically correct to use the term, ”Regime Change,” but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!’\n\nAsked about Mr Trump’s posts, Mr Lammy said: ‘There will be further tweets on many issues over the next three-and-a-half years of Donald Trump’s leadership that you will be discussing… the rhetoric is strong but actually I can tell you, having spoken to the Secretary of State, having sat in the White House, that this is targeted action to deal with Iran’s nuclear capability.’\n\nHe added: ‘I’m very conscious that when I met colleagues in the White House on Thursday that they were considering all of the options… we knew that, you knew that as journalists. And Donald Trump made a decision to act to degrade that capability. It may well have set back Iran by several years. That was a decision that he took.’\n\nPressed on the legitimacy of the strikes, Mr Lammy said: ‘Well, we weren’t involved, it’s for the Americans to discuss those issues.’ \n\nIn a readout of the call after B-2 stealth bombers and a salvo of submarine-launched missiles hit Iran’s nuclear facilities, Downing Street said: ‘The leaders discussed the situation in the Middle East and reiterated the grave risk posed by Iran’s nuclear programme to international security.\n\n‘They discussed the actions taken by the United States last night to reduce the threat and agreed that Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n‘They discussed the need for Iran to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and to make progress on a lasting settlement.\n\n‘They agreed to stay in close contact in the coming days.’\n\nEarlier, Sir Keir said there was a ‘risk of escalation’.\n\n‘That’s a risk to the region. It’s a risk beyond the region, and that’s why all our focus has been on de-escalating, getting people back around to negotiate what is a very real threat in relation to the nuclear programme,’ he said.\n\nThere are fears British forces could be dragged into the conflict if Ayatollah Ali Khamenei orders a retaliation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at his Chequers country retreat, Sir Keir would not be drawn on whether Nato’s mutual defence pact would apply if US forces were targeted.\n\nThe PM said ‘we have taken all necessary measures to protect UK interests, UK personnel and to work with our allies to protect their interests as well’.\n\nExtra RAF Typhoon jets have already been moved to the region and Defence Secretary John Healey said ‘force protection is at its highest level’ following the US strikes.\n\nOn a day of intense diplomatic activity, Sir Keir also held calls with the Sultan of Oman, the King of Jordan, Canada’s Mark Carney and European counterparts Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz.\n\nMinisters from the E3 – the UK, France and Germany – had been involved in talks with Iran as recently as Friday as European allies sought to avoid further escalation in the Middle East.\n\nIn a joint statement with the French president and German chancellor, Sir Keir said: ‘We urge Iran not to take any further action that could destabilise the region.’\n\nMr Lammy spoke to his Iranian and Israeli counterparts ‘to stress the need for de-escalation’.\n\n‘I urged a diplomatic, negotiated solution to end this crisis,’ he said.\n\nThe Foreign Office dismissed as ‘inaccurate’ a report by Iran’s IRNA news agency that Mr Lammy ‘expressed regret’ over the US strikes.\n\nMr Lammy also spoke to US secretary of state Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of Egypt and Cyprus.\n\nTouring broadcast studios today ahead of making a statement to MPs later, the Foreign Secretary said it would be a ‘catastrophic mistake’ for Tehran to fire at US bases in the region.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: It would be a mistake to blockade the Strait of Hormuz.’\n\nMr Lammy said he thinks his Iranian counterpart ‘gets that and understands that’.\n\n‘Let’s take the diplomatic off-ramp. Let’s get serious and calm this thing down,’ he said.\n\nKemi Badenoch accused ministers of having no ‘moral clarity’ over the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nSpeaking at a Policy Exchange event in central London, the Conservative leader said: ‘With regards to the Government, I think there is a complete absence of moral clarity and, in fact, moral courage.\n\n‘They are repeating the sort of standard lines that are written by officials, which are designed to not upset anybody and not give any views or any information: ‘we want to see a de-escalation’, just sort of ‘motherhood and apple pie’.\n\n‘I do think it is quite extraordinary the position they found themselves in where the Foreign Secretary is unable to say whether or not he believes that the action was lawful. It’s a completely preposterous situation, because if there’s a counter-attack from Iran, they will probably come out and say that it is lawful. They clearly don’t think it’s lawful, because if they did, they would have come out and said so.’\n\nMrs Badenoch also hit out at Lord Hermer’s ‘pronouncements’ over the legality of strikes on Iran, adding: ‘I found watching him just quite illuminating in terms of understanding what kind of Government it is that we have. It is legal fetishism, I think is probably a good way to describe it.’\n\nShe added: ‘Whereas we know that the rule of law does not mean that a particular law is in and of itself good or bad, they’re unable to talk about the morality of things and the fact that it looks like they are in this position because of what Lord Hermer says, in my view, makes his position really untenable.’\n\nThe US attacked Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz which are linked to Iran’s nuclear programme.\n\nThe Tehran regime has insisted its nuclear programme is peaceful but its uranium enrichment process has gone far beyond what is required for power stations.\n\nAsked during a round of interviews this morning whether Britain endorsed the military action taken over the weekend, defence minister Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ‘That was a decision that the US has taken. Our focus has been on the diplomatic effort that is necessary to get a lasting peace.\n\n‘That’s why that’s been the focus of the Prime Minister’s actions over the last few days, it’s why the Defence Secretary, myself, the Foreign Secretary and the minister for the Middle East have been engaging in diplomatic activity in the region, because we need to make sure that there is a route to a lasting peace here.\n\n‘The way to do that is with a diplomatic solution that brings Iran back to the negotiating table.’\n\nIn contrast, shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said he backed the US action.\n\n‘We support what’s happened, and obviously now need to see what happens next. There is a big question about the Prime Minister’s position. It’s just not clear what he actually thinks of the attacks,’ he said.\n\n‘If you look at the language he’s talking about recognising the action has happened, that he’s spoken to the president, [but] does he actually support the actual military action?\n\n‘Because, let’s be clear, lots of people say, lots of politicians in this country, lots of our allies, quite rightly, and it’s important that they do. \n\n‘They recognise that Iran can’t be allowed to have a nuclear, a military nuclear program, but at the same time, it’s not clear what the action is that they would take to deal with that.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDavid Lammy ducked today on whether the UK supports US bombing of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: David Lammy Evades Question on UK Support for US Strikes on Iran, Citing Lack of Government Legal Advice first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/world-news/david-lammy-evades-question-on-uk-support-for-us-strikes-on-iran-citing-lack-of-government-legal-advice/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-David-Lammy-ducks-over-whether-UK-supports.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-24 00:03:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":334486674,"title":"Auburn's Bruce Pearl calls for Trump to get Nobel Peace Prize after announcing Israel-Iran ceasefire","text":"Auburn Tigers men’s basketball coach Bruce Pearl called for President Donald Trump to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize as Israel and Iran apparently agreed to a ceasefire.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n There was also no immediate comment from Iran. Iranian state media has no word on Tehran response.

And fair enough. Every day that rockets are not falling on Tel Aviv, and the lights stay on in Tehran, is a better day than the one before. War is cruel, expensive, and unpredictable.But let’s not deceive ourselves: the real news is not the ceasefire. The real news is the war — and how it ended. Not with an exhausted stalemate, not with a UN peacekeeping mission, and certainly not with European mediation. It ended because the United States, under the familiar leadership of a second-term Donald J. Trump, reminded the world what American power looks like when it is unapologetically deployed in defence of civilization..Let’s be blunt. Iran started this when it first aspired to nuclear weapons and declared its national objective to be the destruction of Israel. But the Iranian regime also misjudged the resolve of its enemies and the willingness of a newly re-elected Trump to back Israel with more than hashtags and hollow statements. Over the years, Tehran's proxies fired first — Hezbollah, Hamas and lately the Houthis. But it was Israel — and then, decisively, the United States — who fired last.We don’t yet know the full extent of the damage done to Iran’s military or nuclear infrastructure, but the fact of the ceasefire tells us what we need to know: it was enough. Iran blinked..This is no small thing. For years, Western leaders played a diplomatic shell game with Tehran, treating the regime like a misunderstood regional power rather than a theocratic bully with global ambitions. Under Obama, they showered it with cash and begged for compliance. Under Biden, they fell back into the same bad habits. Only Trump — love him or loathe him — said what needed saying and did what needed doing. And by the way, maybe we need to stop saying things like 'love him or loathe him' in order to obtain grudging permission to acknowledge the success of something he did. Iran will not have nuclear weapons; that's Trump's doing and for that, he deserves love undiluted by nervous condescension..So, Trump's ceasefire matters not merely because the war stops, but because it restores deterrence. Just as the leaders of the USSR did 40 years ago, the ayatollahs today know the price of aggression. And perhaps more importantly, so do their friends in Beijing and those in Moscow who have inherited the Soviet mantle.Israel, for its part, fought with characteristic resolve. It has no illusions about the nature of the Iranian threat. It never did. But what it lacked — until now — was the sense that its most important ally would have its back when the stakes were highest. That question has been answered.Of course, the usual suspects will now resume their miserable themes. The peace process crowd will reassert themselves. Pundits will question whether Trump’s unambiguous actions will provoke further escalation. (Although following the Iranian attack on an empty base in Qatar, by whom, and against whom now looks unobvious.) In Washington, the Democrats will try to persuade us that Trump ignored the 1973 War Powers Powers Resolution, that Congress should have approved his actions before he took them. Lawyers can debate that but since its passage, US presidents of both parties have paid it little heed. And the courts? Not a peep. And never one to miss a photo op, Democrat gadfly Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks there are grounds for impeachment..But let’s not miss the point. What Trump just demonstrated — again — is that peace comes from strength, not from wishful thinking. And that when you carry a big stick and are willing to use it, your enemies pay attention.So yes, congratulations are in order. To Israel, for defending itself without apology. To Iran, for having the sense to stop when it did. But most of all, to the United States — and yes, specifically to Trump — for still being ready to stand firm against the worst governments in the world. It always was, but for a while, we were starting to wonder.The ceasefire is welcome. So is the message it sends — that the West will no longer be pushed around by regimes that chant “Death to America” while enriching uranium. And that is what really matters.The war lasted 12 days. The implications will last much longer.","summary":"If former president Donald Trump is to be believed — and on matters of war and diplomacy, his record now speaks louder than his rhetoric — Israel and Iran have agreed to a “complete and total” ceasefire, to be staged in, once ongoing missions are concluded.","url":"https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/hannaford-so-ends-the-12-day-war/65630","image":"https://media.assettype.com/westernstandard/2025-06-23/9ac8jny0/Screen-Shot-2025-06-23-at-17.40.35.png?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 23:55:37","author":"Nigel Hannaford","authors":["Nigel Hannaford"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":334486476,"title":"U.S. urges Americans in Sweden to remain vigilant, citing threat of attack","text":"The U.S. embassy in Sweden said on Monday Americans in the country are \"advised to exercise increased caution\" due to local media reports on Iran potentially pressuring local criminal gangs to attack U.S. and Israeli interests.\n\nWashington struck Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend and Iran targeted a U.S. base in Qatar on Monday in retaliation.

Moscow continues to wage war against Ukraine with the support of North Korea, Iran, and China as well as Belarus,” he said.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to take part in today’s dinner and as Rutte put it, “there are other meetings scheduled for Zelensky at the summit,” even though the doors remain shut to the members-only working meeting on Wednesday.\n\nA relatively short summit statement has been drafted to ensure the meeting is not derailed by differences over details and wording\n\n“You will see important language about Ukraine, including connecting the defense spending up to 2035 to Ukraine, and the need for Ukraine to stay in the fight,” Rutte said. “This is a clear commitment by allies.”\n\nHe then announced: “And we have – I can announce that now – new estimates showing that our European and Canadian Allies have stepped up and have already pledged – where we originally would have been able to announce a 20 billion over the first three months of this year, it is now they will provide over 35 billion euros (about $40B) of additional security assistance to Ukraine for the year ahead.”\n\nThe NATO chief also highlighted that Ukraine’s path to eventual NATO membership was ensured, and warned that any Russian attack on NATO would prompt a “devastating” response.\n\n“There’s an irreversible path of Ukraine to NATO. That is still the truth today and it will still be true on Thursday after this summit,” Rutte emphasized.US President Donald Trump is expected to arrive in the Netherlands tonight. This will be his first NATO meeting since being re-elected.\n\nAs European allies hope to persuade Trump not to pull troops or US capabilities out of the continent – as he suggested in the past, - some members of the US delegation, including Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), co-chair of the Senate NATO observer group, stresses the significance of unity among the allies.\n\n“We need to send the message that the Transatlantic Alliance is still united, that we are not going to be divided,” she said during the Atlantic Council’s NATO Summit kick-off reception in The Hague.\n\n“We are not going to be divided by Vladimir Putin, by what’s happening in the Middle East, by what’s happening in Ukraine, and all of our allies need to understand that, and so do our adversaries,” Shaheen emphasized.\n\n“And as we’re thinking about the challenges that lie ahead,” she said.","summary":"Rutte: “The most significant and direct threat facing this Alliance remains Russian.
