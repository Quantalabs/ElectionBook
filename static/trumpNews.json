They’ve suffered under one of our country’s weakest ever prime ministers.\n\n“For so many Australians, aspiration has been replaced by anxiety. Optimism has turned to pessimism and national confidence changed to dispiritedness.”\n\nIn a broadside framing the Prime Minister as out of touch, Mr Dutton said a Liberal Government will be guided by the “views, values and vision of everyday Australians”,\n\n“Weak leaders create hard times, but strong leaders create better times and the next federal election is a sliding doors moment for our nation,” Mr Dutton said.\n\n“A returned Labor government — in majority or minority — will see setbacks set in stone.\n\n“A newly elected Coalition government is a last chance to reverse the decline.”\n\nAs part of the speech, Mr Dutton launched a booklet detailing the priorities of a Liberal Government, including reducing the migration cap to 140,000 places over two years, give Australians access to their superannuation to buy a new home, and restore the number of Medicare-subsidised psychologist visits from 10 to 20.\n\nThe strategy is similar to Mr Trump’s “Make America Great Again”, framing the billionaire former president as an outsider with a drive to overhaul the out of touch Washington establishment.\n\nMr Dutton’s choice of launch location — Victoria — will prove a electoral battleground for the Coalition, eager grow its share of seats from the 11 out of 38 in the State at the last election.\n\nThe party is hopeful of winning the seats of Chisholm, Aston, McEwen from the Government as well as Teal seats of Goldstein and Kooyong.\n\nAs part of the speech, Mr Dutton lashed out at the teal MPs, accusing them of being “Green Teals”, who had not shown their true colours to voters.\n\nPolling released last month showed the Coalition’s primary vote had climbed to 39 per cent in Victoria, while Labor had dropped to just 30 per cent.\n\nThe speech comes after Mr Albanese launched Labor’s re-election bid on Monday, with a cross country tour of northern Australia. Starting in Queensland, the Prime Minister spruiked the Government’s “Future Made in Australia” messaging.\n\nHis pre-campaign visit took him to the Northern Territory before culminating in two days in Western Australia, where Labor secured majority government in 2022.","summary":"Peter Dutton has taken a page from Donald Trump’s playbook, launching the Coalition’s election year with a pitch to ‘pessimistic’ Australians to get the country ‘back on track’.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/politics/peter-dutton/peter-dutton-vows-liberals-will-get-country-back-on-track-as-party-gears-up-for-federal-election-c-17361097","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17361097/37d8b01f7c047961aa25ac21432d66bd0517412d-16x9-x0y83w3481h1958.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 01:04:45","author":"Dylan Caporn","authors":["Dylan Caporn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.243},{"id":279976280,"title":"Ông Trump tiết lộ về cuộc gặp trong tương lai với ông Putin","text":"Ông Trump phản ứng khi bị tuyên án ngay trước lễ nhậm chức\n\n Tổng thống đắc cử Mỹ Donald Trump cho biết sẽ kháng án sau khi bị tuyên án không hình phạt trong vụ án chi tiề.n bịt miệng.\n\n Tổng thống đắc cử Mỹ Donald Trump (Ảnh: Getty).\n\n\"Sau khi chi hàng chục triệu USD, lãng phí nhiều năm làm việc đầy ám ảnh mà lẽ ra phải dành để bảo vệ người dân New York khỏi tội phạm bạo lực, tràn lan đang tàn phá thành phố và tiểu bang, chính quyền Biden - Harris phối hợp với Bộ Bất công đưa ra những cáo buộc hoàn toàn vô căn cứ, bất hợp pháp đối với tổng thống thứ 45 và 47\", Tổng thống đắc cử Donald Trump bình luận sau khi tòa tuyên án ngày 10/1.\n\nÔng Trump bình luận thêm: \"Trò chơi đã kết thúc. Chúng tôi sẽ kháng cáo và khôi phục niềm tin của người Mỹ vào hệ thống tư pháp vĩ đại một thời của chúng ta\".\n\nTại phiên tòa diễn ra ở New York ngày 10/1, ông Donald Trump đã bị tuyên án trong vụ chi tiề.n bịt miệng năm 2016.\n\nThẩm phán New York Juan Merchan tuyên án ông Trump \"được miễn hình phạt vô điều kiện\". Theo luật pháp tiểu bang New York, ông Trump sẽ không bị giam giữ, phạt tiề.n hay quản chế nhưng sẽ bị lưu hồ sơ là có tội.\n\n\"Tòa án đã xác định rằng, bản án hợp pháp duy nhất để đưa ra phán quyết kết tội mà không xâm phạm đến chức vụ cao nhất của đất nước là miễn hình phạt vô điều kiện\", thẩm phán Merchan nói, đồng thời nhấn mạnh việc ông Trump sắp nhậm chức tổng thống không thể xóa bỏ phán quyết \"có tội\" mà bồi thẩm đoàn đã đưa ra.\n\nVới bản án trên, ông Trump trở thành cựu tổng thống Mỹ đầu tiên bị truy tố hình sự và kết tội.\n\nÔng gọi đây là một trải nghiệm rất khủng khiếp và khẳng định mình hoàn toàn vô tội.\n\nÔng Trump sẽ tuyên thệ nhậm chức vào ngày 20/1 tới. Hiến pháp Mỹ không cấm những cá nhân bị kết tội tranh cử hay giữ chức tổng thống.\n\nFox News chỉ ra rằng bản án sẽ không hề ảnh hưởng đến khả năng và trách nhiệm của ông Trump trên cương vị tổng thống.\n\nTheo New York Times, việc miễn hình phạt vô điều kiện khác với có điều kiện, vốn yêu cầu người bị kết án phải đáp ứng một số điều kiện nhất định như trả tiề.n bồi thường. Tuy nhiên, trong trường hợp của ông Trump, sẽ không có yêu cầu nào như vậy. Điều này cho thấy tính khác biệt của bản án.\n\nÔng Trump ban đầu phải đối mặt với án treo hoặc lên tới 4 năm tù vì 34 trọng tội làm giả hồ sơ kinh doanh. Kể từ năm 2014, 1/3 số bị cáo bị kết án về tội danh tương tự ở Manhattan đã nhận mức án tù dưới một năm, mức án nghiêm trọng hơn hoặc được tha có điều kiện.\n\nNgoài vụ án làm giả hồ sơ kinh doanh, ông Trump còn phải đối mặt với những thách thức pháp lý khác. Một cuộc điều tra về nỗ lực của ông Trump và đội ngũ nhằm thách thức kết quả cuộc bầu cử tổng thống năm 2020 ở Georgia đang được tiến hành tại bang này.\n\nTuy nhiên, bất chấp mọi rắc rối pháp lý, Trump vẫn tiếp tục khẳng định mình là nạ.n nhâ.n của cuộc đàn áp có động cơ chính trị.","summary":"Tổng thống đắc cử Mỹ Donald Trump cho biết bản thân đang nỗ lực sắp xếp một cuộc gặp với Tổng thống Nga Vladimir Putin trong thời gian sớm nhất.","url":"https://vietgiaitri.com/ong-trump-tiet-lo-ve-cuoc-gap-trong-tuong-lai-voi-ong-putin-20250112i7358004/","image":"https://t.vietgiaitri.com/2025/1/4/ong-zelensky-ukraine-khong-co-y-dinh-chiem-giu-lanh-tho-kursk-cua-nga-600x432-169-7358004.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:55:50","author":"Thanh Thành","authors":["Thanh Thành"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"vn","sentiment":-0.813},{"id":279975032,"title":"Aerial assault aims to stem LA Palisades fire eastward spread","text":"Southern California Edison CEO Steven Powell told reporters there are now about 50,000 customers without power, \"down from over half a million just a couple days ago.\"\n\nPowell said there was no evidence that any of Edison's equipment caused the Hurst fire but that the investigation was continuing.\n\nAs state and local officials grappled with the worst cluster of fires in Los Angeles history, President Joe Biden spoke by phone with some of them to get an update on their efforts and he also was briefed by his senior aides on federal resources that were being dispatched.\n\nBiden’s major disaster declaration unlocked federal assistance for those affected by the wildfires, clearing the way for FEMA to provide support.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency officials, for example, were at the Pasadena Convention Center helping residents navigate FEMA aid applications.\n\nFEMA spokesperson Michael Hart said that support can range from funding to help with home repairs to money to replace lost food or medication.

He refused to rule out the use of force, but offered little specifics on how his government would convince Denmark to relinquish control over Greenland.\n\nCopenhagen is interested in avoiding a public clash with Trump, and has reached out to the incoming president’s team for clarification of his statements, the outlet said.\n\nThe Danish government made it clear that Greenland is not for sale, but also conveyed its willingness “to discuss any other US request regarding the island,” Axios said.\n\nAmerican forces have been stationed on the island since World War II. The US maintains a military base on Greenland, and has a defense agreement with Denmark, under which it can build additional military sites.\n\nGreenland played an important military role during the Cold War, hosting US ballistic missile early-warning infrastructure.\n\nTrump, who takes office on January 20, has said that the ownership of the island is an “absolute necessity” for American national security.\n\nBoth Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland’s pro-independence leader, Mute Egede, have ruled out selling the overseas territory to Trump. Earlier this week, Frederiksen said that she had pitched negotiations to Trump’s team, reaffirming that Copenhagen and Washington share the goal of “strengthening the security of the Western alliance.”\n\nEgede has stated that he is also ready to talk to the US president-elect. The island’s prime minister reaffirmed his committment to independence at a joint press conference with Frederiksen on Friday.\n\n“Greenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American,” he said. He added that Greenland will continue to work with the US.","summary":"Denmark has reportedly expressed readiness to discuss the increasing of US military presence on Greenland \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/610749-denmark-us-military-greenland/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.01/article/67830d1285f54037614873d2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:33:45","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":279974058,"title":"Trump unveils series of cabinet nominations as he prepares to take back White House","text":"Several former members of Donald Trump’s first administration have been tapped to fill key cabinet roles as he prepares to take back the White House this month, the president-elect announced in a series of Truth Social posts Saturday. \n\nTrump, 78, nominated Steven Bradbury to serve as deputy secretary of transportation; Katharine MacGregor – the vice president of environmental services at NextEra Energy — to serve as deputy secretary of the interior; and David Fotouhi as deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe incoming president also chose Paul R. Lawrence to serve as deputy secretary of Veteran Affairs; University of Chicago professor Casey B. Mulligan as chief counsel for advocacy at the US Small Business Administration; and Army veteran James Danly as deputy secretary of energy. \n\nBradbury, who served as the general counsel of the Department of Transportation during Trump’s first term, was credited by the 47th president for rebuilding “our crumbling infrastructure” and slashing regulations that were “killing jobs” and small businesses.\n\nMacGregor will return to the Department of Interior, where she served during Trump’s first four years as president. \n\n“She helped us in our quest to make our National Energy DOMINANT, and was also an integral part of the team that produced our Historic “Salute to America” at the National Mall,” Trump said.\n\nFotouhi, who worked at the EPA for the entirety of Trump’s first term, will return to the environmental agency to advance “pro GROWTH policies, unleash America’s Energy Dominance, and prioritize Clean Air, Clean Water, and Clean Soil for ALL Americans,” he said. \n\nTrump hailed Lawrence for his work during his first term, adding that his latest nominee will focus on taking care of veterans and ensuring they are treated with the “respect they deserve.”\n\n“Paul was a great VA Under Secretary of Benefits in my First Term, implementing Legislation I signed to improve the GI Bill and Appeals Modernization,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“Paul also helped us drive the claims backlog to its LOWEST LEVEL in VA History.”\n\nTrump praised Mulligan as a “fantastic economist” and a “highly respected expert on regulations that are crushing our Small Businesses.” He previously held the title of Chief Economist of Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers. \n\nDanly is a retired US Army officer, who served two tours in Iraq, where he earned the Bronze Star and Purple Heart, Trump said. \n\n“He served in my First Term as General Counsel, Commissioner, and Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where he won countless cases before the Federal Courts, and drove regulatory reform to ensure abundant and affordable energy for the American People,” the incoming commander in chief said.","summary":"All six nominees previously served President-elect Donald Trump during his first term in the White House.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/11/us-news/trump-unveils-latest-nominees-to-serve-in-second-administration/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/96560942.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:31:51","author":"Anna Young","authors":["Anna Young"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.499},{"id":279974654,"title":"Off-duty SAS man who heroically rescued dozens of hostages in Kenya terror attack hired by Trump as one of his elite personal bodyguards","text":"A former SAS soldier who heroically rescued dozens of hostages in a terrorist attack has been hired by incoming US President Donald Trump as one of his elite personal bodyguards.\n\nChristian Craighead was thanked by Mr Trump during his first term in office after he led an operation to save British and American hotel guests who were being held captive by jihadi group al-Shabaab in Kenya’s capital Nairobi.\n\nNow The Mail on Sunday can reveal he will be part of the security detail for Mr Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC on January 20, after the President-elect told aides that Mr Craighead’s ‘eagle eyes’ wouldn’t have missed a rooftop shooter during the failed assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania in July.\n\nMr Craighead, 48, is said to be ‘working in the shadows’ around Mr Trump and has been tasked with the key role of organising reconnaissance at locations where he is due to appear in public.\n\nA close family friend told the MoS: ‘Trump first reached out to Chris after the terror attack, telling him how much he admired his actions. They have kept in regular touch ever since. He’s also good friends with Trump’s son, Don Trump Jnr, and his former partner Kimberly Guilfoyle, having spent time with them in Miami.’\n\nWednesday marks the sixth anniversary of al-Shabaab’s attack on the DusitD2 hotel complex.\n\nMr Craighead – not his real name – had been posted to Nairobi to help train Kenya’s security forces in counter-terrorism. He was off-duty and out shopping when he was told hostages had been taken. He collected weapons from his truck and, according to fellow SAS veteran Chris Ryan, ‘organised the entire operation’.\n\nWhile 22 people died in the shootout, 27 emerged alive – some carried to safety by Mr Craighead after he killed two terrorists.\n\nFootage of his heroism went viral on news and social media outlets, and he was awarded the UK’s second-highest military honour – the Conspicuous Gallantry Award.\n\nBut his actions caused friction within the SAS, which prides itself on discretion. Mr Craighead quit the regiment shortly afterwards, claiming he had been shunned by comrades. His planned book on the attack, titled One Man In, was blocked by the Ministry of Defence.\n\nMr Craighead’s friendship with Mr Trump began when the then President invited him to the White House to offer thanks for his actions in Nairobi.\n\nIn May he introduced Mr Trump to thousands of supporters at a rally in New Jersey. Then, after the assassination attempt in July, Mr Trump, according to a family friend, ‘told his inner circle that Chris’s “eagle eyes” wouldn’t have missed the shooter’.\n\nThey added: ‘In October last year Trump personally requested a meeting and asked Chris to become one of his bodyguards.\n\n‘In December Chris accepted the role, after agreeing financial terms and sorting his US residency. Since then he has been working in the shadows around Trump, organising reconnaissance around his work diary, and will be alongside him when he is sworn into office on January 20.’\n\nLast year the MoS reported how Mr Craighead’s girlfriend, Tobi-Jayne Cadbury, 37, a scion of the chocolate family dynasty, had been bombarded with revenge-porn messages from the elite soldier’s ex, British Army dentist Major Jennifer Wilson, 42.\n\nWilson later pleaded guilty at Aylesbury Crown Court to harassment and malicious communications charges.\n\nShe was ordered to carry out 100 hours of community work and given a ten-year restraining order banning her from contacting her victims.\n\nMr Craighead was unavailable for comment last night.","summary":"Christian Craighead was thanked by Mr Trump during his first term in office after he led an operation to save British and American hotel guests who were being held captive in Nairobi, Kenya.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14274827/Off-duty-SAS-rescued-hostages-Kenya-Trump-bodyguard.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/12/00/94000753-0-image-m-67_1736641415724.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:26:46","author":"Editor,Nick Constable","authors":["Editor","Nick Constable"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.255},{"id":279973176,"title":"Max George reveals he made a heartbreaking decision while in hospital for emergency heart operation after fearing he'd die","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jan 12th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLA inferno surrounds celebrity-packed district as locals are TRAPPED in gridlock: Feds hunt for fire starters\n\nElon Musk and Dominic Cummings 'in plot to sabotage UK politics': Former No 10 adviser is helping orchestrate Tesla billionaire's attacks on Keir Starmer, government sources claim\n\nMy wife died in my arms after her GP dismissed her terminal cancer in an over-the-phone appointment and mistook her symptoms for a common illness\n\nOzempic didn't work for me because I kept making this big mistake.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy NIOMI HARRIS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:07 GMT, 12 January 2025 |Updated:00:19 GMT, 12 January 2025 \n\nMax George has revealed he made the heartbreaking decision to write a will after fearing he'd die while in hospital for an emergency heart operation.\nThe Wanted singer, 36, had a pacemaker fitted after being admitted to the hospital in December after experiencing issues with his heart.\nMax was released in time for Christmas and has been recovering at home with the support of girlfriend Maisie Smith, 23. \nIn a new interview, the performer opened up about the crippling fear he'd felt being on a ward surrounded by patients at least 30 years his senior, and told how he'd left instructions on his iPhone in case he didn't make it. \nHe told The Sun: 'That first night I wrote a will, I thought I was going to die. If I could go from being absolutely on top of the world to being told ‘the bottom part of your heart isn’t working’, I kept thinking in my head, ‘Well, what if the top half stops working overnight?’\nThe Glad You Came hitmaker told how being told he needed a pacemaker as the bottom half of his heart wasn't working properly made him realise what his 'responsibilities' were as he thought about the loved ones he'd be leaving behind if he passed.\n\nMax George has revealed he made the heartbreaking decision to write a will after fearing he'd die while in hospital for an emergency heart operation\n\nThe Wanted singer, 36, had a pacemaker fitted after being admitted to the hospital in December after experiencing issues with his heart\nRecalling that 'really scary' and sleepless first night in hospital, Max told how he was 'struggling to move' and battled a number of other symptoms including a tightness in his throat and having deep, slow breaths. \nTwo days after writing his will, Max was thrown into panic once again after his heart rate and blood pressure dropped, with the star admitting it was the 'worst day; during is hospital stay. \nHe shared: 'It was quite close that night, it really felt like my neck was closing up and that’s when the sort of panic really kicked in. I felt like I was dying. It was the worst, I felt emotional.'\nLuckily for Max, his pacemaker got fitted exactly a week after being admitted to hospital, with the singer conscious throughout the surgery, though heavily sedated.\nHe also remembered the 'grim' sight of the surgeon's hand covered in blood as he pulled his hands away, though he was also 'excited' at the thought of finally being on the mend.\nAfter recovering from the surgery, the All Time Low singer was delighted as the first person to greet him was Maisie, noting that it was at this moment he felt like 'a real person again' and 'had a heart'.\nHe said: I had a proper heartbeat by then as well. My heart rate started just shooting up. So I remember feeling my feet going tingly, because I think obviously the blood started to properly pump around. I was like, \"Holy s, I feel alive again,\" like it was a really nice feeling.'\nThough it was Maisie, who had left her panto duties and dashed up north to be by his side, it was actually Max's mother Babs who had 'saved my life' thanks to her quick-thinking.\n\nIn a new interview, the performer opened up about the crippling fear he'd felt being on a ward surrounded by patients at least 30 years his senior, and told how he'd left instructions on his iPhone in case he didn't make it \n\n' That first night I wrote a will, I thought I was going to die.

The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated , follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump’s White House win in November.\n\nAt issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nThe Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump’s co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.\n\nThe department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.\n\nBut prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.\n\nIn an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.\n\nThe appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump’s efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon’s injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.\n\nThe Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon’s order was “plainly erroneous.”\n\n“The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department,” the Justice Department said. “The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.”\n\nJustice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work, and it’s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.\n\nWilliam Barr, attorney general during Trump’s first term, released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.\n\nBiden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also released special counsel reports, including about Biden’s handling of classified information before Biden became president.","summary":"The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated, follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2025/01/special-counsel-jack-smith-has-resigned-after-submitting-his-trump-report-justice-department-says.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/QZOT452FCVHNHPWW5RZWR3MNLQ.jpg?auth=62194d8110cd3fce9c861f5497c0df670ceca25af55211bdf5ebe11d2cbf0bde&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:13:15","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":279975744,"title":"David Lammy flies to Saudi Arabia for talks on Syria’s future","text":"The Foreign Secretary has travelled to Saudi Arabia for talks on the future of Syria after the collapse of the Assad regime.\n\nDavid Lammy is set to offer UK expertise on humanitarian co-ordination during talks with Arab countries, European allies and the interim Syrian government in Riyadh on Sunday.\n\nThe talks come one month after the fall of Bashar Assad’s authoritarian regime, which left the country in the hands of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an organisation that is banned in the UK.\n\nBefore the visit, the Foreign Office said the Government was committed to a Syrian-led transition to create an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government, stressing the need to end ongoing hostilities in the north-east of the country and counter the threat posed by so-called Islamic State (IS) to UK national security.\n\nMr Lammy said: “The international community must come together to stand behind the people of Syria as they build a democratic future and a diverse and modern country.\n\n“We are united with our key partners from the region and beyond in ensuring the protection of civilians, access to aid and security within Syria and the wider region.\n\n“Syrians deserve a bright and prosperous future – we are here today to support that.”\n\nThe UK has already provided more than £60 million of aid since the fall of the Assad regime.\n\nWhile in Riyadh, Mr Lammy will also meet the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, for bilateral talks building on Sir Keir Starmer’s visit to the country in December.\n\nHis visit also follows calls from incoming US counter-terrorism chief Sebastian Gorka for countries to repatriate members of IS being held in Syrian prison camps.\n\nThe intervention by the adviser to Donald Trump reopened the conversation about the fate of Shamima Begum, who travelled to IS-held territory a decade ago aged 15 and was subsequently stripped of her British citizenship.\n\nBut Mr Lammy was adamant that Ms Begum “will not be coming back to the UK”.","summary":"The Foreign Secretary will offer UK assistance on humanitarian issues.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/david-lammy-syria-foreign-secretary-saudi-arabia-shamima-begum-b1204285.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/01/12/00/1e218727e28e5dde0c0655c1217f31f3Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM2NjkxNTQ4-2.78648347.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:01:00","author":"Christopher McKeon","authors":["Christopher McKeon"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.088},{"id":279974530,"title":"Anwar the statesman? Malaysia’s complex PM steps onto the world stage","text":"In the complex web of geopolitics, few figures embody the tension between ideals and pragmatism quite like Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.\nBold in his defence of the besieged Palestinians in Gaza, he has leaned on the insights and friendships gleaned from his decades in the crucible of Southeast Asian politics – including the years he spent behind bars – to inform his stance.\nBut the man once feted by Washington as Southeast Asia’s democracy champion now risks straining those carefully cultivated US ties through his advocacy for the victims of Israel’s 15-month bombardment.\nConcerns are mounting that his vocal support of the Palestinians may anger Donald Trump, the avowedly pro-Israel and famously transactional incoming US president. A senior Malaysian lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, recounted a meeting in which the US envoy in Kuala Lumpur candidly described Anwar’s Gaza stance as their “biggest problem” with his leadership.\n“That was the first thing they raised in our meeting,” the lawmaker said, encapsulating the tension brewing beneath the surface.\n\nAnwar, who leads Malaysia as it assumes this year’s chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has previously taken outgoing US President Joe Biden and European leaders to task over their perceived double standards on human rights and Gaza.\nClaiming a leadership role in a matter that resonates deeply across the Muslim world, Anwar has repeatedly met with Arab leaders – including at the Extraordinary Arab-Islamic Summit held in Riyadh in November, where he called for Islamic nations to build a consensus for suspending or expelling Israel from the United Nations.\n“What needs to be understood is, we do not recognise Israel in terms of diplomatic relations and do not allow them to conduct trade or official activities in Malaysia,” he said at the Apec summit in Lima, Peru, that same month.\nA UN special committee found last year that Israel’s warfare in Gaza was “consistent with the characteristics of genocide”, while the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nDespite this, Anwar’s commitment to the Palestinian cause has hurt his standing among Israel’s supporters, more so after his high-profile endorsement of Hamas leaders – including his meeting with the group’s political chief Ismail Haniyeh in May, two months before he was killed in Tehran.\nThe US has filed multiple formal requests demanding that Malaysia change its stance on Hamas, with Anwar telling parliament in October 2023 that the US State Department had summoned Malaysia’s envoy in Washington over the matter.\n\nReform to realpolitik\nOnce celebrated by the West as a beacon of reform in a region rife with autocracy, Anwar’s reputation has shifted dramatically since taking office. Former US vice-president Al Gore’s praise of his Reformasi movement in 1998 now feels like a distant memory.\nThe Malaysian prime minister’s close relationship with Turkey’s polarising leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has raised eyebrows – appearing to go against the liberal democratic ethos he once championed. Anwar even took a congratulatory call from Erdogan live on camera during his inaugural press conference in November 2022, in a symbolic gesture of their closeness.\nMore recently, his appointment of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra as a personal adviser on regional matters has drawn criticism – particularly from Anwar’s former mentor turned nemesis, Mahathir Mohamad, who said “other options” could have been considered.\nBoth Thaksin and ex-Cambodian leader Hun Sen, another candidate for the Asean advisory role, have faced allegations of authoritarianism and corruption, raising questions about how these associations align with Anwar’s commitment to democratic principles and clean governance.\nNeither were appropriate choices, even in light of the many threats Asean faces, according to Azmi Hassan, a political analyst at the Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research.\n\n“The appointment of divisive Asean leaders should be questioned,” he told This Week in Asia. “It would create more issues instead of resolving any. Malaysia alone is capable of manoeuvring as the chairman.”\nTwo years after ascending to Malaysia’s top office, Anwar’s ability to navigate these challenges will now be tested as he leads his country and Asean through a turbulent year marked by Trump’s return to the US presidency, the ongoing conflict in Myanmar and tensions in the South China Sea.\nHis success at forming a coalition government in the wake of the inconclusive 2022 elections – by uniting separatist factions from Sarawak and his former party, Umno – will put him in good stead over the next 12 months, said Hafidzi Razali of policy advisory and strategic communications firm Strategic Counsel in Kuala Lumpur.\n“Prime Minister Anwar is notably known for his balancing of Malaysia’s unity government – one that bridges the ideological gap from Malay nationalists to multicultural coalition,” Hafidzi said.\nBut this unity was only achieved through compromise, which some say has tarnished Anwar’s once-stalwart democratic brand.\nAnwar’s Reformasi agenda is stuck between a rock and a hard place\nHan Jun Lim, political analyst\nHis government backtracked on election promises to repeal controversial laws such as the Sedition Act and the Communications and Multimedia Act, which were previously used to silence him and his allies.\n“Anwar’s Reformasi agenda is stuck between a rock and a hard place,” said analyst Han Jun Lim at the Australian National University.\nInstead, his administration has doubled down on curbing criticism, revealing a new political identity for Anwar far removed from his former image as “a reformist force aiming to dismantle the status quo,” said Sophie Lemière, a political anthropologist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n“Critics argue that these compromises have not merely diluted the spirit of Reformasi; they have obliterated it.”","summary":"As his country assumes the Asean chair for 2025, Anwar Ibrahim faces the challenge of reconciling his ideals with thorny global realities.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3294308/anwar-statesman-malaysias-complex-pm-steps-world-stage","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/10/15b2564b-265a-4f2d-a306-e1669272ce70_ac41801f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-12 00:00:08","author":"Hadi Azmi","authors":["Hadi Azmi"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":279973414,"title":"Explaining the Right: Why are conservatives lying about California’s fires?","text":"At least 10 people have died and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed in the Los Angeles-area wildfires over the past week. Despite the chaos playing out on screens across the world, conservatives and Republicans have chosen to go on the attack.\n\nAs has often been the case, Donald Trump led the charge.\n\nTrump made up a lie that California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a frequent critic of Trump, refused to sign a “water restoration declaration,” which supposedly limited the availability of water to fight the fires. Trump also falsely alleged that water in the area has been limited due to environmental policy protecting an endangered fish.\n\nAt the same time, Elon Musk (who spent millions to elect Trump) invoked a bigoted and unsubstantiated allegation that efforts to diversify the Los Angeles Fire Department had contributed to problems in responding to the fires.\n\n“DEI means people DIE,” Musk wrote, referring to diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.\n\nMusk also promoted right-wing lies that the city’s emergency response funds had been cut in favor of diversity programs.\n\nTrump’s allies in conservative media have made similar arguments about diversity programs purportedly affecting the fire department. Newsmax TV host Rob Finnerty called the devastation “death by DEI,” while Fox News host Laura Ingraham complained that California had prioritized “DEI, illegal immigrants” instead of emergency response.\n\nThis isn’t new behavior for the right. When California was hit by wildfires in 2018, when Trump was president, he pushed lies about Newsom and the state government purportedly wasting water.\n\nAt the same time conservatives are pushing these attacks on environmentalism and equality, they have largely ignored the role that climate change has had in contributing to conditions that make it easier for massive fires to begin and spread.\n\nBut why is the right doing all this?\n\nCalifornia is one of the most Democratic states within the United States. In the 2024 presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris defeated Trump by 20 percentage points. In fact, the last time a Republican presidential candidate won California was in 1988 (and even then, George H.W. Bush won it by less than 4 percentage points).\n\nOver the decades, conservative politicians and right-wing media have frequently used California as subject of scorn and derision because of the state’s liberal politics. California has embraced many progressive policies on the environment, gender equality, LGBTQ+ equality, and racial equality, while also being the home to the entertainment industry and much of the tech industry.\n\nWhen something bad happens in California, conservatives flock to the issue to use it as “proof” that liberalism and the Democratic Party are also bad. Instead of expressing solidarity with fellow Americans dealing with tragedy, a figure like Trump mocks California’s leader as “Governor Gavin Newscum.”\n\nIronically, at least part of the blame for the severity of wildfires can be attributed to conservatism. For years, the right has downplayed the extent of climate change, and Trump has repeatedly claimed climate change is a “hoax.” The Republican Party has mocked policies like the Green New Deal meant to fight climate change, and opposed the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested billions in clean-energy efforts.\n\nClimate change is real, and Americans (along with the rest of the world) will have to deal with the fallout in the form of severe weather and massive fires. Conservatives could admit they were wrong and made the problem worse—or they could push lies about water and mock an American state while lives are lost.\n\nThey have chosen the latter and are likely to continue doing so.","summary":"At least 10 people have died and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed in the Los Angeles-area wildfires over the past week.

And for our church, it's really tender. So, I don't feel like I should talk about her yet.'\n'But yeah, I did lose a friend who did not get out on time,' she continued as her voice cracked over the tragic loss.\nJennifer also reflected on seeing the destruction of thousands of homes in the Palisades community and expressed, 'I just...my heart bleeds for all my friends.'\n'I mean, I can think of a hundred families and there are 5,000 homes lost. Without even thinking, I can write out a list of a hundred friends that lost their homes.'\nGarner then admitted, 'I feel almost guilty walking through my house just, you know, what can I do?

But it isn't,\" he says.\n\n\"So why are we surprised that Donald Trump thinks that after he's made Canada the 51st state, Greenland should be the 52nd?\"\n\nClarkson said the Danes might make \"petulant noises\" about losing Greenland now, but it's \"costing £340million a year in subsidies\" and realistically they'd probably be \"glad to see the back of it\".\n\nIt comes after Denmark demanded talks with Trump after the incoming US leader failed to rule out military intervention in his plot to take the autonomous territory.\n\nThe president-elect’s son Don Jr stirred the pot further after he touched down on the Danish territory and allegedly bribed local homeless people to pose as MAGA fans.\n\nTrump had sent shockwaves through the EU after he floated plans to seize Greenland to protect global \"national security and freedom\".\n\nPM Frederiksen said: \"There is a lot of support among the people of Greenland that Greenland is not for sale and will not be in the future either.\"\n\nShe then revealed on Thursday that she had reached out to Trump and offered talks over the shock move, but added the pair had not spoken yet.\n\nShe said that Trump’s landgrab remarks were being taken seriously but added \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\"\n\nDespite the Dane's wish for talks, she hammered down her belief that Trump would not attempt to take the Arctic island by force.\n\nShe said: \"We have no reason to believe that would happen.\"\n\nAhead of his son's controversial visit, Trump wrote on social media: “I am hearing that the people of Greenland are ‘MAGA'.\n\n“My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights.\n\n“Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation.\n\n“We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nGreenland was previously occupied by the US during World War Two, while Denmark was occupied by the Nazis.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing last Tuesday, Trump said he could not assure reporters that military or economic coercion would not be used to try and gain control of both Greenland and the Panama Canal.\n\n\"I can say this, we need them for economic security,\" he said.\n\nGreenland is the world's largest island, a founding member of NATO and boasts rich deposits of various natural resources.\n\nIt straddles the Arctic circle between the US, Russia and Europe - and the US has eyed it for more than 150 years.\n\nTrump added: \"I've been told that for a long time, long before I even ran.\n\n\"People really don't even know that Denmark has any legal right to it, but if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Panama Canal is a waterway connecting the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. \n\nIt acts as a shortcut route, saving time and costs for transporting goods, according to the Embassy of Panama website.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/32750391/donald-trump-greenland-transfer-clarkson/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/newspress-collage-n3cigs04g-1736635925000.jpg?1736635976&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:35:45","author":"Ryan Merrifield","authors":["Ryan Merrifield"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":279974232,"title":"Biden Administration spurs new battle with rules governing AI's global spread","text":"WASHINGTON: The next big fight over offshoring is playing out in Washington, and this time it involves artificial intelligence. The Biden administration, in its final days in office, is rushing to issue new regulations to try to ensure that the United States and its close allies have control over how artificial intelligence develops in the years to come. The rules have touched off an intense fight between tech companies and the government, as well as among administration officials. The regulations would dictate where American-made chips that are critical for AI could be shipped. Those rules would then help determine where the data centers that create AI would be built, with a preference for the United States and its allies. The rules would allow most European countries, Japan and other close US allies to make unfettered purchases of AI chips, while blocking two dozen adversaries, including China and Russia, from buying them. More than 100 other countries would face different quotas on the amount of AI chips they could receive from US companies. The regulations would also make it easier for AI chips to be sent to trusted American companies that run data centers, like Google and Microsoft, than to their foreign competitors. The rules would establish security procedures that data centers would have to follow to keep AI systems safe from cybertheft. The Biden administration's plan has prompted swift pushback from American tech companies, which say global regulations could slow their businesses and create costly compliance requirements. Those firms also question whether President Joe Biden should be setting rules with such far-reaching economic consequences in his final days in office. While some of the details remain unclear, the new rules may force tech companies that are pouring tens of billions of dollars into building data centers around the world to rethink some of those locations. Artificial intelligence, which can answer questions, write code and create images, is expected to revolutionize the way countries fight wars, develop medicines and make scientific breakthroughs. Because of its potential power, US officials want AI systems to be built in the United States or in allied countries -- where they will have more say over what the systems do -- rather than in countries that could share that technology with China or act in other ways contrary to US national security. Peter Harrell, a former White House economic official and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the United States currently had a substantial edge in AI and the leverage to decide which countries could benefit from it. \"It's important to think about how we want those transformational developments to be rolled out around the world,\" he said. The rules are largely about national security: Given the way that AI might transform military conflict, the regulations are designed to keep the most powerful technology in the hands of allies and prevent China from getting access to AI chips through international data centers. But US officials say data centers are also important sources of new economic activity for American communities. They want to encourage companies to build as many data centers as possible in the United States rather than in regions such as the Middle East, which is offering money to attract tech firms. Some labor unions have come out in support of the Biden administration's plan. That's because data centers are huge consumers of electricity and steel. Each one creates work for construction companies, electricians and heating, ventilation and air conditioning technicians, as well as workers involved in energy production. \"Labor has a huge interest in the future of AI and technology, not only in terms of its application but in terms of the infrastructure that supports it,\" said Michael R. Wessel, an adviser to the United Steelworkers union. But US tech companies and their supporters argue that the rules could hold back technological developments, strain international alliances and motivate countries to buy alternative technologies from China, which is racing to develop its own AI chips. \"The risk is that over the long term, countries are going to say, 'We cannot rely on the United States; we cannot be importing our advanced technology from the United States, because there is always this threat that the US government is going to take it away from us,'\" said Geoffrey Gertz, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. California-based Nvidia, which controls 90% of the AI chip market, has lobbied against the rules in meetings with Congress and the White House, as have Microsoft, Oracle and other companies. They worry that the rules could hurt international sales. Ned Finkle, Nvidia's vice president of global affairs, said in a statement that the policy would hurt data centers around the world without improving national security and would \"push the world to alternative technologies.\" \"We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the US economy, set America back and play into the hands of US adversaries,\" Finkle added. Tech companies have also tried to blunt the impact by appealing to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration, which can decide whether to keep or enforce the rules, tech executives and other people familiar with the exchanges said. Microsoft and Oracle declined to comment. Biden officials have also clashed over the regulations. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who is more sympathetic to industry complaints and had concerns about how the Trump administration would carry out the rules, has been at odds with the White House and other agencies, according to three officials and others familiar with the discussions, who declined to be named to discuss private deliberations. Some US allies expressed concerns about the rules, officials said. And in a Dec. 19 letter to the Biden administration, bipartisan lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee criticized the restrictions as \"draconian\" and said they would \"severely hinder the sale of US technology abroad.\" After the White House decided to move forward, the Commerce Department pushed for additional changes to the rule, including increasing the number of chips that can be sold without a license and delaying the rule's start for 120 days to allow the Trump administration to potentially make changes, two officials said. It is unclear what Trump would do, although he has recently expressed support for having data centers built in the United States. His advisers include some China skeptics who are likely to favor tougher restrictions. Others, including the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, have business ties to countries in the Middle East that are likely to oppose any restrictions. The new rules build on export controls that the Biden administration has put in place in recent years to ban shipments of advanced AI chips to China and other adversarial countries and to require special licenses to send AI chips to countries, including in the Middle East. Those controls have allowed the United States to exert some global influence. To gain access to Nvidia chips last year, G42, a leading AI firm in the United Arab Emirates, promised to relinquish its use of technology made by Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications firm under US sanctions. But US concerns have grown that Chinese companies are getting critical technology by smuggling in chips or through remote access to data centers in other countries. Companies have also faced long waits to obtain licenses for even small numbers of chips, and foreign officials have appealed directly to the Biden administration to try to obtain them. So officials began working last year on a more transparent distribution system. Tech companies say the requirements could make data centers too expensive for some nations, preventing some from using AI to benefit their health care, transportation and hospitality industries. Among the countries that would face caps and other restrictions are traditional US allies including Israel and Mexico. \"We can all agree that none of these workloads or uses of AI technology and the GPUs they rely on constitute national security concerns,\" said Ken Glueck, Oracle's executive vice president, in a company blog post referring to graphic processing units, or AI chips. Nvidia and other tech companies have also argued that the rules could backfire by driving buyers in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere to Chinese companies like Huawei. Some US officials disagree. One analysis that US officials put together, including for consultations with private industry, argued that Chinese chipmakers faced significant hurdles and would not be able to export enough chips to train cutting-edge AI models.

The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated, follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump's White House win in November.At issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.RELATED STORY | Supreme Court rejects Trump’s bid to delay hush money sentencingThe Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump's co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.The department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.But prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume.In an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday.The appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump's efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon's injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.The Justice Department told the appeals court in its emergency motion that Cannon's order was “plainly erroneous.”“The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department,\" the Justice Department said. \"The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates.\"Justice Department regulations call for special counsels to produce reports at the conclusion of their work, and it’s customary for such documents to be made public no matter the subject.William Barr, attorney general during Trump's first term, released a special counsel report examining Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and potential ties to the Trump campaign.Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also released special counsel reports, including about Biden’s handling of classified information before Biden became president.","summary":"Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned 10 days before Trump is inaugurated and followuing the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/trump-indictments/special-counsel-jack-smith-has-resigned-after-submitting-his-trump-report-justice-department-says","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0773884/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3601x1891+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2F29%2Fef2e9505434d99a0e601b39ddd81%2Fap24311784190911.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:31:09","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.434},{"id":279975192,"title":"‘We’re in a new era’: How climate change is supercharging disasters","text":"As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.\n\nWith temperatures rising around the world and the oceans unusually warm, scientists are warning that the planet has entered a dangerous new era of chaotic floods, storms and fires made worse by human-caused climate change.\n\nThe firestorms ravaging the country’s second-largest city are just the latest spasm of extreme weather that is growing more furious as well as more unpredictable. Wildfires are highly unusual in Southern California in January, which is supposed to be the rainy season. The same is true for cyclones in Appalachia, where Hurricanes Helene and Milton shocked the country when they tore through mountain communities in October.\n\nWildfires are burning hotter and moving faster. Storms are getting bigger and carrying more moisture. And soaring temperatures worldwide are leading to heat waves and drought, which can be devastating on their own and leave communities vulnerable to dangers such as mudslides when heavy rains return.\n\nAround the world, extreme weather and searing heat killed thousands of people last year and displaced millions, with pilgrims dying as temperatures soared in Saudi Arabia. In Europe, extreme heat contributed to at least 47,000 deaths in 2023. In the United States, heat-related deaths have doubled in recent decades.\n\n“We’re in a new era now,” said former Vice President Al Gore, who has warned of the threats of global warming for decades. “These climate related extreme events are increasing, both in frequency and intensity, quite rapidly.”\n\nThe fires currently raging in greater Los Angeles are already among the most destructive in U.S. history. By Friday, the blazes had consumed more than 36,000 acres and destroyed thousands of buildings. As of midday Friday, at least 10 people were dead, and losses could top $100 billion, according to AccuWeather.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to say with certainty as any specific weather event unfolds whether it was worsened or made more likely by global warming, the Los Angeles fires are being driven by a number of factors that scientists have linked to fire weather and that are becoming increasingly common on a hotter planet.\n\nLast winter, Southern California got huge amounts of rain that led to extensive vegetation growth. Now, months into what is typically the rainy season, Los Angeles is experiencing a drought. The last time it rained more than a tenth of an inch was on May 5. Since then, it has been the second-driest period in the city’s recorded history.\n\nTemperatures in the region have also been higher than normal. As a result, many of the plants that grew last year are parched, turning trees, grasses and bushes into kindling that was ready to explode.\n\nThat combination of heat and dryness, which scientists say is linked to climate change, created the ideal conditions for an urban firestorm.\n\n“Wintertime fires in Southern California require a lot of extreme climate and weather events to occur at once,” said Park Williams, a climate scientist at UCLA. “And the warmer the temperatures, the more intense the fires.”\n\nA third factor fueling the fires, the fierce Santa Ana winds, which blow West from Utah and Nevada, cannot be directly linked to climate change, scientists say. But the winds this week have been particularly ferocious, gusting at more than 100 mph, as fierce as a Category 2 hurricane.\n\nFires across the West have been getting worse in recent years. In 2017, thousands of homes in Santa Rosa, California, burned to the ground. The next year, the Camp fire leveled more than 13,000 homes in Paradise, California. In 2021, roughly 1,000 homes burned near Boulder, Colorado.\n\nAnd from the boreal forests of Canada to the redwood groves of Oregon, large fires have been incinerating vast areas of wilderness.\n\n“In the last couple years, we’ve seen an increase in extreme weather events and increasing amounts of billion-dollar disasters,” said Kaitlyn Trudeau, a senior research associate focused on wildfires and the West Coast at Climate Central, a nonprofit research group. “It’s very clear that something is off, and that something is that we’re pumping an insane amount of carbon into the atmosphere and causing the climate systems to go out of whack.”\n\nAs the Los Angeles fires consumed some of the most valuable real estate in the world, an unfolding tragedy became fodder for political attacks.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, for the disaster. Trump inaccurately claimed that state and federal protections for a threatened fish had hampered firefighting efforts by leading to water shortages.\n\nAnd Thursday, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and an ally of Trump’s, inserted himself into the debate over the role climate change plays in wildfires.\n\n“Climate change risk is real, just much slower than alarmists claim,” Musk wrote to his 211 million followers on X, the social media site he owns. He said the loss of homes was primarily the result of “nonsensical overregulation” and “bad governance at the state and local level that resulted in a shortage of water.”\n\nThose claims were rebutted by scientists, who noted that, as humans continue to warm the planet with emissions, extreme weather is becoming more common.\n\nIn Los Angeles, residents displaced by the fires watched in exasperation as the unfolding disaster was politicized.\n\n“People are just wanting to blame somebody else,” said Sheila Morovati, a climate activist who lives in Pacific Palisades and saw her neighborhood burn. “What about all the dryness? What about the temperatures? There’s so many pieces that are all pointing back to climate change.”\n\nNews that 2024 was the hottest year on record was hardly a surprise. The previous hottest year was 2023. All 10 of the hottest years on record have come in the past decade.\n\n“We sound like a broken record but only because the records keep breaking,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which monitors global temperatures. “They will continue to break until we get emissions under control.”\n\nBut the world is not getting emissions under control. In fact, countries last year released record amounts of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere, even as the consequences of climate change have become painfully clear. U.S. efforts to cut emissions largely stalled last year.\n\nThe inevitable result: more heat and more extreme weather.\n\nIn late September and early October, Hurricane Helene, which scientists said was made worse by climate change, roared across the Southeast, unleashed deadly floods and landslides in several states, including North Carolina.\n\nMonths earlier, researchers showed that the devastating floods that swamped Porto Alegre, Brazil, would not have been so severe were it not for human-caused global warming.\n\nIn May, scientists found the fingerprints of climate change on a crippling heat wave that gripped India, and found that an early heat wave in West Africa last spring was made 10 times more likely by climate change.\n\nOn Friday, parts of the South that are not used to winter weather, including Atlanta, saw sleet and snow, disrupting travel and canceling flights. But it’s unclear whether the recent blast of cold air that has led to plunging temperatures across the Southeast and Gulf Coast states was caused by a warming climate.\n\n“We just don’t see robust increases in severe cold events,” said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research organization. “If anything, they’re decreasing.”\n\nAlthough Southern California is no stranger to fires, the events of the past week have exposed the region’s inherent vulnerabilities.\n\nAs the first fires started, fierce winds pushed the flames through canyons loaded with dried-out vegetation and into homes built in the so-called wildland-urban interface, areas where neighborhoods abut undeveloped wilderness. Both of the areas in the Los Angeles region that suffered the greatest losses — Pacific Palisades and Altadena — were in such fire-prone areas.\n\nArt delaCruz, CEO of Team Rubicon, a nonprofit organization that mobilizes veterans and other volunteers to assist after disasters, was at home in Los Angeles when the fires broke out. His house is safe for now, and he is now preparing to deploy volunteers who will help clear roads and distribute aid.\n\nTeam Rubicon was founded after a group of former Marines went to Haiti to volunteer after the devastating earthquake in 2010. But delaCruz said that most of the disasters his organization responds to around the world now are linked to climate change.\n\n“It’s simple physics,” he said. “Warmer air holds more water. The storms are increasing in frequency. The storms are increasing in severity. And the damage is just unbelievable.”\n\nThere is no rain in the forecast for Los Angeles for at least another couple of weeks. But scientists are already concerned about what will happen when the rains do arrive.\n\nIn 2018, the wealthy enclave of Montecito, just north of Los Angeles, was devastated by mudslides after torrential downpours fell on hills that had recently burned.\n\n“If we get intense rainfall on those burn scars, then we’re going to add insult to injury and have debris flows,” said Alexander Gershunov, a research meteorologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.\n\nHeat waves. Drought. Fires. Superstorms. Floods. Mudslides. These are the growing threats of a rapidly warming world, and scientists say nowhere is entirely protected from the effects of climate change.\n\n“We think sometimes that if we live in a city, we’re not vulnerable to natural forces,” Schmidt said. “But we are, and it comes as a huge shock to people. There’s no ‘Get Out of Climate Change Free’ card.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times. \n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"As Los Angeles burned for days on end, horrifying the nation, scientists made an announcement Friday that could help explain the deadly conflagration: 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/01/11/breaking-news/were-in-a-new-era-how-climate-change-is-supercharging-disasters/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/web1_CALIF-FIRES-8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:31:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.273},{"id":279972596,"title":"Japan’s Foreign Minister to Visit South Korea Amid New Threats by China, North Korea","text":"Japan’s foreign minister will travel to South Korea next week to discuss regional security cooperation against a backdrop of growing Chinese and North Korean aggression in the region.\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya will meet with his South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul and acting President Choi Sang-mok on Jan. 13 to coordinate policies including responses to North Korea’s increasing threats against both nations.\n\nJapan, South Korea, and the United States initiated a historic trilateral security cooperation agreement in 2023 known as the Camp David Principles, overcoming decades of latent hostility between Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nThe trilateral pact has since been regarded as a key mechanism for containing aggression by China and North Korea’s communist leadership, but its future is now somewhat tenuous.\n\nWhen President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month, none of the national leaders who established the pact will remain in power.\n\nIwaya’s planned visit will mark the first occasion in seven years that a Japanese foreign minister has traveled to South Korea.\n\nJapanese leadership is also still feeling out how best to manage its relationship with Seoul following the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in December over a botched declaration of martial law.\n\nYoon has since been sequestered in a hillside villa, with presidential security service and military guards there blocking the interim government’s investigators from arresting him.\n\nJapan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba held a phone call with acting South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo shortly after the impeachment where the two agreed that continuing security cooperation was necessary given the region’s volatility.\n\nLikewise, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited South Korea and Japan this week, meeting with senior government officials to strengthen key security efforts in the region ahead of the transition of power.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Tokyo on Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said that trilateral security cooperation will continue, but it was unclear how strong it will remain.\n\n“The trilateral will move forward, the real question is will the trilateral thrive,” Emanuel said. “It’s going to take work to nurture it and develop it.”","summary":"Japan's Takeshi Iwaya will meet with officials in South Korea to discuss regional security in light of aggression by communist China and North Korea.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/japans-foreign-minister-to-visit-south-korea-amid-new-threats-by-china-north-korea-5790277","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/12/25/id5781811-GettyImages-2184063359-2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:30:26","author":"Andrew Thornebrooke","authors":["Andrew Thornebrooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.049},{"id":279971156,"title":"In sign of progress, Israel sends Mossad director to Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sending the director of the Mossad foreign intelligence agency to ceasefire negotiations in Qatar, his office said Saturday, in a sign of progress in talks on the war in Gaza.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when David Barnea would travel to Qatar’s capital, Doha, for the latest round of indirect talks between Israel and the Hamas militant group, but there is U.S. pressure for a deal before the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20. Barnea’s presence means high-level Israeli officials who would need to sign off on any agreement are now involved.\n\nJust one brief ceasefire has been achieved in 15 months of war, and that was in the earliest weeks of fighting. The talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly stalled since then.\n\nUnder discussion is a phased ceasefire, with Netanyahu signaling he is committed only to the first phase, a partial hostage release in exchange for a weekslong halt in fighting.\n\nHamas has insisted on a full Israeli troop withdrawal from the largely devastated territory, but Netanyahu has insisted on destroying Hamas’ ability to fight in Gaza. On Thursday, Gaza’s Health Ministry said over 46,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, the majority women and children, though it doesn’t say how many were fighters or civilians.\n\nAlso being sent to Qatar are the head of Israel’s Shin Bet internal security agency and military and political advisers. Netanyahu’s office said the decision followed a meeting with his defense minister, security chiefs and negotiators “on behalf of the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations.”\n\nThe office also released a photo showing Netanyahu with President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, who was in Qatar this week.\n\nFamilies of the roughly 100 hostages still held in Gaza after being seized in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that sparked the war are pressing Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. Israelis rallied again on Saturday night in the city of Tel Aviv, with photos of hostages on display.\n\n“We join together in the hope that the talks in Doha succeed,” outgoing U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew said at the rally. “We’re encouraged by the news today, but we know we can’t stop.”\n\nThe recovery of two hostages’ bodies in the past week renewed fears that time is running out. Hamas has said that after months of heavy fighting, it isn’t sure who is alive or dead.\n\n“Return with an agreement that ensures the return of all hostages, down to the last one — the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for proper burial in their homeland,” said a statement by a group representing some hostages’ families.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week a deal is “very close” and he hoped to complete it before handing over diplomacy to the incoming Trump administration. But U.S. officials have expressed similar optimism on several occasions over the past year.\n\nIssues in the talks have included which hostages would be released in the first part of a phased ceasefire deal, which Palestinian prisoners would be released and the extent of any Israeli troop withdrawal from population centers in Gaza.\n\nHamas and other groups killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages into Gaza in the attack that started the war. A truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued or their remains have been recovered over the past year.\n\nIsrael’s military announced the deaths of four soldiers in northern Gaza on Saturday, without details. At least 400 soldiers have been killed in the war. Six others were killed this week in largely isolated northern Gaza, where Israel has been pressing an offensive against regrouping Hamas militants.\n\nThe Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants during the war, without providing evidence.\n\nInside Gaza\n\nOn Saturday, an airstrike killed a 5-year-old girl and two male relatives in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where an AP team saw them.\n\nThe girl’s body, in a pink sweater, was wrapped in foil and placed on the floor of the morgue. Her father knelt and pressed his face to hers. “God!” he cried.\n\nAnother Israeli airstrike killed at least eight Palestinians — including two children and two women — in a school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza, according to the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government. It said the strike on the Halawa school that shelters displaced people in the Jabaliya area also wounded 30 others, including 19 children.\n\nIsrael’s military said it struck a Hamas command center at a former school in Jabaliya, without giving evidence.\n\nAnd a strike killed four people on a street in Gaza City, said Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal. Overall, Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 32 bodies had arrived at hospitals in the past 24 hours.\n\n“I ask the world, do you hear us? Do we exist?” said Hamza Saleh, one of the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents who have been displaced. He spoke on Friday in the southern city of Khan Younis as children and others jostled for food aid, while hunger grows.\n\n— By WAFAA SHURAFA and NATALIE MELZER Associated Press\n\nMelzer reported from Nahariya, Israel.","summary":"It wasn't immediately clear on Saturday when David Barnea would travel to Qatar’s capital for the latest round of indirect talks.","url":"https://www.oregonlive.com/nation/2025/01/in-sign-of-progress-israel-sends-mossad-director-to-gaza-ceasefire-talks-in-qatar.html","image":"https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/v2/XDGR7HBG65BCDFT4BPC2MGLXQQ.jpg?auth=998ca098d67c9586683e064059e223de2677ac1c3183e56bd61c18b90a3000f3&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:30:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.203},{"id":279970188,"title":"Special counsel Jack Smith resigns from DOJ as Trump’s fight to block final report continues","text":"Special Counsel Jack Smith resigned from the Department of Justice on Friday after he completed his two criminal investigations of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSmith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in Nov. 2022, left his post just days ahead of Trump’s inauguration.

Should they fail to find one, they could make a broad claim about possible unfamiliar diseases, though it’s unclear if that would hold up in a court.\n\nWhile time is running out to iron out the complications of immigration-related executive orders, Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, has reportedly begun trying to manage expectations with Republican members of Congress.\n\nHoman — the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement now tasked with implementing Trump’s deportation operation — told lawmakers that deporting millions of people will require extensive funding and resources which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) currently does not have, according to CNN.\n\nTo carry out a mass deportation of its kind, the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit that advocates for fairer immigration policies, estimates it would cost $88 billion — about $80 billion more than what ICE is allocated now.\n\n“His message is not code talk for, ‘Nothing is going to happen’ or, ‘We’re going to slow down’ or whatever,” Republican Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada told CNN.\n\n“But it is a responsible policy approach to getting stuff done quickly, but also in the context of realistic evaluation of how to best get that done and fulfill the promises that the incoming administration has made,” he said.\n\nTrump has insisted there is “no price tag” on carrying out the deportations.\n\nOne way the president-elect and his team could fund his immigration plans would be to declare a national emergency, which would unlock funding within the Department of Defense.\n\nTrump has already said he wants to use the U.S. military to help carry out his mass deportation plan by having them partner with state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.\n\nThe president-elect could also declare a national emergency to continue building the border wall, build immigration detention centers, and invoke the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize local and state law enforcement to carry out the responsibilities of ICE.\n\n“President Trump will enlist every federal power and coordinate with state authorities to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families,” according to Karoline Leavitt, the incoming White House press secretary. “The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, like deporting migrant criminals and restoring our economic greatness.”","summary":"Trump has pledged to close the border and begin deportations on ‘day one’ — but it’s unclear how","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-border-mass-deportations-tom-homan-b2678010.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/31/18/GettyImages-2167172436.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9q0SuD2x-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-11 23:18:57","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.001},{"id":279973404,"title":"Special counsel Jack Smith resigns after submitting Trump report on overturning 2020 results and classified documents","text":"Fortune 500\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nSEARCHSubscribe Now\n\nFORTUNE 500\n\nPersonal Finance\nReal Estate\n\nCredit Cards\n\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts\nBest Savings Accounts\nBest CD Rates\nBest Money Market Accounts\nSavings Calculator\n\nTop Business Schools\nTop Information Technology and Data Schools\nTop Health Schools\nBusiness Solutions\n\nFORTUNE 500\n\nMOST POWERFUL WOMEN\nGREAT PLACE TO WORK LISTS\nBEST MBA PROGRAMS\nMORE RANKINGS\nFortune Company List\n\nNewsletters\n\nDecember 2024/January 2025\nOctober/November 2024\nAugust/September 2024\nJune/July 2024\nApril/May 2024\nFebruary/March 2024\n\nCEO Initiative\n\nPolitics·Donald Trump\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith resigns after submitting Trump report on overturning 2020 results and classified documents\n\nBYThe Associated Press\n\nJack Smith speaking about an indictment of Donald Trump in 2023.\nJacquelyn Martin—AP Photo\n\n100 Best Companies\nFortune 500\n\nFortune 500 Europe\n\nMost Powerful Women\n\nWorld’s Most Admired Companies\nSee All Rankings\n\nEnvironment\nFortune Crypto\n\nNewsletters\n\nCEO Initiative\nConferences\nPersonal Finance\n\nCustomer Support\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCustomer Service Portal\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nSingle Issues for Purchase\nInternational Print\n\nCommercial Services\n\nFortune Brand Studio\nFortune Analytics\nFortune Conferences\nAdvertising\nBusiness Development\n\nEditorial Calendar\nPress Center\nWork at Fortune\nDiversity and Inclusion\nTerms and Conditions\n\n© 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

View,' sources say: Becoming a 'big thing'","text":"There's been a cloudy forecast for \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin as her husband has been accused in a lawsuit of committing insurance fraud, which has become a \"big thing\" at ABC News, according to sources. \"It's been discussed internally,\" one source tells Fox News Digital of the situation at the ABC talk show. \"But no one is sure what to make of it.\" Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Emmanuel \"Manny\" Hostin and his practice, Hostin Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine, were named among more than 180 defendants in a major RICO case filed in New York last month. According to The Daily Mail, Hostin and the other defendants were allegedly receiving kickbacks for performing surgeries and fraudulently billing the insurance company that provides for Uber and Lyft drivers, as well as taxi companies. The lawsuit alleges Hostin was given an \"investment\" interest in the Empire State Ambulatory Surgery Center while receiving a \"steady stream\" of patient referrals in return. Hostin's attorney told The Daily Mail his client denies all the allegations and called the filing a \"blanket, scattershot, meritless lawsuit by a near-bankrupt insurance carrier.\" ‘THE VIEW’ STAR SUNNY HOSTIN'S SURGEON HUSBAND ACCUSED OF INSURANCE FRAUD IN SWEEPING FEDERAL LAWSUIT A former ABC insider said Hostin was always the first one to jump down a Republican's throat when they'd done anything wrong on \"The View,\" and \"now she's not even talking about it on the show.\" \"It's pretty hypocritical,\" they said, saying the controversy had become a \"big thing at the network.\" \"It's death by a thousand cuts. This is just another thing to make people not trust [The View] and not take them seriously.\" As co-host of \"The View\" and ABC's senior legal correspondent, Hostin often cites her background as an attorney to weigh in on major legal stories that have made headlines, most notably the litany of criminal charges that were leveled against President-elect Donald Trump. Hostin is known for giving sarcastic readings of Trump's denials of the charges against him when discussed on the program. \"Sunny Hostin will only look more foolish when she pontificates about ethics and morality and the rule of law,\" Fox News contributor Joe Concha said. ABC NEWS HIT WITH EMBARRASSING HEADLINES FROM DAVID MUIR'S CLOTHESPIN BLUNDER TO SUNNY HOSTIN'S HUSBAND DRAMA Many media experts, like Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson, don't think the legal drama rocking the Hostin household will have much of an effect on ABC News nor the host's standing with \"The View.\" \"It would be a stretch to claim that anything he did or did not do relates to Ms. Hostin, much less her ability to offer her opinions on ‘The View,'\" Jacobson told Fox News Digital. DePauw University journalism professor Jeffrey McCall similarly predicted the scandal will likely not move the needle as ABC News will \"steer clear\" from covering the lawsuit in a constantly packed news cycle that is bracing for Trump's return to the White House. \"It does have a certain sensationalism to it in that Sunny is an outspoken personality on a rather raucous commentary program, but the interest factor is probably rather low for most American news consumers,\" McCall said. ABC News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A representative for Hostin also did not comment. SUNNY HOSTIN LIKENS JANUARY 6 RIOT TO THE HOLOCAUST, SAYS WE CAN ‘NEVER FORGET’ Disney-ownd ABC is still smarting from its $16 million settlement with Trump after he sued the network and \"This Week\" host George Stephanopoulos for defamation. Hostin has remained mum about her husband's legal troubles since the December lawsuit filing, but that hasn't stopped her from commenting on her husband's work, as she did last month while discussing the health insurance industry in the aftermath of the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. \"Doctors suffer because of big corporations as well, doctors that want to do good like my husband,\" Hostin told her colleagues. \"[He] operates on someone even though they don't have insurance and then has to sue health insurance companies to get paid for the work that he's been trained his whole life to do.\" ‘THE VIEW’ HOST SUNNY HOSTIN'S SURGEON HUSBAND FACING YEARS-ALONG BATTLE IN FRAUD CASE Additionally, comments Hostin made in March 2023 about the severity of insurance fraud went viral this week as she discussed potential charges against former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, who had been serving a prison sentence for tax fraud. \"Prosecutors are like, ‘Oh really? Well, how about we add some additional fraud charges onto you?' And they're talking about threatening him with insurance fraud, which I would say you could get 20 years in prison. So that's a death sentence for him,\" Hostin said at the time. Legal experts tell Fox News Digital the $459 million lawsuit embroiling Dr. Hostin and his co-defendants could keep them in court for years. The lawsuit was filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, in the Eastern District of New York—a strategy that legal experts say is designed to have a chilling effect on behavior. It's also one that risks entangling defendants such as Hostin in years of complex court proceedings—and potentially saddling them with massive payouts as a result. American Transit alleges that Hostin and other defendants abused New York’s no-fault laws to bill \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in fraudulent payments between 2009 and December 2024.

Garland has pledged to release to the public all reports completed under his tenure and has so far done so, including after an investigation into President Biden’s handling of classified records. \n\nCourt filings earlier this week revealed Smith had submitted a two-volume report to Garland on Jan. 7, just days after attorneys for Trump and his codefendants reviewed a draft report. Trump’s attorneys subsequently wrote a letter to Garland asking him to remove Smith from his post and prevent the release of the report, according to court filings. \n\nFollowing the review, attorneys for Trump’s codefendants asked Cannon, who initially dismissed one of Smith’s cases against Trump in July, and judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta to stop Garland from releasing the report. \n\nSmith was appointed in November of 2022 to take over two Justice Department investigations into Trump, one related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, and another tied to his handling of classified records after he left office. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Trump. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. \n\nSmith’s dual cases against Trump were ultimately closed last year after Trump won the presidential election. Prosecutors wrote that Justice Department regulations forbid the prosecution of a sitting president. \n\nThe special counsel at the time opted to keep an appeal of Cannon’s dismissal of the classified documents investigation open in the cases of Nauta and de Oliveira. It was in this case that their attorneys sought to prevent the release of the report, arguing doing so would prejudice their case. \n\nIn response, the Justice Department revealed the attorney general would not release the volume of the report dealing with the classified documents probe until the case is completely closed, and instead make it available to a select group of members of Congress. \n\nStill, the defense attorneys and Trump’s legal team have urged the federal courts to stop the release of the other portion of the report detailing Smith’s probe into the 2020 election. \n\nRight now, the report remains unreleased after Cannon ordered the Justice Department to keep the report under wraps until at least Sunday. Judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Trump codefendants’ bid to further enjoin prosecutors from releasing the report.\n\nDefense attorneys have now asked Cannon to extend her order forbidding the report’s release, a move the Justice Department opposes.","summary":"Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to take over two investigations into President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned, according to a Justice Department court filing submitted on Saturday.

I’ve got that question, I can’t tell you, by how many people, ‘What happened?’ – on my own team, ‘What happened?’” he said.\n\n“I’ll be candid with you, I wasn’t getting straight answers,” Newsom said during an appearance on the podcast “Pod Save America,” which was released on Saturday.\n\nMany Angelinos are “so angry” over the state’s handling of the destructive blaze, said co-host Jon Favreau, who asked the governor to respond as the person who is “ultimately responsible” for state decisions.\n\nThe governor has also been heavily criticized after a blistering report revealed he had slashed funding earmarked for fighting wildfires by more than $100 million this fiscal year.\n\nNewsom answered by saying he was getting “different answers” from local leaders.\n\n“We had my team start talking to local leaders, saying, ‘What’s going on?’” Newsom said.\n\n“When you start getting different answers, then I’m not getting the actual story.”\n\nNewsom admitted the state may have had some lackluster responses regarding the devastating blaze — but claimed he wouldn’t be able to have a “sober” evaluation until after the wildfires are brought under control.\n\nInstead, he bragged that the state secured dozens of helicopters and prepositioned engines, personnel, dozers, and more in half a dozen counties over the weekend in preparation for the strong and arid Santa Ana winds. \n\nHe also pointed a finger at Donald Trump, who earlier this week slammed Newson for failing to do “a good job” at handling the crisis and claiming California wasn’t taking advantage of ocean water to extinguish the flames because they were worried it would affect marine life.\n\n“It’s words. It’s a salad. It’s the form and substance of fog. It’s made up. It’s delusional and it’s a consistent mantra from Trump going back years and years and years, and it’s reinforced over and over and over within the right wing,” Newsom told Favreau, adding Trump was only adding misinformation “into this crisis in a profoundly demeaning and damaging way.”\n\nAs of Saturday, the southern California wildfires had claimed at least 13 lives.\n\nAt least 153,000 residents have been forced to evacuate their homes in Southern California as wildfires continue to rage across the Pacific Palisades and surrounding areas.","summary":"\"When you start getting different answers, then I’m not getting the actual story.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/01/11/us-news/california-gov-gavin-newson-passes-off-wildfire-response-blame-to-local-leaders-own-team/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/newsom-pod-save-america-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1736615221&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:51:38","author":"Christopher Scarglato,Katherine Donlevy","authors":["Christopher Scarglato","Katherine Donlevy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.416},{"id":279969356,"title":"She was shunned for Donald Trump's inauguration 2017...but now fashion giants are begging to dress Melania on her husband's big day","text":"When Donald Trump was first elected President his wife Melania was ‘shunned’ by major fashion houses wary of being associated with his ‘toxic’ brand of politics.\n\nFormer fashion model Melania ended up wearing a £5,500 powder blue cashmere dress and bolero by the American designer Ralph Lauren to her husband’s January 2017 inauguration – one of the few designers who offered to create an outfit out of respect for the office of the presidency. How times have changed.\n\nThe Mail on Sunday understands Melania, 54, is being swamped by offers of free designer clothing from nearly every major US fashion house and European couture icons including Versace and Christian Dior in advance of her husband’s inauguration on January 20.\n\nToni Holt Kramer, founder of the Trumpettes support group and a close friend of both Mr Trump and his wife, said: ‘Things are very different this time around. When President Trump was first elected back in 2016, Melania was treated very badly indeed.\n\n‘People spoke out against her and refused to dress her. She was shunned and treated appallingly but acted with nothing but class. It must have been hard for her. Now people are begging to dress her.’\n\nJeremy Scott, former creative director of fashion house Moschino and a favourite of stars such as Beyonce and Lady Gaga famously said before Mr Trump’s first inauguration that he would ‘never’ design for Melania.\n\n‘Obviously [Melania] looks great, but I can’t divorce it from who she is. I don’t know Melania,’ he said.\n\nAnd French designer Sophie Theallet – whose clients include Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Lopez – wrote an open letter urging her fellow designers not to associate with Melania stating: ‘I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next First Lady. The rhetoric of racism, sexism and xenophobia unleashed by her husband’s presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by.’ \n\nWhile Melania’s final choice of inauguration outfit is still ‘up in the air’, the MoS understands her longtime designer friend Herve Pierre is favouring a US brand.\n\nHe recently told American fashion ‘bible’ Woman’s Wear Daily that designers were so reluctant to offer Melania clothing during her husband’s first term he bought clothes ‘off the rack’ for her.\n\nMelania’s sister Ines is one of the few people she confides in and, it is understood, the pair have been ‘considering’ outfits this week during fittings in Melania’s private quarters at Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family home in Florida\n\nMs Holt Kramer said: ‘Truth be told no one knows who Melania will wear but it will be an outfit which will go down in history.\n\n‘The mood is very different this time around. People have voted overwhelmingly in favour of President Trump so, of course, everyone wants to dress Melania.\n\n‘She is very much her own woman, with impeccable taste. I believe she will go for an American designer to send a strong message that America is back. One thing is for sure, she will look fabulous.’\n\nDavid Adler, founder of Washington high society magazine Washington Dossier, told the MoS: ‘Melania has come out from under her husband’s shadow. She has a best-selling memoir and has signed a $40 million documentary deal.’\n\n‘Washington is no longer a foreign land for her. She has gained the confidence to be her own person. She knows the game.’\n\nMr Adler says Melania seeks to emulate the fashion legacy of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy. ‘She’s trying to get the Jackie Kennedy mantle, to be the Jackie Kennedy of the MAGA world,’ he added.","summary":"Melania ended up wearing a £5,500 powder blue cashmere dress and bolero by Ralph Lauren to her husband's 2017 inauguration - one of few designers who offered to create an outfit.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14274329/Donald-Trump-inauguration-2017-fashion-giants-begging-dress-Melania.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/11/20/93996663-0-image-m-21_1736627665263.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:48:39","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor,Sharon Churcher","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor","Sharon Churcher"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.222},{"id":279968692,"title":"Federal prosecutor Jack Smith resigns ahead of Trump's inauguration","text":"Jan. 11 (UPI) -- Special Counsel Jack Smith, who pursued two criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned from the Justice Department, according to a federal court filing made Saturday.\n\nSmith had completed work on the two cases against Trump over the president-elect's retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago Resort home in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nHe resigned from the Justice Department effective Friday, according to the federal court filing made Saturday in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida, which revealed the information in a footnote.\n\nThe note says the \"special counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on Jan. 7, 2025, and separated from the [Justice] Department on Jan. 10.\"\n\nThe court filing is signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton, U.S. Attorney Markenzy LaPointe and attorney Elizabeth Shapiro.\n\nThe footnote indicating Smith's resignation appears beneath the federal attorney's names at the bottom of Page 10 of the filing, which challenges District Judge Aileen Cannon's stay blocking the release of a final report regarding the classified documents case against Trump and two co-defendants.\n\nThe matter now is before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which Boynton argues invalidates Cannon's stay because her jurisdiction is within the district court and not the federal appellate court.\n\nSmith in November announced his intention to resign from the Department of Justice before Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20.","summary":"Special Counsel Jack Smith, who pursued two criminal cases against President-elect Donald Trump, has resigned from the Justice Department, according to a federal court filing made Saturday.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/11/jack-smith-resignation/4401736633752/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4401736633752/2025/upi/8fb32610caad0d5dcd4b6b60c5192ee8/v1.2/Federal-prosecutor-Jack-Smith-resigns-ahead-of-Trumps-inauguration.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:46:41","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":279975588,"title":"Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned after submitting his Trump report, Justice Department says","text":"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump, an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.\n\nThe department disclosed Smith's departure in a court filing Saturday, saying he had resigned one day earlier. The resignation, 10 days before Trump is inaugurated , follows the conclusion of two unsuccessful criminal prosecutions against Trump that were withdrawn following Trump's White House win in November.\n\nAt issue now is the fate of a two-volume report that Smith and his team had prepared about their twin investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the results of his 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. \n\nThe Justice Department had been expected to make the document public in the final days of the Biden administration, but the Trump-appointed judge who presided over the classified documents case granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt its release. Two of Trump's co-defendants in that case, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would be unfairly prejudicial, an argument that the Trump legal team joined in.\n\nThe department responded by saying that it would withhold from public release the classified documents volume as long as criminal proceedings against Nauta and De Oliveira remain pending. Though U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had dismissed the case last July, a Smith team appeal of that decision related to the two co-defendants remained pending.\n\nBut prosecutors said they intended to proceed with the release of the election interference volume. \n\nIn an emergency motion late Friday, they asked the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to swiftly lift an injunction from Cannon that had barred them from releasing any portion of the report. They separately told Cannon on Saturday that she had no authority to halt the release of the report, but she responded with an order directing prosecutors to file an additional brief by Sunday. \n\nThe appeals court on Thursday night denied an emergency defense bid to block the release of the election interference report, which covers Trump's efforts before Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to undo the results of the 2020 election. But it left in place Cannon's injunction that said none of the findings could be released until three days after the matter was resolved by the appeals court.","summary":"Special counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department after submitting his investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump, an expected move that comes amid legal wrangling over how much of that document can be made public in the days ahead.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/judge-who-blocked-release-of-trump-report-was-plainly-wrong-special-counsel-tells-appeals-court/601204534","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/IQ5WHX3GKVEVRLAH743MB3P3ME.jpg?&w=1200&ar=1.91:1&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:42:12","author":"Eric Tucker","authors":["Eric Tucker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.4},{"id":279969236,"title":"Woke ‘cartel’ of financial giants dealt death blow 11 days before Trump takes office: ‘A huge win’","text":"Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT).\n\nThe firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported.

The move was expected ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking the oath of office. Smith’s report on Trump’s alleged involvement in 2020 election interference is expected to be released soon. Trump has denied the allegations. “The Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,” a government court filing said in a footnote. The footnote was part of a Justice Department filing in which the government asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, not to extend a restriction that is temporarily blocking part of Smith’s report from being released. Trump had been indicted on charges related to allegations that he attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election results. He had entered a not guilty plea before the case was dropped. The federal charges, brought by Smith, were dismissed after Trump was elected in 2024. The Justice Department has a longstanding policy not to prosecute a sitting president. Smith was appointed in November 2022 by Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland said at the time that appointing Smith was in \"the public interest\" because Trump had announced his candidacy and Biden was also planning to run for a second term. Garland, who had been appointed by Biden, said in 2022 that his selection of Smith \"underscores the Department’s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters.\" Smith oversaw investigations into Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, as well as allegations that he mishandled classified documents. The former president was indicted in the classified documents case as well, though Cannon dismissed the case in July 2024, deciding that Smith was unlawfully appointed and funded. Trump had pleaded not guilty to all charges. The president-elect frequently criticized Smith, and he said in October that he would \"fire him within two seconds\" of taking office. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this week, a federal appeals court ruled that the Justice Department could release Smith's report on Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The court, however, kept in place Cannon's order that the report's release must be delayed for three days to allow for Trump to consider whether to appeal the decision further. Cannon said in a Saturday order that the Justice Department must submit a filing by 10 a.m. on Sunday confirming that the volume of Smith's report about alleged election interference does not discuss Walt Nauta or Carlos De Oliveira, two co-defendants in the classified documents case. Although the classified documents case against Trump was dropped, Nauta and De Oliveira still face charges. Smith has said that he would not release the second volume of his report regarding the classified documents case as charges against the co-defendants are pending.","summary":"Special Counsel Jack Smith has resigned from the Justice Department ahead of President-elect Donald Trump taking office, officials said in a court filing.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/special-counsel-jack-smith-resigns-trump-rcna187280","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250110-jack-smith-se-546p-040ceb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:38:45","author":"Megan Lebowitz,Ryan J.

Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 to investigate the 2020 election interference case against Trump concerning Jan. 6, as well as the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.

TRUMP PLANS TO ‘IMMEDIATELY’ REVERSE BIDEN'S ‘RIDICULOUS’ BAN ON NEW OIL AND GAS DRILLING ALONG US COAST The news came as the country waits for Smith's report on the election interference case to be released. A recent court filing showed that Garland plans to release the investigative report soon, possibly before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. On Friday, a judge from a federal appeals court ruled not to block the release of Smith's report. \"As I have made clear regarding every Special Counsel who has served since I took office, I am committed to making as much of the Special Counsel's report public as possible, consistent with legal requirements and Department policy,\" Garland wrote in a recent letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, D-Md. TRUMP PRESSES GOP TO SWIFTLY SEND ‘ONE POWERFUL BILL’ FOR HIS SIGNATURE ASAP Once Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Smith motioned to wind down his cases against the president-elect. At the end of November, Smith asked a judge to drop the charges against President-elect Donald Trump in the D.C. case against him. Before asking to drop the case, Smith filed a motion to vacate all deadlines in the 2020 election interference case against Trump in Washington, D.C. – a decision that was widely expected following Trump's win.

(AP) — Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as “Soul Man” and “Hold On, I’m Comin’,” has died. He was 89.\n\nPublicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.\n\nMoore, whose admirers ranged from Al Green to Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\n“Over on E Street, we are heartbroken to hear of the death of Sam Moore, one of America’s greatest soul voices,” Springsteen said Saturday on Instagram. “He was filled with stories of the halcyon days of soul music, and to the end had that edge of deep authenticity in his voice I could only wonder at.”\n\nAt the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater ranked only behind Otis Redding as the label’s biggest stars. They transformed the “call and response” of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music’s most enduring hits, which also included “You Don’t Know Like I Know,” “When Something is Wrong With My Baby” and “I Thank You.”\n\nMost of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music’s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called “Play it, Steve” midway through “Soul Man.”\n\nLike many ’60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the decade ended. But “Soul Man” hit the charts again in the late 1970s when “Blues Brothers” John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the “Saturday Night Live” stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.\n\nIn 2008, the movie “Soul Men” depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.\n\nHe also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.\n\nIn 1993, Moore was among numerous artists who pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated them out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nMoore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.\n\n“Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?” Moore said then. “If you’re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don’t give me cornbread and tell me it’s biscuits.”\n\nMoore also became involved in politics. He wrote the song “Dole Man,” modeled on “Soul Man,” for Republican Bob Dole’s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama’s campaign used “Hold On, I’m Comin’.”\n\nMoore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.\n\nHe and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn’t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label’s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.\n\nMoore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band’s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit, though Moore did work often with Springsteen, whom Moore would call one of his closest friends. They performed together on stage and sang on each other’s albums, including on the high energy duet “Real World.”\n\n“RIP Sam Moore,” Springsteen sideman Steve Van Zandt posted on X. “Him and Dave Prater were the inspiration for me and Johnny to start Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. An important righteous wonderful man.”\n\nHe married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction that he credited with saving his life.\n\n“I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,” during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.\n\n“That’s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,” he said. “But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I’m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.”\n\nMoore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and sang for Obama among other presidents.\n\nMoore is survived by his wife, Joyce; daughter, Michell; and two grandchildren.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Department","text":"US Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican US president-elect prepared to return to the White House.\nSmith resigned on Friday from the US Department of Justice, according to a court filing on Saturday to US District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking her to lift a court order she issued blocking release of his final report.\nNotice of Smith’s resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which said the special counsel had completed his work, submitted his final confidential report on January 7, and “separated” from the Justice Department on January 10.\nA former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the US Supreme Court – with three justices appointed by Trump – found that former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official acts. Neither case went to trial.\nAfter Trump defeated Democratic US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents.\nIn asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith’s team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signalling only that Trump’s impending return to the White House made them untenable.\n\nSmith’s departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming US president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback.\nSmith’s resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump, who has frequently called Smith “deranged”, had said he would fire him immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him once he returns to office.\nTrump in 2023 became the first sitting or former US president to face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 presidential campaign.\nSmith’s charges followed, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that state.\nTrump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed against him and his supporters.\nThe Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.\nGarland appointed Smith in November 2022 – nearly two years after the Capitol attack – to lead the Justice Department’s twin ongoing investigations into Trump. That move came just days after Trump announced a campaign to return to the White House in the 2024 election.\nGarland, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, said Smith would provide a degree of independence in the highly sensitive investigations. Garland had rebuffed earlier calls to name a special prosecutor, insisting he could appropriately oversee the Trump probes.\n\nSmith returned to Washington from The Hague where he prosecuted war crimes cases arising from the 1998-1999 Kosovo War. He previously led the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section and worked in the federal prosecutor’s office in Brooklyn, New York, developing a reputation as a tenacious investigator.\nAt the Hague, Smith won the conviction of Salih Mustafa, a former Kosovo Liberation Army commander who ran a prison where torture took place during the conflict.\nThe indictments, the first federal cases against a former US president, accused Trump of taking highly sensitive national security documents to his Florida resort and using false claims of voter fraud to attempt to derail the collection and certification of votes following his 2020 election loss.\n“The attack on our nation’s Capitol on January 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy. As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies – lies by the defendant, targeted at obstructing the bedrock function of the US government,” Smith said in announcing the election indictment in August 2023, one of only two public appearances he made during his investigation.\nSmith faced a tight window to complete both prosecutions as it was clear Trump would be able to shut them down if he won the election. Both faced legal hurdles.\nIn the classified documents case, Florida-based US District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump nominee, dismissed all charges in July after ruling that Smith was improperly appointed as special counsel.\nSmith’s office appealed that decision. Prosecutors dropped the appeal relating to Trump following his election win, but signaled they will continue a bid to revive charges against two Trump associates who were accused of obstructing the investigation.\nThe election case was paused for months while Trump’s lawyers mounted an appeal for presidential immunity. The US Supreme Court largely sided with Trump in August, ruling Trump could not be prosecuted for many official acts he took as president and sparking more delays in the case.\nSmith acknowledged in court papers that his team faced an “unprecedented circumstance” after Trump won the election over Democrat Kamala Harris. His office concluded both cases could not continue.\nTrump was convicted of falsifying business records following a trial in the New York hush money case, which was brought by state prosecutors. His sentencing was delayed indefinitely after his election win and Trump’s lawyers are seeking to have it dismissed in its entirety.\nThe Georgia case, which also includes charges against 14 Trump allies, remains in limbo while an appeals court determines if the lead prosecutor, Fani Willis, must be disqualified for misconduct over a romantic affair with a former top deputy. The case against Trump is unlikely to move forward while he remains president.","summary":"The special counsel says he has completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on the cases against the US president-elect.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3294394/trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-us-justice-department","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/01/12/8fd49b04-f155-48f1-b4d0-afa08e01619f_d8109fa8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:29:05","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":279967442,"title":"Ukraine not joining NATO is Putin’s main priority ahead of possible meeting with President-elect Trump: ‘Anything can happen’","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s priorities ahead of meeting with President-elect Donald Trump include ensuring Ukraine never joins NATO, according to a new report.\n\nBoth leaders have indicated that they are ready to meet and discuss ending the nearly three-year-long war in Ukraine.

His sentencing hearing, in which Manhattan-based Judge Juan Merchan gave him an unconditional discharge, came less than two weeks before his inauguration.In an attempt to halt his sentencing hearing, Trump's legal team appealed to the Supreme Court. However, in a 5-4 decision a day before the hearing, the Court decided to allow Trump's sentencing to proceed. Chief Justice John Roberts and Barrett, a Trump-appointee, broke with their fellow conservative-leaning justices to side with the Court's three liberal-leaning justices, which has sparked some backlash from Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) base.What To KnowBannon, a supporter of Trump's MAGA movement who hosts the War Room podcast, criticized Barrett and Roberts' decision to side with the Court's liberal-leaning justices in Thursday's decision during a phone call with Newsweek on Saturday afternoon.\"Barrett is a disgrace. A total disgrace,\" he said, calling her decision \"outrageous.\"When asked why he wanted Roberts and Barrett to halt Trump's sentencing, Bannon said, \"Because it's a total sham. All you're doing is empowering this Banana Republic judges and courts to go after future presidents.\"He called the reasoning behind Roberts and Barrett's decision \"completely fallacious.\"What Did the Supreme Court's Decision Say?The Court wrote in a filing Thursday that it was denying Trump's application to halt the sentencing because \"the alleged evidentiary violations at President-Elect Trump's state-court trial can be addressed in the ordinary course on appeal.\"\"Second, the burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial in light of the trial court's stated intent to impose a sentence of \"unconditional discharge\" after a brief virtual hearing,\" the order said.Bannon Calls for Amy Coney Barrett to Step DownBannon, who served as the CEO of Trump's 2016 campaign as well as a White House adviser in his first administration, said that the \"honorable thing\" for Barrett to do is to \"step down, take another job and open that slot up for President Trump to...appoint a true MAGA judge to the Supreme Court.\"Bannon declined to suggest who should take Barrett's place if she were to step down. Barrett, a 52-year-old judge who only assumed office in October 2020, has not signaled any intent to retire from the bench.Bannon Says Clarence Thomas Should Swear Trump InBannon also suggested that Justice Clarence Thomas should be the one to swear Trump into the presidency during his inauguration instead of Roberts, who has the role of swearing in presidents as the head of the Court.When asked why Bannon thinks Thomas should swear Trump in, he said, \"It's the Thomas Court. Justice Thomas is the lead intellectual in this court.\"Details About the Hush Money CaseIn May 2024, a New York jury found Trump, guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to adult film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before his first presidential election in 2016. Daniels alleges she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies. Trump has maintained his innocence, claiming the case is politically motivated.Trump's unconditional discharge means that he will not be punished with prison time, fines or community service. He will, however, have felonies on his criminal record, which changes some things for him moving forward such as his ability to own a gun.What People Are SayingManhattan Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said that Trump's behavior and the \"enduring damage\" he'd caused to the reputation of the justice system would normally result in a heavy sentence. But prosecutors had to \"be respectful of the office of the presidency.\"\"The American public has the right to a presidency unencumbered to pending legal matters...imposing this sentence ensures that,\" he said.Trump lawyer Todd Blanche, pushed back in response to the assistant DA's comments.\"I very, very much disagree with much of what the government just said about this case, about the legitimacy of what happened in this courtroom during this trial, and about President Trump's conduct fighting this case,\" Blanche said.President-elect Donald Trump appeared by video from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for the sentencing, where he addressed the court. He said: \"I'm totally innocent. I did nothing wrong.\"Trump claimed he was the victim of a \"political witch hunt.\"He added, \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I would lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"\"This has been a very terrible experience. I think it has been a tremendous setback for New York and the New York court system,\" Trump said.What Happens NextRoberts' is set to swear in Trump during his inauguration in Washington, D.C., on January 20.","summary":"\"Barrett is a disgrace,\" Bannon told Newsweek, calling her decision to not halt Donald Trump's sentencing \"outrageous.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-donald-trump-sentencing-amy-coney-barrett-2013569","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2562617/bannon-barrett.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:26:38","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.477},{"id":279973524,"title":"Time to make the West great again","text":"Following Donald Trump’s presidential election win, the United States now has a unique opportunity to bring peace to Ukraine and play an enhanced role in restoring the Western-led global system of deterrence and security that has fueled decades of growing prosperity around the world. The war unleashed by Russia in February 2022 has evolved into the bloodiest European conflict since World War II. It began as a result of Russian aggression, but has raged for so long primarily due to Western weakness.\n\nDuring the first year of the full-scale Russian invasion, a combination of Western-supplied weapons and Ukrainian courage led to a series of remarkable military successes including the defense of Kyiv, the liberation of Kherson, and a counteroffensive that allowed Ukraine to take back a great deal of territory in the east. However, the Biden administration then became overcautious and was slow to adjust its support for Ukraine as Russia dug in and adapted to the realities of modern warfare. Crucially, Biden’s policy of avoiding escalation at all costs repeatedly left Ukraine short of vital weapons and ammunition. With the US Congress also deadlocked for an extended period over further military aid, the slow pace of American support caused a great deal of frustration in Kyiv and created tensions between the US and some NATO allies.\n\nThanks in part to insufficient Western backing, Ukraine is currently locked in a grinding WWI-style war of attrition, with Russia benefiting from overwhelming advantages in terms of both manpower and firepower. Nevertheless, Putin’s army has only been able to achieve relatively minor gains during 2024 while suffering unsustainable casualties. The Russian economy is also facing mounting challenges including sanctions pressures, record defense spending, rising inflation, labor shortages, and a weakening ruble. And while Russia still produces more armaments than Europe, the West is closing the gap. Meanwhile, Ukraine now has Europe’s strongest land army, a rapidly expanding domestic defense industry, and is leading the world in drone production. In other words, Russia’s position may be weaker than it at first appears, while Ukraine is better placed than many realize.\n\nThe Trump administration enters office with the chance to reestablish the US’s global leadership and restore international confidence in the West. Securing a meaningful peace deal between Russia and Ukraine would communicate geopolitical strength during a generational moment in global politics. Significantly, Trump has taken personal responsibility for the outcome of the war in Ukraine. He is certainly tenacious when it comes to getting what he wants, as the 2024 election campaign demonstrated.\n\nWhat happens next in Ukraine is likely to become a big part of Trump’s political legacy. He has explicitly stated that previous US foreign policy weakness emboldened Kremlin dictator Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine. Any chance for peace must therefore be rooted in a convincing display of American strength.\n\nA realistic peace process needs to begin by improving the bargaining position of the collective West. This must go beyond short-term military aid commitments to Ukraine. Trump has already rightfully called on every NATO member countries to significantly increase defense spending. EU appeasement of Russia helped pave the way for the current war, so Brussels should be at the forefront of any international efforts to finance a solution.\n\nIt also makes sense to encourage the countries on NATO’s eastern edge to take a lead and provide the greatest amount of support, as they know the Russian menace best and have the most at risk should the Ukraine peace process falter. Most of all, Trump must convince the Kremlin that the West is resolute and willing to significantly increase its support for Ukraine if Russia refuses to join the push for peace.\n\nAfter three years of war, millions of Ukrainians desire a just and long-lasting peace together with credible security guarantees. I’ve lived and worked in Ukraine for more than two decades and have traveled around the country on a regular basis since the start of the full-scale invasion. People in Kyiv and across Ukraine have repeatedly told me about the need for a viable peace to end the needless suffering. Despite sometimes contrary rhetoric from official Ukrainian channels, many Ukrainians are willing to find a path to peace, provided they can be assured that Russia will not return to continue the fight in five to ten years. If Trump can lead the way toward a sustainable peace that provides Ukraine with security and returns stability to Europe, he will secure his own place in history while revitalizing the wider Western world.","summary":"Following Donald Trump’s presidential election win, the United States now has a unique opportunity to bring peace to Ukraine and play an enhanced role in restoring the Western-led global system of deterrence and security that has fueled decades of growing prosperity around the world.

They sent it out to the Pacific because they’re trying to protect a tiny little fish, which is, in other areas, by the way, called the smelt,” Trump said. “For the sake of a smelt, they have no water. They had no water in the fire hydrants today in Los Angeles.”\n\nOn Wednesday, during an interview with CNN, Newsom promptly responded to Trump’s remarks. The governor stood in front of a burning home in Pacific Palisades and said the incoming president was attempting to “politicize” the situation.\n\nThroughout the week, the governor has faced backlash for his response to residents. One emotional mother in the Palisades confronted him Thursday and begged for him to explain how he would help locals. While the woman could be seen pleading with him, the governor said he was on the phone with President Joe Biden before quickly saying he was unable to reach the president after trying to call him “five times.”\n\nBy Thursday, the governor faced additional pushback after California lawmakers began a special legislative session, convened by Newsom, to “Trump-proof” the state’s left-wing laws.\n\nNewsom also on Friday requested that Biden “deal with” people allegedly spreading what he said was “misinformation” about not only the wildfires but also about how he and Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’ have responded to the crisis.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Indications during oral arguments on Friday suggested that the court is inclined to uphold the law, which President Joe Biden signed in April. If the ban is in effect on Jan. 19, the popular social media platform may be removed from app stores, but it probably won’t disappear from users’ phones immediately. User experience could deteriorate over time, as security patches and updates won’t be available to download, CNN reported. However, if the court decides not to block the law or to delay the Jan. 19 deadline, the app’s fate may lie with President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Trump has said he opposes the ban and that he would “save” TikTok. Last month, he asked the Supreme Court to pause the law so that he can “pursue a political resolution” after he takes office. If the court acquiesces, Trump could grant a 90-day extension to TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, to continue seeking a buyer. But ByteDance has long insisted that it is not interested in selling TikTok, and the Chinese government has indicated that it would block any sale that includes the app’s valuable algorithm. There has been at least one U.S.-based offer to buy TikTok without its algorithm, from “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary and billionaire entrepreneur Frank McCourt. TikTok did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment. As president, Trump could also take the more difficult route of trying to reverse the law. He might try to pressure Congress to repeal the legislation, which seems unlikely to succeed, considering it passed with strong bipartisan support. Such a move would also be a major test of his influence over his party, which currently has slim majorities in both chambers of Congress. Otherwise, Trump could direct his Justice Department simply not to enforce the ban and decline to penalize companies that continue to make the app available on their app stores. However, ABC News has reported that some experts are skeptical that companies would be willing to open themselves up to such a risk. In any event, TikTok’s future in the U.S. hangs in the balance for now. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a preliminary decision prior to the deadline.","summary":"If the Supreme Court decides not to block the law or delay the Jan. 19 deadline, the app’s fate may lie with President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated the next day.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/what-happens-tiktok-ban-jan-19-trump-supreme-court-rcna187263","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/GettyImages-2189475702-e993ab.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:19:19","author":"Clarissa-Jan Lim","authors":["Clarissa-Jan Lim"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.433},{"id":279968734,"title":"Bill Maher Blindsides Fans With Staggering Admission About How He Intends to Joke About Trump When The Don Steps Into White House","text":"Bill Maher has revealed how he will calm down on jokes directed at President-elect Donald Trump during his second term in office.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the talk-show comedian said he is \"not going to chase every rabbit down the hole like I did the first term\".During his interview with CNN on Friday, January 10, Maher said: \"He's a kooky guy who says a lot of kooky things, and I'm just not going to pre-hate anything.\n\n\"I'm just going to hope for the best, and then when something serious happens, I'll comment on that.\"\n\nMaher has been a vocal critic of Trump over the years and previously cautioned that a Republican victory in the 2024 presidential election could lead to \"complete devastation\".Maher said fodder like Trump's recent proposals about purchasing Greenland and making Canada the 51st state were still fair game.\n\nThe late-night host explained: \"That's perfect for comedy, but I'm not going to take it seriously.\" \n\nDuring the interview, Maher also reiterated his belief that President Joe Biden is too old to serve as president and should have withdrawn earlier from the election to allow the Democratic Party to hold an \"open\" primary.\n\nHe added: \"I felt like I had standing to make that case because I had for so many years been the only person on television who was consistently railing against ageism. I have been saying for years ageism is the last allowable prejudice that we can have in this country.\n\n\"You can always do the age jokes, you can always rail on people for being too old, and it was, as I said, a case-by-case basis. \n\n\"Some people at 70 act like they are 100 years old, and some are like 40 years old.

Consumer groups say a voluntary agreement is not strong enough and selling unsafe products should be illegal.\n\nTemu signed safety pledges in Canada and South Korea in 2024. However, the Chinese-founded company suspended operations in Vietnam in December, over government concern about deep discounts and a failure to register the business.\n\nNonetheless the former Google engineer and founder of Temu – Colin Huang – reportedly became China’s richest person last year.\n\nIn Guanyun county in China’s eastern Jiangsu province, factory boss Lei Congrui inspects shelves of new stock of what he calls \"erotic clothing\". With Donald Trump's presidency around the corner, Lei is worried about the future of his business. Gabe Singer has more.\n\nA Temu spokesperson told NewsWire signing the safety pledges was “underscoring our commitment to aligning with local regulations and prioritising consumer trust globally”.\n\nTemu’s overarching parent company became the most valuable US-listed Chinese company in 2023, driven by the store’s huge selection of items across clothing, beauty, sports, homewares, hardware, appliances, toys and games.\n\nTemu is officially incorporated in Delaware, and headquartered in Boston. Parent company, PDD Holdings, moved its headquarters to Dublin in 2023.\n\nTemu has been able to forge ahead despite the Chinese regime cracking down on the private sector during the past two years. Temu ads continue to fill screens here in Australia with its gamified store, but makes headlines when the Chinese-made kids clothes and toys are deemed dangerous.\n\nIn July, eight-year-old Queensland girl Daniella Jacobs-Herd was badly burnt when a Temu-sold jumper rapidly ignited. The family had been sitting around a fire pit; the replica ‘oodie’ garment ignited “in a split second”, her mother wrote online.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found the jumper did not comply with mandatory standards because it did not have a fire warning label.\n\nTemu told NewsWire it expanded a review of children’s garments after the incident “as a precaution”, and the specific product was pulled from the store.\n\nTemu did not answer specific questions from NewsWire about how many products the review has identified and banned, or where and how items are checked.\n\nA company spokesperson did say “We require all merchants on our platform to adhere to strict safety standards”.\n\nTemu also keeps a blacklist of repeat-offender manufacturers.\n\n“We enforce these standards through a system of quality control measures, which include requiring relevant documentation, regular spot checks, continuous monitoring, and a reporting channel for the public,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“Products found or suspected to be non-compliant are swiftly removed, and merchants are held accountable through measures including warnings, penalties, product delisting, and account closure.”\n\nDaniella was burnt in July 2024, and the jumper was pulled in September 2024.\n\nThe retailer is “actively engaging” with the ACCC to join Australia’s safety pledge, which would match certified commitments in Asia and North America.\n\n“In December 2024, Temu signed the Canadian (pledge) … In May 2024, Temu signed a similar pledge in South Korea, underscoring our commitment to aligning with local regulations and prioritising consumer trust globally.”\n\nThe ACCC says companies already signed-on are still selling unsafe products.\n\n“This includes products that do not meet mandatory safety standards, or that have been recalled, banned, or otherwise identified as unsafe in Australia or elsewhere,” an ACCC spokesperson told NewsWire.\n\n“The ACCC has been approached by Temu about the pledge. We are seeking further information on their approach to ensuring products supplied through their platform to Australian consumers are safe.”\n\nThe pledge does not replace the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, or Australian Consumer Law. Companies not signed-on are still under scrutiny; the ACCC actively pursues product safety issues with non-signatory sellers.\n\n“If a supplier finds that a product they supply is unsafe, we expect the supplier to follow our guidelines and initiate a recall voluntarily and remove it from the market,” the ACCC spokesperson said.\n\n“Strengthening product safety online … encouraging best practices … and raising awareness to reduce safety risks from goods sold online is a current priority for the ACCC.”\n\nConsumer group Choice says a voluntary pledge is not good enough.\n\n“The voluntary safety pledge, signed by online marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon, has resulted in some significant safety improvements, but compliance is inconsistent,” a Choice spokesperson told NewsWire.\n\n“The ACCC has previously expressed concerns about the number of unsafe products still available for sale across online marketplaces, including some pledge signatories.”\n\n“It is clear that we cannot rely on voluntary measures alone when it comes to product safety.\n\n“Choice is continuing to call on the government to introduce a general safety provision, which would make it illegal for businesses to sell unsafe products in the first place.”","summary":"Bargain Chinese retailer Temu is working with the Australian consumer watchdog to make changes to its product lines.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/bargain-retailer-temu-looks-to-bring-safety-standards-up-to-competitors-level-after-8yo-badly-burnt-c-17360421","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-17360421/dc12ed48f1b6fe29ab6d638fd0bdb8d1db11be61-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-11 22:11:50","author":"Blair Jackson","authors":["Blair Jackson"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.137}]}
