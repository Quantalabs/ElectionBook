Next best was Jobanputra with 19. Vitel Lawes captured 3-23 and Micah McKenzie 2-15.\n\nThe West Indies achieved their run chase in 21 overs as opener Tanez Francis stroked 52 with 5×4 and 1×6 from 55 balls at a strike rate of 94.55 per cent. It was the first 50 of the tournament. Jewel Andrew made 44 from 44 balls as the Caribbean side reached 124-5.\n\nIn other games, India beat the United States of America by six wickets and the game between Scotland and Zimbabwe was rained out without a ball bowled.\n\nThe West Indies will next face Afghanistan on Sunday, starting at 2:20 am Jamaican time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: ICC Under-19 Men’s Cricket World Cup Namibia West Indies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jamaica’s unemployment rate now 3.3 per cent, says STATIN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2026 \n\n\n Jamaica’s unemployment rate stood at 3.3 per cent at the end of October 2025, when compared to 3.5 per cent in October 2024.

It said a total of 1,413,200 persons were employed, reflecting a decline of 3,800 individuals. It said the number of unemployed persons was estimated at 48,800, down from 51,300 the previous year. \n\nMeanwhile, 693,800 individuals were outside the labour force, an increase of 6,300 persons.\n\n“These shifts resulted in an unemployment rate of 3.3 per cent compared with 3.5 per cent in October 2024,” said STATIN.\n\nIt is also reporting that in October 2025, the labour force totalled 1,462,000 individuals, reflecting a decline of 6,300 compared with October 2024. The male labour force fell by 11,900 to 777,200, while the female labour force increased by 5,600 to 684,800. The overall labour force participation rate was 67.8 per cent relative to 68.1 per cent in October 2024.\n\nThe Institute noted that “the data provide an important snapshot of Jamaica’s labour market prior to the passage of Hurricane Melissa on October 28, 2025”.\n\nIt cited that the hurricane caused significant disruption to its field operations, particularly in the western parishes of St Elizabeth, Westmoreland, St James, Hanover, and Trelawny.\n\nSTATIN explained that, “In these areas, STATIN deployed an abridged version of the standard LFS questionnaire to ensure the continuation of data collection while capturing the core labour market indicators. Therefore, some of the usual indicators could not be estimated for the quarter. Data collection for the LFS is typically completed within six weeks of the reference week. However, due to the extensive impact of Hurricane Melissa, both data collection and processing activities were extended by an additional two weeks”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: STATIN Statistical Institute of Jamaica unemployment rate \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kingston man charged with murder \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica—A carpenter of a Kingston address has been charged in connection with the murder of 22-year-old Tyrese Harrison in the parish on Feb... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Catherine man charged following drug bust \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2026 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica—A St Catherine man has been charged with possession of cocaine and dealing in cocaine following a drug bust at his home on Wedne... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Regional \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Guyana, Suriname, T&T not included in latest US visa policy for the Caribbean \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2026 \n\n\n BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (CMC) – Antigua and Barbuda on Wednesday said it has not been officially informed of the latest migration policy of the United St... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Funeral service for Donald Oliver to be held at UWI Mona Chapel \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2026 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The funeral service for late media practitioner Donald Oliver will be held at the UWI Mona Chapel on Saturday, January 24.

Uncertainty over U.S. trade and tariff developments, along with escalating civilian unrest in Iran and rising prospects of U.S. military intervention—potentially heightening tensions across the Middle East—continued to weigh on risk appetite and limit fresh buying interest.Overall, market action remained driven primarily by external cues, with investors remaining cautious and selective rather than aggressive in their positioning.Silver rate todayIn the international market, silver price today is under pressure. The COMEX silver price has opened with a downside gap and currently quoting $90.620 per ounce, 1.85% lower from yesterday's close.On Thursday, MCX silver rate finished 1.59% higher at ₹2,92,601 per kg.Gold rate todayIn the international market, gold price today is under pressure. The COMEX gold price has opened with a downside gap and currently quoting $4,606 per ounce, 0.38% lower from yesterday's close.On Thursday, MCX gold rate finished fkat at ₹1,43,120 per 10 fm.US-Iran latest newsAmid escalating tension between the US and Iran, the UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss Iran's deadly protests at the request of the United States. This has left the entire world guessing about the US President Donald Trump's next move on Iran.On Thursday, Donald Trump changed his stance on Iran while talking to BBC, \"We've been told that the killing in Iran is stopping,\" he said. \"And there's no plan for executions… I've been told that on good authority.\"Stock market todaySpeaking on the outlook of the Nifty 50 index, Ponmudi R, CEO at Enrich Money, said, “After a flat-to-soft opening on Wednesday, the Nifty 50 index gradually drifted lower through the session, retesting key support zones before a modest late recovery attempt. Buying interest once again emerged near the previous day’s low around 25,603, enabling the index to defend the 25,600 zone and attempt a move toward 25,700. However, follow-through buying remained absent, and the index failed to sustain higher levels.”The Enrich Money expert stated that repeated rejection near the 25,900 zone continues to cap the upside, with immediate resistance now positioned around 25,800. On the downside, a decisive break below 25,600 could open the door for further weakness toward 25,500–25,450.“Momentum indicators remain weak—RSI near 40 reflects a bearish bias without oversold conditions, while MACD stays in negative territory. Intraday structure indicates that bears continue to dominate on rallies, even as selective buying emerges at lower support levels,” Ponmudi R of Enrich Money added.On the outlook of the Bank Nifty index, Ponmudi said, “The Bank Nifty index opened on a negative note and remained under pressure during the early part of the session. Although the index attempted an intraday recovery, the move was decisively rejected near the 59,700–59,800 supply zone, reaffirming this area as a strong overhead resistance. Technically, prices continue to trade below the falling trendline, keeping the broader structure weak and suggesting that today’s rebound was corrective rather than trend-reversing.”“Repeated failure to sustain above 59,750–59,800 highlights persistent supply at higher levels. Immediate support is seen at 59,400–59,350, while the 59,000–59,100 zone remains a key demand area. A sustained breakout above 59,800 would be required to shift momentum positively, whereas a decisive breakdown below 59,350 could invite renewed selling pressure toward 59,000,” Ponmudi added.Stocks to buy todayRegarding stocks to buy today, stock market experts — Sumeet Bagadia, Executive Director at Choice Broking; Ganesh Dongre, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Anand Rathi; and Shiju Koothupalakkal, Senior Manager of Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher, recommended these eight intraday stocks for today: NTPC, PNB, Mankind Pharma, LT, SAIL, hBL Engineering, BEML, and Indian Bank.Sumeet Bagadia's stock recommendations today1] NTPC: Buy at ₹349.10, Target ₹380, Stop Loss ₹310.NTPC share price is trading above its key 20, 50, 100, and 200 EMAs, reinforcing the bullish bias. Momentum indicators also support the uptrend, with RSI at 65.62, having recently broken out from an oversold phase and now taking support near the 50 level, signalling sustained momentum.2] PNB: Buy at ₹128.68, Target ₹142, Stop Loss ₹122.PNB share price has recently marked a fresh 52-week high and is consistently moving higher, signalling trend continuation rather than exhaustion, supported by an improving price structure. The stock is trading comfortably above its key 20, 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs, highlighting a strong bullish bias and reinforcing the positive outlook.Ganesh Dongre's buy or sell stocks3] Mankind Pharma: Buy at ₹2240, Target ₹2320, Stop Loss ₹2180.In the recent short-term trend analysis of the stock, a notable bullish reversal pattern has emerged. This technical pattern suggests the possibility of a temporary retracement in the stock's price, potentially reaching around ₹2320.4] LT: Buy at ₹3868, Target ₹4050, Stop Loss ₹3800.The stock has exhibited a strong, notable, and continuous bullish pattern, offering another promising opportunity for short-term traders. The stock is currently priced at ₹3868 and is maintaining a strong support at ₹3800. The technical setup suggests a potential price retracement towards the ₹4050 level.5] SAIL: Buy at ₹152, Target ₹162, Stop Loss ₹145.The stock has exhibited a strong, notable, and continuous bullish pattern, offering another promising opportunity for short-term traders.Shiju Koothupalakkal's intraday stocks for today6] HBL Engineering: Buy at ₹878, Target ₹930, Stop Loss ₹860.The stock, after witnessing a short period of correction, has taken support near the ₹838 zone with a higher bottom formation on the daily chart, currently indicating a significant revival, as evidenced by a positive candle formation that improves the bias. We expect a further rise in the coming days.7] BEML: Buy at ₹1812, Target ₹1910, Stop Loss ₹1775.The stock, after slipping down from the 1915 zone, has consolidated near the 1760 level, taking support, and has currently picked up with a positive candle formation, accompanied by decent volume participation, which improves the bias and anticipates a further rise in the coming sessions. The RSI is currently well-positioned, indicating a positive trend reversal that signals a buy, and can be expected to continue with the positive move, with upside potential visible.8] Indian Bank: Buy at ₹846, Target ₹900, Stop Loss ₹828.The stock has recently witnessed a good run-up and, after a short period of correction, has once again gained strength, currently taking support near the important 50-DEMA level at the ₹816 zone, which has indicated a positive candle formation with significant volume participation to improve the bias and is expected to rise further in the coming sessions.Disclaimer: This story is for educational purposes only.

In the United States they think whales and seals are cute and shouldn’t be hunted. That’s what I’m afraid of,” Kunuk Abelsen, a resident of Kulusuk — a remote Greenlandic settlement with a population of just 241 — told the NYT.\n\n This is the equivalent of “affordability” in Greenlandic politics pic.twitter.com/LeQtgV2bbJ — dylan (@narrenhut) January 15, 2026 \n\nA website devoted to Greenland tourism describes Kulusuk as “a traditional Greenlandic settlement with hunting and fishing in its heart and tourism in its embrace.”\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), which former President Richard Nixon signed into law in 1972, prohibits the unpermitted hunting, harassment, capture, or killing of whales, seals and other marine mammals in U.S. waters and by U.S. citizens on the high seas.\n\nWhile commercial whaling is banned in both the U.S. and Denmark, both countries still allow “aboriginal subsistence hunts” of marine mammals by native populations in Greenland and Alaska — as well as a part of Washington state — respectively. The only three countries that presently allow commercial whaling are Japan, Norway and Iceland.\n\nAnother Greenlander interviewed by the NYT said she has “never heard anyone talk like that about another country before,” referring to Trump’s expressed desire to take control of the Danish territory.\n\nDespite being three times the size of Texas, Greenland only has a population of about 56,000 people — giving it a population density of around 0.07 people per square mile. By comparison, if the island of Manhattan had the same population density as the Arctic territory, it would not even be home to two people. About 80% of Greenland’s area is covered by the massive Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\n“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to The Hill earlier in January.\n\nA statement from Trump’s White House at the time said “the president and his team are discussing a range of options to” pursue their goal to obtain the Arctic Island “and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. John Fetterman expressed openness to the U.S. acquisition of Greenland through peaceful means stating that while he opposes a military invasion of the island, “Ideally we could purchase it. And that’s not scandalous either.”\n\n“That’s been an idea in our history for a while. Ideally, we could purchase it,” Fetterman said.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In 2014, James Watson sold his for over $4 million, having been awarded the medal decades earlier for codiscovering the structure of DNA. The Nobel Prize has become the focus of an ethical debate about who gets to claim it after María Corina Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, offered to share hers with President Donald Trump despite the Nobel Committee's stipulation that the prize cannot be revoked, shared or transferred.ET Budget Survey: Tell us your wishlist It can, however, be sold for millions of dollars. Since the 1980s, the Nobel medal has been made with 18-karat recycled gold, according to the Nobel Committee. And, in a few auctions across the prize's history, it has fetched a wide range of prices.Also read: Trump finally gets a Nobel? Venezuela's Machado 'presents' peace prize medal to US PresidentLive Events Francis Crick, who was awarded the prize with Watson, received over $2 million for his medal. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 1936 to Carlos Saavedra Lamas, a former foreign minister of Argentina, sold for $1.1 million in 2014. But not all attempts to sell the medal have brought staggering returns. The 1994 medal awarded to John Nash for his work in game theory sold for under $1 million in 2019. The 1982 prize awarded to physicist Kenneth Wilson failed to reach a minimum bid of $450,000 in 2016. And William Faulkner's failed to sell in 2013, after bidding stalled at $425,000, short of the minimum. Trump has openly coveted the prize, and Machado dedicated it to him when she received it in October. On Thursday, Machado said she had \"presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" describing a moment during a private lunch earlier in the day.

But the historical record and geopolitical reality suggest that acquiring the island territory would be not only fair compensation for American involvement in Europe since the start of World War II, but also a critical check against encroaching Chinese and Russian influence in the Arctic.\n\nTrump’s latest quip that Greenland’s defense is “two dog sleds” has the global liberal media tripping over itself to “fact-check” this obvious hyperbole and declare Trump an evil imperialist. But Trump is only highlighting a glaring security lapse in what is fast becoming one of the most important regions on the planet. It doesn’t require anything more than basic common sense to understand that Denmark, Europe, the United States, and the entire free world would be better off if Washington, rather than Copenhagen, took the lead on defending Greenland.\n\nThe idea of the United States purchasing Greenland is hardly some wild brainstorm cooked up on social media. American leaders proposed buying the island for $5.5 million as far back as 1868, and again offered $100 million in 1946.\n\nThe strategic logic was obvious even then. Greenland sits astride vital North Atlantic and Arctic sea routes that are becoming increasingly important in the 21st century. The United States also controls the most significant military installation on the island, the Pituffik Space Base, which plays a critical role in missile warning, space surveillance, and Arctic operations.","url":"https://hotair.com/headlines/2026/01/15/europe-should-be-begging-trump-to-buy-greenland-n3810861","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 01:00:00","author":"Beege Welborn","authors":["Beege Welborn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.072},{"id":393336152,"title":"Thanks to 'tariffs'?: Donald Trump claims there is 'virtually no inflation' in America","text":"ANIDonald Trump\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) credited his administration's tariff policy for \"record financial performance\", asserting that the country has \"generated hundreds of billions of dollars\" in revenue with \"virtually no inflation\".In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, \"Great Financial Numbers were released today -- Our Country has never done better!

The funds were approved under Title XLIII – Operation and Maintenance.\n\nThe security budget for the US Africa Command comes against the backdrop of the Christmas Day attacks on terrorists’ hideouts in Sokoto State by the Donald Trump administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, AFRICOM delivered a consignment of military equipment to Nigerian security agencies as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen security operations across the country.\n\nThe NDAA 2026 is a comprehensive bill that outlines defense policy priorities and authorises $901 billion in annual military spending, with a 4 per cent pay raise for troops. AFRICOM requested $413.046m and the same amount was authorised, but the Act did not provide a breakdown of how the funds would be spent.\n\nThe Act was signed into law by President Trump on December 18, 2025, marking the 65th consecutive annual authorisation.\n\nThe $413m budget for security operations comes as West Africa continues to grapple with insurgency, banditry and violent extremism.\n\nIn Nigeria, insurgency in the North-East and banditry in the North-West persist, even as piracy and other maritime crimes remain concerns in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nMali is under persistent attacks by jihadist groups, while northern Benin has witnessed a spillover of violence from the Sahel.\n\nOther commands and activities listed under the operation and maintenance category of the NDAA include the United States European Command with a $385.744m budget, United States Southern Command with $224.971m, US Forces Korea with a $77.049m allocation, Cyberspace Activities (Cyberspace Operations), $331.467m and Cyberspace Activities (Cybersecurity), $550.089m.\n\nThe subtotal for operating forces under operation and maintenance in the Act stands at $39.999b.\n\nThe Act also provides for the establishment of an Assistant Secretary for African Affairs within the US Department of State.\n\nThe office, according to the Act, will oversee matters relating to sub-Saharan Africa and coordinate the implementation of US foreign policy in the region.\n\nIn addition, the Appropriation Act establishes a Bureau of African Affairs, to be headed by the Assistant Secretary, to manage US foreign policy implementation and assistance to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n“(5) BUREAU OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS. (A) ESTABLISHMENT: There shall be in the Department of State a Bureau of African Affairs, which shall perform such functions related to implementation of United States foreign policy and assistance to sub-Saharan Africa as the Under Secretary for Political Affairs may prescribe.”\n\n‘’(B) HEAD: The Assistant Secretary for African Affairs shall be the head of the Bureau of African Affairs.\n\n‘’(9) ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR AFRICAN AFFAIRS: (A) ESTABLISHMENT. There shall be in the Department of State an Assistant Secretary for African Affairs who shall be responsible to the Secretary of State, acting through the Under Secretary for Political Affairs, for “(i) matters relating to sub-Saharan Africa; and “(ii) such other related duties as the Secretary may from time to time designate.\n\n“(B) Responsibilities: In addition to the responsibilities described under subparagraph (A), the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs shall maintain continuous observation and coordination of all matters pertaining to implementation of United States foreign policy in sub-Saharan Africa,” the Act partly read.\n\nThe Act further mandates assessments of Russia’s military strategy, objectives and force posture affecting African countries.\n\nThis includes a review of Russia’s overseas military basing, logistics capabilities and infrastructure used to project power on the continent, as well as the implications for US contingency plans under AFRICOM, US Central Command and US European Command.\n\n“An assessment of the military strategy objectives and force posture of Russia that affect countries in Africa; A description of Russia’s overseas military basing, military logistics capabilities, and infrastructure to project power.\n\n“An analysis of the impact of such an action on the ability of the Armed Forces to execute contingency plans of the Department of Defence, including those in the area of responsibility of United States European Command or in support of operations and crisis response in the areas of responsibility of United States Central Command and United States Africa Command.’’\n\n“The reduction of the risk of executing contingency plans of the Department of Defence, including contingency plans conducted by United States Central Command and United States Africa Command,” the Act stated.\n\nCommenting on the development, a security analyst and Chief Executive Officer of Beacon Consulting, Kabir Adamu, said the funding and policy moves reflected growing geopolitical rivalry in Africa, driven largely by economic interests.\n\nAdamu said Africa, particularly West Africa and the Sahel, had become a strategic arena due to insecurity, weak state control and the presence of critical resources.\n\nAccording to him, Russia and China have expanded their influence across Africa through military cooperation and economic engagement, forcing the United States to reassess its posture on the continent.\n\n‘’First, if you look at the Monroe Doctrine, the US area of influence is its immediate neighbourhood, particularly South America and related regions.\n\n“That is why it moved against Venezuela and also issued threats to Cuba. The other aspect relevant to this discussion is the geopolitical rivalry between the US and Russia.\n\n“In almost all locations where the US has economic interests, Russia and China are already ahead of it. The same applies to Africa. What the US is now trying to do is to catch up.’’\n\n“Russia and China have, in practical terms, taken over much of Africa through their economic interests. In China’s case, it uses loans and other forms of financial assistance to keep Africa within its sphere of influence. The challenge for the US is how to come in and catch up, and it is unlikely that Russia and China will remain passive while the US attempts to do so.’’ \n\nThe counter-intelligence and security risk consultant predicted intense rivalry among the US, China and Russia.\n\n“We are, therefore, going to see an intense period of geopolitical rivalry among these three countries. We do not yet know where the United States intends to establish this bureau. If I were to hazard a guess, Nigeria is a likely option, given the renewed US interest in the country.\n\n“Nigeria offers strategic advantages for the United States. Beyond its resources, Nigeria allows the US to monitor neighbouring countries, particularly Sahelian states such as Niger, especially because of uranium deposits there. Not long ago, the US had to leave Niger.\n\n“If the US can establish a presence in Nigeria, it would still be able to keep an eye on developments in the Sahel. If not Nigeria, other possible locations are in East Africa. Congo is an example, especially given recent efforts to negotiate a peace agreement there.’’\n\nHe added, “Overall, until we know the exact location where the bureau will be established, it will be difficult to draw firm conclusions about the nature of the geopolitical rivalry that will emerge. However, wherever the US chooses to engage in Africa, China and Russia are already ahead in terms of economic interests.\n\n“As stated in the budget, the US will also attempt to assess Russia’s current involvement. Part of that assessment will likely be to develop its own strategy to gain advantages.\n\n“This can force countries to capitulate, but it may also trigger local pushback, and these are issues we should be watching closely. My view is that the primary interest is economic, not military.\n\n“The rivalry is driven by economic interests, particularly access to rare earth minerals such as lithium. There may be other narratives, including claims about stopping Christian genocide in Nigeria, but the Nigerian government has been clear that such a narrative is false and that there is no Christian genocide.\n\n“If you analyse what happened on December 25, the attacks occurred in locations without significant Christian populations. If the aim were to protect Christians, one would expect action in places like Plateau State or Benue State. In fact, officials in Benue have said that after the Sokoto attack, bandits began moving into the state as a result.\n\n“So, the notion of intervention to end Christian genocide is flawed. The interest is economic. One key issue journalists and the National Assembly must raise when it resumes is the nature of any agreement entered into with the American government. Nigerians deserve to know the contents of such agreements.\n\n“We need clarity. If the agreement is economic, it should be made public. If it is military, it should also be made public. “\n\nAdamu, however, stressed that the rivalry was largely economic, noting that access to critical minerals and long-term influence, rather than direct military confrontation, remained the primary drivers of engagement by global powers in Africa.\n\nHe said, “Finally, Nigeria’s foreign policy is based on strategic autonomy. This means Nigeria keeps itself open to relations with any country that offers strategic advantages. Given the current global order and recent US policies, we should expect a rise in what I would describe as multilateral diplomacy.\n\n“This will involve different approaches by the three global powers across different continents. The US will act as it does in its backyard and in Europe, but Russia and China will not remain silent. We are likely to see a complex geopolitical rivalry among these powers, including in Africa.”\n\nSecurity analyst Chidi Omeje pointed out that the evolving relationship between Nigeria and the US should be viewed strictly through the lens of partnership and collaboration, rather than dominance or repression.\n\n Omeje said the current engagements with the US, including through AFRICOM, reflect mutual respect and dignity, noting that this aligns with Nigeria’s long-standing demand to be treated as an equal partner in addressing security challenges.\n\n According to him, many of Nigeria’s security threats are linked to global terrorist networks, stressing that groups operating in the Sahel and Lake Chad regions are not purely local, but part of wider international movements.\n\n He argued that such transnational threats require international cooperation, making partnerships with global powers necessary.\n\n “The key issue here now is that we are now on the level of partnership, not on invasion or any kind of dominance, so we are talking about partnership. The other day, AFRICOM sent some materials to the Nigerian armed forces. This is about partnership and no longer the issue of threats or repression or display of supremacy and the like, so whatever we are doing with them that is based on respect and dignity and partnership is always welcome.\n\n “The issues we are dealing with are actually problems associated with the global terrorist network, and if it is a global terrorist network, partnership and collaboration are welcome.”\n\n Omeje expressed reservations about Russia’s growing security engagements in Africa, saying Moscow lacks the reach and capacity to effectively address Nigeria’s security challenges, given its ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nArmy-US cooperation\n\nIn a related development, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Waidi Shaibu, has called for deeper strategic cooperation between the Nigerian Army and the United States Army to effectively address Nigeria’s evolving and complex security challenges.\n\nThe COAS stated this on Wednesday when the US Defense Attaché to Nigeria, Lt. Col. Semira Moore, paid him a courtesy visit at the Army Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nShaibu commended the United States Government for its enduring partnership and sustained support to the Nigerian Army, noting that the NA has benefitted significantly from American military professionalism and institutional expertise.\n\nThe COAS stressed that the Nigerian Army remains eager to leverage the extensive experience of the US Army in both kinetic and non-kinetic operations.\n\nHe, therefore, advocated the expansion of cooperation in areas aimed at enhancing operational effectiveness, institutional capacity, doctrine development, and strategic capability.\n\nAccording to him, international military partnerships remain critical in complementing Nigeria’s internal security architecture and advancing sustainable peace and stability across the country.\n\nMoore expressed appreciation for the cordial and mutually beneficial relationship between the two armies. She reaffirmed her commitment to strengthening existing ties while exploring new areas of collaboration, particularly in capacity building, intelligence sharing, and joint operational planning.\n\nThe Defense Attaché also disclosed that the United States remains committed to supporting the Nigerian Army in key non-kinetic areas, including humanitarian assistance and troop welfare initiatives, which she noted are essential for sustaining morale and operational effectiveness in the field.","summary":"The US plans to spend $413m on counter-insurgency and security operations in Nigeria and other African nations to combat worsening regional insecurity.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/counter-insurgency-campaigns-us-votes-413m-for-security-operations-in-nigeria-others/","url":"https://punchng.com/counter-insurgency-campaigns-us-votes-413m-for-security-operations-in-nigeria-others/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01005424/USA-flag.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:53:05","author":"Punch Newspapers,Solomon Odeniyi","authors":["Punch Newspapers","Solomon Odeniyi"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":393337004,"title":"European military mission in Greenland as US aim ‘remains intact’","text":"NUUK: A European military mission was taking shape in Greenland on Thursday, drawing a sharp rebuke from Russia, as Denmark said Washington still aimed to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen insisted meanwhile that “dialogue and diplomacy are the right way forward”, hailing in a Facebook post the fact that a dialogue was now “underway”.\n\nThe developments came a day after a White House meeting failed to resolve “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump insists the United States needs to ensure its security.\n\nTwo Danish troop transport planes landed in Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nBritain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have also announced the deployment of military personnel as part of a reconnaissance mission to Greenland’s capital Nuuk, under Denmark’s “Arctic Endurance” exercise organised with NATO allies.\n\nThe modest military reinforcements — 13 soldiers from Germany, for example — are meant to prepare armed forces for future exercises in the Arctic, according to European defence sources. “A first team of French service members is already on site and will be reinforced in the coming days with land, air, and maritime assets,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday.\n\nGermany’s defence ministry said the aim was to “explore the framework conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region”.\n\n‘NATO consensus’\n\nThe foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Thursday that “a working group” was being set up to discuss how Arctic security could be improved.\n\n“However, this does not change the fact that there is a fundamental disagreement, because the American ambition to take over Greenland remains intact,” Frederiksen said, hailing the arrival of European military personnel in Greenland.\n\n“There is consensus within the NATO alliance that a strengthened presence in the Arctic is crucial for European and North American security,” she said.

In the shootings, which happened over the span of a week, Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was killed, and a man, who DHS identified as a “criminal” Venezuelan immigrant, was injured. \n\nFormer D.C. Chief of Homeland Security and Intelligence Donell Harvin accused ICE of not practicing proper police safety. \n\n“If you take the current DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at her word, the ICE agent that shot Ms. Good was following his training, his tactics and policies,” the ex-DHS official told MS NOW’s Ana Cabrera Thursday. \n\n“If that's the case and you take her at her word, then we have a big problem, because what we have is ICE agents that are not practicing proper police or law enforcement officer safety and survivability,” Harvin continued.\n\nNoem said that ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Good, was “experienced.” \n\n“We have ICE agents that are rolling off the assembly line, so to speak, with far, far less training” than the agent involved in Good’s death, Harvin said.\n\nHarvin said news reporting found that ICE recruits receive “47 days of training.”\n\nNew ICE officers used to reportedly receive about five months of training, but three unnamed officials told The Atlantic last August that it was shortened to 47 days because Trump is the 47th president. \n\nThe publication did note that the shortened training was partly due to the elimination of Spanish courses. A senior DHS official told The Washington Examiner that The Atlantic’s reporting was “false.”\n\n“I will tell you that in many states, you can become an animal control officer, but you need twice as much training,” Harvin said. “So think about that.

In the shootings, which happened over the span of a week, Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was killed, and a man, who DHS identified as a “criminal” Venezuelan immigrant, was injured.\n\nFormer D.C. Chief of Homeland Security and Intelligence Donell Harvin accused ICE of not practicing proper police safety.\n\n“If you take the current DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at her word, the ICE agent that shot Ms. Good was following his training, his tactics and policies,” the ex-DHS official told MS NOW’s Ana Cabrera Thursday.\n\n“If that's the case and you take her at her word, then we have a big problem, because what we have is ICE agents that are not practicing proper police or law enforcement officer safety and survivability,” Harvin continued.\n\nNoem said that ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Good, was “experienced.”\n\n“We have ICE agents that are rolling off the assembly line, so to speak, with far, far less training” than the agent involved in Good’s death, Harvin said.\n\nHarvin said news reporting found that ICE recruits receive “47 days of training.”\n\nNew ICE officers used to reportedly receive about five months of training, but three unnamed officials told The Atlantic last August that it was shortened to 47 days because Trump is the 47th president.\n\nThe publication did note that the shortened training was partly due to the elimination of Spanish courses. A senior DHS official told The Washington Examiner that The Atlantic’s reporting was “false.”\n\n“I will tell you that in many states, you can become an animal control officer, but you need twice as much training,” Harvin said. “So think about that.

Democrats would need to take four seats currently held by GOP senators while defending all of their own in order to win back power.\n\nA tough ask, were it not for one major factor: Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican president’s effect on the 2026 Senate map cannot be overstated, and it’s objectively all negative for the Republican Party. That dynamic was true before this week and it was doubly true on Wednesday when Politico reported that Trump, citing four people familiar with his thinking on the matter, has no plans to endorse three sitting Republican senators who are running for re-election this year.\n\nThose three senators are Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and John Cornyn of Texas. \n\nTwo out of the three of those seats are seen as prospective Democratic pickups this year; the third, Cassidy’s, is not seen as endangered in large part due to the failure of Democrats to recruit a prominent candidate to run for the seat. For Collins, the refusal to endorse her may be seen as a gift, given Maine’s independent streak and her own reputation as a maverick in the Senate.\n\nBut for John Cornyn, it could present problems as he tries to fend off two primary challengers, including one, Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, who is leading him in the polls. Paxton is primarying the senator from the right, arguing that Texas would do better if the senator’s traditionalist style were replaced by a dyed-in-the-wool MAGA warrior. Cornyn’s allies have countered that Paxton is too weighed down by his own controversies and would lose the seat to Democrats in the fall should he become the nominee. In a clip highlighted by Paxton, Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett (one of two Democrats running in the primary for his seat) told an interviewer that she didn’t believe “that there’s a Democrat that can take out Cornyn”.\n\nYet in Texas, as in Maine, the president is unwilling to extend a lifeline to a fellow Republican — even one who votes with him much more reliably than Collins. Couple that with news that Democrats have recruited former Rep. Mary Peltola to run against Sen. Dan Sullivan in Alaska, and suddenly Democrats such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, head of the party’s campaign arm, are talking bullish about winning back the majority.\n\nIt’s not just endorsements where Trump has given his party in Congress grief this year. Retirements are affecting the House and Senate GOP caucuses in devastating fashion, and senior Republicans have grumbled behind the scenes that the White House’s iron grip on the Hill is to blame. In the Senate, the president found himself drawn into a feud with Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, last year, only for the senator to turn around and announce that he wouldn’t run for re-election. Democrats are now favored to win his seat as Roy Cooper, the popular two-term governor, is running against a former RNC chair.\n\nOther GOP senators are retiring too, but none under threat of a Trump-aligned primary challenge.\n\nIf Republicans lose the Senate this year, it is a near certainty that many will turn their gaze to the White House. \n\nThe administration, meanwhile, will suddenly be unprotected by a potential twin Democratic majority in Congress, which Trump has openly warned his followers will lead to his third impeachment. More realistically, it will mean the end of any legislative codification of Trump’s agenda and an endless torrent of probes and investigations into the myriad of scandals that have followed the second Trump presidency.\n\nIt will also be a crucial lifeline for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who faced open calls for his removal as Democratic leader after members of his caucus backed down from demands for GOP votes on the extension of expiring federal Obamacare subsidies last fall.\n\nOn Tuesday, he told the Associated Press of his party’s path to a Senate majority: \"I say it's a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago.”","summary":"Trump’s MAGA purity tests could endanger Republicans running in key battles that could decide the fate of his Senate majority, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/senate-republicans-trump-midterm-majority-b2901592.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2026/01/16/0/10/SEI280923486.jpeg?crop=3000,2000,x0,y0.5&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ahssn7kk-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:48:08","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":393336156,"title":"Trump finally gets a Nobel?

Machado did not specify what became of it following the meeting. Trump has previously voiced strong frustration over not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize himself.Does this mean Trump finally gets a Nobel?Machado framed the gesture as symbolic, drawing on historical parallels from the era of independence movements in the Americas. She referenced the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who aided the United States during its war of independence from Britain, and later presented a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar.“Two hundred years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal -- in this case, the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom,” she said.Live EventsThe Norwegian Nobel Committee, however, underscored earlier that the honour itself is non-transferable. In a statement posted on X, the committee said the Nobel Peace Prize “cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others” and stressed that the recipient’s name “stands for all time,” even if the physical medal changes hands.Trump, who has often said he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, was dismissive of Machado when she received the award. His comments came as he continued to advocate the use of force in other contexts, including on Thursday when he warned of stronger action against protesters in the US state of Minnesota.Venezuela, Trump and shifting alliancesEarlier this month, Trump ordered a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the removal of President Nicolas Maduro. The leftist leader has long been described by Washington and several other governments as illegitimate, following elections that were widely criticised for alleged irregularities.Despite backing opposition claims of victory in the last vote, Trump later said Machado lacked the “respect” needed to lead the country. US officials had previously recognised Machado’s political movement as the rightful winner of the election.Machado nonetheless offered a favourable account of her private discussion with Trump. “We are counting on President Trump for freedom in Venezuela,” she said.She added, “President Trump knows the situation in Venezuela; he cares about how the people of Venezuela are suffering.”Machado said she told Trump that Venezuelans “want to live with freedom, with dignity, with justice, we want our children back home, and for that to happen, there has to be democracy in Venezuela.”Trump has previously indicated he would work not with Machado but with Delcy Rodriguez — Maduro’s vice president who later assumed the role of interim president -- warning that she could face force if she failed to meet key US demands, including measures favouring American oil companies.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onMaria Corina MachadoVenezuelaNobel Peace PrizeDonald TrumpUS CapitolDelcy RodriguezNicolas MaduroMarquis de LafayetteBolivar and WashingtonNorwegian Nobel Committee\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onMaria Corina MachadoVenezuelaNobel Peace PrizeDonald TrumpUS CapitolDelcy RodriguezNicolas MaduroMarquis de LafayetteBolivar and WashingtonNorwegian Nobel Committee \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said Thursday she \"presented\" her Nobel Peace Prize medal to US President Donald Trump, who has openly coveted the award that the Nobel committee says cannot be transferred. \"I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Machado told reporters outside the US Capitol following her White House meeting with Trump.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-finally-gets-a-nobel-venezuelas-machado-presents-peace-prize-medal-to-us-president/articleshow/126555142.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-126555153,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-86502,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:43:00","author":"Martin Shwenk Leade","authors":["Martin Shwenk Leade"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.028},{"id":393318884,"title":"‘Trump Island’: Wild call on Aussie city","text":"The Trump family are reportedly scoping out a beachfront lot – 3 Trickett Street, the site of the former Iluka tower – to build a supertower. \n\nThere was strong council interest in any possible development by the Trump Organisation, Gold Coast City council sources told the Courier Mail. \n\nThe rumours were welcomed by Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie, who told the Today Show she’d like to see the Trump Family’s development ambitions in Australia extend beyond a potential skyscraper. \n\n“I stayed at the Iluka Resort site, which is where it’s planned for, but I wouldn’t want him to stop just at that site because we’ve got a couple of islands that could be Trump Island,” she said on Friday.\n\nDunk Island, Keppel Island and Lindeman Island could be ideal for “Trump Island” locations, Ms McKenzie said. \n\nShe claimed the islands were “sitting there underdeveloped … from cyclones and haven’t been rebuilt,” before adding: “So I say, look at the islands while you’re at it, Mr. Trump.”\n\nHowever, the source confirmed there had been no application for the build with the council. \n\n“But we have seen plans with renders.

The worker raised over $800,000 in GoFundMe donations in less than 24 hours, according to fundraising pages and reporting by Business Insider.\n\nThe employee, TJ Sabula, told The Washington Post that he yelled “pedophile protector” at Trump on Tuesday during the president’s tour of the plant where Ford builds its popular F-150 pickup. Video from the event, obtained by TMZ and referenced by Business Insider, shows Trump responding by raising his middle finger and appearing to curse as he walked away.\n\nThe White House called the heckler “a lunatic” who “was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage,” according to Business Insider.\n\nA source from the United Auto Workers confirmed to Business Insider that Sabula was suspended. Laura Dickerson, a UAW vice president, said in an email that the union is examining the suspension. “The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union, the UAW,” Dickerson wrote. “He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we fully support, and we stand with our members in protecting their voice at work.”\n\nDickerson also criticized Trump’s reaction in the video. “Workers should never face vulgar language or behavior from anyone, including the President of the United States,” she said.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, two GoFundMe campaigns supporting Sabula had raised over $480,000 and about $330,000, according to the campaign pages cited by Business Insider. Both pages listed “Thomas Sabula” as the beneficiary and later paused new donations.\n\nUAW worker at Ford factory on Trump flipping him off after he called Trump a “pedophile protector”:\n“Definitely no regrets whatsoever.” pic.twitter.com/KU2rjDgvZX\n— FactPost (@factpostnews) January 14, 2026\n\nOne fundraiser, organized by Sean Williams, reported $480,925 raised from around 21,500 donations. It included an update stating the organizer transferred control of the fundraiser to Sabula. The text urged supporters to “help him pay some bills” and also mentioned demands for the release of files related to the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nA second fundraiser, organized by Diandra Gourlay, described her as “a longtime personal friend of the Sabula family” and stated that donations would support Sabula and his family during the suspension. The page identified Sabula as a father of two and a UAW Local 600 line worker.\n\nBusiness Insider reported that both campaigns paused donations and posted the same update thanking donors while encouraging support for other causes. “TJ and his family greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time, we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support,” the update said.\n\nSabula told The Washington Post he had “no regrets whatsoever,” Business Insider reported. “I don’t feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,” he added.\n\nThe spike in donations followed Trump’s visit, which Business Insider described as aimed at highlighting the White House’s focus on rebuilding the U.S. workforce and Ford’s efforts to create a blue-collar workforce pipeline.","summary":"The suspended autoworker drew a wave of financial support after video of his confrontation with the president spread online.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/suspended-ford-worker-who-heckled-trump-gets-over-800k-in-gofundme-donations","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/White-House-Defends-Donald-Trump-Flipping-Off-Ford-Factory-Worker.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:30:52","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":393319082,"title":"Donald Trump claims there is ‘virtually no inflation’","text":"US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) credited his administration’s tariff policy for “record financial performance”, asserting that the country has “generated hundreds of billions of dollars” in revenue with “virtually no inflation”.In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “Great Financial Numbers were released today — Our Country has never done better!

Trump Posts From Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) January 15, 2026\n\nThe remarks come amid ongoing debates within the United States over trade policy, inflation trends and the broader impact of tariffs on consumers and global markets.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said his administration’s tariff policy is the cornerstone of the “strongest and fastest economic turnaround” in the country’s history, asserting that it has brought hundreds of billions of dollars into the United States Treasury and “helped curb inflation”.Speaking at the Detroit Economic Club after touring Ford Motor Company’s historic River Rouge Complex, Trump said, “I am back in Michigan to report to you on the strongest and fastest economic turnaround in our country’s history. Under our administration, growth is exploding, productivity is soaring, investment is booming, incomes are rising, inflation is defeated, and America is respected again. Just as I promised you, I’ve imposed a 25 per cent tariff on all foreign automobiles,” adding that the move had transformed the domestic auto sector.“U.S. auto factories are now seeing more than $70 billion of new investment, and much of that money is coming right here to the car-making capital of the world, Detroit,” he said.Defending his broader tariff strategy, Trump claimed it had delivered substantial fiscal gains. “They brought hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury, helped curb inflation, and helped cut the federal budget deficit by a staggering 27 per cent and that’s only for a short period of time,” he said.Rejecting criticism that tariffs raise prices for consumers, Trump added, “Every prediction the critics made about our tariff policy has failed to materialise. The evidence shows overwhelmingly that the tariffs are not paid by American consumers. They’re paid by foreign nations and middlemen. Once again, the so-called ‘experts’ were 100 per cent wrong and Trump was right.” (ANI)","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2026/01/donald-trump-claims-there-is-virtually-no-inflation/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ANI-20260116000828.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:30:07","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.16},{"id":393322026,"title":"‘I have an economics degree from a fantastic university’: I’m 71 with $3 million and earn $250K.

The Moneyist regrets he cannot reply to questions individually.\n\nDear Worker,\n\nThat is the short and sweet response. Here’s the long one:\n\nI applaud the fact that you are pulling in $250,000 with $3 million in investable assets to fall back on, and $60,000 a year in Social Security benefits. It tells me that you enjoy staying busy is important for your mental and cognitive health, and that you are someone who benefits from structure and gets a kick out of setting goals. You and your wife should explore Roth conversions for when you enter a lower tax bracket.\n\nYou have some sticky wickets ahead, namely, your required minimum distributions on any 401(k)s or IRAs will kick in when you turn 73. You are, lest we forget, already in a high income-tax bracket. Even if you took $110,000 to $115,000 from your investments, you would still be in the 4% withdrawal range. At 73, you would have to take $113,000 a year ($3 million divided by 26.5), assuming they’re all tax-deferred accounts.\n\nWith a 3% mortgage rate and a healthy bank account and income at 71, it does not make sense to withdraw a large amount of money to pay off the remainder of your $300,000 mortgage, especially given the amount you would have to take out before taxes. At 3%, you’re more or less staying current with inflation. But I would start taking money from your tax-deferred investments now (even if it’s just $50,000 a year).\n\nYour wife is an important character in this story, personally and financially.\n\nYou don’t say much about your wife, but she is an important character in this story, both personally (obviously) and financially. At 67, your wife likely has her own Social Security benefit — or, at least, spousal benefit. If she had a working life, you will likely have two sources of investment income in your retirement; that’s also something to think about should one of you predecease the other and fall into the “spousal tax trap.”\n\nMarginal tax brackets and capital gains also raise their heads, as you and your wife start to draw down your investment income. Falling over an IRMAA (income-related monthly adjustment amount) cliff can result in an unwelcome increase in Medicare Part B and Part D premiums. A higher income can also trigger the 3.8% net investment income tax and, in some states, additional state income taxes. \n\nYou are an anomaly. Most people who keep working in their 70s do so because they need the money. A small minority of people (19%) between 70 and 74 still work, according to the Pew Research Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. You could comfortably retire and take your 4% withdrawals — and your investments would, all going well, last you until your last day. You clearly enjoy your work.\n\nDon’t miss: 2025 has been one hell of a year. Consumers should expect more ‘silent pain’ in 2026.\n\nMore older Americans are working\n\nOlder Americans are, for better or for worse, working more hours, on average, than in previous decades, Pew researchers found. Roughly 62% of older workers are working full time, compared with 47% in 1987. They’re more likely to have a four-year college degree than prior decades, and, not surprisingly, 44% of older workers have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared with 18% in 1987. \n\nWhat’s more, aging workers are more likely to contribute to the economy than previous generations. “They’re more likely than in previous decades to be receiving employer-provided benefits such as pension plans and health insurance. The same does not hold true for younger workers, whose access to these employer-provided benefits has decreased in recent decades.”\n\nThe downside is that they work out of necessity. One poll by Bankrate, the personal-finance site, found that more than half (57%) of Americans working full-time, part-time or who are temporarily unemployed feel behind on their retirement savings. “Many are pessimistic they’ll be able to meet their goals — 48% of workers with a specific retirement goal in mind don’t think it’s likely they’ll be able to save that much.”\n\nLooking ahead, your main risks are tax inefficiency and healthcare costs.\n\nYou are one of the lucky ones. “Americans are unable to meet their retirement goals as they struggle financially due to high inflation, high interest rates and a weakening job market,” according to Bankrate. “Some may also be deprioritizing their retirement contributions to focus on paying for their day-to-day essentials. But that puts them at risk of being unable to retire in their golden years.”\n\nI get why you are hesitant to give up your six-figure job, even if you don’t necessarily need to keep working. Consumer sentiment has fallen in recent times, and people are concerned about the stock market’s bull market, wondering how long it will last. The stock market has defied many foes, including inflation, President Donald Trump’s tariffs (notwithstanding April’s correction), geopolitical unrest and high interest rates.\n\nYou are financially independent and continuing to work is a lifestyle choice, I hope, and not because you are afraid to let go and enjoy more leisure time. Looking ahead, your main risks are tax inefficiency and healthcare costs; with $3 million in investable assets, you are unlikely to run out of money if you retire today. A phased retirement plan with a reduced workload could give you the best of both worlds.\n\nHave faith in your own financial stability. \n\nDon’t miss: ‘I fear a significant decline in the S&P 500’: Do I sell my tech stocks before it’s too late?\n\nCheck out the Moneyist private Facebook group, where members help answer life’s thorniest money issues.

Bush announced in 2001.\n\nBut sometimes that’s just what happens.\n\nLast week, for instance, Russia’s Vladimir Putin unleashed an Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile on Ukraine, supposedly in response to a drone attack on one of his residences.\n\nIts six hypersonic warheads came down like bolts of lightning, Putin later crowed, asserting that his show of force demonstrated Russia’s unstoppable military prowess.\n\nUkrainians, however, were not impressed.\n\nOreshnik was designed to deliver nuclear warheads, which only need to land within a few hundred meters of the aimpoint. Conventional weapons require much greater accuracy.\n\nThe strike was roughly as powerful as a single 2,000-pound bomb, but spread out over six impact sites across a wide area.\n\nOne warhead reportedly hit a building, punching down into a sub-basement where it destroyed an archived collection of the works of Lenin. Others made holes in the ground.\n\nThis performative action convinced no one but Putin’s most dedicated fans — and even they may have rolled their eyes at wasting a $40 million missile to do less damage to Ukraine than Russia’s nightly waves of small, cheap Shahed drones inflict.\n\nSimilarly, Iran’s leadership last year mounted what it called “devastating and powerful missile” strikes on US military bases in Qatar in response to the destruction of its nuclear facilities.\n\nIn fact, the missiles were intercepted and there were no casualties; the face-saving move allowed Iran’s leadership to accept a cease-fire with Israel.\n\nThe domestic audience may have been fooled, but the operation convinced the rest of the world of Iran’s weakness.\n\nContrast these with Operation Absolute Resolve, which captured Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela this month.\n\nIt too was a comparatively small operation with few casualties; Maduro was quickly replaced by his deputy.\n\nYet the mission sent seismic shock waves through the entire region and exposed Venezuela’s ineffectual military in the face of US power.\n\nAbsolute Resolve was a show of force done right: a political goal achieved without an invasion, mass bombings or civilian casualties.\n\nBut another recent US intervention, the December airstrikes targeting Islamic State militants in Nigeria, was no such triumph.\n\nThe operation included Tomahawk cruise missiles as well as Hellfire missiles from Reaper drones — with underwhelming results.\n\nFive buildings were reportedly hit, causing some injuries but no deaths, and images of the debris showed at least four cruise missiles failed to detonate.\n\nRather than demonstrating American military power, the strike may have highlighted its limits against the ongoing Nigerian insurgency.\n\nThis mixed history helps explain Trump’s hesitation to aid Iran’s protesters with military strikes.\n\nThe regime’s leadership will have gone to ground, making themselves difficult targets, and hitting air bases or other large military installations won’t short-circuit Tehran’s attacks on its people.\n\nAmerican air power could target oil facilities, telecommunications or power plants to push regime change — but such strikes could create ill will and spread chaos.\n\nA full-scale invasion in support of the protests is out of the question; any action must be carefully calibrated, precisely directed and carried out with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nIf not, Iranian propaganda may succeed in making the United States look like the enemy, rallying support to the regime — a significant defeat for Trump’s foreign policy.\n\nSo what’s on the table?\n\nA decapitation strike against Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei might just be possible; American intelligence can still pull off surprises, as we saw in Venezuela — and if Khamenei can be found, he can be hit.\n\nAlternatively, strikes against Iran’s national police or the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would send a strong message that the United States sides with the protesters, while weakening the state’s ability to suppress them.\n\nStrikes might focus on those forces’ leadership and arsenals, or on symbolic targets such as buildings besieged by protesters — requiring very precise, up-to-date intelligence from inside the country.\n\nAnd while cyber and other electronic operations supporting the protesters are important, putting America’s stamp on the operation will require something visibly successful — and, ideally, spectacular enough to turn the tide.\n\nScripting such a show of force will require as much political finesse as high-tech firepower.\n\nDavid Hambling is the author of “Swarm Troopers: How Small Drones Will Conquer the World.”","summary":"A well-done show of force overawes an opponent, but a misfire signals weakness and escalates conflict — making the prospect of a strike on Iran a major challenge.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/15/opinion/trumps-iran-quandary-is-a-question-of-strategic-warfare-and-showbiz/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2026-demonstration-mullah-regime-iran-118857299.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:23:36","author":"David Hambling","authors":["David Hambling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":393324664,"title":"US announces 'major sporting event' exemptions from broad visa bans","text":"The Trump administration has identified a host of athletic competitions it classifies as \"major sporting events\" — aside from soccer's 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games — that athletes and coaches will be allowed to travel to the US to take part in, despite a broad visa ban on nearly 40 countries.\n\nIn a cable sent to all US embassies and consulates, the State Department said athletes, coaches and support staff for the World Cup, the Olympics and events endorsed or run by a long list of collegiate and professional sporting leagues and associations, would not be subject to the full and partial travel bans that apply to citizens of 39 countries and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nHowever, the cable made clear that foreign spectators, media and corporate sponsors planning to attend the same events would still be banned unless they qualify for another exemption.\n\n\"Only a small subset of travellers for the World Cup, Olympics and Paralympics, and other major sporting events will qualify for the exception,\" it said.\n\nDonald Trump's administration has issued a series of immigration and travel bans as well as other visa restrictions as part of ongoing efforts to tighten US entry standards for foreigners.\n\nAt the same time, the administration has been looking to ensure that athletes, coaches and fans are able to attend major sporting events in the US.\n\nTrump's December 16 proclamation banning the issuance of visas to the 39 countries and the Palestinian Authority had carved out an exception for athletes and staff competing in the World Cup, the Olympics and other major sporting events.

They demanded he roll down his window and show his papers. When he didn’t comply, they shattered the window and dragged him out, pressing him against the ground until his body went limp. They carried him into a dark, unmarked van and drove away. \n\nWatching the video of his arrest on Monday, his sister Consuelo was sure he was dead. It wasn’t until a day later that she could confirm he had survived – and that he’d been sent to an infamous detention tent camp in Texas. She told HuffPost she was able to speak to him for “a few seconds” over the phone.\n\n“He only managed to tell me that he is very injured,” she said. A friend who helped set up a GoFundMe page for the family shared photos with HuffPost showing the aftermath of the incident ― Serrano’s car, windows busted out, sitting in a suburban driveway. \n\nIn the week since Good was killed, federal agents have continued to pour into Minnesota. The state calls it an “invasion.” The Trump administration has deployed a massive amount of force to Minneapolis — 800 Border Patrol and 2,000 Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers, amounting to five times the headcount of the Minneapolis police force. President Donald Trump has threatened even more by invoking the Insurrection Act, which would send the U.S. military to police the streets. On Wednesday night, federal agents shot a man in the leg during what they said was an immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“To us, these are red coats,” Chris Lund, an attorney working to free a community member who’d been arrested and detained in the Whipple Federal Building told me, as federal agents glared at us from across the way. “These are imperial agents that are here to hurt us.”\n\nDespite the awesome force arrayed against them, Minnesotans are fighting back. When federal agents arrive in a neighborhood, residents hound them. The near constant use of chemical agents and physical violence doesn’t stop resident’s efforts. The orange stain of pepper spray has become something of a mark of pride among locals ― evidence they have stood up for their neighbors. Many of those neighbors are too scared to leave their homes; when they do, they carry proof of citizenship.\n\nOne volunteer, Elanor, said there are some tell-tale signs of federal vehicles: masked men, of course. Out-of-state plates, especially those covered by snow ― real or fake. “Reckless driving” is another trademark, she said: “running red lights, driving well over the speed limit.” (Many people who spoke with HuffPost asked to be identified by only their first name or to remain anonymous given the potential for retribution by law enforcement or employers.) \n\nGroup chats buzz, directing concerned residents to where they might be able to confront agents. Around the Twin Cities dozens of volunteers ― some in neon vests, others more incognito, behind masks and beanies ― track the movements of vehicles they suspect might belong to the federal mission.\n\nCaravans of cars or jeering crowds of pedestrians quickly form when the feds are spotted, accompanied by a cacophony of car horns and whistles. Immigration agents seem willing to do almost anything to stop it, from scanning people’s license plates and then leading them on a drive to their own homes, to breaking people’s windows and detaining them. Then there are the threats: “Don’t make a bad decision today!” “Go home to your children, it’s Sunday. You did not learn from what just happened!” “You guys gotta stop obstructing us. That’s why that lesbian bitch is dead.”\n\nSeveral times when HuffPost was present, immigration agents flashed a middle finger at observers gathered outside the Whipple Building as they drove off. One pair did a coordinated “6-7” meme. One agent made a distinct “A-OK” shape with his hand.\n\nThough ICE is the bigger force, Border Patrol and its on-the-ground commander Gregory Bovino carry out many of the most brutal operations.\n\nThe public face of the federal occupation in Minnesota, Bovino, a roving Border Patrol commander, has a well-earned reputation for police brutality and racial profiling. Federal judges have issued rulings attempting to restrain his behavior in California and Illinois. But his practice in this administration of jumping from state to state ― as well as an assist from conservatives on the Supreme Court, who embraced racial profiling ― has allowed him to operate effectively with impunity. \n\nAfter Ross shot and killed Good, Bovino said “hats off” to the killer, and in response to a tweet saying the Department of Homeland Security had killed an American citizen, Bovino’s account responded: “Triggered much?” \n\nBovino expresses disdain for people who get in his way. In a Monday interview with CBS’ Twin Cities affiliate, WCCO, he warned that “weaker-minded people” might “fall victim” to the likes of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, or “a community activist that has an agenda.” \n\nThat same day, videos showed two Target workers, both U.S. citizens, taunting Bovino and several other agents. “Hey, are you guys American citizens?” Bovino asked, marching toward them. “None of your business,” they replied. “Fuck you.” Before long, an agent ran after the pair and tackled them to the ground. DHS claimed later that this was for the offense of “impeding federal officers”. Rather than book the young men in jail and put them in front of a judge, at least one of them was simply dropped off several miles away, sobbing and bleeding. \n\n“I’m not OK!” he cried. “They slammed me on the fucking ground!”\n\nBovino was also present at the gas station Sunday, snarling at protesters to step back as his men squeezed the wind out of Serrano. \n\nOnce they loaded the unconscious man into their van, the Border Patrol convoy took Serrano to their home base: the massive, and recently fortified, Whipple Federal Building. \n\nThere, over the next several hours, agents pelted a crowd of angry protesters with pepperballs, gas and flash bang grenades. They shoved them and arrested them. \n\nThe agents take that same posture on the streets of Minneapolis. \n\nRecently, they broke down the door to one home despite not having a judicial search warrant. They frequently approach people on the street and simply demand to see their papers, threatening prolonged detainment if they don’t comply. They’ve deployed chemical irritants at a school. Separately, they dragged one woman ― who said she was on her way to a doctor’s appointment ― out of the window of her sedan. “I’m autistic and I have a brain injury — put me down!” the woman screamed as officers carried her by her extremities. “I’m disabled and I need accommodations!” \n\nOn Monday, Border Patrol agents tried to force their way into a neighborhood pizza place that had recently raised over $83,000 to help families impacted by the surge of immigration agents in the area. When a crowd gathered to confront the agents, one of them deployed a teargas canister and drove off. \n\nDHS did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about its officers’ use of force. \n\nTerrorized by their own government, many people have quit public life altogether. Some pregnant patients are too afraid to come in for prenatal care, a registered nurse said. Kids are asking what to do if ICE shows up at school, a school administrator lamented. Most stalls were closed at Mercado Central, a colorful indoor market selling food, toys and clothing, on Sunday.\n\n“People don’t want to go out,” a man working a flattop grill said in Spanish. “People aren’t coming to the market. Sales are very low, and that affects us.” \n\nFor some, the surge of immigration agents is dredging up decades-old trauma. \n\nJosefina Catalan, now 51, said her mother was deported when she was 3 years old. She was left with a caretaker whose husband molested her, she recalled. Catalan became legalized thanks to the Reagan administration’s amnesty program. \n\n“I understand the feelings of the children at this moment,” she said, referring to Good’s kids, including a 6-year-old son. “They’re going through the nightmare I went through when I was a child.”\n\nAt the makeshift memorial on Portland Avenue, where Good was killed, a group of Somali women passed out free sambusas and tea to the crowd. Trump flooded the Twin Cities with DHS agents seemingly due to a conservative influencer’s viral video smearing Somalians. The women were among the many residents who now carry their documents with them everywhere they go, intent on being able to show they’re citizens if federal officers stop them. Sometimes, it’s not enough.\n\nAbdirhman Ahmed Hassan and Ahmed Ahmed, U.S.-born cousins who are both 21 years old, said ICE had “yanked” their uncle from his car and pointed a gun at him, despite him presenting a valid passport. \n\nWhen asked how Minneapolis has felt in recent weeks, Hassan responded in one word: “Germany.” \n\n“People stopping you for random bullshit,” he said. “It’s frightening.” \n\nOne Ojibwe woman said encountering immigration agents would be terrifying, even if she were able to show them her tribal ID. \n\n“I’d probably end up getting shot by them, because I’d freak out, you know?”\n\nAt the Whipple Federal Building, protesters gather daily to translate their neighbors’ fears into outrage. The street outside the main gate, which immigration agents pass through daily, has become the closest thing to a town square the people of the Twin Cities have to air their grievances with the provisional local government. \n\nOne recent night, Heidi Leaf, a project manager, was one of several people using megaphones there to full effect, not only giving the agents a piece of her mind but, as she told me, laying a curse upon them for their deeds. \n\n“Your bloodline ends with you!” she chanted, over and over. (“The main curse is much longer,” she noted.) \n\nJames McGuiggan, a retired Air Force staff sergeant who wore an Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran hat and a T-shirt that read “No One Is Illegal on Stolen Land,” smoked nearby and expressed himself with his middle finger.\n\n“This is fucked up… This is a land of immigrants,” McGuiggan said. He was the only one in the crowd not to flinch when federal agents suddenly deployed another round of flash-bang grenades in the air above us. “Oh, fuck you!” he yelled instead.\n\n“I was fucking in Andrews [Air Force Base], guarding fucking presidents ― Air Force One ― and never fucking thought this would happen,” he said, gesturing around him. \n\n“Everything I feel like I did was for nothing, because now they’re doing this shit to people ― shooting American citizens just for trying to protect people.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minneapolis-trump-ice-local-resistance_n_6966ad39e4b0dd199b1aa10d?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6966ad55140000eb3364c285.jpg?cache=6ZWdrjeDp8&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:20:58","author":"Matt Shuham","authors":["Matt Shuham"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":393315856,"title":"Inside The Invasion Of Minneapolis","text":"TWIN CITIES, Minn. — Four days after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, federal agents in St. Paul constrained the airflow to a man’s neck until he became unconscious.\n\nOrbin Mauricio Henríquez Serrano, a Honduran national, was at a Speedway on Sunday afternoon when a dozen masked Border Patrol officers suddenly swarmed his vehicle.

While Trump’s “America First” strategy aimed to bolster domestic interests, it inadvertently accelerated China’s ascent on the world stage. This emergence is notably marked by China’s increasing influence in international trade and geopolitical alliances, altering the fabric of global influence.\n\nShifting Trade Policies and Economic Strategies\n\nThe Trump administration’s emphasis on protectionism reshaped international trade, setting the stage for China to fill the void left by the United States. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods, while intended to revive American manufacturing, led to a protracted trade war that had mixed results for both nations. However, China adeptly maneuvered around these barriers, strengthening economic ties with other global players and continuing to expand its Belt and Road Initiative. This multinational investment strategy allowed China to extend its economic reach into Africa, Asia, and Europe, forging new partnerships and enhancing its global stature.\n\nChina’s response to the U.S. trade policies was twofold: diversification of its trading partners and bolstering domestic innovation. As the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), China moved to secure trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, positioning itself as a central economic figure. Concurrently, significant investments in technology and infrastructure have cemented China’s role as a leader in various sectors, including renewable energy and telecommunications.\n\nGeopolitical Influence and Strategic Alliances\n\nAlongside economic influence, China’s geopolitical presence has grown noticeably. Trump’s foreign policy decisions, characterized by a rearrangement of traditional alliances, granted China the opportunity to strengthen diplomatic ties worldwide. The U.S.’s retreat from global agreements and perceived commitment to unilateralism opened avenues for China to present itself as a stable, reliable partner on issues ranging from climate change to trade.\n\nChina’s assertive stance in the South China Sea and its strategic partnerships with countries like Russia and Iran reflect its broader geopolitical ambitions. By bolstering military capabilities and engaging in regional diplomacy, China aims to fortify its position as a global power. This has coincided with its increasing presence in international institutions, where it seeks to exert influence and shape global norms to align with its national interests.\n\nThe Impact on American Influence\n\nThe consequence of these shifts has not gone unnoticed in the United States. Insightful analysts and policymakers are examining the long-term implications of this transition. The U.S. must navigate a complex global landscape where its traditional role as a dominant influence is challenged by a rising China. This necessitates a recalibration of diplomatic strategies and an exploration of new alliances to ensure that American interests are safeguarded in an adapting world order.\n\nThe growing challenge from China underscores the urgency for the U.S. to innovate and invest in cutting-edge industries, education, and infrastructure. Renewed focus on domestic capabilities can help counterbalance China’s momentum, securing America’s position as a global leader. Observers highlight the need for strategic engagement and collaboration on international issues that require collective effort, such as climate change and technology standards.\n\nAs the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, the competition between the U.S. and China marks one of the most significant political narratives of our time. While the strategic contest shapes up, what remains clear is the transformative impact of these shifts, not only on the two countries involved, but on the broader international community. The world watches closely as these developments unfold, knowing that the outcomes will have lasting repercussions for global governance and economic stability.\n\nThe era of shifting global influence calls for careful analysis, strategic foresight, and a commitment to adapting to changing realities. The world stands at a crossroads, and the choices made in Washington, Beijing, and beyond will define the direction of international relations for generations to come.","summary":"As global dynamics shift, China's rise is gaining momentum, accelerated in part by former U.S. President Donald Trump's \"America First\" policies. While aimed at strengthening the U.S., these strategies inadvertently opened doors for China to expand its influence, particularly through trade and diplomacy. By forging new partnerships, investing in innovation, and stepping into leadership roles in international institutions, China is reshaping the global order.

The announcement, made on Thursday, signals a shift from ceasefire management to post-war governance and reconstruction, even as major political and security disputes remain unresolved.Peace board unveiled on Truth SocialPresident Trump revealed the development in a post on his Truth Social platform, framing the “Peace Board” as both historic and prestigious.“It is my Great Honor to announce that THE BOARD OF PEACE has been formed. The Members of the Board will be announced shortly, but I can say with certainty that it is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place. Thank you for your attention to this matter!,” Donald Trump wrote.The Board of Peace was first proposed by Trump in 2024 as a transitional authority that would oversee Gaza’s reconstruction and supervise a technocratic panel of Palestinian administrators tasked with day-to-day governance.Structure and international roleAccording to officials familiar with the plan quoted by AFP, the Peace Board for Gaza expected to include international figures, with representation from Arab states, and Trump has indicated that he intends to chair it himself. The body would exercise oversight over a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, designed to operate independently of armed factions.Trump had earlier suggested that former UK prime minister Tony Blair would be involved, but Blair later withdrew from the initiative following criticism, particularly over concerns that the framework sidelines Palestinian self-determination.The proposal has faced pushback from Palestinian groups and international observers who argue that it risks imposing external governance on Gaza without a clear pathway to an independent Palestinian state.Phase two begins amid unresolved tensionsThe Board of Peace announcement comes as the broader US-backed plan formally enters its second phase, despite lingering disputes between Israel and Hamas over alleged ceasefire violations and obligations left unmet during the first stage.Phase one, part of a 20-point proposal unveiled by Trump, began on October 10 and focused on halting hostilities, facilitating humanitarian aid and securing the return of hostages held by Hamas and allied Palestinian militant groups. All hostages have now been returned, with one exception: the remains of Israeli Ran Gvili.Israel has accused Hamas of delaying the handover of Gvili’s body, while Hamas has said the extensive destruction in Gaza has complicated recovery efforts. Gvili’s family urged mediators to delay the transition to phase two.“Moving on breaks my heart. Have we given up? Ran did not give up on anyone,” his sister, Shira Gvili, said after mediators confirmed the move.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said efforts to recover the remains would continue, but has not publicly commented on the launch of the second phase.Ceasefire violations and humanitarian concernsHamas has accused Israel of repeated ceasefire violations, including air strikes, firing on civilians and advancing the so-called “Yellow Line,” an informal boundary separating areas under Israeli military control from those under Hamas authority.Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said Israeli forces had killed 451 people since the ceasefire took effect. Israel’s military has said it targeted suspected militants who crossed into restricted zones near the Yellow Line, adding that three Israeli soldiers were also killed by militants during the same period.Humanitarian agencies say Israel has not permitted the volume of aid envisaged under phase one, a claim Israel rejects. Gaza continues to face acute shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel, with Israel and the United Nations disputing figures on the number of aid trucks allowed into the territory.Governance and disarmament at the heart of phase two in GazaUnder phase two, Gaza is to be administered by a Palestinian technocratic committee operating under the supervision of the Board of Peace. Hamas has signalled conditional support for the committee’s role.“The ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee,” Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas leader, said on Thursday.Mediators Egypt, Turkey and Qatar have said Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority, has been appointed to lead the committee. Egyptian state television later reported that all committee members had arrived in Egypt and begun preparatory meetings ahead of entry into Gaza.Al-Qahera News, which is close to Egypt’s state intelligence services, said the move followed US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff’s announcement on Wednesday “of the start of the second phase and what was agreed upon at the meeting of Palestinian factions in Cairo yesterday”.Shaath has said the committee would rely on “brains rather than weapons” and would not coordinate with armed groups.Demilitarisation and withdrawal remain sticking pointsSteve Witkoff has said phase two of Gaza peace plan aims for the “full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza,” including the disarmament of all unauthorised armed factions. He added that Washington expected Hamas to meet its remaining obligations, including the return of Gvili’s body, warning that failure to do so would bring “serious consequences”.The plan also envisages the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to secure Gaza and train vetted Palestinian police units.(With inputs from agencies)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-announces-formation-of-gaza-board-of-peace-under-us-backed-phase-two-of-peace-plan-israel-hamas-netanyahu-11768521226610.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2026/01/15/1600x900/logo/FLORIDA-PANTHERS-WH-0_1768521273531_1768521314213.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:02:35","author":"Sayantani Biswas","authors":["Sayantani Biswas"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.05},{"id":393322148,"title":"Tim Walz Calls ICE an ‘Occupation’ as Minneapolis Descends into Chaos","text":"“So tonight, let me say one again to Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: End this occupation.

What are the practical challenges confronting Europe on its path to strategic autonomy?\n\n European observers warn that, amid shifting transatlantic relations, Europe may remain stuck in an awkward position of neither trusting the U.S. nor achieving strategic autonomy.\n\n SYMBOLIC TROOP DEPLOYMENTS\n\n The Trump administration has repeatedly signaled its intention to obtain Greenland and has claimed that the use of force cannot be ruled out.\n\n Under continued pressure from Washington, Denmark's Ministry of Defense and Greenland's autonomous government said on Wednesday that they had decided to establish \"a more permanent and larger military presence\" in and around Greenland, including participation by NATO allies, and described the move as \"a clear response to the challenges facing the Arctic.\"\n\n Located in northeastern North America, Greenland, the world's largest island, is a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, while Copenhagen retains authority over defense and foreign policy. The United States maintains a military base on the island.\n\n European media reported that several European countries have confirmed their participation, at Denmark's invitation, in a multinational reconnaissance mission to be conducted in Greenland.\n\n In a statement released Wednesday, the German Ministry of Defense said the mission is to explore framework conditions for potential military support to Denmark in ensuring security in the region. For example, the team will look into capabilities such as maritime surveillance.\n\n France, Sweden, and Germany have all said they would send personnel to Greenland, though the deployments are limited in scale. Germany, for example, announced it would dispatch only a team of 13 personnel.\n\n European analysts believe that these troop deployments carry limited practical significance, serving mainly as symbolic gestures of support for Denmark and signals of concern over Arctic security.\n\n Tim Haesebrouck, assistant professor of international politics at Ghent University, said European countries lack the capacity to engage in direct military confrontation with the U.S., noting that at any stage of potential escalation, the balance of military power would favor Washington.\n\n A military takeover of Greenland could be feasible for the U.S., and the real challenge lies in post-conflict administration, said Ian Lesser, a distinguished fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the U.S.\n\n URGENT CALLS TO REDUCE DEPENDENCE\n\n In response to Trump's threats over Greenland, Camille Grand, former NATO assistant secretary general, said the situation once again underscored the need for Europe to reduce its security dependence on the U.S.\n\n Since Trump returned to the White House in 2025, transatlantic relations have undergone noticeable changes. Frictions within the alliance, long described as being based on shared security interests and values, have intensified, reinforcing Europe's willingness to pursue strategic autonomy.\n\n From wielding tariffs against the European Union to pressuring European allies to sharply increase defense spending, from demanding that Europe assume the \"primary responsibility\" for Ukraine's security to repeatedly expressing a desire to seize Greenland, the Trump administration's \"America First\" stance has continued to strain transatlantic ties.\n\n Tensions were further heightened late last year when Washington released a National Security Strategy report that called for deeper U.S. involvement in European affairs and portrayed Europe increasingly as an ideological and geopolitical rival.\n\n An article in The Guardian described the report as marking a \"seismic shift\" in transatlantic relations, noting that elements of hostility toward Europe had been incorporated into U.S. national strategy.\n\n Such changes have made Europe's pursuit of strategic autonomy more urgent. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for greater European autonomy, arguing that the EU should be able to safeguard its own defense and security and independently control the technologies and energy driving its economic growth.\n\n Dan Krause, programme director for European and International Politics at Bundeskanzler-Helmut-Schmidt-Stiftung, a German think tank, told Xinhua that as the U.S. is targeting the EU on its values and even its civilization, and is opposing multilateralism, the traditional ally can't be compatible with European interests.\n\n A genuinely strategic autonomous Europe can actually improve relations with the U.S., because only on this basis can \"Europe speak on equal footing, from an independent position,\" he said.\n\n THREE DILEMMAS CAST LONG SHADOWS\n\n The Greenland issue also highlights the practical challenges confronting Europe. European commentators note that security and defense autonomy lies at the core of Europe's strategic autonomy, yet three major dilemmas make genuine defense independence difficult to achieve.\n\n The first is the capability gap. Analysts argue that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on the U.S. in areas such as the military industry, intelligence capabilities, and cross-border military mobility. However, decades of reliance on Washington have made \"security dependence on the U.S.\" Europe's greatest vulnerability.\n\n Research by the U.S.-based Atlas Institute for International Affairs shows that U.S. military procurement to European allies surged from an average of 11 billion U.S. dollars between 2017 and 2021 to 68 billion U.S. dollars in 2024. The BBC has reported that Europe remains heavily dependent on the U.S. for intelligence gathering, command and control, and air capabilities.\n\n The second dilemma is internal division. Debates over defense autonomy have persisted in Europe for years, yet member states continue to differ in priorities and positions. Some countries prefer to continue to rely on the U.S. security guarantees, while others push for greater independence.\n\n Disagreements also persist over whether to strengthen intergovernmental defense cooperation or advance EU-level collective defense efforts. Whether Europe can forge a unified political resolve will be crucial to the progress of defense autonomy.\n\n Last but not least, the financial pressure. Driven by the Ukraine crisis and rising transatlantic tensions, EU defense spending has continued to increase. The European Defence Agency estimates that EU defense expenditure will reach 381 billion euros in 2025, up about 11 percent from 2024.\n\n For many European countries, however, soaring defense budgets amid high inflation, low growth and widening deficits pose a heavy economic burden, potentially crowding out social spending and triggering political and social tensions. The Economist has forecast that European defense spending will hit a post-Cold War high in 2026, yet cautioned that, under mounting economic pressure, Europe still has a long road ahead before achieving genuine strategic autonomy.","url":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/europe/47323/Greenland-standoff-further-exposes-dilemmas-of-Europes-strategic-autonomy","image":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2026/01/16/image-47323-1768521681.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":393327396,"title":"Major NATO exercises begin in Germany under shadow of Greenland row","text":"NATO has begun transferring around 10,000 soldiers, equipment and vehicles to Germany for a major military exercise in the coming weeks under the shadow of the dispute over the status of Greenland, reported dpa.\n\nDozens of vehicles belonging to an Italian military unit rolled off a cargo ship at the north-western German port of Emden early on Thursday.\n\nThis marked the start of visible operations in Germany, according to the Allied Joint Force Command (JFC) in the Dutch town of Brunssum.\n\nGermany is hosting the manoeuvre, which has been dubbed \"Steadfast Dart 26\" and is the largest NATO exercise this year.\n\nEleven member states are participating in the exercises with army, air force, navy, space and cyber units.\n\n\"From today onwards, around 10,000 soldiers will arrive in Germany,\" said Italian General Nicola Mandolesi during the unloading of the first cargo ship in Emden. \"With this exercise, NATO is showing the capability to move rapidly from south to the north, from west to the east.\"\n\nThe exercises show the alliance is \"united and capable and ready\" to fullfil all kinds of mission, the general said, thanking Germany for coordinating the manoeuvre. \n\nThe operations come amid a major split within the alliance over the future of the largely autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing for Washington to control the territory, with European countries warning that any US move to take over Greenland could mean the end of NATO.","url":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/europe/47317/Major-NATO-exercises-begin-in-Germany-under-shadow-of-Greenland-row","image":"https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2026/01/16/image-47317-1768515472.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-16 00:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"fi","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":393327392,"title":"France to send extra forces to Greenland: Macron","text":"A first team of French military personnel is already on the ground in Greenland and will be reinforced in the coming days with extra \"land, air and maritime assets,\" French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Thursday during his New Year address to the armed forces at the Istres air base, reported Xinhua.\n\n Earlier in the day, Macron said on X that at Denmark's request, France had decided to take part in joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland.\n\n In his address, Macron said France and its European partners must continue to be present \"wherever their interests are threatened, without escalation, but uncompromising on respect for territorial sovereignty.\"\n\n Also on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the European Union has a \"strategic responsibility\" in Greenland because \"Arctic security is inseparable from our own,\" French news channel BFMTV reported.\n\n Speaking at a joint press briefing with his Latvian counterpart in Riga, he said that by taking part in the joint exercise, France and its partners were making \"a choice of lucidity and solidarity with Denmark.\"\n\n The German Ministry of Defense on Wednesday announced that it will participate in a multinational reconnaissance mission in Greenland to assess potential military contributions to regional security.
