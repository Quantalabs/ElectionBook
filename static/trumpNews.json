Albanese hits out at Peter Dutton as energy stoush continues and climate debate heats up","text":"Anthony Albanese has accused the Opposition of seeking to stifle investment in energy and industry as the Government reveals a months-long delay for its new emissions reduction target.\n\nThe Prime Minister said Opposition Leader Peter Dutton’s policy to add nuclear power to Australia’s energy mix was flimsy, myopic and still lacked detail more than six months after first being announced.\n\n“The only thing that we’re seeing here is Peter Dutton trying to hold his ramshackle show together by coming up with a policy that essentially stifles investment and says something will happen in the 2040s so we can have the argument down the track,” Mr Albanese said on Monday.\n\n“Everything Peter Dutton does is just about making himself into a smaller and smaller ball while the world just moves past him.”\n\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen revealed the key body advising the Government on its emission reduction plans had asked for several months longer “ to work through the international permutations”.\n\nHe pointed out that of 197 countries that are part of the Paris Agreement, only five have so far announced their next targets.\n\nThe delay pushes the timing for the Government’s 2035 target beyond the federal election, although it already wasn’t keen to release the new figure in the heat of a campaign.\n\nThe Coalition has previously said it would not announce any targets under the Paris agreement.\n\nClimate Change Authority chair Matt Kean told the Nine newspapers over the weekend that Donald Trump’s election as US President would have a global impact and the organisation needed to recalculate its assumptions in light of this before giving advice to the Government.\n\nMr Bowen said it was a legitimate concern.\n\nHe cited uncertainty around whether Mr Trump would abolish the Inflation Reduction Act, which channels money into renewable energy and related industries.\n\n“The idea is that it reduces the cost of renewable energy for everyone, and that’s a negative if that goes,” he told Radio National.\n\n“On the other hand, if the United States is less interested in renewable energy investment, that investment’s got to go somewhere, and Australia will be right on top of this looking for that investment and encouraging it to Australia.\n\n“So there are swings and roundabouts about how it will apply to Australia, and I think it’s perfectly reasonable for the Climate Change Authority to tell the government we need a bit more time to work this through.”\n\nMr Dutton used social media over the weekend to accuse Mr Albanese of shifting blame onto “everyone else” for rising power bills.\n\n“And now, instead of owning up to the fact that he doesn’t want to release the rate of his 2035 target electricity tax before the election, he’s blaming – wait for it – Donald Trump,” he said.\n\n“Australia can’t afford three more years of Anthony Albanese and Labor.”\n\nThe Coalition claims its policy to build seven nuclear power stations between 2035 and 2050 will reduce power bills by 44 per cent, however the consultant that did its costings did not model the effect on household electricity bills.","summary":"Anthony Albanese has accused the Opposition of seeking to stifle investment in energy and industry as the Government reveals a

The 78-year-old’s comments sparked widespread reactions on social media, including an endorsement from Elon Musk, who tweeted “YES!” alongside a viral clip of Trump’s remarks.“Woke has to stop. It’s destroying our country. Woke is bullshit,” Trump declared, referencing the renaming of US military bases that previously honored Confederate leaders. He pledged to reverse such changes, including restoring the original name of Fort Bragg in North Carolina, now called Fort Liberty.— elonmusk (@elonmusk) Trump vows to end 'transgender lunacy'Trump also vowed to end critical race theory and “transgender insanity” in schools, promising a hardline approach to culture war issues as part of his post-inauguration agenda.“I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military, and out of our elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools,” Trump said, signaling his administration's hardline stance.Trump also promised to “keep men out of women’s sports,” emphasizing that “it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female.”— CollinRugg (@CollinRugg) The president-elect’s remarks come amid a growing political divide in the US over transgender rights, with states moving in opposite directions on issues such as medical treatments for minors and access to LGBTQ-themed books in public and school libraries. Republican-controlled states have sought to restrict access, while Democratic states have moved to safeguard transgender rights.In his first rally-like speech since the November election, he also threatened to retake control of the Panama Canal, pushed back on criticism of Elon Musk’s influence, and suggested he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Agenda for \"Liberation Day\"Trump outlined his plans for his first day in office, which he referred to as \"liberation day.\" He vowed to crack down on illegal immigration, expand domestic energy production, and eliminate \"woke ideology\" from public institutions.In a broader policy statement, Trump criticized the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali during the Obama administration. He promised to restore the mountain’s original name, saying, “McKinley was a very good, maybe a great president. He deserves that honor.”Panama Canal and foreign policyThe former president surprised many by suggesting he might seek to reclaim control of the Panama Canal, calling it a “vital national asset.” He criticized Panama’s handling of the canal and demanded it be returned to the US, warning Panamanian officials to “be guided accordingly.” Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino swiftly rebuffed the comments, asserting the canal’s sovereignty and emphasizing cooperation on mutual security issues.Trump also floated the possibility of an early meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. “Bringing the war to an end is one of the things I want to do quickly,” he said, noting that Putin had expressed readiness for talks.— elonmusk (@elonmusk) Praise for Elon MuskResponding to claims that Elon Musk was acting as a “shadow president,” Trump dismissed the idea but praised Musk’s contributions to technology and space exploration. “No, he’s not going to be president. He wasn’t born in this country,” Trump quipped, adding, “I like having smart people.”Vaccine skepticism and TikTokTrump defended his controversial choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services Secretary, hinting at possible investigations into vaccines and their links to autism despite a lack of scientific evidence. “We’re going to find out a lot,” Trump said, emphasizing his goal to “make America healthy again.”On TikTok, Trump expressed openness to allowing the app to continue operating in the US, citing its role in reaching young voters during the 2024 election. “Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while,” he said.Closing rhetoricTrump concluded by reiterating his commitment to fulfilling his campaign promises and tackling culture wars head-on. “We’re going to stop woke,” he declared, signaling a combative presidency ahead.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woke-is-bull-trump-takes-aim-at-woke-culture-musk-reacts-watch/articleshow/116580550.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116580921/116580921.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:43:14","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.192},{"id":275398658,"title":"EastEnders legend Anita Dobson, 75, reveals why she no longer watches the BBC soap - 36-years after leaving iconic role of Angie Watts","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Dec 23rd 2024\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead the bombshell full list of 30 demands Blake Lively made of Justin Baldoni and others on set…some of them are wild\n\nJeremy Clarkson admits his pub the Farmer's Dog is a 'total disaster' in the wake of thefts, £27,000 to 'keep the council off his back' and disgusting loos\n\nThe UK's most expensive street REVEALED - and it will set you back a staggering £21.4million if you want to live there\n\nThe expert guide to looking younger in 2025: I've tried every tweakment going, says ALICE HART-DAVIS... here are the ones that are actually worth your cash\n\nBritain facing a 'recession made in Downing Street': Economy is heading for 'worst of all worlds'\n\nIs Stephen Bartlett all that he claims to be?

But I do try to catch up with stuff now and again. But it's hard with that because it turns over so quickly. You'd have to be constantly catching up. So no, I have watched bits and pieces.'\n'I don't really watch television very much at all, I watch things like a series because then you can get your teeth into it, and you can watch it when you want to rather than having to keep playing catch up'.\n\nEastEnders legend Anita Dobson, 75, has revealed why she no longer watches the BBC soap, 36-years after leaving the role of the Queen Vic's first landlady\n\nThe actress played Angie Watts from the show's very first episode in 1985 before bowing out three-years later (pictured on the show with co-star Leslie Grantham in 1985)\nIt comes after Anita shared a health update on her husband Brian, after he suffered a stroke in September and was left unable to use his arm.\nThe Queen star revealed he had been rushed to hospital following the medical emergency in a video shared to his personal website.\nBut his Anita has reassured fans that the legendary guitarist's condition has 'stabilised' and he's back to playing piano and guitar.\nSpeaking to The Mirror at the TRIC Christmas Lunch earlier this month she said he was now doing 'much better' and had 'stabilized'. \nBrian announced his stroke in a video, looking animated despite the 'scary' episode, and said he can still play guitar following what he called his 'little health hiccup'. \nAt the time, he asked fans not to 'clutter up' his inbox with good wishes, adding that the doesn't want sympathy. \nThe guitarist was recovering from a ripped muscle and trapped nerve as a result of a gardening injury, when he suffered a heart attack in May 2020.\nIn the video, he said: 'I'm here to bring you some good news - the good news is that I can play guitar after the events of the last few days,' he said, twiddling his fingers for emphasis.\n\nHer memorable stint saw 30M viewers watch the now classic scene when husband Dirty Den (Leslie Grantham) served her with divorce papers on Christmas Day (pictured)\n\nAnita admitted that she no longer watches her former co-stars - including onscreen daughter Leticia Dean(pictured) - as they struggle to keep up with the number of episodes per week\n\nShe said: 'I tend to always miss it. But I do try to catch up with stuff now and again. But it's hard with that because it turns over so quickly.\n'I say this because it was in some doubt because that little health hiccup that I mentioned happened about a week ago and what they called it was a minor stroke.'\nThe We Will Rock You writer revealed the incident left him temporarily unable to use his left arm and he had a 'very exciting' emergency ambulance journey to Frimley Hospital in Surrey, while praising the medical staff for giving him the 'most fantastic care.'\n\n Queen's Sir Brian May reveals the band hated their first music video because 'it didn't feel rock and roll' and 'looked like something on ITV' \n'All of a sudden, out of the blue, I didn't have any control over this arm, so it was a little scary, I have to say,' he continued.\n'I didn't want to say anything at the time because I didn't want anything surrounding, you know. I really don't want sympathy. Please don't do that because it'll clutter up my inbox and I hate that.'\nBut the animal rights activist, who has campaigned against the culling of badgers to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis, said he is currently 'grounded' as a result.\n'The good news is I'm okay. Just doing what I'm told, which is basically nothing. I'm grounded.\n'I'm not allowed to go out - well, I'm not allowed to drive, not allowed to get on a plane, not allowed to raise the heart rate too high... but I'm good.' \nThe rocker - who also has a PhD in astrophysics after abandoning his studies to pursue a career in music - had been seen in public just days before the scare, appearing on ITV's This Morning on August 23 to promote his BBC documentary on badger tuberculosis. \n\nIt comes after Anita shared a health update on her husband Brian , after he suffered a stroke in September and was left unable to use his arm \n\nBrian announced his stroke in a video, looking animated despite the 'scary' episode, and said he can still play guitar following what he called his 'little health hiccup. \nAnita has been at Brian's side throughout his setbacks and previously opened up about his stroke during an appearance on Loose Women in October, where she admitted it had been a 'big wake up call for us both'.\nAfter the panel asked her how Brian was doing, Anita let out a sigh and responded: 'I'm very happy to say, sitting here now, he's stable and he's got through it.'\nThe audience broke into applause at the positive news, before panellist Kay Adams added: 'It's a big shock though isn't it?'\nAnita admitted: 'It was... yeah, a bolt from the blue and a big wake up call for us both because you suddenly think, you charge through life don't you, wanting to do the things you can do, failing and succeeding sometimes.\n'You just don't think about that inevitable moment when you're going to have to slow down and this really did make us both, particularly Brian, and me too, think okay, you're not getting any younger.'\nShe continued: 'At some point you are going to have to face the prospect that you can't do the things you used to do, so you will have to slow down and start making compromises.\n'It has been quite a shock in a way, not a massive shock because thank God he's alright, still iconic.'\n\nAnita DobsonBBCBrian MayEastenders\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nEastEnders legend Anita Dobson, 75, reveals why she no longer watches the BBC soap - 36-years after leaving iconic role of Angie Watts\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nRead the bombshell full list of 30 demands Blake Lively made of Justin Baldoni and others on set...some of them are wild\n\nMichelle Keegan and Mark Wright join James Argent and his new girlfriend Nicoline Artursson for double date\n\nAll the A-list stars mentioned in Blake Lively's lawsuit against Justin Baldoni including Taylor Swift and Ben Affleck\n\nEXCLUSIVEInside Cheryl and Bear's first Christmas without Liam: Friends reveal how his family are rallying round, the 'great lengths' Cheryl is going to\n\nRobbie Williams, 50, reveals plans to resit his GCSEs after a lifetime of feeling 'stupid' and leaving school without qualifications \n\nLooking to create some NEW family traditions?

In the MPC minutes released on Friday, Kumar, one of the six members of the rate-setting panel, had noted that growth slowdown largely reflected the weakness of the industrial sector, deteriorating the employment sentiment in Q2.Explaining this in detail, Kumar told Mint in an emailed interview that the sharp slowdown in the GDP growth to 5.4% in the second quarter ended September was transient. This slowdown prompted most analysts to downgrade the GDP growth forecasts for 2024-25 from around 7% earlier to around 6.5% now.“We should expect an improvement in growth in the coming two quarters. The government capex, which saw a squeeze in the first quarter, has begun to revive in the second quarter and should gain momentum in the third and fourth quarters,” Kumar said. \"The government capex should, therefore, help to lift the growth rate in the second half of the year. Yet, monetary easing could support growth further by bringing down the cost of capital for private investments.”Read more: States push for more fiscal room, seek expansionary Union budgetOn inflation, Kumar argued that interest rates have limited impact on taming food prices, an argument also made in last year’s Economic survey. The survey had also noted that inflation-targeting framework should be changed by excluding food prices as interest rates had failed to curb food inflation, which surged to 10.9% in October.“I have argued in my statement that while looking at the policy options for reviving growth and containing inflation, one should factor in their determinants. This is because monetary policy instruments such as interest rate changes have more to do with demand management and have limitations in addressing the rising vegetable prices, which are primarily due to a supply-side shock, namely seasonal demand-supply mismanagement, which was beginning to correct itself in November,” he said. The inflation-targeting framework of MPC is currently focused on addressing the headline inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI), which includes food as well as non-food items.With the appointment of the new RBI Governor, a deputy governor in place of Michael Patra next month and new external members, the MPC’s next policy meeting in February will be keenly watched. The street is expecting the committee to pivot to rate-cutting cycle to revive growth.This meeting will be held in the backdrop of an uncertain external environment with US President Donald Trump taking charge.According to Kumar, the MPC will factor in all these changes before making a decision.“We are living through highly uncertain times with upcoming changes in the economic and trade policy in the US with the change of administration in January, the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, which have a bearing on the oil prices, exchange rates, etc,” Kumar said. “The MPC will factor in the trends of the past months and projections for the future when it meets next to arrive at its decisions.”Read more: Escaping India within India is an exorbitant exercise","url":"https://www.livemint.com/market/growth-to-pick-up-in-coming-quarters-on-government-capex-says-rbi-mpc-member-nagesh-kumar-gdp-growth-11734867633472.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/12/22/1600x900/LiveMint_1734878106726_1734889862047.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:33:23","author":"Gopika Gopakumar","authors":["Gopika Gopakumar"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":275397660,"title":"Trump upending global politics a month before taking office","text":"His second term doesn’t start for a month, but Donald Trump is already sending shock waves around the world.His trade threats helped set off a Cabinet crisis in Canada that has Prime Minister Justin Trudeau teetering.

As a Panamanian, I strongly reject any statement that distorts this reality,” stated Mulino in a video on his X account without explicitly mentioning Trump.\n\nThe reaction comes after Trump made the threat on Saturday on his Truth Social platform. “Our Navy and commerce have been threatened in a very unfair and reckless way. The rates that Panama charges are ridiculous.” “This complete scam against our country will cease immediately,” Trump stated.\n\nThe president-elect also denounced China’s growing influence over the canal, a concerning situation since American businesses depend on the canal to transport goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. “It was exclusively for Panama to manage, not China or anyone else,” Trump said. “We would never and will never let it fall into the wrong hands!”\n\nIf Panama cannot guarantee a “safe, efficient, and reliable operation” of the canal, “then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us in its entirety and without any doubt,” added the Republican.\n\nThe Panamanian president responded by demanding “respect” for his country and reiterated that “every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zones belongs to Panama and will continue to be so.” “Our country’s sovereignty and independence are not negotiable,” he added.\n\nDespite Trump’s statements, Mulino said he hopes to have “a good and respectful relationship” with the future U.S. government, with which he hopes to continue addressing issues such as illegal migration and drug trafficking. The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under the 1977 agreement signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter.\n\nPanama resumed complete control of the commercial passage on December 31, 1999.

But who is Katie Miller, and why has she emerged as a key figure in this effort?Miller, a veteran of Trump’s first administration, served as deputy press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security and later as press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence. She is also the wife of Stephen Miller, Trump's incoming deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser. Her appointment to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) highlights her deep ties to Trump’s inner circle and her experience navigating the complexities of Washington bureaucracy.\"Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE! She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years and will bring her professional experience to Government Efficiency,\" Trump announced on Truth Social. What is DOGE?The Department of Government Efficiency, an informal advisory board, is spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, two billionaires who have pledged to drastically reduce the size of the federal government. Musk has already outlined ambitious plans to shrink the number of federal agencies from over 400 to just 99. The initiative aims to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in earlier remarks.While Miller is one of the first named members, Musk and Ramaswamy have yet to unveil the full team. However, their vision has drawn both support and criticism for its bold approach to dismantling what they describe as an \"unaccountable bureaucracy.\"Miller’s current roleKatie Miller is currently serving as the spokesperson for the transition team of Robert Kennedy Jr, Trump’s designated Health and Human Services secretary. Her dual roles highlight her increasing influence as the Trump administration prepares to take office.Her appointment reflects Trump's strategy of relying on trusted allies with proven loyalty and experience. As the DOGE initiative takes shape, all eyes will be on Miller and the advisory board to see if they can deliver on their promise to overhaul the federal government.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-katie-miller-trump-taps-mike-pences-ex-press-secretary-for-musk-ramaswamy-led-doge-team/articleshow/116580585.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116580722/116580722.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:24:44","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.363},{"id":275394864,"title":"Canberra light rail extension: Disruption to get worse in 2025","text":"The report \"Railworks expected to cause disruption\" (December 20) includes the phrase from Infrastructure Canberra: \"Utilities work will be undertaken south of the lake at King Edward Terrace\". This is a strong indication that the Barr government is determined to proceed with its light rail stage 2B project regardless of warnings about skyrocketing costs and multiple years-long disruptions to road traffic. Morning peak hour traffic queues can already stretch from Commonwealth Avenue Bridge almost to the State Circle-Adelaide Avenue intersection. Surely it&apos;s time to reconsider a much more flexible and far less costly alternative: greatly expanding the fleet of electric buses. I don&apos;t know where Frank Breglec (Letters, December 20) gets his US political news and commentary, but he certainly hasn&apos;t been reading much of the informed commentary since the presidential election. If he truly thinks \"no politician, or their policies, has ever been under the microscope to the extent that Trump was and indeed still is,\" perhaps he should consider the following sentence in a piece by Bill Wyman, a former assistant managing editor of National Public Radio in Washington, on the US media \"caving in\" to Trump. He wrote: \"The media needs to stand up, state the obvious, and keep stating it. It needs to keep saying Trump is what the courts have declared him to be: a felon, a fraudster and a sexual predator\". And Frank probably applauded the decisions by the Trump-supporting owners of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times to ban editorials in favour of Harris. Oh, and what does he make of the US ABC TV network caving into Trump&apos;s libel suit based on one of their anchors repeating the decision of a judge about Trump&apos;s guilt in a sexual offence trial? I&apos;m not looking for scapegoats here, Frank, but you wrote about Dutton&apos;s long-term policies, not the populist rhetoric he is now promoting. While the Albanese government is busy working out how to ban under-16-year-olds from accessing social media, it seems that there is now an urgent and compelling need to ban the platform formerly known as Twitter and particularly its owner, who is arguably the single largest threat to democracy on the planet at present. I would like to give a special shout out to the wonderful Australian Girls Choir. I had just finished another round of chemotherapy at TCH and as I was walking out I sat down for half an hour with other patients and was swept away by their majestic singing. The choir sang both traditional and modern carols giving each their own special touch. A woman next to me was so taken away she was crying. If you are confused by Alan Shroot&apos;s answer to Herman van de Brug (An absurd argument, Letters, December 20) and emeritus professor (ANU) Ben Selinger&apos;s addition (A short history lesson), look up Wikipedia. It states \"Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples or proto-Semitic people were speakers of Semitic languages who lived throughout the ancient Near East and North Africa, including the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Arabian Peninsula and Carthage from the third millennium BC until the end of antiquity, with some, such as Arabs, Arameans, Assyrians, Jews, Mandaeans, and Samaritans having a continuum into the present day.\" I am not anti-Semitic. I just worry about Middle Eastern politics. \"Between love and hate there is a field. I&apos;ll meet you there.\" The bullying of the secular over the sacred is writ large at Christmas where the indulgent \"me\" drowns out the self-emptying \"thee\": A time when the citizenry bows to the icon of consumerism, leaving it exhausted - overwhelmed by presents and bereft of presence. All about us, the signage points to paddocks of fun and good cheer where grog, and food, and gifts, and music distract like bread and circuses, leaving us disconnected and hungover. But what of that other field, the Christ-child, born in the mud and blood and dust of a messy, violent marketplace? The divine manifested as a vulnerable infant who overturned the pervasive social conventions and dogmas of his day; that might is right; that peace comes through the sword, and that only those in the first rank count. He taught that serving replaced being served, love of the enemy replaced vengeance and tribalism, and that the poor should replace the Caesars as the guests of honour at banquets. This extraordinarily fertile and productive field is also paved in forgiveness, inviting us beyond the superficiality of mere tolerance to, as Rabbi Jonathan Sacks coined, \"a respect for the dignity of difference\". Without this field war, famine, tribalism, and loneliness are afforded unfettered trespassing rights. \"Between your religious tenets and mine there is a field. I&apos;ll meet you there.\" Merry Christmas. There has been some discussion about the rising debt created by the federal government&apos;s increasing expenditure. Without passing judgement on the relative merits of this government&apos;s spending on various items, I am astonished that every time there is an announcement about spending more money on another initiative, it seems that no journalist ever asks where the money is coming from. As a layperson, every time an announcement is made about spending yet another eye-watering, taxpayer-funded amount, I wonder how the heck we are going to pay for it. If I decided to add (yet) another storey to our house, buy a Bugatti Veyron, get a nose job, or get a hair transplant, it would not be unreasonable for my wife to ask how we are going to pay for it. As the government keeps putting billions of dollars on the credit card, I don&apos;t think it would be unreasonable for journalists to occasionally ask how we&apos;re going to pay it off. As a former UN PNG and AusAID staff member, I find the decision to give $600 million to Papua New Guinea for rugby league appalling. It even beats PNG&apos;s crazy decision in 2018 to use part of its ever-insufficient national budget to buy up a planeload of Maseratis to transport APEC VIPs for less than a week. By any standards of project design, let alone common sense, the plan fails to meet the basic principles of contributing to resolving PNG&apos;s many high-priority development needs, such as health, education and safety, which all desperately need financial support. It is like Marie Antoinette wanting to feed the starving Paris mobs cake. Give them rugby league. The decision should be rescinded immediately. It is not just highly unprofessional, it is simply shameful. Mark Kenny is a good political commentator. But, like all The Canberra Times journalists, he needs to read economics far more widely than economic neoliberalism. He falls into the usual neoliberal trap of assuming the Reserve Bank of Australia really needed to raise interest rates when inflation took hold worldwide two to three years ago. Japan&apos;s central bank, on the other hand, did none of that and instead kept its interest rates near zero. Inflation in Japan has since dropped, just like in Australia. When will we learn that there are alternative and better ways of managing the economy? Thank you, Michelle Grattan for your incisive opinion piece on Dutton&apos;s nuclear policy (December 14). It seems there are two elephants in the room. The first is a big, grey, smelly one called pollution. The Coalition deliberately ignores it, wanting to keep burning coal until their nuclear power plan is implemented several years from now. The second is the ridiculously clunky and obstructive white elephant that is Dutton&apos;s nuclear plan itself. Australians are already footing the bill for billions of dollars worth of climate reparations annually. But the Coalition wants to prop up ageing coal-fired power stations well into the future. We need to reduce pollution now. Just as urgent is householders&apos; need for cost-of-living relief. Rooftop solar and batteries can provide clean energy and overall savings on household power bills, plus they don&apos;t take long to install. Why discourage the uptake of solar and throw good money after bad? Anthony Albanese is, at best, a low-level, unimaginative, mediocre public servant who has been overpromoted despite his clearly proven lack of ability. If Daniel Cash doesn&apos;t like the content suggested by an algorithm (\"Algorithms are leading us into the dark\", December 14) there is a simple solution that does not require more authoritarian government intervention in what we see and say online. Exercise your agency as an autonomous human being and don&apos;t click the link. Now we have some costings for the Coalition&apos;s nuclear power proposal. While in fantasy land, I wonder why they didn&apos;t include a fusion reactor, too. Not a peep from Labor about the cost of AUKUS. A bit selective don&apos;t you think? It seems there&apos;s money to burn; burn all of us up that is. \"Can the ACT rise to housing challenge?\" asks the December 19 editorial headline. Well, if a bombed-out resource-short Britain could build more than 156,000 bungalows between 1946 and 1949, 8000 of which are still standing, it should be. However, since we&apos;ve spent $30 million dollars so far in two years with nothing to show for it, probably not. My suggested slogans for next year&apos;s federal election are \"push the nuclear button with Peter Dutton\" and \"ride the mushroom cloud with Littleproud\". Any reference to an agricultural product fed on equine fertiliser under low-light conditions might appeal to National Party voters. Keep it rural. Trump has said making Canada another American state is a \"great idea\". I agree but with economic integration and not autonomy. Similar to the EU. This could apply to Australia and New Zealand too. But Albo is too busy with his properties to think of possible benefits for us. Foreign Minister Penny Wong, under PM Anthony Albanese&apos;s leadership, was wrong to vote for Palestine&apos;s (really Hamas&apos;) UN membership, prematurely push for a two-state solution, and have earlier reinstated financial aid to Iranian-funded/weapons-supplied Hamas terrorist-riddled UNRWA in Gaza. Our politicians have very safe jobs. They can smartly predict the outcome of their ventures 20 years from today. If it does not work, they won&apos;t be facing any questions because they won&apos;t be in the Parliament. In just 30 days&apos; time Donald Trump will be president. Be afraid, very afraid. 2025 is going to be a wild ride indeed. How in the name of anything holy did the world get into this mess?","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8852898/canberra-light-rail-extension-disruption-to-get-worse-in-2025/?cs=27763","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/LLBstgPA4H8EG9DTTGcXBL/659fa3d4-712c-4a5d-8924-7a2dcdefcf68.jpg/r0_0_3886_2591_w3886_h2591_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:22:24","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.002},{"id":275394840,"title":"How TikTok is reshaping Australian political campaigns","text":"Whether it&apos;s a clip on the best way to peel a mango or a slideshow on the quirks of owning a family dog, politicians have turned to influencers to figure out how to reach younger, chronically online audiences. Peter Dutton&apos;s arrival on TikTok last month solidified the site&apos;s relevance to major political parties vying to win over newer generations. Gen Z and Millennial voters are set to overtake Baby Boomers in every state and territory at next year&apos;s election, with millions of users scrolling through the popular short-form video app daily. Experts argue TikTok will emerge as a dominant force in leaders&apos; 2025 election campaigns, with \"online political authenticity\" a major factor influencing how voters perceive who they vote for. \"A strong part of politicians using TikTok is the focus on ordinariness, and what that means is where they really show that very &apos;ordinary&apos; side of themselves, as if to say they are just like you and me,\" said Griffith researcher Dr Susan Grantham, who studies politicians&apos; use of social media. \"It&apos;s really about this performance and this persona, inviting the audience in to see different elements of the human race.\" About a third of federal MPs own an individual TikTok account. It marks a growing trend among global leaders who have seized on the platform&apos;s 1 billion monthly users to amplify their policies and take jabs at their political opponents. In the recent US presidential election, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both ran vigorous campaigns over TikTok despite a law threatening to ban the app over national security concerns about its parent company, Bytedance. Despite calling for a similar ban in Australia, Peter Dutton has amassed more than 252,000 likes and gained 22,000 followers since joining the platform in September. His piece-to-camera videos resemble a similar strategy to that of the Liberals&apos; broader campaign, marked by concerning predictions about immigration and the economy set to sombre background music. The ALP camp takes a more light-hearted approach, using clips of senior ministers chatting about housing policy to upbeat pop music or reviewing their lunchbox meals for the day in their offices. Social media has played a major role in political messaging in Australia since at least 2007, when former Labor leader Kevin Rudd used Facebook and Twitter to spread his successful Kevin07 campaign. After the Australian Labor Party opened an official TikTok account during the 2022 election, it marked a shift in how major political parties would use newer platforms to establish candidates&apos; leadership personas. Dr Grantham said the ALP successfully used the platform to cement Anthony Albanese as the \"ordinary bloke\", an essential factor in his win over Scott Morrison. \"The main change I have seen, not just in Australia, but across other countries and other political campaigns, is a slightly stronger focus on the individuals,\" Dr Grantham said. \"During the 2022 election, Anthony Albanese was very much portrayed as this &apos;everyday Australian bloke&apos; who is just like you and me and stands for the same things, so they worked very hard on that campaign to develop him in that way. \"But we&apos;ll start to see a few more of these individual accounts, such as the Peter Dutton account, and this gives the individuals an opportunity to present themselves and develop a particular persona on that platform that the party accounts don&apos;t allow for.\" Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather is the most popular Australian politician on TikTok. As of December, he has more than 171,000 followers and 3 million likes on his videos. His most viewed video to date, with 3.5 million views, is a five-minute clip of him demanding action over housing affordability in a speech to the lower house of Parliament. The Brisbane MP said the secret to successful political messaging online is not memes or lip-syncing to trending songs but talking to people about real issues that affect their lives. \"I think there&apos;s an assumption that to do well online, you have to have clever and well-produced videos that are almost pandering to people, but I think that&apos;s intellectually insulting to young people because what they want is their life to not be tough and to be able to pay their supermarket bills,\" he said. \"My advice to any politicians joining TikTok is if you want to appeal to young people, start talking about solutions; don&apos;t try and be funny or have these faux relatable pieces of content.\" Labor MP Andrew Leigh, who has had a live account on the platform since 2021, said both TikTok and Instagram have allowed him to engage directly with people in his electorate. \"I can get news and messages out in real-time, in my own voice, and also have a bit of fun with how I communicate to a broader audience. It&apos;s also a chance to engage with runners, fiction readers and other non-political communities,\" Dr Leigh said. He said potential threats to the integrity of elections were the greatest downsides to using the platform as a public figure. \"Like others, I&apos;ve been struck by the increase in scratchiness and vitriol on social media platforms over the past decade,\" he said. There is not enough data yet to determine if a strong social media reach correlates with real-time voting trends, but time will tell whether bite-sized videos and dog memes can turn the tide of an election.","url":"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8851756/how-tiktok-is-reshaping-australian-political-campaigns/?cs=27845","image":"/images/transform/v1/crop/frm/237852436/573b4026-0523-44df-ba69-2540114bf8c1.png/r0_0_1200_675_w1200_h675_fmax.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:22:24","author":"Eleanor Campbell","authors":["Eleanor Campbell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.441},{"id":275394716,"title":"Trump addresses Elon Musk's growing political influence: 'He's not going to be president'","text":"PHOENIX — President-elect Donald Trump dismissed any suggestion that he’s being usurped by his high-profile billionaire ally Elon Musk, coming off a week in which Musk helped derail an emergency spending measure to avert a government shutdown. Trump said the notion that he has “ceded the presidency” to Musk is a fiction and that even if Musk wanted the job, he couldn’t get it because of the Constitution’s requirement that the U.S. president be a natural-born citizen. Musk was born in South Africa. “No, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump said. “And I’m safe. You know why he can’t be? He wasn’t born in this country.” Trump spoke for more than an hour Sunday at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest conference in Phoenix, with thousands of conservative activists cheering wildly as he took the stage amid a pyrotechnic display. It was his first rally-style event since the election. Smoke curled around the lectern and sparklers shot up from the floor as the crowd stood and cheered the incoming president, who wore his trademark suit and overlong red tie. “Trump! Trump! Trump!” the audience chanted. “The golden age of America is upon us,” Trump said. In his remarks, Trump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to meet with him “as soon as possible” and called for an end to the “horrible,” horrible” war between Russia and Ukraine. During the campaign, Trump said he would bring a swift end to the war, using leverage and clout he believes he has attained with both Putin and Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Raising a different foreign policy issue, he reiterated a warning that he made on social media Saturday that Panama is charging excessive fees for use of the Panama Canal, the passageway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. If Panama doesn’t relent, Trump said he would insist on retaking control of the canal, which the U.S. relinquished under a treaty that then-President Jimmy Carter signed in 1977. “We’re being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we’re being ripped off everywhere else,” Trump said. The president of Panama, José Raúl Mulino, posted on social media Sunday that the canal belongs to Panama and the sovereignty of the country is not up for negotiation. \"Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama, and will continue to,\" he said in his video message. \"The sovereignty and independence of our country are non-negotiable. ... It's part of our history of struggle and an irreversible victory.\" Trump also outlined a new plan for a campaign-style advertising blitz aimed at discouraging drug use. “We are going to advertise how bad drugs are for you,” Trump said. “They ruin your look, they ruin your face, they ruin your skin. They ruin your teeth. If you want to have horrible teeth, take a lot of fentanyl.” Trump’s appearance at the conference followed a tense standoff in Washington, D.C., over the past week that nearly caused a government shutdown. Trump and Musk effectively scuttled Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposed emergency spending measure, forcing lawmakers to find an acceptable alternative that would keep the government running hours before the shutdown would have taken effect. Musk, who owns the social media site X, posted more than 100 times about his objections to the original spending deal — a preview of how he may use his influence and his megaphone to shape policy in Trump’s second term. Mockingly, Democrats have taken to calling him “President Musk.” History shows that anyone who upstages Trump or diverts attention from him doesn’t last long in his orbit. Yet Trump’s remarks suggest that he doesn’t want a rift with Musk; for now, the two have shared interests. Musk spent more than $250 million to help get Trump elected. After his victory, Trump tapped Musk to head a new nongovernmental office whose mission is to reduce government costs and inefficiencies. Looking ahead, Musk’s wealth could help keep Republicans in Trump’s fold. Any GOP lawmaker tempted to defy Trump may fear that the new president would orchestrate a primary challenge bankrolled by Musk. Speakers at the conference downplayed any friction between Musk and Trump. In a speech Thursday night, Donald Trump Jr., the president-elect’s eldest son, said: “You see what the media is trying to do to break up the relationship that my father has with Elon. They’re trying to cause that schism to prevent these guys doing what they’re going to do best, and we cannot allow that.” Another speaker, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said in an interview with NBC News that Musk is filling an important role in helping eliminate government waste. “We’re bringing in a consultant from the private sector to put a different set of eyes on what we’re spending money on,” Mullin said. As for Musk’s use of his social media platform, Mullin said, “He has a right to do it. He’s still a private citizen. He’s no different than anyone else.” Less than one month before the 45th president becomes the 47th, Trump seemed in a good mood. After summoning Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to the stage, Trump scanned the crowd and didn’t see him at first. “Is he here someplace? Ted? Ted?” Trump said. “Oh, oh, he’s in trouble.” At that, Cruz emerged from backstage and the two shook hands and embraced. At another point, Trump heard a strange sound onstage. “What the hell was that?” he said. “You get the little yips up here every once in a while.” Trump, who faced two assassination attempts during the campaign, added: “I wonder why.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-addresses-elon-musks-growing-political-influence-not-going-presi-rcna185038","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-12/20241220-trump-sj-107-992dfc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:20:24","author":"Peter Nicholas","authors":["Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":275394718,"title":"Congress avoids a Christmas shutdown, German market attack suspect faces murder charges: Weekend Rundown","text":"Shutdown averted ’Twas the night before shutdown, and all through the House, a funding bill passed, assuaging all doubts. The eleventh-hour deal to keep the government open passed the Senate early Saturday morning and was signed into law by President Joe Biden hours later. The turmoil of the week previewed the legislative chaos that awaits Washington after President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. Congress punted government funding for only three months, lengthening Trump’s already extensive to-do list for his first 100 days. “I think it’s kind of stupid,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said of the new deadline. “Don’t ask me to explain or defend this dysfunction.” The spending fight also showed the political influence of Elon Musk on Capitol Hill. In a fiery speech Sunday, Trump laughed off the idea that he has “ceded the presidency” to the tech billionaire. “No, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump said. “And I’m safe.

He wasn’t born in this country.” A suspect in German Christmas market attack ID'd as doctor with strong anti-Islamic views A car plowed into a crowd at a Christmas market in eastern Germany on Friday, leaving five people dead and more than 200 injured, dozens of them critically. A 9-year-old boy was among those killed, along with women ages 52, 45, 67 and 75. Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, a self-described member of the “liberal opposition” to Saudi Arabia who has voiced strong anti-Islamic and anti-immigration views, faces five counts of murder and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault. Al-Abdulmohsen was a doctor in Saudi Arabia before seeking asylum in Germany in 2016. His online activity includes inflammatory content on X against Islam, and he has aligned himself with Germany’s far-right anti-immigration party. Police have not released a motive in the attack, but two senior U.S. officials told NBC News that authorities are investigating the incident as terrorism-related. Parts of the U.S. will be dashing through the snow Parts of the United States might miss out on a white Christmas this year, but at least they might have a white Christmas Eve. A storm system is moving in across the Great Lakes and Northeast regions, bringing rain and snow in the days before Christmas. The interior Northeast, Michigan and Wisconsin are expected to receive anywhere between 2 to 6 inches of snow before Christmas Eve. There’s currently no forecast for a white Christmas, as many areas will see melted white blankets by Wednesday. It’s still likely that the storms will affect holiday travel, especially along I-95. Uninsured while pregnant, she used a medical cost-sharing service. Her family was left in debt. Rachel Kaplan was uninsured when she became pregnant last year. So her doctor suggested an alternative: a nonprofit called Sedera, which bills itself as a medical cost-sharing service where members pay monthly fees that are pooled for the organization’s use to reimburse members’ medical bills. But when she and her husband reached out to Sedera for reimbursement after their son was born, they were denied. To the couple’s shock, they said, Sedera cited a policy in fine print that stated they were ineligible. The organization is what’s known as a “health care sharing ministry,” one of more than 100 such groups operating in the U.S., most of which are rooted in Christianity. NBC News spoke to four families who were denied or struggled to get reimbursed by their health care sharing ministry for pregnancy or childbirth-related expenses. All felt they had been deceived and warned other expecting families not to join. Politics in brief ‘Deep state’ reprisals: Intelligence officials have expressed fears that Kash Patel could seek criminal retribution if he is confirmed as FBI director, after he prepared a list of claimed “deep state” actors within government. Lara out: Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, has taken herself out of the running for the Senate seat expected to be vacated by Sen. Marco Rubio, instead teasing a “big announcement” next month. Trump’s Indian American allies: When Donald Trump retakes the White House, he is likely be flanked by a large cohort of young Indian Americans — a demographic with growing influence in Republican politics.

Sen. Raphael Warnock says we must learn “how we can pray with one another rather than prey on one another.” MLB Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson dies at 65 Rickey Henderson, the greatest base stealer in Major League Baseball history, has died at 65. In a statement Saturday, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred called Henderson the “gold standard of base stealing and leadoff hitting.” The Athletics called Henderson “undoubtedly the most legendary player in Oakland history.” Nicknamed the “Man of Steal,” Henderson ranks first all time in both stolen bases, with 1,406, and runs scored, with 2,295. He made his MLB debut at just 20 years old, and after 10 All-Star appearances, World Series championships with Oakland and Toronto, and a career nearly beyond compare, his final MLB game came in 2003, at age 44. Blake Lively accuses 'It Ends With Us' director of sexual harassment Blake Lively filed a legal complaint accusing her “It Ends With Us” co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment, creating a hostile work environment and then trying to ruin her reputation after she expressed her concerns. Lively’s complaint alleges Baldoni, who is also the film’s director, improvised physical intimacy that had not been previously rehearsed or discussed, and pressured her to “simulate full nudity” during one scene and didn’t close the set such that nonessential crew could “pass through while Ms. Lively was mostly nude.” The film made headlines over the summer after fans suspected behind-the-scenes drama, zeroing in on the fact Baldoni was doing press separately from his co-stars. Lively’s complaint accuses Baldoni of hiring a crisis communications team to destroy her reputation during the film’s promotion. An attorney representing Baldoni called all the allegations “completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media.” Countdown to Christmas It’s the most wonderful time of the year... for presents! For people struggling to celebrate the holidays on a budget, a handful of TikTok creators have ramped up content in the hopes of easing the stress — encouraging people to reject microtrends and focus on the things that they actually use and enjoy on a daily basis. “I think on social media, sometimes it becomes normalized that every year you need to have a new Christmas aesthetic,” said one content creator posting more budget-conscious videos. “But I think for the majority of people, that’s just not realistic.” Consumers have been choosier about spending this season overall, but young adults are splurging a bit on gifts for themselves. Nearly half of Gen Z and millennial consumers plan to buy gifts for themselves this holiday season, according to researchers at the consulting firm Deloitte.

Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, on Sunday compared tech mogul Elon Musk to a “prime minister,” praising Musk for speaking out against an early version of a stopgap funding bill last week. “It’s kind of interesting,” Gonzales said during an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels like as if Elon Musk is our prime minister.” Gonzales added that he spoke with Musk “a couple of times” during a chaotic week for House Republicans as GOP leadership scrambled to pull together a package to fund the government that would garner support from a majority of the House GOP caucus. Gonzales voted against the final version of a continuing resolution that passed the House late Friday night and was later signed Saturday by President Joe Biden. The package funds the government at current levels through March 14 and includes a one-year farm bill and $100 billion in disaster aid. Gonzales continued to praise Musk’s influence on the funding process, even as moderator Margaret Brennan pointed out that Musk has not been elected to any formal position in the U.S. government. “Well, unelected, but, I mean, he has a voice, and I think a lot of —large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people,” Gonzales said. Musk was one of President-elect Donald Trump’s biggest supporters ahead of the November presidential election, spending a quarter of a billion dollars on outside efforts to boost his campaign. Last week, Musk was outspoken against a government funding deal negotiated by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., days before a Dec. 20 deadline to avert a government shutdown. Musk called the bill “one of the worst bills ever written,” wrote “this bill should NOT pass” and called for Republicans to shut down the government instead of voting for the continuing resolution. In a span of two days, he voiced his opposition to the bill more than 100 times on X, the social media platform he owns. Shortly after Musk started speaking out against the bill, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance released their own statement against the bill, tanking already wavering support for the bill among congressional Republicans. And days later, when GOP congressional leaders released the text of a new continuing resolution one-tenth the size of the first bill, Musk praised the size of the second bill in a post that Gonzales himself reshared. At a Turning Point USA event in Arizona, Trump downplayed concerns that Musk is usurping control from the president-elect. “No, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump said. “And I’m safe. You know why he can’t be? He wasn’t born in this country,” Trump added about Musk, who was born in South Africa.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gonzales-elon-musk-prime-minister-trump-rcna185165","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240522-tony-gonzales-vl-311p-5aec80.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:20:24","author":"Alexandra Marquez","authors":["Alexandra Marquez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.264},{"id":275394304,"title":"“Në ora 17:00 është dita e betejës sonë, të vërshojnë nga Tirana dhe gjithë Shqipëria”","text":"Kreu i PD, Sali Berisha tha se në ora 17:00 është dita e betejës sonë.

'Isn’t it nice ...

Speaking to a lively crowd, Trump dismissed the claims with his trademark candor, joking, “I’m safe, you know why? He wasn’t born in this country.” The remark, referencing Musk’s South African origins, drew laughter and applause from the audience.Rumors had gained traction in some media outlets, but Trump dismissed them outright. “They’re on a new kick,” he said. “All the different hoaxes. The new one is that President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk. No, no, that’s not happening,” Bloomberg quoted Trump as saying.Despite the speculation, Trump praised Musk, a significant donor to his campaign, for his intelligence and contributions. “Isn’t it nice to have smart people we can rely on? Don’t we want that? But no, he’s not going to be president, that I can tell you,” Trump reiterated.— bennyjohnson (@bennyjohnson) Musk's growing influence in WashingtonMusk, whose companies heavily interact with federal regulations and contracts, has become a polarizing figure in US policymaking. His influence was evident last week when the Republican-controlled House passed legislation, avoiding a government shutdown, a move attributed partly to Musk’s efforts.Trump recently appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, a temporary agency headquartered at SpaceX's Washington office.A controversial agendaIn his first rally-style appearance since winning the 2024 election, Trump unveiled a sweeping agenda. Promising to rebuild urban centers, cut taxes, and increase wages, he declared January 20 as “liberation day.”On cultural issues, Trump called for a “commonsense revolution” and condemned progressive policies. “Woke needs to come to an end. It’s ruining our nation,” he said, vowing to remove critical race theory and transgender policies from schools and military settings.Trump also pledged to address “transgender madness” on his first day in office, promising executive orders to ban transgender Americans from military service and women’s sports. “With the stroke of my pen, on day one, I will stop the transgender lunacy,” he declared.Concluding with familiar flourishTrump ended the rally with his signature phrase, “Together we will fight, fight, fight, and together we will win, win, win!” The event concluded with Trump dancing to the Village People’s “YMCA,” a hallmark of his campaign appearances, as supporters cheered.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-donald-trump-giving-us-presidency-to-elon-musk-isnt-it-nice-president-elect-finally-responds/articleshow/116580548.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116580586/116580586.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:11:17","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":275397980,"title":"Irish Examiner view: In the Trump era, our politicians will have to develop a thick skin","text":"But the reality may be more self-interested than that. The previous Irish government did a passable impersonation of being more simpatico with the Democrats than the Republicans. Ireland has skin in the game when it comes to corporate tax changes and any attempts to repatriate US company profits back over the Atlantic.\n\nIssues over illegal immigration — the 47th president committed to deport a million people annually in his election campaign — may bite. One legal expert said last month that undocumented Irish people in the US could represent “low-hanging fruit” in the programme.\n\nIreland contributes little financially to the collective defence of Europe and, even though Trump might understand the concept of neutrality, he could argue that Dublin cannot be an outspoken advocate of EU policies without putting more on the table to ensure stability and safety.\n\nEven on Palestine, which has become our Government’s signature foreign policy, there will not be consensus on statehood recognition or the involvement of the International Criminal Court. \n\nHarris, who could become our next foreign minister, will have to deal closely with Trump and his appointees, including Edward Walsh, the businessman from New Jersey with a background in construction who has been nominated as US ambassador to Ireland.\n\nAt least Harris does not have a record of bad-mouthing the next resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, unlike key appointments made by our next-door neighbours.\n\nWestminster’s new ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, who was Tony Blair’s Northern Ireland minister for 14 months, has previously described Trump as a “danger to the world” and “little short of a white nationalist and racist”. This drew the response from a senior Trump campaign adviser that Mandelson was “an absolute moron”.\n\nThis is not a promising start for the man who is thought to be a close ally of Morgan McSweeney, the Macroom-born chief of staff for British prime minister Keir Starmer.\n\nBut it will have been noted by ambitious Irish politicians who will be combing back copies of interviews, looking up previous speech notes, and re-running old TV and radio interviews and podcasts for their views on the Donald, and making a note to selves that the prime quality for the next few years will be a thick skin, something, perhaps, Harris has yet to develop.\n\nIn a different league \n\nThe soft power struggle for control of the English Premier League moved decisively in favour of American venture capitalists this week with the conclusion of the long-running takeover of Everton Football Club by the Friedkin Group for €500m.\n\nOrganisations which are either wholly, or mainly, headquartered in the US now have charge of 10 out of 20 elite clubs. \n\nIn comparison, there is Arab money in three teams — Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle; Asian money in Leicester and Fulham; Chinese backing of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and a Greek owner of Nottingham Forest. In other words, 50% of teams have non-English ownership. Twenty-five years ago, that figure was three.\n\nEverton are one of the league’s oldest clubs, founded in 1878, and will be leaving historic Goodison Park for a €1bn new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock in Vauxhall, Merseyside at the end of this season. \n\nThe new owners, based in Houston, Texas, also have a controlling interest in Serie A team Roma. \n\nThe club’s chairman, a flamboyant figure, has been a producer on well-known films including The Square and Killers of the Flower Moon and won a stunt award by landing his own Spitfire on the beach in the film Dunkirk. He also has wide ranging wildlife interests and owns a luxury lodge and private park on the Serengeti in Tanzania.\n\nIf that all sounds a bit Hollywood for the Gwladys St End, fans will be pleased to see an ownership — whatever its origin — which will bring some sense of strategy and direction to a club that has been in the doldrums for many years.","summary":"With many Irish policies at odds with the outlook of the incoming US administration, Ireland will have to navigate a potentially rocky relationship with the Trump White House","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41541862.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8868/4434412_6_seoimage1x1_IRISH_20Election_20_2010434483C.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:06:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Simon Harris","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Simon Harris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":275398188,"title":"'We're back already': Eamon Ryan says Green demise isn't like last time","text":"Advertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

After winning 12 seats in the 2020 election, its best ever result, it only managed to keep one of them in 2024. \n\nIts sole TD in the 34th Dáil is Roderic O’Gorman, Eamon Ryan’s successor as the leader of the party.\n\n“We took a real hit in the election. We were getting attacked from every single front,” Ryan said.\n\n“We were attacked from Rural Independents and Fianna Fáil trying to protect their flank from that side. We were attacked from Ryanair. And we were attacked from behind by environmental NGOs saying that the Social Democrats or Labour are more ambitious on climate,” he said.\n\n“Well, I’m sorry, but if they were more ambitious on climate, they would be going into government now. I know the politics and it’s difficult because negotiations depend on the numbers and so on, but the ambition on climate is needed so desperately that if you were really that ambitious, you would engage in serious talks.” \n\nNew Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman at the Dublin West count centre on 1 December, where he was waiting to find out whether he had kept or lost his seat.PA / Alamy\n\nPA / Alamy / Alamy\n\nDespite the Green Party’s tumble in this election, Ryan is adamant that it is in a stronger position than it was when it was previously wiped out.\n\nIn 2011, after being in coalition with Fianna Fáil, the Greens lost all six of their former Dáil seats.\n\nReflecting on that time, Ryan said the party was running on “vapours” back then.\n\n“It’s so much easier now [to rebuild]. We’re halfway back already because we got a presence in the Dáil and all going well we’ll have a presence in the Seanad,” he said, adding: “There’s a world of difference. \n\n“If you look at what Peader Toibín [the leader of Aontú] has done with a single seat, in terms of representing a world view and addressing issues – we [the Greens] are in a completely different situation to where we were the last time.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nIreland needs to stop using harmful fossil fuels in the next 15 years - climate watchdog\n\n'Drill, baby, drill': What Trump's return to the White House means for climate\n\n“Roderic O’Gorman winning a seat was the most significant thing for me. It means we’re back already.”\n\nA Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil partnership without the Greens\n\nThe outcome of the general election in November saw the Greens lose all but one of their seats. Their coalition partners Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, however, won enough support to be on track to go back into Government together if they can sway some independents or a smaller party to their side.\n\nAs the leader of the Green Party until earlier this year, Ryan worked closely with the heads of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. \n\nHe appears to have come away from the last four years with a sense that there are members of the parties who understand that climate change is a serious problem but also that the parties aren’t above pushing climate issues to one side in favour of serving their own immediate political interests.\n\nEamon Ryan with Fine Gael leader Simon Harris and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin in May 2024Sasko Lazarov / © RollingNews.ie\n\nSasko Lazarov / © RollingNews.ie / © RollingNews.ie\n\nRyan said that in recent years, the European People’s Party – the political grouping that Fine Gael belongs to in the European Parliament – has been moving further to the right, and that Fine Gael has moved with them. \n\nAt the interview, he said that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil blocked a memo at the final Cabinet meeting that was about allocating more road space to public transport, claiming that it was too last minute despite it having been worked on for months. Ryan said the move “annoyed” him and attributed it to “short-term political reasons”, saying the other parties didn’t want to “ruffle feathers” during the election.\n\nThe outgoing climate minister said he is concerned that a Fine Gael/Fianna Fáil-led government won’t continue the 2:1 transport spending ratio that was implemented by the last coalition, which had committed to investing double the amount of money into public transport than investments into roads.\n\nRyan said that failing to continue that strategy would mean Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil aren’t serious about developing public transport or taking climate action.\n\nHe added that the impacts would be felt the hardest in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick, where public transport projects are in earlier stages than in Dublin where they are mostly well in train.\n\nAsked by The Journal who he thinks should be the next minister for climate, Ryan wouldn’t name names but said he does think there are “some” people in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who understand the seriousness of climate.\n\nWhat will be important for the role, he said, is consistency. He cited that during his time in Cabinet, he dealt with five different clean energy ministers in the UK, who had an average term in the role of about eight months. \n\nSome other, more light-hearted advice he had for the next minister: to watch the box set of the 1980s sitcom “Yes, Minister”.

The party has launched an online site with a counter displaying its membership and the target needed to overtake the Tories.\n\n“We have a number of billionaires prepared to donate to the party, not just Elon,” Mr Candy said.\n\n“The Reform party is the disrupter — this is the seed round, the series A. This will be political disruption like we have never seen before.”\n\nMr Candy, who arranged the meeting between Mr Musk and Mr Farage, said the US billionaire would “be the first of many wealthy donors legally allowed to donate”, although he did not name any others.\n\nThe treasurer, who switched from the Tories and promised a “seven-figure sum” for Reform, said the party had “more Conservative values in its little finger than the Conservative party”.\n\n“Even the big Tory donors are calling me,” he told the Financial Times. “A lot of people will join us. The movement has started.”\n\nRules preventing foreign donations mean Mr Musk would have to funnel any donation through one of his UK-based businesses.\n\nParties can accept donations from a number of sources including individuals on the UK electoral register or a UK-registered company.\n\nThe head of the Electoral Commission, Vijay Rangarajan, has called for the rules to be strengthened to “protect the electoral system from foreign interference”.\n\nCommons Leader Lucy Powell said any proposals to change the law would not come until next year.\n\nShe told Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips there will be an Elections Bill “probably in the next parliamentary session” which could include “making sure that the issues around donations are … fair and robust”.\n\nShadow cabinet minister Kevin Hollinrake said he would not seek to block Mr Musk making a donation, but suggested he would like him to back the Tories instead.\n\nHe said: “I have great faith in the British public. I don’t think the British public could be easily bought. I think they’ll decide at the next election who they think the best party is to run this country. And I think they’ll choose Conservatives.”","url":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/news/national/reform-uk-lines-up-billionaires-to-fund-political-disruption-123829/","image":"https://www.grampianonline.co.uk/_media/img/SE757JZTMDXZKZ57ZY5L.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:01:23","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.1},{"id":275393036,"title":"Labour MP invites Donald Trump ‘home’ to visit the Scottish island where his mother was born","text":"Donald Trump has been invited “home” to visit the Scottish island where his mother was born, just days before he re-enters the White House. \n\nLabour’s Torcuil Crichton, the new MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, extended the offer to the US president-elect in a Christmas card.\n\nThe mothers of both men come from the same village of Tong on the Isle of Lewis.\n\nMr Trump’s late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, left there in the 1930s at the age of just 18 to move to America. \n\nMr Crichton said: “Oceans may separate our political views, but the president and I are both sons of Lewis with mothers from the same village and I thought it might be an appropriate Christmas gesture to invite him home.”\n\nHe added that Mr Trump’s mother “who returned regularly, is fondly remembered. The president of the United States would be sure to get a warm island welcome if he chose to come.”\n\nMr Crichton also joked that the next president could pick up some political tips during his trip. His own mother was “the most astute politician in our family and she could give Donald Trump some invaluable advice”, he said.\n\nThe Labour politician appears to have trumped his party leader, Keir Starmer, who is expected to invite the new president to the UK for a state visit during his time in office. \n\nMr Trump is already due to visit Scotland next year for the opening of a new golf course in Aberdeenshire, his son has confirmed.\n\nBut other parts of the UK are also vying for a visit, with sources in Nigel Farage’s camp confident he could make a surprise trip to the Reform UK leader’s constituency of Clacton. \n\nRelations between Labour and Mr Trump’s team are strained, after his election campaign team hit out at Sir Keir’s party and accused it of attempting to interfere in the US election, in a row over UK activists helping the Democrats. \n\nMr Trump has visited Lewis before, most recently in 2008, but not since his foray into politics.\n\nThe photo on the Christmas card sent to the Republican featured Mr Crichton with his mother Joan in her kitchen as she congratulated him after winning the seat for Labour in the July general election.\n\n“Every candidate needs a winning team, and my mother played a key role in my election,” Mr Crichton said.\n\nIn the card, he also congratulated Mr Trump on his election victory. \n\nMr Trump’s inauguration in the middle of January will mark the start of his second term in the White House after a remarkable political comeback. Elected president in 2016, he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. But after Mr Biden was replaced as the Democrat candidate, he swept to victory against Kamala Harris in November.","summary":"Exclusive: Torcuil Crichton, whose party leader Keir Starmer is expected to offer the US president-elect a state visit, sent the message in a Christmas card","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-mother-scottish-island-torcuil-crichton-b2667568.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/20/13/aab470a52ee4cc405b8c234285a7047cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzMyMTkzNjg4-2.71991725.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fHeqgNLj-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-23 00:01:00","author":"Kate Devlin","authors":["Kate Devlin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.322},{"id":275395144,"title":"India getting into 'offensive' play after Trump check","text":"Ahead of Donald Trump taking office, the Centre has reached out to industry seeking their 'offensive asks' from Washington. These asks relate to demands in the areas of export interest for India. We have asked industry on how they see trade with the US and the possible impact of pronouncements that Trump has made. We have sought their inputs to evaluate the issues and their offensive interests, said an official. The inputs will be used to develop India's export strategy and evolve the approach in trade talks with the US. The exercise assumes significance with Trump threatening to impose reciprocal tax on India alleging that New Delhi levies high tariffs on certain US goods. Separately, the commerce and industry ministry is also examining the contours of the mini trade deal that India and the US were negotiating during Trump's previous term. Negotiations, discussions, retaliation, dispute or mini trade deal, nothing is off or on the cards, the official added.The US is India's second largest trading partner with $53 billion of goods exports in April-November FY25 and $30 billion of imports.

Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative has suggested that as part of a five-pronged strategy to navigate the Trump-led trade administration, India should diversify IT exports to ease risks arising from potential tariffs as a major portion of India's IT export revenue comes from the US. Lowering import tariffs, strengthening data policies, rejecting the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) trade pillar and boosting Make in India are the other suggestions.India and the US are part of the IPEF and three of the four pillars of the pact are already operational except the one on trade. The IPEF is structured around four pillars relating to trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy (issues such as tax and anti-corruption). India has joined all the pillars except the trade one.","summary":"India prepares for trade talks with the returning Trump administration.

Matt Gaetz — who is selling videos on Cameo after withdrawing his name from consideration to become Donald Trump’s attorney general — is now eyeing a Senate run.\n\nGaetz told the crowd at Turning Point USA’s event in Phoenix Sunday ahead of an appearance byTrump that he was considering running for the seat of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state.\n\n“Many have asked which perch I will be fighting from next,” he said.\n\n “It seems I may not have had enough support in the United States Senate,” he noted, referring to lack of backing to become the nation’s next attorney general. “Maybe I’ll just run for Marco Rubio’s vacant seat in the United States Senate and join some of those folks,” Gaetz added.\n\nGaetz resigned from the House shortly after being nominated after he was met with mounting concerns in the Senate over wide-ranging allegations, including sexual misconduct and illicit drug use claims. He has denied all wrongdoing. The Florida Republican ultimately withdrew his name from consideration after he realized he wouldn’t have enough support to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\nThe former Florida congressman floated his latest idea ahead of the release of the highly-anticipated House Ethics Committee’s report into sex-trafficking allegations against him.\n\nThe House panel quietly voted earlier this month to release the report, which is expected to be made public Monday, CBS News reported.\n\nA woman reportedly testified to the committee that she had sexual encounters with Gaetz at a party in 2017 — when she was just 17 years old. Records also show that Gaetz paid more than $10,000 to women, ABC News reported. Gaetz allegedly labeled these Venmo and Paypal payments to women for “being awesome” and “being my friend,” but some of them were allegedly used in transactions for sex.\n\nEarlier this week, Gaetz admitted that he “probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked” more than he should have in his 30s and that he sent money to “women he dated.” However, he said that he “NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18.”\n\nGaetz’s suggestion that he may make a run for the Senate comes as Lara Trump, the former Republican National Committee co-chair and the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, said she was dropping her bid for Rubio’s seat.\n\n“After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,” she wrote Saturday in a post on X.\n\nAt the Phoenix conference, Gaetz revealed other suggestions that people had for his political future.\n\nSome people have suggested he “eye the governor’s mansion in Tallahassee” while still others urged him to become “special counsel to go after the insider trading for my former colleagues in Congress,” Gaetz revealed.\n\nWhile Gaetz has spent recent weeks making videos on Cameo for $325 a pop, One America News Network (OAN) announced in December that Gaetz will be joining the conservative channel in January. He will be hosting “The Matt Gaetz Show,” a one-hour political talk show every weeknight at 9 p.m. E.T., the network said in a release.\n\nIn yet another occupation Gaetz is considering, the controversial Republican has been talking with John Morgan, the founder of law firm Morgan & Morgan about a potential new job, Politico first reported.","summary":"The former Florida congressman bared his plans in a speech to a conservative  Phoenix crowd as the release of the House Ethics Committee investigation report on him is imminent","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/matt-gaetz-marco-rubio-senate-seat-b2668764.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/22/23/SEI234045267.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 23:56:56","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":275393358,"title":"Trump nominates billionaire Feinberg as US Deputy Secretary of Defense","text":"NEW YORK, December 23. /TASS/.

On Sunday, a CBS/YouGov poll on this topic released by CBS News shows that Americans in general are more optimistic about 2025 than they were at the same time last year about 2024. \n\nHeading into 2025 Americans are more hopeful than discouraged — and more outright hopeful than they were heading into 2024. Last year was more mixed.It does look like this very political past year is affecting that larger outlook going into next year.Among those who say they're generally hopeful about 2025, their top reason is that Donald Trump will be president. His upcoming presidency ranks even higher among things making them feel hopeful about 2025 than their outlook for their own personal relationships and finances.\n\nNow, there's a catch. There's always a catch. While the poll showed that 57 percent of respondents were \"hopeful,\" as opposed to 47 percent the year before, it's interesting to look at the responses when party affiliation is added to the mix. Sixty percent of respondents who replied they were \"hopeful\" did say that \"Trump becoming president\" was one of the reasons that they feel hopeful, while 85 percent who replied that they were \"discouraged\" also cited Trump becoming president.\n\nGosh, who didn't see that coming?\n\nNow, 85 percent of Republicans, 49 percent of Independents, and a mere 38 percent of Democrats were among those who replied they were \"hopeful.\" Honestly, given the wailing and gnashing of teeth coming from Democrats these days, it's amazing that as many as 38 percent of Democrats are \"hopeful.\" One wonders, in fact, if these are the same people who are pushing Kamala Harris to run for president again in 2028.\n\nIf so, we should encourage them; then, we could be even more optimistic when we look forward to 2029.\n\nOh, and Joe Biden? In this survey, his approval is down and sinking fast, with 39 percent approving and 61 percent disapproving of his job as president - which tells me that 39 percent of the respondents have evidently been living in a cave somewhere in Outer Mongolia for the last four years.\n\nSee Related: WATCH: AmFest Crowd Goes Wild When Trump Brings Up His Plans for 'Woke' in New Term\n\nOh, and there is a question about people's most prevalent New Year's resolutions. Honestly, who cares? If you need to resolve to do something you wouldn't have done otherwise, well, you probably still won't do that thing. So let's dispense with the whole \"New Year's resolution\" horse squeeze.\n\nPolls like this can be fun to pick apart.

His commitment to restore a commonsense approach to gender begins with a set of executive orders aimed at critical issues. Among the key priorities is banning gender-affirming medical procedures for minors, removing transgender individuals from military service, and eliminating the promotion of transgender ideology in schools.\n\n“With a stroke of my pen, on day one, we are going to stop the transgender lunacy, and I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools and middle schools and high schools, and we will keep men out of women's sports,” he declared. \n\nHe added, “Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.”\n\nUnder the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: MALE and FEMALE. pic.twitter.com/aAYz53twXM— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) December 22, 2024\n\nTrump has outlined bold policies to address this crazy idelogy, including banning federal funding for gender-transition procedures and revoking Biden-era regulations. Perhaps we can finally start treating this issue like the mental health crisis that it is.\n\nHis promise to “keep men out of women’s sports” most certainly resonates with Americans who feel fairness and biology have been sidelined in favor of a radical agenda. His campaign effectively used this issue to their advantage during the 2024 campaign, running ads that declared, “Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.\"\n\nRelated: The Dominoes Are Falling Fast Over the Biden Mental Health Cover-Up\n\nThe 2024 elections exposed the radical transgender agenda as a critical vulnerability for Democrats, and Donald Trump has a prime opportunity to capitalize on this issue. The Democratic Party severely underestimated public backlash against their extreme social policies, particularly on transgender participation in women’s sports. This miscalculation played a significant role in the GOP winning the national popular vote for the first time in 20 years.\n\nRepublicans, to their credit, didn’t run away from the issue out of concern over being labeled bigots. They knew that the public doesn’t buy into the insanity and effectively made it a key social issue of the campaign while Democrats were hoping to make the election all about abortion. In addition to Trump winning the national popular vote and winning control of the Senate, Senate Democrat incumbents like Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown, and Bob Casey were ousted. And the Democrats were completely blindsided. Even Chuck Schumer admitted Democrats were unprepared for this strategy.\n\nSo, make no mistake about it, Trump and the GOP have a clear path to stay on the offensive on this issue to protect women and children from this dangerous cult and maintain their winning momentum in future elections. I can't wait for Trump to make America sane again.","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2024/12/22/make-america-sane-again-n4935364","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/319/048715d0-d44d-41fa-b5ac-012a542a66db.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 23:42:24","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":275400646,"title":"Angel Mom Patty Morin: Trump 'Heard the Cries of a Mother, and He Cared'","text":"Angel mom Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel Morin, 37, was allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant, praised President-elect Donald Trump for having “heard the cries of a mother” and caring.\n\nDuring a speech at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, Trump invited Patty Morin on stage to share her story.

Medicare reimbursements to health providers had a 7.7% mistake rate this year, the worst since percentages were first reported in 2019.\n\nAnother $4 billion was sent to recipients who had issues regarding their citizenship, including $824 million in unemployment insurance from the Department of Labor.\n\nThe government also sent $346 million to dead people, mostly because the Office of Personnel Management continued to send benefits to retirees who are no longer alive. That’s the highest amount since at least 2021.\n\nCovid-era programs continued to have some of the worst improper payment rates. Roughly 25%, or $2 billion, of loans forgiven under the Paycheck Protection Program this year were paid improperly.\n\nThe data was released on Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 27, the day before Thanksgiving, leaving little time for negative coverage before the news cycle paused.

Since then, it has come down, and 2024 is the first time since 2019 that improper payment spending has dropped below $200 billion.\n\nIn 2024, 3.97% of the government’s money was lost to improper payments, the best rate since 2013.

I shut my eyes in defense, as my brain tells my optic nerve to try again.\n\nThe ship makes no sense, vertically or horizontally. It makes no sense on sea, or on land, or in outer space. It looks like a hodgepodge of domes and minarets, tubes and canopies, like Istanbul had it been designed by idiots. Vibrant, oversignifying colors are stacked upon other such colors, decks perched over still more decks; the only comfort is a row of lifeboats ringing its perimeter. There is no imposed order, no cogent thought, and, for those who do not harbor a totalitarian sense of gigantomania, no visual mercy. This is the biggest cruise ship ever built, and I have been tasked with witnessing its inaugural voyage.\n\n“Author embarks on their first cruise-ship voyage” has been a staple of American essay writing for almost three decades, beginning with David Foster Wallace’s “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again,” which was first published in 1996 under the title “Shipping Out.” Since then, many admirable writers have widened and diversified the genre. Usually the essayist commissioned to take to the sea is in their first or second flush of youth and is ready to sharpen their wit against the hull of the offending vessel. I am 51, old and tired, having seen much of the world as a former travel journalist, and mostly what I do in both life and prose is shrug while muttering to my imaginary dachshund, “This too shall pass.” But the Icon of the Seas will not countenance a shrug. The Icon of the Seas is the Linda Loman of cruise ships, exclaiming that attention must be paid. And here I am in late January with my one piece of luggage and useless gray winter jacket and passport, zipping through the Port of Miami en route to the gangway that will separate me from the bulk of North America for more than seven days, ready to pay it in full.\n\nThe aforementioned gangway opens up directly onto a thriving mall (I will soon learn it is imperiously called the “Royal Promenade”), presently filled with yapping passengers beneath a ceiling studded with balloons ready to drop. Crew members from every part of the global South, as well as a few Balkans, are shepherding us along while pressing flutes of champagne into our hands. By a humming Starbucks, I drink as many of these as I can and prepare to find my cabin. I show my blue Suite Sky SeaPass Card (more on this later, much more) to a smiling woman from the Philippines, and she tells me to go “aft.” Which is where, now? As someone who has rarely sailed on a vessel grander than the Staten Island Ferry, I am confused. It turns out that the aft is the stern of the ship, or, for those of us who don’t know what a stern or an aft are, its ass. The nose of the ship, responsible for separating the waves before it, is also called a bow, and is marked for passengers as the FWD, or forward. The part of the contemporary sailing vessel where the malls are clustered is called the midship. I trust that you have enjoyed this nautical lesson.\n\nI ascend via elevator to my suite on Deck 11. This is where I encounter my first terrible surprise. My suite windows and balcony do not face the ocean. Instead, they look out onto another shopping mall. This mall is the one that’s called Central Park, perhaps in homage to the Olmsted-designed bit of greenery in the middle of my hometown. Although on land I would be delighted to own a suite with Central Park views, here I am deeply depressed. To sail on a ship and not wake up to a vast blue carpet of ocean? Unthinkable.\n\nAllow me a brief preamble here. The story you are reading was commissioned at a moment when most staterooms on the Icon were sold out. In fact, so enthralled by the prospect of this voyage were hard-core mariners that the ship’s entire inventory of guest rooms (the Icon can accommodate up to 7,600 passengers, but its inaugural journey was reduced to 5,000 or so for a less crowded experience) was almost immediately sold out. Hence, this publication was faced with the shocking prospect of paying nearly $19,000 to procure for this solitary passenger an entire suite—not including drinking expenses—all for the privilege of bringing you this article. But the suite in question doesn’t even have a view of the ocean! I sit down hard on my soft bed. Nineteen thousand dollars for this.\n\nThe viewless suite does have its pluses. In addition to all the Malin+Goetz products in my dual bathrooms, I am granted use of a dedicated Suite Deck lounge; access to Coastal Kitchen, a superior restaurant for Suites passengers; complimentary VOOMSM Surf & Stream (“the fastest Internet at Sea”) “for one device per person for the whole cruise duration”; a pair of bathrobes (one of which comes prestained with what looks like a large expectoration by the greenest lizard on Earth); and use of the Grove Suite Sun, an area on Decks 18 and 19 with food and deck chairs reserved exclusively for Suite passengers. I also get reserved seating for a performance of The Wizard of Oz, an ice-skating tribute to the periodic table, and similar provocations. The very color of my Suite Sky SeaPass Card, an oceanic blue as opposed to the cloying royal purple of the standard non-Suite passenger, will soon provoke envy and admiration. But as high as my status may be, there are those on board who have much higher status still, and I will soon learn to bow before them.\n\nIn preparation for sailing, I have “priced in,” as they say on Wall Street, the possibility that I may come from a somewhat different monde than many of the other cruisers. Without falling into stereotypes or preconceptions, I prepare myself for a friendly outspokenness on the part of my fellow seafarers that may not comply with modern DEI standards. I believe in meeting people halfway, and so the day before flying down to Miami, I visited what remains of Little Italy to purchase a popular T-shirt that reads DADDY’S LITTLE MEATBALL across the breast in the colors of the Italian flag. My wife recommended that I bring one of my many T-shirts featuring Snoopy and the Peanuts gang, as all Americans love the beagle and his friends. But I naively thought that my meatball T-shirt would be more suitable for conversation-starting. “Oh, and who is your ‘daddy’?” some might ask upon seeing it. “And how long have you been his ‘little meatball’?” And so on.\n\nI put on my meatball T-shirt and head for one of the dining rooms to get a late lunch. In the elevator, I stick out my chest for all to read the funny legend upon it, but soon I realize that despite its burnished tricolor letters, no one takes note. More to the point, no one takes note of me. Despite my attempts at bridge building, the very sight of me (small, ethnic, without a cap bearing the name of a football team) elicits no reaction from other passengers. Most often, they will small-talk over me as if I don’t exist. This brings to mind the travails of David Foster Wallace, who felt so ostracized by his fellow passengers that he retreated to his cabin for much of his voyage. And Wallace was raised primarily in the Midwest and was a much larger, more American-looking meatball than I am. If he couldn’t talk to these people, how will I? What if I leave this ship without making any friends at all, despite my T-shirt? I am a social creature, and the prospect of seven days alone and apart is saddening. Wallace’s stateroom, at least, had a view of the ocean, a kind of cheap eternity.\n\nWorse awaits me in the dining room. This is a large, multichandeliered room where I attended my safety training (I was shown how to put on a flotation vest; it is a very simple procedure). But the maître d’ politely refuses me entry in an English that seems to verge on another language. “I’m sorry, this is only for pendejos,” he seems to be saying. I push back politely and he repeats himself. Pendejos ? Piranhas? There’s some kind of P-word to which I am not attuned. Meanwhile elderly passengers stream right past, powered by their limbs, walkers, and electric wheelchairs. “It is only pendejo dining today, sir.” “But I have a suite!” I say, already starting to catch on to the ship’s class system. He examines my card again. “But you are not a pendejo,” he confirms. I am wearing a DADDY’S LITTLE MEATBALL T-shirt, I want to say to him. I am the essence of pendejo.\n\nEventually, I give up and head to the plebeian buffet on Deck 15, which has an aquatic-styled name I have now forgotten. Before gaining entry to this endless cornucopia of reheated food, one passes a washing station of many sinks and soap dispensers, and perhaps the most intriguing character on the entire ship. He is Mr. Washy Washy—or, according to his name tag, Nielbert of the Philippines—and he is dressed as a taco (on other occasions, I’ll see him dressed as a burger). Mr. Washy Washy performs an eponymous song in spirited, indeed flamboyant English: “Washy, washy, wash your hands, WASHY WASHY!” The dangers of norovirus and COVID on a cruise ship this size (a giant fellow ship was stricken with the former right after my voyage) makes Mr. Washy Washy an essential member of the crew. The problem lies with the food at the end of Washy’s rainbow. The buffet is groaning with what sounds like sophisticated dishes—marinated octopus, boiled egg with anchovy, chorizo, lobster claws—but every animal tastes tragically the same, as if there was only one creature available at the market, a “cruisipus” bred specifically for Royal Caribbean dining. The “vegetables” are no better. I pick up a tomato slice and look right through it. It tastes like cellophane. I sit alone, apart from the couples and parents with gaggles of children, as “We Are Family” echoes across the buffet space.\n\nI may have failed to mention that all this time, the Icon of the Seas has not left port. As the fiery mango of the subtropical setting sun makes Miami’s condo skyline even more apocalyptic, the ship shoves off beneath a perfunctory display of fireworks. After the sun sets, in the far, dark distance, another circus-lit cruise ship ruptures the waves before us. We glance at it with pity, because it is by definition a smaller ship than our own. I am on Deck 15, outside the buffet and overlooking a bunch of pools (the Icon has seven of them), drinking a frilly drink that I got from one of the bars (the Icon has 15 of them), still too shy to speak to anyone, despite Sister Sledge’s assertion that all on the ship are somehow related.\n\nThe ship’s passage away from Ron DeSantis’s Florida provides no frisson, no sense of developing “sea legs,” as the ship is too large to register the presence of waves unless a mighty wind adds significant chop. It is time for me to register the presence of the 5,000 passengers around me, even if they refuse to register mine. My fellow travelers have prepared for this trip with personally decorated T-shirts celebrating the importance of this voyage. The simplest ones say ICON INAUGURAL ’24 on the back and the family name on the front. Others attest to an over-the-top love of cruise ships: WARNING! MAY START TALKING ABOUT CRUISING. Still others are artisanally designed and celebrate lifetimes spent married while cruising (on ships, of course). A couple possibly in their 90s are wearing shirts whose backs feature a drawing of a cruise liner, two flamingos with ostensibly male and female characteristics, and the legend “HUSBAND AND WIFE Cruising Partners FOR LIFE WE MAY NOT HAVE IT All Together BUT TOGETHER WE HAVE IT ALL.” (The words not in all caps have been written in cursive.) A real journalist or a more intrepid conversationalist would have gone up to the couple and asked them to explain the longevity of their marriage vis-à-vis their love of cruising. But instead I head to my mall suite, take off my meatball T-shirt, and allow the first tears of the cruise to roll down my cheeks slowly enough that I briefly fall asleep amid the moisture and salt.\n\nI WAKE UP with a hangover. Oh God. Right. I cannot believe all of that happened last night. A name floats into my cobwebbed, nauseated brain: “Ayn Rand.” Jesus Christ.\n\nI breakfast alone at the Coastal Kitchen. The coffee tastes fine and the eggs came out of a bird. The ship rolls slightly this morning; I can feel it in my thighs and my schlong, the parts of me that are most receptive to danger.\n\nI had a dangerous conversation last night. After the sun set and we were at least 50 miles from shore (most modern cruise ships sail at about 23 miles an hour), I lay in bed softly hiccupping, my arms stretched out exactly like Jesus on the cross, the sound of the distant waves missing from my mall-facing suite, replaced by the hum of air-conditioning and children shouting in Spanish through the vents of my two bathrooms. I decided this passivity was unacceptable. As an immigrant, I feel duty-bound to complete the tasks I am paid for, which means reaching out and trying to understand my fellow cruisers. So I put on a normal James Perse T-shirt and headed for one of the bars on the Royal Promenade—the Schooner Bar, it was called, if memory serves correctly.\n\nI sat at the bar for a martini and two Negronis. An old man with thick, hairy forearms drank next to me, very silent and Hemingwaylike, while a dreadlocked piano player tinkled out a series of excellent Elton John covers. To my right, a young white couple—he in floral shorts, she in a light, summery miniskirt with a fearsome diamond ring, neither of them in football regalia—chatted with an elderly couple. Do it, I commanded myself. Open your mouth. Speak! Speak without being spoken to. Initiate. A sentence fragment caught my ear from the young woman, “Cherry Hill.” This is a suburb of Philadelphia in New Jersey, and I had once been there for a reading at a synagogue. “Excuse me,” I said gently to her. “Did you just mention Cherry Hill? It’s a lovely place.”\n\nAs it turned out, the couple now lived in Fort Lauderdale (the number of Floridians on the cruise surprised me, given that Southern Florida is itself a kind of cruise ship, albeit one slowly sinking), but soon they were talking with me exclusively—the man potbellied, with a chin like a hard-boiled egg; the woman as svelte as if she were one of the many Ukrainian members of the crew—the elderly couple next to them forgotten. This felt as groundbreaking as the first time I dared to address an American in his native tongue, as a child on a bus in Queens (“On my foot you are standing, Mister”).\n\n“I don’t want to talk politics,” the man said. “But they’re going to eighty-six Biden and put Michelle in.”\n\nI considered the contradictions of his opening conversational gambit, but decided to play along. “People like Michelle,” I said, testing the waters. The husband sneered, but the wife charitably put forward that the former first lady was “more personable” than Joe Biden. “They’re gonna eighty-six Biden,” the husband repeated. “He can’t put a sentence together.”\n\nAfter I mentioned that I was a writer—though I presented myself as a writer of teleplays instead of novels and articles such as this one—the husband told me his favorite writer was Ayn Rand. “Ayn Rand, she came here with nothing,” the husband said. “I work with a lot of Cubans, so …” I wondered if I should mention what I usually do to ingratiate myself with Republicans or libertarians: the fact that my finances improved after pass-through corporations were taxed differently under Donald Trump. Instead, I ordered another drink and the couple did the same, and I told him that Rand and I were born in the same city, St. Petersburg/Leningrad, and that my family also came here with nothing. Now the bonding and drinking began in earnest, and several more rounds appeared. Until it all fell apart.\n\nMy new friend, whom I will refer to as Ayn, called out to a buddy of his across the bar, and suddenly a young couple, both covered in tattoos, appeared next to us. “He fucking punked me,” Ayn’s frat-boy-like friend called out as he put his arm around Ayn, while his sizable partner sizzled up to Mrs. Rand. Both of them had a look I have never seen on land—their eyes projecting absence and enmity in equal measure. In the ’90s, I drank with Russian soldiers fresh from Chechnya and wandered the streets of wartime Zagreb, but I have never seen such undisguised hostility toward both me and perhaps the universe at large. I was briefly introduced to this psychopathic pair, but neither of them wanted to have anything to do with me, and the tattooed woman would not even reveal her Christian name to me (she pretended to have the same first name as Mrs. Rand). To impress his tattooed friends, Ayn made fun of the fact that as a television writer, I’d worked on the series Succession (which, it would turn out, practically nobody on the ship had watched), instead of the far more palatable, in his eyes, zombie drama of last year. And then my new friends drifted away from me into an angry private conversation—“He punked me!”—as I ordered another drink for myself, scared of the dead-eyed arrivals whose gaze never registered in the dim wattage of the Schooner Bar, whose terrifying voices and hollow laughs grated like unoiled gears against the crooning of “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.”\n\nBut today is a new day for me and my hangover. After breakfast, I explore the ship’s so-called neighborhoods. There’s the AquaDome, where one can find a food hall and an acrobatic sound-and-light aquatic show. Central Park has a premium steak house, a sushi joint, and a used Rolex that can be bought for $8,000 on land here proudly offered at $17,000. There’s the aforementioned Royal Promenade, where I had drunk with the Rands, and where a pair of dueling pianos duel well into the night. There’s Surfside, a kids’ neighborhood full of sugary garbage, which looks out onto the frothy trail that the behemoth leaves behind itself. Thrill Island refers to the collection of tubes that clutter the ass of the ship and offer passengers six waterslides and a surfing simulation. There’s the Hideaway, an adult zone that plays music from a vomit-slathered, Brit-filled Alicante nightclub circa 1996 and proves a big favorite with groups of young Latin American customers. And, most hurtfully, there’s the Suite Neighborhood.\n\nI say hurtfully because as a Suite passenger I should be here, though my particular suite is far from the others. Whereas I am stuck amid the riffraff of Deck 11, this section is on the highborn Decks 16 and 17, and in passing, I peek into the spacious, tall-ceilinged staterooms from the hallway, dazzled by the glint of the waves and sun. For $75,000, one multifloor suite even comes with its own slide between floors, so that a family may enjoy this particular terror in private. There is a quiet splendor to the Suite Neighborhood. I see fewer stickers and signs and drawings than in my own neighborhood—for example, MIKE AND DIANA PROUDLY SERVED U.S. MARINE CORPS RETIRED. No one here needs to announce their branch of service or rank; they are simply Suites, and this is where they belong. Once again, despite my hard work and perseverance, I have been disallowed from the true American elite. Once again, I am “Not our class, dear.” I am reminded of watching The Love Boat on my grandmother’s Zenith, which either was given to her or we found in the trash (I get our many malfunctioning Zeniths confused) and whose tube got so hot, I would put little chunks of government cheese on a thin tissue atop it to give our welfare treat a pleasant, Reagan-era gooeyness. I could not understand English well enough then to catch the nuances of that seafaring program, but I knew that there were differences in the status of the passengers, and that sometimes those differences made them sad. Still, this ship, this plenty—every few steps, there are complimentary nachos or milkshakes or gyros on offer—was the fatty fuel of my childhood dreams. If only I had remained a child.\n\nI walk around the outdoor decks looking for company. There is a middle-aged African American couple who always seem to be asleep in each other’s arms, probably exhausted from the late capitalism they regularly encounter on land. There is far more diversity on this ship than I expected. Many couples are a testament to Loving v. Virginia, and there is a large group of folks whose T-shirts read MELANIN AT SEA / IT’S THE MELANIN FOR ME. I smile when I see them, but then some young kids from the group makes Mr. Washy Washy do a cruel, caricatured “Burger Dance” (today he is in his burger getup), and I think, Well, so much for intersectionality.\n\nAt the infinity pool on Deck 17, I spot some elderly women who could be ethnic and from my part of the world, and so I jump in. I am proved correct! Many of them seem to be originally from Queens (“Corona was still great when it was all Italian”), though they are now spread across the tristate area. We bond over the way “Ron-kon-koma” sounds when announced in Penn Station.\n\n“Everyone is here for a different reason,” one of them tells me. She and her ex-husband last sailed together four years ago to prove to themselves that their marriage was truly over. Her 15-year-old son lost his virginity to “an Irish young lady” while their ship was moored in Ravenna, Italy. The gaggle of old-timers competes to tell me their favorite cruising stories and tips. “A guy proposed in Central Park a couple of years ago”—many Royal Caribbean ships apparently have this ridiculous communal area—“and she ran away screaming!” “If you’re diamond-class, you get four drinks for free.” “A different kind of passenger sails out of Bayonne.” (This, perhaps, is racially coded.) “Sometimes, if you tip the bartender $5, your next drink will be free.”\n\n“Everyone’s here for a different reason,” the woman whose marriage ended on a cruise tells me again. “Some people are here for bad reasons—the drinkers and the gamblers. Some people are here for medical reasons.” I have seen more than a few oxygen tanks and at least one woman clearly undergoing very serious chemo. Some T-shirts celebrate good news about a cancer diagnosis. This might be someone’s last cruise or week on Earth. For these women, who have spent months, if not years, at sea, cruising is a ritual as well as a life cycle: first love, last love, marriage, divorce, death.\n\nI have talked with these women for so long, tonight I promise myself that after a sad solitary dinner I will not try to seek out company at the bars in the mall or the adult-themed Hideaway. I have enough material to fulfill my duties to this publication. As I approach my orphaned suite, I run into the aggro young people who stole Mr. and Mrs. Rand away from me the night before. The tattooed apparitions pass me without a glance. She is singing something violent about “Stuttering Stanley” (a character in a popular horror movie, as I discover with my complimentary VOOMSM Surf & Stream Internet at Sea) and he’s loudly shouting about “all the money I’ve lost,” presumably at the casino in the bowels of the ship.\n\nSo these bent psychos out of a Cormac McCarthy novel are angrily inhabiting my deck. As I mewl myself to sleep, I envision a limited series for HBO or some other streamer, a kind of low-rent White Lotus, where several aggressive couples conspire to throw a shy intellectual interloper overboard. I type the scenario into my phone. As I fall asleep, I think of what the woman who recently divorced her husband and whose son became a man through the good offices of the Irish Republic told me while I was hoisting myself out of the infinity pool. “I’m here because I’m an explorer. I’m here because I’m trying something new.” What if I allowed myself to believe in her fantasy?\n\n“YOU REALLY STARTED AT THE TOP,” they tell me. I’m at the Coastal Kitchen for my eggs and corned-beef hash, and the maître d’ has slotted me in between two couples. Fueled by coffee or perhaps intrigued by my relative youth, they strike up a conversation with me. As always, people are shocked that this is my first cruise. They contrast the Icon favorably with all the preceding liners in the Royal Caribbean fleet, usually commenting on the efficiency of the elevators that hurl us from deck to deck (as in many large corporate buildings, the elevators ask you to choose a floor and then direct you to one of many lifts). The couple to my right, from Palo Alto—he refers to his “porn mustache” and calls his wife “my cougar” because she is two years older—tell me they are “Pandemic Pinnacles.”\n\nThis is the day that my eyes will be opened. Pinnacles, it is explained to me over translucent cantaloupe, have sailed with Royal Caribbean for 700 ungodly nights. Pandemic Pinnacles took advantage of the two-for-one accrual rate of Pinnacle points during the pandemic, when sailing on a cruise ship was even more ill-advised, to catapult themselves into Pinnacle status.\n\nBecause of the importance of the inaugural voyage of the world’s largest cruise liner, more than 200 Pinnacles are on this ship, a startling number, it seems. Mrs. Palo Alto takes out a golden badge that I have seen affixed over many a breast, which reads CROWN AND ANCHOR SOCIETY along with her name. This is the coveted badge of the Pinnacle. “You should hear all the whining in Guest Services,” her husband tells me. Apparently, the Pinnacles who are not also Suites like us are all trying to use their status to get into Coastal Kitchen, our elite restaurant. Even a Pinnacle needs to be a Suite to access this level of corned-beef hash.\n\n“We’re just baby Pinnacles,” Mrs. Palo Alto tells me, describing a kind of internal class struggle among the Pinnacle elite for ever higher status.\n\nAnd now I understand what the maître d’ was saying to me on the first day of my cruise. He wasn’t saying “pendejo.” He was saying “Pinnacle.” The dining room was for Pinnacles only, all those older people rolling in like the tide on their motorized scooters.\n\nAnd now I understand something else: This whole thing is a cult. And like most cults, it can’t help but mirror the endless American fight for status. Like Keith Raniere’s NXIVM, where different-colored sashes were given out to connote rank among Raniere’s branded acolytes, this is an endless competition among Pinnacles, Suites, Diamond-Plusers, and facing-the-mall, no-balcony purple SeaPass Card peasants, not to mention the many distinctions within each category. The more you cruise, the higher your status. No wonder a section of the Royal Promenade is devoted to getting passengers to book their next cruise during the one they should be enjoying now. No wonder desperate Royal Caribbean offers (“FINAL HOURS”) crowded my email account weeks before I set sail. No wonder the ship’s jewelry store, the Royal Bling, is selling a $100,000 golden chalice that will entitle its owner to drink free on Royal Caribbean cruises for life. (One passenger was already gaming out whether her 28-year-old son was young enough to “just about earn out” on the chalice or if that ship had sailed.) No wonder this ship was sold out months before departure, and we had to pay $19,000 for a horrid suite away from the Suite Neighborhood. No wonder the most mythical hero of Royal Caribbean lore is someone named Super Mario, who has cruised so often, he now has his own working desk on many ships. This whole experience is part cult, part nautical pyramid scheme.\n\n“The toilets are amazing,” the Palo Altos are telling me. “One flush and you’re done.” “They don’t understand how energy-efficient these ships are,” the husband of the other couple is telling me. “They got the LNG”—liquefied natural gas, which is supposed to make the Icon a boon to the environment (a concept widely disputed and sometimes ridiculed by environmentalists).\n\nBut I’m thinking along a different line of attack as I spear my last pallid slice of melon. For my streaming limited series, a Pinnacle would have to get killed by either an outright peasant or a Suite without an ocean view. I tell my breakfast companions my idea.\n\n“Oh, for sure a Pinnacle would have to be killed,” Mr. Palo Alto, the Pandemic Pinnacle, says, touching his porn mustache thoughtfully as his wife nods.\n\n“THAT’S RIGHT, IT’S your time, buddy!” Hubert, my fun-loving Panamanian cabin attendant, shouts as I step out of my suite in a robe. “Take it easy, buddy!”\n\nI have come up with a new dressing strategy. Instead of trying to impress with my choice of T-shirts, I have decided to start wearing a robe, as one does at a resort property on land, with a proper spa and hammam. The response among my fellow cruisers has been ecstatic. “Look at you in the robe!” Mr. Rand cries out as we pass each other by the Thrill Island aqua park. “You’re living the cruise life! You know, you really drank me under the table that night.” I laugh as we part ways, but my soul cries out, Please spend more time with me, Mr. and Mrs. Rand; I so need the company.\n\nIn my white robe, I am a stately presence, a refugee from a better limited series, a one-man crossover episode. (Only Suites are granted these robes to begin with.) Today, I will try many of the activities these ships have on offer to provide their clientele with a sense of never-ceasing motion. Because I am already at Thrill Island, I decide to climb the staircase to what looks like a mast on an old-fashioned ship (terrified, because I am afraid of heights) to try a ride called “Storm Chasers,” which is part of the “Category 6” water park, named in honor of one of the storms that may someday do away with the Port of Miami entirely. Storm Chasers consists of falling from the “mast” down a long, twisting neon tube filled with water, like being the camera inside your own colonoscopy, as you hold on to the handles of a mat, hoping not to die. The tube then flops you down headfirst into a trough of water, a Royal Caribbean baptism. It both knocks my breath out and makes me sad.\n\nIn keeping with the aquatic theme, I attend a show at the AquaDome. To the sound of “Live and Let Die,” a man in a harness gyrates to and fro in the sultry air. I saw something very similar in the back rooms of the famed Berghain club in early-aughts Berlin. Soon another harnessed man is gyrating next to the first. Ja, I think to myself, I know how this ends. Now will come the fisting, natürlich. But the show soon devolves into the usual Marvel-film-grade nonsense, with too much light and sound signifying nichts. If any fisting is happening, it is probably in the Suite Neighborhood, inside a cabin marked with an upside-down pineapple, which I understand means a couple are ready to swing, and I will see none of it.\n\nI go to the ice show, which is a kind of homage—if that’s possible—to the periodic table, done with the style and pomp and masterful precision that would please the likes of Kim Jong Un, if only he could afford Royal Caribbean talent. At one point, the dancers skate to the theme song of Succession. “See that!” I want to say to my fellow Suites—at “cultural” events, we have a special section reserved for us away from the commoners—“Succession! It’s even better than the zombie show! Open your minds!”\n\nFinally, I visit a comedy revue in an enormous and too brightly lit version of an “intimate,” per Royal Caribbean literature, “Manhattan comedy club.” Many of the jokes are about the cruising life. “I’ve lived on ships for 20 years,” one of the middle-aged comedians says. “I can only see so many Filipino homosexuals dressed as a taco.” He pauses while the audience laughs. “I am so fired tonight,” he says. He segues into a Trump impression and then Biden falling asleep at the microphone, which gets the most laughs. “Anyone here from Fort Leonard Wood?” another comedian asks. Half the crowd seems to cheer. As I fall asleep that night, I realize another connection I have failed to make, and one that may explain some of the diversity on this vessel—many of its passengers have served in the military.\n\nAs a coddled passenger with a suite, I feel like I am starting to understand what it means to have a rank and be constantly reminded of it. There are many espresso makers, I think as I look across the expanse of my officer-grade quarters before closing my eyes, but this one is mine.\n\nA shocking sight greets me beyond the pools of Deck 17 as I saunter over to the Coastal Kitchen for my morning intake of slightly sour Americanos. A tiny city beneath a series of perfectly pressed green mountains. Land! We have docked for a brief respite in Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts and Nevis. I wolf down my egg scramble to be one of the first passengers off the ship. Once past the gangway, I barely refrain from kissing the ground. I rush into the sights and sounds of this scruffy island city, sampling incredible conch curry and buckets of non-Starbucks coffee. How wonderful it is to be where God intended humans to be: on land. After all, I am neither a fish nor a mall rat. This is my natural environment. Basseterre may not be Havana, but there are signs of human ingenuity and desire everywhere you look. The Black Table Grill Has been Relocated to Soho Village, Market Street, Directly Behind of, Gary’s Fruits and Flower Shop. Signed. THE PORK MAN reads a sign stuck to a wall. Now, that is how you write a sign. A real sign, not the come-ons for overpriced Rolexes that blink across the screens of the Royal Promenade.\n\n“Hey, tie your shoestring!” a pair of laughing ladies shout to me across the street.\n\n“Thank you!” I shout back. Shoestring! “Thank you very much.”\n\nA man in Independence Square Park comes by and asks if I want to play with his monkey. I haven’t heard that pickup line since the Penn Station of the 1980s. But then he pulls a real monkey out of a bag. The monkey is wearing a diaper and looks insane. Wonderful, I think, just wonderful! There is so much life here. I email my editor asking if I can remain on St. Kitts and allow the Icon to sail off into the horizon without me. I have even priced a flight home at less than $300, and I have enough material from the first four days on the cruise to write the entire story. “It would be funny …” my editor replies. “Now get on the boat.”\n\nAs I slink back to the ship after my brief jailbreak, the locals stand under umbrellas to gaze at and photograph the boat that towers over their small capital city. The limousines of the prime minister and his lackeys are parked beside the gangway. St. Kitts, I’ve been told, is one of the few islands that would allow a ship of this size to dock.\n\n“We hear about all the waterslides,” a sweet young server in one of the cafés told me. “We wish we could go on the ship, but we have to work.”\n\n“I want to stay on your island,” I replied. “I love it here.”\n\nBut she didn’t understand how I could possibly mean that.\n\n“WASHY, WASHY, so you don’t get stinky, stinky!” kids are singing outside the AquaDome, while their adult minders look on in disapproval, perhaps worried that Mr. Washy Washy is grooming them into a life of gayness. I heard a southern couple skip the buffet entirely out of fear of Mr. Washy Washy.\n\nMeanwhile, I have found a new watering hole for myself, the Swim & Tonic, the biggest swim-up bar on any cruise ship in the world. Drinking next to full-size, nearly naked Americans takes away one’s own self-consciousness. The men have curvaceous mom bodies. The women are equally un-shy about their sprawling physiques.\n\nToday I’ve befriended a bald man with many children who tells me that all of the little trinkets that Royal Caribbean has left us in our staterooms and suites are worth a fortune on eBay. “Eighty dollars for the water bottle, 60 for the lanyard,” the man says. “This is a cult.”\n\n“Tell me about it,” I say. There is, however, a clientele for whom this cruise makes perfect sense. For a large middle-class family (he works in “supply chains”), seven days in a lower-tier cabin—which starts at $1,800 a person—allow the parents to drop off their children in Surfside, where I imagine many young Filipina crew members will take care of them, while the parents are free to get drunk at a swim-up bar and maybe even get intimate in their cabin. Cruise ships have become, for a certain kind of hardworking family, a form of subsidized child care.\n\nThere is another man I would like to befriend at the Swim & Tonic, a tall, bald fellow who is perpetually inebriated and who wears a necklace studded with little rubber duckies in sunglasses, which, I am told, is a sort of secret handshake for cruise aficionados. Tomorrow, I will spend more time with him, but first the ship docks at St. Thomas, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Charlotte Amalie, the capital, is more charming in name than in presence, but I still all but jump off the ship to score a juicy oxtail and plantains at the well-known Petite Pump Room, overlooking the harbor. From one of the highest points in the small city, the Icon of the Seas appears bigger than the surrounding hills.\n\nI usually tan very evenly, but something about the discombobulation of life at sea makes me forget the regular application of sunscreen. As I walk down the streets of Charlotte Amalie in my fluorescent Icon of the Seas cap, an old Rastafarian stares me down. “Redneck,” he hisses.\n\n“No,” I want to tell him, as I bring a hand up to my red neck, “that’s not who I am at all. On my island, Mannahatta, as Whitman would have it, I am an interesting person living within an engaging artistic milieu. I do not wish to use the Caribbean as a dumping ground for the cruise-ship industry. I love the work of Derek Walcott. You don’t understand. I am not a redneck. And if I am, they did this to me.” They meaning Royal Caribbean? Its passengers? The Rands?\n\n“They did this to me!”\n\nBack on the Icon, some older matrons are muttering about a run-in with passengers from the Celebrity cruise ship docked next to us, the Celebrity Apex. Although Celebrity Cruises is also owned by Royal Caribbean, I am made to understand that there is a deep fratricidal beef between passengers of the two lines. “We met a woman from the Apex,” one matron says, “and she says it was a small ship and there was nothing to do. Her face was as tight as a 19-year-old’s, she had so much surgery.” With those words, and beneath a cloudy sky, humidity shrouding our weathered faces and red necks, we set sail once again, hopefully in the direction of home.\n\nTHERE ARE BARELY 48 HOURS LEFT to the cruise, and the Icon of the Seas’ passengers are salty. They know how to work the elevators. They know the Washy Washy song by heart. They understand that the chicken gyro at “Feta Mediterranean,” in the AquaDome Market, is the least problematic form of chicken on the ship.\n\nThe passengers have shed their INAUGURAL CRUISE T-shirts and are now starting to evince political opinions. There are caps pledging to make America great again and T-shirts that celebrate words sometimes attributed to Patrick Henry: “The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people; it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government.” With their preponderance of FAMILY FLAG FAITH FRIENDS FIREARMS T-shirts, the tables by the crepe station sometimes resemble the Capitol Rotunda on January 6. The Real Anthony Fauci, by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be a popular form of literature, especially among young men with very complicated versions of the American flag on their T-shirts. Other opinions blend the personal and the political. “Someone needs to kill Washy guy, right?” a well-dressed man in the elevator tells me, his gray eyes radiating nothing. “Just beat him to death. Am I right?” I overhear the male member of a young couple whisper, “There goes that freak” as I saunter by in my white spa robe, and I decide to retire it for the rest of the cruise.\n\nI visit the Royal Bling to see up close the $100,000 golden chalice that entitles you to free drinks on Royal Caribbean forever. The pleasant Serbian saleslady explains that the chalice is actually gold-plated and covered in white zirconia instead of diamonds, as it would otherwise cost $1 million. “If you already have everything,” she explains, “this is one more thing you can get.”\n\nI believe that anyone who works for Royal Caribbean should be entitled to immediate American citizenship. They already speak English better than most of the passengers and, per the Serbian lady’s sales pitch above, better understand what America is as well. Crew members like my Panamanian cabin attendant seem to work 24 hours a day. A waiter from New Delhi tells me that his contract is six months and three weeks long. After a cruise ends, he says, “in a few hours, we start again for the next cruise.” At the end of the half a year at sea, he is allowed a two-to-three-month stay at home with his family. As of 2019, the median income for crew members was somewhere in the vicinity of $20,000, according to a major business publication. Royal Caribbean would not share the current median salary for its crew members, but I am certain that it amounts to a fraction of the cost of a Royal Bling gold-plated, zirconia-studded chalice.\n\nAnd because most of the Icon’s hyper-sanitized spaces are just a frittata away from being a Delta lounge, one forgets that there are actual sailors on this ship, charged with the herculean task of docking it in port. “Having driven 100,000-ton aircraft carriers throughout my career,” retired Admiral James G. Stavridis, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, writes to me, “I’m not sure I would even know where to begin with trying to control a sea monster like this one nearly three times the size.” (I first met Stavridis while touring Army bases in Germany more than a decade ago.)\n\nToday, I decide to head to the hot tub near Swim & Tonic, where some of the ship’s drunkest reprobates seem to gather (the other tubs are filled with families and couples). The talk here, like everywhere else on the ship, concerns football, a sport about which I know nothing. It is apparent that four teams have recently competed in some kind of finals for the year, and that two of them will now face off in the championship. Often when people on the Icon speak, I will try to repeat the last thing they said with a laugh or a nod of disbelief. “Yes, 20-yard line! Ha!” “Oh my God, of course, scrimmage.”\n\nSoon we are joined in the hot tub by the late-middle-age drunk guy with the duck necklace. He is wearing a bucket hat with the legend HAWKEYES, which, I soon gather, is yet another football team. “All right, who turned me in?” Duck Necklace says as he plops into the tub beside us. “I get a call in the morning,” he says. “It’s security. Can you come down to the dining room by 10 a.m.? You need to stay away from the members of this religious family.” Apparently, the gregarious Duck Necklace had photobombed the wrong people. There are several families who present as evangelical Christians or practicing Muslims on the ship. One man, evidently, was not happy that Duck Necklace had made contact with his relatives. “It’s because of religious stuff; he was offended. I put my arm around 20 people a day.”\n\nEveryone laughs. “They asked me three times if I needed medication,” he says of the security people who apparently interrogated him in full view of others having breakfast.\n\nAnother hot-tub denizen suggests that he should have asked for fentanyl. After a few more drinks, Duck Necklace begins to muse about what it would be like to fall off the ship. “I’m 62 and I’m ready to go,” he says. “I just don’t want a shark to eat me. I’m a huge God guy. I’m a Bible guy. There’s some Mayan theory squaring science stuff with religion. There is so much more to life on Earth.” We all nod into our Red Stripes.\n\n“I never get off the ship when we dock,” he says. He tells us he lost $6,000 in the casino the other day. Later, I look him up, and it appears that on land, he’s a financial adviser in a crisp gray suit, probably a pillar of his North Chicago community.\n\nTHE OCEAN IS TEEMING with fascinating life, but on the surface it has little to teach us. The waves come and go. The horizon remains ever far away.\n\nI am constantly told by my fellow passengers that “everybody here has a story.” Yes, I want to reply, but everybody everywhere has a story. You, the reader of this essay, have a story, and yet you’re not inclined to jump on a cruise ship and, like Duck Necklace, tell your story to others at great pitch and volume. Maybe what they’re saying is that everybody on this ship wants to have a bigger, more coherent, more interesting story than the one they’ve been given. Maybe that’s why there’s so much signage on the doors around me attesting to marriages spent on the sea. Maybe that’s why the Royal Caribbean newsletter slipped under my door tells me that “this isn’t a vacation day spent—it’s bragging rights earned.” Maybe that’s why I’m so lonely.\n\nToday is a big day for Icon passengers. Today the ship docks at Royal Caribbean’s own Bahamian island, the Perfect Day at CocoCay. (This appears to be the actual name of the island.) A comedian at the nightclub opined on what his perfect day at CocoCay would look like—receiving oral sex while learning that his ex-wife had been killed in a car crash (big laughter). But the reality of the island is far less humorous than that.\n\nOne of the ethnic tristate ladies in the infinity pool told me that she loved CocoCay because it had exactly the same things that could be found on the ship itself. This proves to be correct. It is like the Icon, but with sand. The same tired burgers, the same colorful tubes conveying children and water from Point A to B. The same swim-up bar at its Hideaway ($140 for admittance, no children allowed; Royal Caribbean must be printing money off its clientele). “There was almost a fight at The Wizard of Oz,” I overhear an elderly woman tell her companion on a chaise lounge. Apparently one of the passengers began recording Royal Caribbean’s intellectual property and “three guys came after him.”\n\nI walk down a pathway to the center of the island, where a sign reads DO NOT ENTER: YOU HAVE REACHED THE BOUNDARY OF ADVENTURE. I hear an animal scampering in the bushes. A Royal Caribbean worker in an enormous golf cart soon chases me down and takes me back to the Hideaway, where I run into Mrs. Rand in a bikini. She becomes livid telling me about an altercation she had the other day with a woman over a towel and a deck chair. We Suites have special towel privileges; we do not have to hand over our SeaPass Card to score a towel. But the Rands are not Suites. “People are so entitled here,” Mrs. Rand says. “It’s like the airport with all its classes.” “You see,” I want to say, “this is where your husband’s love of Ayn Rand runs into the cruelties and arbitrary indignities of unbridled capitalism.” Instead we make plans to meet for a final drink in the Schooner Bar tonight (the Rands will stand me up).\n\nBack on the ship, I try to do laps, but the pool (the largest on any cruise ship, naturally) is fully trashed with the detritus of American life: candy wrappers, a slowly dissolving tortilla chip, napkins. I take an extra-long shower in my suite, then walk around the perimeter of the ship on a kind of exercise track, past all the alluring lifeboats in their yellow-and-white livery. Maybe there is a dystopian angle to the HBO series that I will surely end up pitching, one with shades of WALL-E or Snowpiercer. In a collapsed world, a Royal Caribbean–like cruise liner sails from port to port, collecting new shipmates and supplies in exchange for the precious energy it has on board. (The actual Icon features a new technology that converts passengers’ poop into enough energy to power the waterslides. In the series, this shitty technology would be greatly expanded.) A very young woman (18? 19?), smart and lonely, who has only known life on the ship, walks along the same track as I do now, contemplating jumping off into the surf left by its wake. I picture reusing Duck Necklace’s words in the opening shot of the pilot. The girl is walking around the track, her eyes on the horizon; maybe she’s highborn—a Suite—and we hear the voice-over: “I’m 19 and I’m ready to go. I just don’t want a shark to eat me.”\n\nBefore the cruise is finished, I talk to Mr. Washy Washy, or Nielbert of the Philippines. He is a sweet, gentle man, and I thank him for the earworm of a song he has given me and for keeping us safe from the dreaded norovirus. “This is very important to me, getting people to wash their hands,” he tells me in his burger getup. He has dreams, as an artist and a performer, but they are limited in scope. One day he wants to dress up as a piece of bacon for the morning shift.\n\nTHE MAIDEN VOYAGE OF THE TITANIC (the Icon of the Seas is five times as large as that doomed vessel) at least offered its passengers an exciting ending to their cruise, but when I wake up on the eighth day, all I see are the gray ghosts that populate Miami’s condo skyline. Throughout my voyage, my writer friends wrote in to commiserate with me. Sloane Crosley, who once covered a three-day spa mini-cruise for Vogue, tells me she felt “so very alone … I found it very untethering.” Gideon Lewis-Kraus writes in an Instagram comment: “When Gary is done I think it’s time this genre was taken out back and shot.” And he is right. To badly paraphrase Adorno: After this, no more cruise stories. It is unfair to put a thinking person on a cruise ship. Writers typically have difficult childhoods, and it is cruel to remind them of the inherent loneliness that drove them to writing in the first place. It is also unseemly to write about the kind of people who go on cruises. Our country does not provide the education and upbringing that allow its citizens an interior life. For the creative class to point fingers at the large, breasty gentlemen adrift in tortilla-chip-laden pools of water is to gather a sour harvest of low-hanging fruit.\n\nA day or two before I got off the ship, I decided to make use of my balcony, which I had avoided because I thought the view would only depress me further. What I found shocked me. My suite did not look out on Central Park after all. This entire time, I had been living in the ship’s Disneyland, Surfside, the neighborhood full of screaming toddlers consuming milkshakes and candy. And as I leaned out over my balcony, I beheld a slight vista of the sea and surf that I thought I had been missing. It had been there all along. The sea was frothy and infinite and blue-green beneath the span of a seagull’s wing. And though it had been trod hard by the world’s largest cruise ship, it remained.\n\nThis article appears in the May 2024 print edition with the headline “A Meatball at Sea.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Panama's president balks at the suggestion","text":"Donald Trump suggested Sunday that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal that the United States “foolishly” ceded to its Central American ally, contending that shippers are charged “ridiculous” fees to pass through the vital transportation channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\n\r\n Panama's conservative president José Raúl Mulino, who was elected in April on a pro-business platform, roundly rejected that notion as an affront to his country's sovereignty.\n\n\r\n\r\n The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\r\n\n\r\n The Republican president-elect's comment came during his first major rally since winning the White House on Nov. 5. He also used his comments to also bask in his return to power as a large audience of conservatives cheered along. It was a display of party unity at odds with a just-concluded budget fight on Capitol Hill where some GOP lawmakers openly defied their leader's demands.\n\n\r\n Addressing supporters at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Arizona, Trump pledged that his “dream team Cabinet” would deliver a booming economy, seal U.S. borders and quickly settle wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\n\r\n “I can proudly proclaim that the Golden Age of America is upon us,” Trump said. “There’s a spirit that we have now that we didn’t have just a short while ago.”\n\n\r\n His appearance capped a four-day pep rally that drew more than 20,000 activists and projected an image of Republican cohesion despite the past week's turbulence in Washington with Trump pulling strings from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as Congress worked to avoid a government shutdown heading into the Christmas holiday.\n\n\r\n House Republicans spiked a bipartisan deal after Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally, expressed their opposition on social media. Budget hawks flouted Trump's request to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, which would have spared some new rounds of the same fight after he takes office Jan. 20, 2025, with Republicans holding narrow control of the House and Senate. The final agreement did not address the issue and there was no shutdown.\n\n\r\n Trump, in his remarks in Phoenix, did not mention the congressional drama, though he did reference Musk's growing power. To suggestions that \"President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon,” Trump made clear, “No, no. That’s not happening.”\n\n\r\n “He’s not gonna be president,” Trump said.\n\n\r\n\r\n Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips\r\n\n\r\n The president-elect opened the speech by saying that \"we want to try to bring everybody together. We’re going to try. We’re going to really give it a shot.\" Then he suggested Democrats have “lost their confidence” and are “befuddled” after the election but eventually will ”come over to our side because we want to have them.”\n\n\r\n Atop a list of grievances — some old, some new — was the Panama Canal.\n\n\r\n “We’re being ripped off at the Panama Canal,” he said, bemoaning that his country ”foolishly gave it away.”\n\n\r\n The United States built the Panama canal in the early 1900s, as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 under President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\r\n The canal depends on reservoirs to operate its locks and was heavily affected by 2023 Central American droughts that forced it to substantially reduce the number of daily slots for crossing ships. With fewer ships using the canal each day, administrators also increased the fees that are charged all shippers for reserving a slot.\n\n\r\n With weather returning to normal in the later months of this year, transit on the canal has normalized. But price increases are still expected for next year.\n\n\r\n Mulino, Panama's president, has been described as a conservative populist who aligns with Trump on many issues. Panama is a strong U.S. ally and the canal is crucial for its economy, generating about one-fifth of that government’s annual revenue.\n\n\r\n Still, Trump said, that, once his second term is underway, \"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.”\n\n\r\n “I’m not going to stand for it,\" Trump said. \"So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.”\n\n\r\n He did not explain how that would be possible.\n\n\r\n A short time after Trump's speech, Mulino released a video declaring that “every square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong” to his country.\n\n\r\n\r\n Read more of the latest international headlines\r\n\n\r\n Without mentioning Trump by name, Mulino addressed the president-elect's complaints over rising fees for ships crossing the canal, saying that they are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors.\n\n\r\n “The tariffs are not set on a whim” Mulino said. He noted that Panama has expanded the canal over the years to increase ship traffic “on its own initiative,” and added that shipping fee increases help pay for improvements.\n\n\r\n “Panamanians may have different views on many issues” Mulino said. “But when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.”\n\n\r\n The canal aside, Trump’s appearance at Turning Point’s annual gathering affirmed the growing influence the group and its founder, Charlie Kirk, have had in the conservative movement. Kirk’s organization hired thousands of field organizers across presidential battlegrounds, helping Trump make key gains among infrequent voters and other groups of people that have trended more Democratic in recent decades, including younger voters, Black men and Latino men.\n\n\r\n ”You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”\n\n\r\n Also Sunday, Trump said that Stephen Miran, who worked at the Treasury Department in Trump's first term, was his choice to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. He also announced his choice of venture capitalist Scott Kupor to serve as the director of the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s chief human resources agency.\n\n\r\n And Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt announced he was donating $1.1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund to complement the $14 million that he said he already had given to the Make America Great Again Inc. super political action committee — making him one of the president-elect’s top donors.\n\n\r\n Pratt is chairman of Pratt Industries, which uses recycled paper and boxes as a raw material in a process that produces new cardboard.\n\n\r\n Weissert reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump was able to flip Bucks County, but it’s also important to note the gains he made in Montgomery, Chester and Delaware counties.\n\nIn Delaware County, specifically, the traction he gained with working class voters, as reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer, shows you the connection he made with blue collar workers in the steady blue precincts.\n\nIn order to understand the gains made by Trump, I spoke with Frank Agovino, chairman of Delaware County’s GOP, to see if the progress made by Republicans is solely a Trump centric one-off, why Trump resonated with the common man, and if the Keystone State is no longer a battleground state.\n\n“I think, both, two things with Trump, we definitely saw an improvement in precincts in the areas that are traditionally difficult: minority areas, 6th and 7th, along the Philly border. When you dive deep, we moved more to the right than the average, 10-11%. He added “I really saw something with African American males. They were open to voting for Trump. I saw them, I talked with them, they wanted something different. They understood inflation was high and so was crime. Things were not great. Trump was a straight shooter. It resonated. Trump had a message, and people wanted the change and it’s still happening. We’re seeing independents grow over both parties, with the biggest exodus being Dem to unaffiliated.”\n\nWhen it came to Trump and the connection he made with the blue-collar worker, Agovino said it’s hardly a Trump phenomenon. “It’s a phenomenon going on across the country. It’s flipping from the 80’s to now. Democrats are the educated elite, it’s a complete role reversal,” he said. “Trump is not perceived as a politician, but he says what he says, doesn’t give a damn who he offends, there’s a grit to him, even though he’s the billionaire from Mar-A-Lago. If you pick the top 5 adjectives in Delco, it starts with grit. We’ve become more blue collar, not less. Manufacturing is gone, but refining is still a thing and the jobs are good paying. We’re getting more and more blue collar by the day. Delco represents America. We have a lot of everything in this county, from affluent to poor.”\n\nPennsylvania and its nineteen electoral college votes will always be valued by both the Republican party and Democratic party. Is Pennsylvania still considered a battleground or are Republicans in the driver’s seat moving forward? Agovino says there is still work to do. “I would say we are still purple but approaching red. I think we will need a couple more years of election cycles and we will get there. Trending Republican at this rate with this platform. We asked the campaign many times to have a presence in Delco. JD Vance is educated and sharp as a whip, but his background and growing up also resonated in Delco. They did a good job of connecting with voters about his past and coming through the ranks. Delco liked JD Vance.”\n\nAgovino added: “Social issues were an underpinning issue and played to the Republican’s success. It was going too far left. Delco is a moderate county, and the far-left attempts to normalize their ideologies were starting to feel like too much to Republicans.”\n\nAgovino is new to the arena, having been a part of the political scene for just over a year and a half, but he absolutely knows his constituents, he wanted the Trump campaign to make an investment in Delaware County, and the Trump campaign capitalized on their time invested in one of Philadelphia’s most diverse suburbs.\n\nThe GOP has built up trust and good will with more voters in Delaware County and the collar counties in 2024 than they had in 2020. Now it’s time to deliver on campaign promises and produce results. Agovino seems to believe that slow and steady will win the race and he’s confident that Republicans are on the right track, even in the soon-to-come post Trump era.","summary":"'Trump was a straight shooter.

He warned that if Panama failed to manage the canal in a way he deemed acceptable, he would push for the canal to be handed back to the United States. Posting on Truth Social, Trump also expressed concern about potential Chinese influence over the canal, emphasising that he would not allow the critical passage to fall into the \"wrong hands.\" His comments marked a rare instance of a US leader suggesting that a sovereign country could be compelled to relinquish territory. \"The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the US,\" Trump wrote. He criticised Panama for what he sees as mismanagement and suggested the canal should be returned to the US if moral and legal principles are not upheld. The Panama Canal, a vital trade route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, was built largely by the US. After decades of US administration, full control was handed to Panama in 1999 following a joint administration period. Trump’s remarks highlight a potential shift in US diplomacy under his leadership. Known for his confrontational rhetoric, Trump has often taken a hardline approach with both allies and adversaries. The Panamanian embassy in Washington has not yet commented on Trump’s statements. However, his remarks are likely to raise concerns about the future of US-Panama relations and the management of one of the world’s most strategic waterways.","url":"https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-donald-trump-big-threat-says-will-take-back-control-of-panama-canal-3123625","image":"https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/12/22/2668109-2641615-donald-trump-reuters.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 23:21:24","author":"Shivam Verma","authors":["Shivam Verma"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.602},{"id":275387170,"title":"Happy birthday Isha Talwar: 10 stunning pics of Mirzapur actress","text":"Bigg Boss 18: Edin Rose, Yamini Malhotra eliminated in double eviction\n\nTelangana CM Revanth Reddy condemns attack on Allu Arjun's home\n\nGautam Adani's big move, to set up Rs 20000 crore ultra-super critical...\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nFrom Brown Tones to Red Wine Hues; 6 nail trends are about to dominate 2025\n\nMeet two men who are changing Anil Ambani's fortunes, clearing debts, they work \n\n5 most expensive Rolls-Royce cars in the world\n\nHappy birthday Isha Talwar: 10 stunning pics of Mirzapur actress\nAs Isha Talwar turned 37, here are a few photos of her where she left her followers dazzled by her beauty. \n\nSimran Singh | Dec 22, 2024, 10:55 AM IST\n\n1.Isha Talwar turned 37\n\nDecember 22 marks the birthday of actress Isha Talwar.

But Russians have advanced far enough into the salient that the fighting has pushed the medical staff back over the border.\r\n\nWith no medics to treat him nearby, both hands gushing blood and the four other men in his unit all killed, Yurii, 45, said he used his teeth to tie tourniquets on each arm, took a radio off his dead commander and eventually found fellow troops who the next day loaded him onto a U.S.-made Stryker fighting vehicle and took him back over the border — and then on to the hospital where he told his story.\n\nYurii’s devastating wounds came during a massive Russian counterattack that poses a serious threat to Ukraine’s only territorial bargaining chip in the war and the result of one of the war’s biggest gambles — August’s incursion into Russia. Like other Ukrainian ground troops in this article, he spoke on the condition he be identified by only his first name, in keeping with military rules.\n\nThe intensity of the attacks in Kursk signals Russian President Vladimir Putin’s growing desperation to take that chip off the table — and quickly — as pressure mounts for possible negotiations to end the war ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration next month.\n\nRussia has deployed 60,000 troops to the region and is assaulting Ukrainian positions with all means at its disposal, Ukrainian commanders and soldiers say, often moving by motorcycles, buggies, bicycles and on foot to limit their losses on roads controlled by Ukrainian firepower. In recent days, waves of North Korean troops have also appeared on the battlefield, advancing in large groups that have made for easy targeting.\r\n\nOutnumbered, Ukraine is clinging to the sliver of territory it still controls — bolstered in part by President Joe Biden’s recent decision to allow Kyiv to use U.S.-made missiles, known as ATACMS, to strike deeper inside of Russia. Muddy conditions and natural barriers including rivers have also helped Ukraine hold some lines. But the huge Russian deployment to Kursk has helped Moscow claw back around 40 percent of the 530 square miles Ukraine initially seized.\n\nWhen Yurii and his fellow troops drove into Kursk for their final mission this month, “we were sure we were going to achieve something,” he recalled. “But we were not sure we were going to survive.”\r\n\nPutin downplayed Ukraine’s brazen incursion when it happened in August, framing it as a futile sideshow to the main fighting in Ukraine’s east. But almost five months on, as the fighting intensifies, the battle for this corner of western Russia has proved that Ukraine’s cross-border incursion marked a watershed moment in the war — even if the final outcome remains unclear.\n\n“I can be frank with you: Even when I was creating this operation … I was very skeptical about it in general,” said Col. Dmytro Voloshyn, commander of Ukraine’s 82nd Brigade. Since, then, he said, the importance of the fight in Kursk has become “undeniable.”\r\n\nThere has been skepticism of the effectiveness of the Kursk operation — both in Ukraine and among its partners — with critics suggesting Ukraine would have been better served reinforcing its existing front lines in the east.\n\nIts supporters, however, say the assault was Ukraine’s only option: A Russian attack on the north was imminent, officials claim, and Russia’s fortifications in Ukraine’s south and east would have made similar missions there nearly impossible.\r\n\nAlthough Russia still targets the Sumy region across the border, it is also using its weapons at home for the first time — damaging its own towns and infrastructure instead of just Ukraine’s.\n\nUkraine’s seizure of hundreds of Russian soldiers as prisoners “forced Russia” to restart exchanges with troops from Ukraine’s Azov Battalion who were captured in early 2022, said Vasyl Malyuk, head of Ukraine’s internal security service, the SBU. Interrogations with Russian prisoners have aimed “to obtain evidence of war crimes committed by them in Ukraine, and bring criminals to justice,” he said.\r\n\nThe operation also forced Russia to move tens of thousands of troops away from front lines in Ukraine.\r\n\n“This is a story of principle for Putin, first and foremost. He threw [his] ready-made and best brigades here. These are trained, confident types … We are fighting the elite,” said Capt. Oleh Shyriaiev, commander of Ukraine’s 225th Assault Battalion, whose troops crossed the border on Aug. 6. “We pulled them back from other regions.”\r\n\n“The positive thing,” he added, “is that we have destroyed the warehouses with drones, ATACMS, and so on. We destroyed arsenals, ammunition depots, all of it.”\r\n\nStill, many Russians troops stayed in Ukraine’s east to focus on seizing the strategic city of Pokrovsk. They are now nearly in reach of the city, though the advance has taken much longer than most expected. Months of grinding battles have caused significant Russian losses there and in Kursk.\r\n\nAnd Ukraine has more reason than ever to stand its ground in Russia: Officials say if they retreat, the 60,000 troops they are fighting off will follow them back into Ukraine.\r\n\n“We will not go anywhere,” Shyriaiev said.\r\n\nIn border villages in the Sumy region, where Russia has struck regularly with glide bombs, most civilians have left home. Their houses are now empty, destroyed or made into makeshift military bases and medical points.\r\n\nIn one such house, medics from Ukraine’s 82nd Brigade had set up a small clinic. The first group to establish a medical station inside of Russia in August, they have seen the cost of Kursk firsthand, treating 1,200 wounded troops in the months that followed — with all casualties now treated on the Ukrainian side of the border.\n\nOn a frigid December morning, they crowded around a soldier named Vova, who hours earlier took shrapnel to his lung. He had waited hours in the cold for an evacuation, his lung filling with blood. His eyes rolled backward as they pumped him with plasma. He screamed as they used a tube to drain two cups of his blood into the bottom half of a plastic water bottle they had cut and placed on the floor.\r\n\nWhen they moved him to an ambulance, they shouted at journalists to stay inside. Russian drones hovered overhead constantly, and the houses where they treat casualties have been targeted before. Several of their medical colleagues have been wounded or killed, they said. They fear so much for their safety that they hide their location even from neighboring Ukrainian brigades. Dozens of glide bombs can land nearby each day.\r\n\nDespite the risks, Roman, 41, interim commander of the medical unit, said he still thinks the Kursk operation was worth it. “If we keep them on their territory, our territory is less destroyed,” he said.\r\n\nIn another such house, troops from Ukraine’s 95th Brigade sat at desks, preparing attack drones to use inside of Kursk. A gray rescue cat named Bandit meandered through stacks of weapons and energy drinks on the floor.\r\n\nAndrii, 35, commander of the drone unit based there, described how recent Russian methods show they are seeking “to retake [Kursk] at any cost.”\r\n\nHis unit has observed how Russia has recently sent columns of vehicles down roads Ukraine controls — seemingly willing to take their chances at losing multiple armored vehicles and many personnel if it means even one or two might get through.\n\n“They send a tank, we destroy it, they send an APC, we destroy it, they send a BTR, we destroy it. And now they’re using motorcycle groups,” he said, referring to types of armored vehicles. “Even if we are still destroying them, they will probably still come on foot.”\r\n\nDmytro, 25, an assault company commander in the same brigade, described Russia’s tactics as “meat assaults.”\r\n\nBut even as they expend huge numbers of troops and equipment on attempts to retake the territory, he doesn’t expect Russia will be able to easily push past Ukrainian defenses this winter.\r\n\n“There’s a cemetery of destroyed Russian vehicles in Kursk,” he said.","url":"https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2024-12-22/ukraine-troops-cling-to-kursk-16247140.html","image":"https://www.stripes.com/incoming/5p2xti-ukraine-kursk-g2n4tpilkloj5iq65c44kh5joy.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/ukraine-kursk-G2N4TPILKLOJ5IQ65C44KH5JOY.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-22 23:18:23","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143}]}
