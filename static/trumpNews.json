Four Republican senators -- Susan Collins (Maine), Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Rand Paul (Kentucky) -- joined Democrats in supporting the resolution to end Trump's tariff powers.The Senate had previously approved the same measure on April 2, but its progress stalled after the Republican-controlled House refused to take it up. The resolution's sponsor, Senator Tim Kaine (Democrat-Virginia), reintroduced it this week, arguing that Trump's tariffs on Canada cannot be justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, The Hill reported. \"I primarily object to the Canada tariffs because I don't think there's an emergency that should trigger the use of this statute,\" Kaine said during the floor debate. \"The fracturing of this long-standing, powerful relationship [with Canada] is one of the many reasons I oppose them.\"Senator Susan Collins, who represents Maine, a state bordering Canada, has repeatedly warned that the tariffs would hurt her state's economy. \"The Maine economy is integrated with Canada, our most important trading partner,\" she said in an earlier statement, adding that tariffs on petroleum products, paper mills, forest industries, and fisheries would be detrimental to many Maine families and local economies.\"Live EventsTrump's dispute with Canada escalated earlier this week after Ontario aired a television advertisement during the World Series featuring a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs. Calling the ad a \"serious misrepresentation of the facts\" and a \"hostile act,\" Trump announced a 10 per cent increase in tariffs on Canadian imports in retaliation.Wednesday's Senate vote came a day after five Republican senators joined Democrats in passing a similar resolution to terminate Trump's emergency authority to impose tariffs on Brazil.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onCanada trade relationsTim Kaine Senate resolutionRepublican senators supportTrump tariffs revocationOntario advertisement tariffsUS Senate tariffs Canadaeconomic impact Maine CanadaRonald Reagan tariffs ad\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

And it was a great honour for Australia to be invited. It’s not the usual thing for such a small, intimate dinner as it was last night to occur, but a real opportunity, and one that I was very pleased to accept,” Albanese told reporters.He would not reveal the timing of when he received the invite, but confirmed he knew going into the dinner that he would be seated at Trump’s right-hand side.The meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is the first time the pair have met in person in more than six years, and the first since the president returned to the White House.Their last face-to-face meeting was in June 2019 at the G20 summit in Japan. That encounter ended with Trump saying he would allow US companies to continue trading with Chinese tech giant Huawei, a move seen as a significant concession amid security concerns over the company’s links to the Chinese government.Donald Trump and Xi Jinping meet in Osaka in 2019.Credit: APTrump also agreed to pause further US tariffs on China and said he would continue to negotiate on trade “for the time being”.The dispute between the two countries had escalated in the preceding year, with Trump accusing China of stealing intellectual property and forcing US firms to share trade secrets to do business in China.\n\nThe main event today is the blockbuster meeting on the APEC sidelines between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping after months of trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies destabilised global markets and supply chains.The meeting is scheduled for 11am (1pm AEDT), in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometres south of Gyeongju, though the exact venue details are not yet known.The high stakes meeting marks the first time the pair will sit down face-to-face since Trump returned to the White House, and follows two known phone calls between the leaders.US President Donald Trump speaks at the APEC CEO summit in Gyeongju on Wednesday.Credit: BloombergThe US and Chinese presidents are expected to agree to a truce deal that will roll back some of the recent trade restrictions their countries have slapped on each others’ economies, including new port fees on shipping operations and US threats to tighten control on China’s access to American software.As part of the anticipated deal, Trump and his officials have already foreshadowed that his administration will lower tariffs in exchange for Beijing’s co-operation on fentanyl trafficking.LoadingHowever, the big ticket item is securing a delay to Beijing’s planned sweeping curbs on rare earth exports, which have threatened to derail global high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for Trump abandoning plans to hit China’s export with an additional 100 per cent tariffs on November 1.In a positive sign ahead of the meeting, China made its first purchases of American soybeans yesterday after a months-long hiatus that threatened to financially cripple US farmers – a key voting base for Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Royal Australian Airforce jet winged its way into Busan, the closet international airport to the APEC summit, yesterday from Kuala Lumpur, pulling up on the tarmac next to US President Donald Trump’s Air Force One.Albanese came directly to Gyeongju from Kuala Lumpur, where he had attended the ASEAN summit, and arrived a day earlier than his original schedule in time for an intimate dinner with Trump and a handful of other leaders last night.Anthony Albanese and Donald Trump dining with other world leaders in Gyeongju, South Korea yesterday.Credit: APLoadingThe dinner was hosted by South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, with Trump the guest of honour. It is not exactly clear how Albanese scored an invitation, along with the leaders of Canada, New Zealand, Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore, but it proved diplomatically fruitful, with the US president full of bonhomie and praising Albanese for their “great meeting a week ago” and saying the prime minister had done a “fantastic job”.“We’re working together on rare earths, but we’re working on a lot of things together,” Trump said.You can read a recap of the dinner hereGood morning.

Kelly left Notre Dame after the 2021 season and ultimately spent fewer than four full seasons in Baton Rouge. \"We had high hopes that he would lead us to multiple SEC and national championships during his time in Baton Rouge,\" Woodward said in the announcement. \"Ultimately, the success at the level that LSU demands simply did not materialize, and I made the decision to make a change after last night's game.\" LSU continues to finalize Kelly’s $54 million buyout, a figure that Landry has criticized.

Seibt has also been accused of heaping praise on an alleged white nationalist and criticised for her support of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party. \n\nDue to her opinions, Seibt claims she was followed in the street, called a 'Nazi' and 'racist,' targeted by Antifa extremists, and even placed under illegal surveillance by German police.\n\nFollowing the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in September and the attempt on U.S. President Donald Trump's life last year, Seibt believes outspoken conservatives are being hunted by people who have been radicalised with far-left ideologies. \n\nExplaining that she believes her death would serve to silence her and deter others from speaking out, in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail from Washington, D.C., she says: 'If I went to Europe, it would be extremely useful to kill me. And I do believe there is a chance that would occur. That's why I'm here. I'm not at the same level of danger here.'\n\nAccording to her, even Elon Musk, with who she has struck up a friendship after he agreed with her views online, has privately told her he would never travel to Europe as he fears for his life.\n\nShe claims: 'Elon Musk himself would not go to Europe. He refuses to go, especially to Germany. He has said that very clearly to me personally. He was invited to a big event in Austria, and I asked him if he would go.\n\n'He made it clear that they underestimated the threat level of going to Europe, so he wouldn't do it.' \n\nAsked to clarify the threats he believed he'd face on the continent, she says: 'Assassination. That's very clearly what he was referring to.'\n\nAlthough Seibt and Musk have interacted publicly on social media, Daily Mail has not seen evidence of private communications where Musk expressed these concerns. \n\nSpeaking about being targeted by far-left extremists, she adds: 'They have been trained to see us as monsters. If you put me in a room with someone who's from Antifa, I would encourage them to have a conversation with me, and they would most likely shut it down. Because they see me, and they see a Nazi.\n\n'If you train someone to believe that somebody else is the monster, you basically train them like soldiers. The second they see me, and associate me with all the emotions that I've been accumulating in them, they want to destroy me, whatever it takes.'\n\n'They tell themselves they are against Nazis, but the irony is that they are the ones who want to restrict free speech - that's what Hitler wanted to do.'\n\nShe says her security concerns were validated when she claims, police dismissed her fears after she started receiving death threats. She says: 'I have become a very big target, obviously, of Antifa, so I receive death threats, sometimes even still in my emails. \n\n'I went to the police on multiple occasions and they told me, as long as no harm has been done to me, as long as I've not been raped or killed, there's nothing they can do.' \n\nSeibt claims that the 'harassment' began shortly after she was labelled the Anti-Greta Thunberg. 'I had a certain impact in Germany because I was the very first, young, blonde, girly voice for a more right-wing movement, and I became known as the anti-Greta Thunberg', she says.\n\n'I just became more involved in this whole community of scientists who were sceptical of climate change. And so I made this video where I just asked these kinds of questions. And that went viral.\n\n'Then I was asked to participate in the Climate Sceptic Conference in Germany, and then I became known in the media as the Anti-Greta Thunberg. \n\n'And this is when I started being harassed even more by Antifa and by the media because they were deliberately trying to frame me in a narrative that I was some far-right chick, and the poster girl for the right.'\n\nBefore long, the threats had taken a sinister turn, she claims. 'And that's when the Antifa death threats started happening, because everything that I had online was just very public, everything was disclosed,' she states.\n\n'And I got super scared, because I have a little sister, and I have a single mom, and so we're all girls, essentially. We didn't have anyone to protect us.'\n\nShe recalls being recognised at a climate change protest and confronted by men she believes were linked to Antifa.\n\n'They were these big, buff guys, and they were slowly walking towards me,' she notes. 'They backed me against a tree. And then eventually the police noticed it, and they came.\n\n'In the end, I was the one who ended up being pulled away as the police said I was provoking the group. I was shocked - I hadn't said a word to them. But the police said they knew I was the one causing trouble because they knew who I was.'\n\nThe incident, she explains, left her shaken and humiliated. 'They treated me as though I was the threat,' she asserts. \n\n'My mere existence was threatening to these big Antifa guys.' That's when I asked myself if the police would ever be there for me in these types of dangerous situations.'\n\nOnline, she says the abuse only escalated. After an interview, which she claims she was 'pressured' into, aired on national television in 2019, Seibt says the comments section was filled with vicious personal insults as she was portrayed as a ' dangerous Nazi girl.' \n\nShe explains: 'Obviously, in Germany, that's the one allegation that you don't want to have put on you. I never identified with any of these beliefs.\n\n'After the interview, I got increasingly more death threats. At that time, I was so underweight, and I had terrible inflammation in my face as I was ill. I got many hate comments afterwards, with some going as far as calling me a crack w****.\n\n'And that's why I was even more scared of these death threats, because I knew I was way too frail. So, if somebody attacks me, it's over.'\n\nSeibt notes that her family also became targets - her address became public because as per German law, anyone who runs a professional website or monetised YouTube channel must list an address.\n\nShe says this made her vulnerable, and people began to stalk her. The most disturbing messages, she claims, were aimed at her little sister after she gave a speech in parliament questioning the PCR tests used during the pandemic. \n\nShe explains: 'I got death threats online and people were commenting about my little sister, and then someone at some point, threatened that they would want to rape my sister. That was the most shocking thing for me.\n\n'There was nothing I could do. She is just a normal teenager who never deserved to be dragged into this. I wanted to protect her at all costs.'\n\nSeibt insists she became increasingly convinced that authorities were not only failing to protect her, but actively monitoring her.\n\n'I found out this year that last year I was, some of my phone calls had been intercepted by the federal German police because they were looking for someone,' she claims. \n\n'Then I filed an official request to the German intelligence community to see how much information they had retained about me, because you can do that in Germany.\n\n'And then they have to, at the very least, give you some vague estimation of what they have on you. I just received an email two months ago, saying that they are still assembling all the information because it's a lot.' \n\nDaily Mail has not seen evidence of the alleged interception. German police have not responded to requests for comment. \n\nSeibt claims the hatred was not only confined to left-wing extremists. She recalls a time when she was severely ill and had to be rushed to the hospital. \n\nDescribing an 'uncomfortable incident, she says: 'Some of the nurses knew who I was, and they were talking behind my back, and that was the most uncomfortable position to be in. \n\n'I had a doctor come up to me two days after I was in the hospital, and he said to me, \"You are going to die anyway.\"'\n\nSeibt says the frequency of the attacks led her to flee to the US in September last year. Although she was planning on visiting for just a month, she ended up extending her stay and decided to file for asylum last month. \n\n'I made the honestly difficult decision to apply for asylum,' she states. 'If I just wanted to stay in America, I could have easily applied for something like a journalism visa. Applying for asylum has made my personal life more difficult. \n\n'I cannot leave the country, which means I can't see my family. There's a very, very good chance that I'm not going to see my grandma anymore as she's quite old. But I feel like it had to be done because I need this official protection from the US government. \n\n'Otherwise, I'm worried that at some point they will try to blackmail me by harming my family in Germany, and I just want to be completely disassociated from that, and have the official protection from the American government. \n\n'This will allow me to continue to speak freely and expose more information about what I know to be true about the German government.'\n\nWhen she declared her intention to vote for the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) on X, she was stunned when the platform's owner, Elon Musk, reached out and showed his support and also backed the party.\n\nIn May this year, Germany's domestic spy agency designated the AfD as a 'right-wing extremist party', a move that Seibt condemns. \n\n'The AFD obviously is the strongest opposition party at this point. They are now at 27 per cent voter support. It makes them the most popular party in Germany, and they are at risk of being banned currently.'\n\nShe also said supporters and people linked to the AfD have been put under constant surveillance, a claim that has not been substantiated by Daily Mail. \n\nSeibt says she was targeted with more death threats after her public interactions with Musk. Seibt remarks that the Tesla founder, named the richest man in the world, warned her never to return to Europe, as it was unsafe. \n\n'As soon as I detach myself from America, I will no longer have any protection,' she says. I addressed this with Elon personally at some point in messages, and he agreed that it would be too dangerous to go to Europe, and I should definitely not do that.'\n\nBelieving that Europe is no longer a place where opinions could be shared freely, she welcomes reports that Donald Trump is considering granting asylum to Europeans who have been targeted online for their opinions. \n\nTrump and his administration, including Musk, who held an appointment until May this year, have regularly hit out at what they note is a restriction on free speech. \n\n'That came very out of the blue, and I obviously support it,' Seibt says.\n\n'This probably has to do a lot with the work that Vice President J.D. Vance has already done, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who have openly spoken about the threat to free speech, or the threat from within, as J.D. Vance called it. It's where citizens are being arrested for memes and communications online.' \n\n'In my personal opinion, I honestly think that this is a reason to claim that you are being persecuted by the government.'\n\nAlthough freedom of speech in Germany is guaranteed in Article 5 of the Basic Law, which is the German constitution, there are limits. It is a crime to insult others in the country. Spreading and demeaning others is also prohibited. \n\nThis means that Germany has tighter laws governing what a person can say. Seibt alleges that authorities go to great lengths to enforce this. \n\nShe declares: 'The problem is you can stretch the definition so much that even if any average citizen posts something like a poop emoji next to a politician, they could be fined, sometimes up to thousands of Euros. Sometimes, people have their homes raided.'\n\nEarlier this year, cops launched a nationwide operation against online hate speech and incitement. It was reported that the crackdown was targeting individuals who insulted politicians and incited hostility towards a particular group. \n\nOne conservative lawmaker said at the time: 'Digital arsonists should not be able to hide behind their cellphones or computers.' \n\nBut Seibt has condemned the move, saying: 'In one day, they raided around 170 homes. Without a trial, they confiscate these people's phones, and they don't get them back. They also don't get a chance to defend themselves in court.\n\n'To me, that screams tyranny, because you cannot even criticise your politicians, or you have to fear that it will be counted as a form of defamation, or damaging their reputation, which is what this law applies to.\n\n'If you're gonna say that you have free speech in the country, then this needs to be eliminated.'\n\nBut observers in favour of the law say it is necessary as far-right ideology is linked to the 40 per cent rise in politically motivated crimes in the country. Last year, they soared to 84,172 - almost half of them were motivated by far-right talking points, according to figures. \n\nSome have said Seibt's public opinions go beyond the limits of what is acceptable. \n\nWhen challenged about the risk of generalisation, she insists: 'If you take a look at the crime statistics in Germany, every single time, these immigrants that we have imported are vastly overrepresented, and the worst country of origin for this is Afghanistan.\n\n'Putting your own country first is not a negative thing, and it is not racist. I think it's crucial - that's what we elect the government for - to protect us. Our women are being raped at such a disproportionately high rate. \n\n'Many of the immigrants, I'm sure, are super nice. But is there a reason why we should risk it all instead of figuring out what the original problem is in the first place? \n\n'Of course, it's not everyone, but you have a duty to protect your own people first, because we are sacrificing, especially our women and children.'\n\nAt the root of the problem, she believes, is a lack of patriotism across Europe. With flags being taken down in Germany and Europe, she believes the wrong message is being sent. \n\n'Being patriots at the very end of everything should be the core value. I don't see that in Germany and Europe. If we had both the left and right being patriots above all, then I think we could communicate with each other way more.\n\n'In America, you're not gonna find, like, reasonable Democrats who would burn the American flag. Actually, if you go to a Democratic political event, you will still see the American flag everywhere. They just interpret the American flag differently.'\n\nDespite what some believe are controversial opinions, Seibt insists she's neither a racist nor a Nazi and says she welcomes opposing views. \n\nShe explains: 'The best thing we can do is to keep having conversations about these topics. \n\n'And if we allow these free conversations online and in real life, and we have more discussion forums in that way, we would have a better chance of finding more commonalities than anything else.'\n\nWhile her critics argue that she fuels division, her supporters see her as a symbol of free speech in Europe. Seibt, however, maintains she is unfairly vilified.","summary":"Naomi Seibt, 25, from Germany , shot to fame in 2019 after her videos challenging climate change went viral, sparking comparisons to Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15238349/I-famous-Anti-Greta-Thunberg-death-rape-threats-Antifa-Ill-killed-return-Europe-Elon-Musk-told-fears-fate-visited-continent.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/29/16/103399817-0-image-m-30_1761754260972.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 00:50:31","author":"Editor,Kevin Adjei-Darko","authors":["Editor","Kevin Adjei-Darko"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.088},{"id":373904338,"title":"GOP congressman urges 'no' vote on California measure to redraw US House maps","text":"CHICO, Calif. (AP) — California Rep. Doug LaMalfa made a last-ditch plea Wednesday for Republicans to vote ‘no’ on a ballot measure aimed at pushing him out of office.\n\n“It’s really a blatant power grab,” he said at a news conference in Chico, a city at the southern end of his district that covers a vast, rural swath of Northern California.\n\nVoting ends Tuesday on Proposition 50, which would create partisan U.S. House maps outside of normal once-a-decade redistricting handled by an independent commission. It’s an effort by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to counter a Trump-backed plan in Texas to gain five more Republican seats. The new California map aims to dilute Republican voting power by redrawing districts that help Democrats win five more seats.\n\nNewsom says it’s a necessary step to defend democracy, but California Republicans call it a power grab that will disenfranchise voters. Republicans currently hold nine of the state’s 52 congressional seats.\n\nIf the measure passes, the new maps would be in place for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 midterm elections.\n\nAfter the 2030 Census, the measure promises to give map-drawing power back to the independent commission that typically handles redistricting. But LaMalfa warned it’s just the first step toward a permanent, partisan process.\n\n“If Sacramento is emboldened by this passing, what will stop them?” he said, noting Democrats hold supermajorities in both chambers in the Legislature.\n\nLaMalfa appeared alongside local elected officials and farmers in his district, which is known for farms that grow rice, olive and other tree nuts, as well as ranching. The new map would split his district, which includes counties that went strongly for President Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections. Parts of his district would the merge with more liberal districts near the coast.\n\nLaMalfa’s new district would have many more Democratic voters, making his reelection bid increasingly challenging. But he said Wednesday he plans to seek reelection no matter what. He was first elected to Congress in 2013.\n\nLaMalfa, as well as a handful of other Republican congressmen who could see their districts dramatically reshaped, have mostly stayed away from the campaign spotlight. Voters in Redding, another city in LaMalfa’s district, said they have heard little from him leading up to the election.\n\nThe fight for U.S. House control in California has become lopsided in recent weeks as opponents ran low on campaign ads and options. TV advertisements opposing the measure — a key investment in the sprawling state — have largely dried up. Newsom told Prop 50 supporters this week they can stop donating to the campaign.\n\nRegistered Democrats in California, who outnumber Republicans by nearly 2-to-1, are also returning nearly twice as many ballots. Even if the conservative strongholds in the Northern part of the state come out strong against the measure, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to compete with millions of Democratic voters in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.\n\n“The optimist in me wants to believe we could defeat it,” said Geri Byrne, a Modoc county supervisor and chair of the Rural County Representatives of California, who appeared with LaMalfa.\n\nA Public Policy Institute of California statewide poll, released Wednesday, found that 56% of likely voters would support the proposition if the election was held today. The poll from the nonpartisan institute said 43% were opposed.\n\nLaMalfa said there’s still a fighting chance for Republican voters, and his campaign will continue reaching voters through text messages and social media campaigns. All Californians are mailed a ballot, and he urged people to turn their ballots in now. That’s despite Trump urging people not to vote early or by mail in a recent post on his social media site Truth Social.\n\n“No mail-in or ‘Early’ Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is!” he posted Sunday.\n\nLaMalfa said voters should get their ballot in whenever they can.\n\n“Why would you want to wait till then? I don’t know why,” LaMalfa said in an interview. “But that’s part of our messaging: ‘Just get it in.’”","summary":"CHICO, Calif. (AP) — California Rep.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, Pool)\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Wednesday that the U.S. military carried out another strike on a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing all four people aboard the vessel, as the Trump administration pursues its divisive campaign against drug cartels in the waters off South America. Hegseth, who's been traveling in Japan and Malaysia, said in a social media post that intelligence determined the craft was \"transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics.\" He said the strike was conducted in international waters and no U.S. forces were harmed. A video posted by Hegseth shows a boat exploding into flames and smoke. The Trump administration has been conducting a nearly two-month campaign in the region, while building up an unusually large force of warships that are carrying Marines and aircraft. Their presence has fueled speculation that the moves are aimed at ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of narcoterrorism. President Donald Trump has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States. He has asserted the U.S. is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Live Events But as the number of strikes has grown, a debate in Congress has escalated over the limits of the president's power. The attacks have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress, and some lawmakers have raised questions about the lack of hard evidence to justify the killings. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that has been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes. The strike announced by Hegseth on Wednesday makes it the 14th since the campaign began, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News ondrug traffickingPacific Ocean drug boat strikeTrump administration strikesHegseth drug campaignVenezuelan drug cartelsUS military strikes\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The 50-46 tally was the latest in a series of votes this week to terminate the national emergencies that Trump has used to impose tariffs. While the resolutions won't ultimately take effect, they have proven to be an effective way for Democrats to expose cracks between the president's trade policy and Republican senators who have traditionally supported free trade arguments. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democrat pushing the resolutions, said that higher prices caused by tariffs would force Republicans to break with Trump. \"It will become untenable for them to just close their eyes and say, 'I'm signing up for whatever the president wants to do,'\" Kaine told reporters. The Senate passed a similar resolution applying to Brazilian tariffs on Tuesday, and it has already passed a resolution on Canadian imports in April. The same four Republicans - Sens. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Rand Paul of Kentucky - voted again with all Democrats to approve the resolution applying to Canada. Kaine, joined by other Democrats and Paul, has forced the votes under a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president's emergency powers. However, House Republicans have passed new rules that allow leaders to prevent such resolutions from getting a vote in that chamber, and Trump could veto the legislation even if it did clear Congress.Live Events Wednesday's vote happened as Trump was in Asia to advance trade talks with partners there. The president has also been jousting with Canadian officials amid a delicate negotiation to reduce tariffs between the two countries. Sen. Mike Crapo, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, acknowledged in a floor speech that many \"may be nervous about what comes next\" as Trump remakes global trade. But he urged Congress to stay out of the way. \"Let's truly get a balanced, fair playing field in trade,\" Crapo added. Yet there is increasing tension between GOP senators and the president over how soybean farmers have suffered from the trade war with China, as well as his administration's plans to allow the purchase of more beef from Argentina. Vice President JD Vance visited Republicans during a closed-door luncheon this week and also argued that they should steer clear of trade policy while the president negotiates deals. But Vance's efforts appeared to have little impact on those determined to vote against the tariffs. \"Retaliatory tariffs on American products have turned agricultural income upside down for many of Kentucky's nearly 70,000 family farms,\" said Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former longtime Republican Senate leader, in a statement. \"Bourbon has been caught in the crossfire from day one. And consumers are paying higher prices across the board as the true costs of trade barriers fall inevitably on them.\" Trump said earlier this week he wanted to impose another 10% tariff hike on imports of Canadian goods because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. The television ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticize U.S. tariffs. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to engage with Trump to ease the import taxes that have hit Canada hard. The U.S.-Canada economic relationship is one of the largest globally, totaling $909.1 billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($2.7 billion U.S.) worth of goods and services cross the border daily. Canada has also tried to turn to Asian trading partners amid the trade war. Democrats argued the trade war was impacting a range of industries, from farmers to shipbuilders. They also said it made little sense to engage in a trade war with a close military ally. Trump has invoked a national emergency to impose the tariffs, saying that fentanyl and other illegal drugs are entering the country from Canada. So far this year, less than 1% of the total fentanyl seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 66 pounds, was seized at the northern border. Kaine argued in a floor speech that Trump's trade policy was actually hinging on his personal feelings. He claimed that Trump had \"such thin skin that an ad on television quoting Ronald Reagan\" had prompted an end to the negotiations. He asked, \"How about that as a rationale for trade policy?\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onSenate vote on tariffseconomic relationship U.S. Canadatrade negotiationsU.S. tariffs on CanadaTrump Canada trade talksTrump trade policyRepublican senatorsDemocrats oppose tariffs\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!' \n\nIt comes after Gates downplayed global warming's effect on humanity and called out those who continually preach climate alarmism, arguing they should instead focus more on health and poverty issues.\n\nThe Microsoft co-founder has spent a large amount of his estimated $122 billion net worth raising the alarm on climate change. He previously warned that it is already affecting lives and threatening long-term consequences for families and future generations. \n\nHowever, Gates has now signaled a shift, arguing that the United Nations's 'doomsday outlook' focuses too heavily on short-term emission targets instead of looking at how to improve overall life right now.\n\nThe 70-year-old billionaire is calling for more focus and spending on vaccines to fight deadly diseases across the world, including malaria.\n\n'Although climate change will hurt poor people more than anyone else, for the vast majority of them, it will not be the only or even the biggest threat to their lives and welfare,' Gates wrote in an open letter ahead of the upcoming UN COP30 climate summit in Brazil.\n\n'The biggest problems are poverty and disease, just as they always have been.\n\n'To be clear: Climate change is a very important problem. It needs to be solved, along with other problems like malaria and malnutrition. Every tenth of a degree of heating that we prevent is hugely beneficial because a stable climate makes it easier to improve people’s lives.'\n\nAccording to his letter, the world has already made significant progress on climate change.\n\n'People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future,' he wrote.\n\n'Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further.' \n\nWhile continued investment in breakthroughs is essential to reach net-zero emissions, Gates warned that health and development funding cannot be sacrificed in the process. \n\nThe co-founder argued that the attention should shift from temperature targets to improving human lives, making human welfare the central pillar of climate strategies. \n\n'Our chief goal should be to prevent suffering, particularly for those in the toughest conditions who live in the world’s poorest countries,' he wrote.\n\nGates acknowledged that some climate advocates might now call him a 'hypocrite'.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, he also later said: 'If you said to me, ''Hey, what about 0.1 degrees versus malaria eradication?'' I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degrees to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today.'\n\nMichael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University professor of geosciences and international affairs, argued that Gates was framing a misleading narrative 'usually propagated by climate skeptics.'\n\n'Despite his efforts to make clear that he takes climate change seriously, his words are bound to be misused by those who would like nothing more than to destroy efforts to deal with climate change,' he told The New York Times via email. \n\nJohannes Ackva, climate work leader at Founders Pledge, disagreed with Oppenheimer and told the outlet: 'He [Gates] saw the U.S.A.I.D. situation as more pressing, and something where he could be more effective.'\n\nMonday’s memo comes just a week before global leaders are set to gather in Belém, Brazil, for this year’s COP30. \n\n'It’s not too late to adopt a different view and adjust our strategies for dealing with climate change,' Gates wrote.\n\n'COP30 is an excellent place to begin, especially because the summit's Brazilian leadership is putting climate adaption and human development high on the agenda,' he added. \n\nGates has spent the past 20 years studying climate change, collaborating with scientists and innovators.\n\nJust four years ago, Gates released his book titled How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, outlining technological strategies to combat climate change based on years of research and collaboration.\n\nIn 2015, the billionaire launched Breakthrough Energy, a venture that invests in promising clean energy startups and later added a climate policy group in Washington to advocate for emissions reduction strategies. \n\nSo far, Gates has backed over 150 clean energy companies, many of which have grown into major industry players.\n\nThen, in March, Breakthrough Energy announced significant cuts, including axing its climate policy group. Two months later, Gates revealed plans to gradually wind down the Gates Foundation. \n\nHis foundation has poured billions into the cause, including a $1.4 billion pledge to help farmers in developing countries adapt to the climate.\n\nNevertheless, Gates continues to invest in clean energy start-ups through groups such as the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst program and the Breakthrough Energy Ventures. He also continues to fund nuclear energy.\n\nAccording to Gates, 'temperature is not the best way to measure our progress on climate.","summary":"The president, who has long been a skeptic of government programs attempting to solve the issue and even declared it a hoax, declared victory on Truth Social Wednesday night.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15240369/Trump-war-climate-change-Bill-Gates.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/30/00/103428897-0-image-a-8_1761784455276.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2021/11/03/7580328806687947669/1024x576_MP4_7580328806687947669.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-30 00:41:21","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Reuters reports that a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that SNAP benefits could stop on November 1 as a result of the ongoing government shutdown.\n\n“Bottom line, the well has run dry… At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” the notice bluntly reads.\n\nNearly 42 million Americans depend on SNAP each month to buy food. Unless rapid action is taken, with Congress still deadlocked and the White House refusing to access emergency funds, families can be left hungry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump flew to South Korea on Tuesday night and gave a short statement. “We’re going to get it done,” he said, per ABC News. He didn’t offer any explanation about how he was planning to do this, leaving many in a state of uncertainty.\n\nIn Colorado, for instance, food pantries are experiencing a higher demand. “For every meal we provide, SNAP provides nine,” said one director to Reuters.\n\nSo many households are already stretched thin. Families on tight budgets are preparing for worst-case scenarios as they try to figure out what they are going to do if the benefits stop. Previously they could rely on SNAP.\n\nLawmakers disagree. Senate Majority Leader John Thune urged Democrats to approve a clean stopgap to reopen government. In the meantime, Democrats accuse the administration of using hunger as leverage.\n\nBut, behind the scenes, the USDA announced that it won’t touch a $5 billion emergency fund.\n\nTo those in the trenches, this isn’t politics. It is survival. Families that rely on SNAP usually live paycheck to paycheck, and losing even one month’s food aid can push them into crisis. But it’s not only families who will be hit.\n\nLocal businesses could feel the strain too. After all, each dollar of SNAP benefits generates roughly $1.50 in economic activity. One small grocery owner in Texas said, “We’ve already had customers using food banks more. If SNAP stops, it’s going to hit everyone.”\n\n13% of the population is on food stamps… https://t.co/ZOxBO4WyCg pic.twitter.com/xi5UxNXLRj\n— Sam Raus (@SamRaus1) October 25, 2025\n\nCritics are furious that the administration is gambling with these vulnerable people’s food supply. “The Trump administration is weaponizing hunger as a political bargaining chip,” said New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen via Reuters. Experts warn that delays now could have ripple effects for months, especially heading into the holiday season.\n\nThe next 48 hours are crucial. If Congress doesn’t act and the shutdown persists, families, farmers, and local economies will suffer. Are they prepared to lose the trust of their voters?\n\nAnd for Americans watching, the politicians’ response will tell them everything. Will they opt to allow millions go without food to gain leverage, or will they intervene in time?\n\nFor the families that rely on SNAP, these aren’t merely headlines. They are decisions about dinner, about keeping kids fed, and about holding onto a fragile sense of stability. Time is out, and the price of inaction will be paid in full throughout America.","summary":"Donald Trump comes under fire as millions of Americans could lose their SNAP benefits.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-under-fire-as-food-aid-for-42-million-americans-nears-a-cliff","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cover-69.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 00:32:31","author":"Tracey Ashlee","authors":["Tracey Ashlee"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":373905256,"title":"School Assembly News Headlines For 30th October: Top National, International & Others News","text":"News Headlines for School Assembly, October 30, 2025: From Kerala govt pausing the implementation of PM SHRI scheme to former India captain Rohit Sharma becoming the oldest Indian cricketer to become the world’s No. 1 ODI batter, here are the top news highlights for October 30th.\nTop National News:\n– Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday stated that amid global tensions, trade disruptions, and shifting supply chains, India stands as a symbol of strategic autonomy, peace, and inclusive growth.\n– The Kerala government has paused all procedures related to the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme following strong opposition from the Communist Party of India (CPI), a key ally in the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF).\n– Wing Commander Shivangi Singh, India’s only woman Rafale pilot, was part of a landmark moment on Wednesday as President Droupadi Murmu undertook a historic sortie in the French-made fighter jet from the Ambala Air Force Station, which houses the first fleet of India’s advanced combat aircraft and the elite Golden Arrows Squadron.\nTop International News:\n– US President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressed his hope of reaching a trade agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their upcoming meeting, showing optimism about improving ties between the two economic giants.\n– The United States and South Korea will maintain reciprocal tariffs at 15 per cent and reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts.\nTop Sports News:\n– Rohit Sharma has become the fifth Indian cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Shubman Gill to achieve the No. 1 position in the ICC ODI batter’s rankings.\nTop News in Business:\n– Indian benchmark indices — Sensex and Nifty — ended higher on Wednesday, tracking positive global cues and investor optimism ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy outcome.

Shipbuilding in our Country will soon be making a BIG COMEBACK,” Trump said. As reported by CNN, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had earlier indicated that he would make efforts to get US approval to acquire fuel for nuclear-powered submarines, which South Korea wants to build so it can keep up with North Korean and Chinese submarines.“If the president would make a decision to allow us to receive fuel for nuclear-powered submarines, we would appreciate it,” Lee said ahead of his bilateral meeting with Trump on Wednesday.This is a major step, considering that earlier this year, North Korea had shown off its under-construction nuclear-powered submarine, CNN reported. Additionally, Trump also stated that South Korea has agreed to pay the USD 350 billion for lowering of the Tariff’s charged against them by the United States.“They have agreed to buy our Oil and Gas in vast quantities, and investments into our Country by wealthy South Korean Companies and Businessmen will exceed 600 Billion Dollars,” he also stated. Earlier, South Korean presidential chief of staff for policy Kim Yong-beom told reporters in Gyeongju that South Korea has reached an agreement on the details of a trade deal with the US The agreement on the big framework of the trade deal in July had brought the reciprocal tariff down to 15 per cent, but South Korea’s automobile exports were still subject to a 25 per cent tariff, and details of the agreement were not finalised until Trump met with Lee on the sidelines of APEC.Among the USD 350 billion in investments Trump demanded upfront, Kim said USD 200 billion will be paid in cash and USD 150 billion through shipbuilding cooperation led by South Korean companies, CNN reported.The USD 200 billion investment will be done over many years, with yearly investment limited to USD 20 billion depending on the business progress, Kim said.He added that such a limit would make it manageable for the South Korean foreign-exchange market, which was the biggest concern for Seoul when asked to pay USD 350 billion in cash originally.

Four Republican senators — Susan Collins (Maine), Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), and Rand Paul (Kentucky) — joined Democrats in supporting the resolution to end Trump’s tariff powers.The Senate had previously approved the same measure on April 2, but its progress stalled after the Republican-controlled House refused to take it up. The resolution’s sponsor, Senator Tim Kaine (Democrat-Virginia), reintroduced it this week, arguing that Trump’s tariffs on Canada cannot be justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, The Hill reported. “I primarily object to the Canada tariffs because I don’t think there’s an emergency that should trigger the use of this statute,” Kaine said during the floor debate. “The fracturing of this long-standing, powerful relationship [with Canada] is one of the many reasons I oppose them.”Senator Susan Collins, who represents Maine, a state bordering Canada, has repeatedly warned that the tariffs would hurt her state’s economy. “The Maine economy is integrated with Canada, our most important trading partner,” she said in an earlier statement, adding that tariffs on petroleum products, paper mills, forest industries, and fisheries would be detrimental to many Maine families and local economies.”Trump’s dispute with Canada escalated earlier this week after Ontario aired a television advertisement during the World Series featuring a speech by former US President Ronald Reagan denouncing tariffs. Calling the ad a “serious misrepresentation of the facts” and a “hostile act,” Trump announced a 10 per cent increase in tariffs on Canadian imports in retaliation.Wednesday’s Senate vote came a day after five Republican senators joined Democrats in passing a similar resolution to terminate Trump’s emergency authority to impose tariffs on Brazil.

The meeting is expected to begin in the morning hours local time on Thursday, or Wednesday night in the U.S. Trump has expressed optimism about securing a deal with China even as the trade dispute has escalated with the two sides trying to exert leverage over the other in an eventual deal. As Trump and Xi prepare to hold discussions over the economic relationship between the two geopolitical rivals they lead, here&apos;s a look at some of the key topics that they may discuss. AMERICAN SOYBEAN FARMERS FACE FINANCIAL CRISIS AS CHINA TRADE DISPUTE THREATENS LIVELIHOODS China halted purchases of U.S. soybeans earlier this year in retaliation for the Trump administration&apos;s tariffs on Chinese exports, and instead pivoted to buying soybeans from South America. The move cut off American farmers from the world&apos;s largest importer of soybeans and a market in which they were China&apos;s primary supplier of soybeans dating back to before Trump&apos;s first term. Soybean farmers are in a critical period for marketing their crop, and a failure to resolve the dispute would leave them struggling to find alternative buyers and taking a financial hit. Ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting, Reuters reported that a Chinese state-owned firm moved forward with the first purchase of U.S. soybeans from China in months, though the two trade sources told the outlet that they don&apos;t expect a significant rise in demand for U.S. soybeans following China&apos;s purchases from South America. TRUMP, AUSTRALIA PM SIGN $8.5B CRITICAL MINERALS DELA TO COUNTER CHINA DOMINANCE IN RARE EARTHS Trump said Wednesday that he expects that he will reduce tariffs on Chinese goods if China commits to curbing the flow of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is the leading cause of U.S. overdose deaths in recent years. The president imposed 20% tariffs on China over fentanyl earlier this year and also imposed them on Canada and Mexico, arguing that the precursor chemicals are shipped through those countries. CHINA RESPONDS TO US-AUSTRALIA RARE EARTHS DEAL The Chinese government recently moved to implement tougher export controls on rare earth minerals, which are used in a variety of high-tech applications, ranging from smartphones and electric vehicle batteries to military radars and cruise missiles. China is the world&apos;s leading producer of rare earths and has the largest reserves, according to a report by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS found that in 2024, China&apos;s mines produced 270,000 tons of rare earths and the country has 44 million tons of reserves. The U.S. and Australia recently announced an agreement to cooperate on developing rare earths in response to China&apos;s move. The two governments agreed to each invest $1 billion in mining and processing projects in the next six months, as well as to cut permits for mines, processing facilities and related operations. OIL PRICES SURGE AS TRUMP HITS RUSSIAN ENERGY GIANTS WITH SWEEPING NEW SANCTIONS Last week, the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russian oil companies over their role in funding Russia&apos;s war in Ukraine, which has become the biggest land war in Europe since World War II. The sanctions – which are aimed mainly at China and India as key energy clients of Russia – give companies until Nov. 1 to cut their transactions with Russian oil producers or face losing access to the Western banking system. Major Chinese state oil companies, including PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC and Zhenhua Oil moved to halt purchases of Russian seaborne oil at least temporarily, in response to the sanctions. TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER ALLOWING TIKTOK DEAL TO PROCEED Trump said that he may be able to sign a final deal with Xi that allows TikTok, the short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to separate its U.S. operations from ByteDance in a transaction valued around $14 billion. The president signed an executive order late last month to allow the deal to proceed, though the U.S. and Chinese governments hadn&apos;t finalized the agreement that would allow the transaction to proceed. Last year, Congress enacted a law that banned TikTok and other apps, which are subject to the control of adversarial foreign governments like China&apos;s, over concerns about data security and the use of the platforms&apos; algorithms for foreign influence operations. It allowed for them to be divested from foreign ownership to remain available to U.S. users.

Jeff Landry says LSU athletic director won't pick the Tigers' next coach","text":"Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry intends to prevent LSU Athletic Director Scott Woodward from hiring the Tigers' next football coach.\n\n“Hell, I’ll let Donald Trump select him before I let him do it,” Landry said of Woodward during a press conference he held in Baton Rouge on Wednesday to mainly discuss other governmental matters. \n\nWoodward, who announced coach Brian Kelly's firing on Sunday night, has so far declined to comment on Landry's remarks. \n\nLandry confirmed his involvement in discussions on Sunday that led to the firing of Kelly, who'd been hired by LSU after the 2021 football season and signed to a guaranteed contract paying him about $100 million during 10 years.\n\nLSU still owes Kelly more than $52 million through 2031, although that figure could be negotiated down or offset by money Kelly earned in a subsequent coaching job.\n\n\"I hosted a meeting at the governor’s mansion to talk about the legalities, to talk about the cost, to talk about who pays for it,” he said. “It was a meeting to discuss the legalities of the contract.”\n\n“My role is about the fiscal effect of firing a coach under a terrible contract,” Landry said. “All I care about is what the taxpayers are going to be on the hook for.”\n\nHistorically, LSU's athletic department has been self-funding and does not tap in to public money. Before NCAA rule changes allowing college players to be paid, LSU's athletic department would at times even make seven-figure contributions to the university's academic operations.\n\nIn the case of Kelly's contract, unnamed private donors have pledged to cover the cost of the buyout.\n\n“If big billionaires want to spend all that kind of money, no problem,” Landry said. “But if I’ve got to go find $53 million ... it’s not going to be a pleasant conversation.”\n\nKelly, who was fired eight games into his fourth season, went 34-14 at LSU, ending with last Saturday's 49-25 loss to Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium. Running backs coach Frank Wilson has been tapped as Kelly's interim replacement.\n\nSince Woodward has been LSU's athletic director, the football program has bought out former coach Ed Orgeron for about $17 million in 2021, and now must pay Kelly's buyout, which is among the largest in the history of college sports.\n\nTexas A&M's $77 million buyout of former coach Jimbo Fisher, who was fired in 2023, is the largest. \n\nWoodward was Texas A&M's athletic director when Fisher was hired to coach the Aggies in December 2017. But Woodward already had been at LSU for two years when A&M, in 2021, gave Fisher a contract extension that effectively doubled the cost of his buyout.\n\nStill, Landry assigned blame for Fisher's buyout to Woodward.\n\n“This is a pattern,” Landry said, suggesting that Woodward “cost Texas A&M $77 million.” \n\n“Right now, we've got a $53 million liability,” he continued. \"We are not doing that again.” \n\nLandry said LSU's Board of Supervisors — whose members are appointed to staggered six-year terms by sitting governors — will form a search committee to find LSU's next coach.\n\n“I’m not going to be picking the next coach, but I can promise you we’re going to pick a coach and we’re going to make sure that that coach is successful,” Landry said. “We’re going to make sure that he’s compensated properly.”\n\nBut Landry also stressed that the contract will be heavy on performance-based incentives and low on guarantees, “because I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country and then leaving the taxpayers ... to foot the bill.”\n\nLandry has appointed nine of 18 Board of Supervisors members since taking office in January 2024 and will be able to appoint four more in 2026.\n\nThe governor went on to demonize sports agents, particularly those representing the most sought-after college coaches. Kelly was represented by Trace Armstrong, Fisher by Jimmy Sexton.\n\n“This is ridiculous. Lawyers would be disbarred for the way these agents act,” Landry said. “It’s really time for the NCAA to put on some guardrails on college sports.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

She has shared outspoken social media posts on the issue.\n\n Supporters of Poland’s anti-choice Law and Justice party (PiS) have written to Gibson’s Icon Productions banner in protest of her casting, according to Variety, citing Polish media outlets.\n\n PEOPLE has reached out to Smutniak’s talent agency for comment. However, when Variety contacted her publicist, he told the outlet that he was not aware of the protest.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n Gibson, 69, began production this summer on The Resurrection of the Christ. The Oscar-winning actor-director joins Randall Wallace as co-writer of the sequel. \n\n The Passion of the Christ starred Jim Caviezel as Jesus and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. Earlier this month, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Caviezel and Bellucci were not returning in their roles. That retelling of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ’s life drew inspiration from the New Testament of the Bible and Anne Catherine Emmerich’s The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ. The follow-up will chronicle Jesus’ resurrection. \n\n In January, Gibson — a vocal conservative and supporter of President Donald Trump — was named one of Trump's \"special ambassadors\" to Hollywood along with actors Sylvester Stallone and Jon Voight. The Braveheart star’s gun rights were restored this April after he lost them over a 2010 domestic violence incident.\n\n Lionsgate is planning to release The Resurrection of the Christ: Part One on March 26, 2027, with Part Two to follow 40 days later on May 6, 2027.

Prosecutors alleged Taranto said he livestreamed himself saying he wanted to “get a good angle at a shot.” \n\nJust for good measure, he also livestreamed his hoax threat to blow up the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is kind of a niche government agency to be mad at. \n\nIn recommending the 27-month sentence, Valdivia and White briefly referenced Taranto’s history as a violent criminal, saying that he was “accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C. by entering the U.S. Capitol Building.” \n\nDoing so wasn’t some rogue progressive anti-Trump move. The United States Sentencing Guidelines require consideration of a defendant’s past criminal history, with a complicated system of points per offense that then informs the sentence for the current case. Even when someone is pardoned, the sentence for the pardoned crime still has to be counted. \n\nSo, Trump’s pardon may have erased Taranto’s conviction, but it couldn’t magic away, for sentencing purposes, the fact that the past conviction existed. But it seems that following sentencing guidelines is verboten when it comes to the most-favored criminal defendants ever: violent insurrectionists. \n\nIn a hilarious aside that really highlights how Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, seems to have very little idea what she is doing, she had signed off on the sentencing memo along with Valdivia and White. Somehow, it doesn’t seem likely that Pirro will be placed on leave, though.\n\nTaranto is far from the only one of Trump’s pet rioters who have been charged with new, unrelated crimes since being pardoned. We’ve got everything from threatening to assassinate federal agents to soliciting a minor, to killing someone while driving drunk, to possessing child sexual abuse material. These folks are some real winners.\n\nIt’s impossible not to think of the Frank Wilhoit quote: “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.”\n\nIt isn’t just that people like Taranto are being protected. It’s also a message to everyone else that they will not receive the full protection of the law. The DOJ seems to be sending a message that literally threatening to kill a former president does not warrant a stiff sentence if he’s a Democrat, or at the very least, does not allow for consideration of Taranto’s other violent past acts. \n\nContrast the light touch for Taranto with the DOJ bragging about getting 97 months for the person who threatened Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Sophie Roske was found near Kavanaugh’s house with a pistol, zip ties, pepper spray, and burglary tools. Roske was convicted of attempted assassination, a big step up from the firearms and threat charges Taranto faced, even though she turned herself in before actually getting to Kavanaugh’s house. \n\nSo, less firepower than Taranto and a voluntary surrender, but prosecutors asked for 30 years for Roske, yet didn’t propose even one-tenth that for Taranto.\n\nOr see the DOJ’s apparent refusal to follow-up on or prosecute people lobbing death threats against Rep. Eric Swalwell of California.\n\nWe know exactly who matters to this administration: violent people who support Trump’s every move. For the rest of us? Good luck.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s project of rewriting the history of his Jan. 6 insurrection continues to chug along nicely.

But a new survey tells a very different story. According to new polling from The Economist and YouGov, Trump’s approval rating has plunged to 39 percent, with 58 percent of Americans disapproving, his lowest mark since returning to office.\n\nThe poll’s results paint a grim picture for the president. His net approval rating of minus 19 percent is worse than nearly all readings from his first term and marks a sharp slide from earlier this year. The data suggests Trump is now struggling with virtually every major demographic group outside his base, even as he insists his popularity has never been stronger.\n\nThe partisan divide remains as stark as ever. Ninety-seven percent of Democrats disapprove of Trump’s job performance, while 86 percent of Republicans approve. But beneath those predictable splits are troubling signs for Trump’s re-election prospects. Among voters under 30, only 20 percent say they approve of the president, a generational low that could haunt him in future elections. Support is slightly stronger among those aged 30 to 64, hovering around the mid-40s, before dipping again among voters over 65.\n\nForty-six percent of men say they approve of Trump’s actions in office, compared to just 32 percent of women. Among minority voters, the numbers are even worse: only 11 percent of Black Americans and 29 percent of Hispanic Americans say they support his presidency. The figures point to a coalition that’s shrinking rather than expanding — a warning sign for any leader hoping to maintain political dominance.\n\nTrump’s issue-specific numbers are equally bleak. On immigration, his net approval sits at minus 10. On abortion, minus 17. On education, minus 19. The economy and jobs — once his political stronghold — now stand at minus 22. On climate and environmental issues, minus 31. And on inflation and grocery prices, voters give him his harshest score of all, minus 31. With the cost of living still rising, the president’s ability to sell his economic agenda appears to be collapsing.\n\nThe poll also shows widespread disapproval of Trump’s recent controversies. Fifty-five percent of Americans disapprove of his escalating trade fight with Canada, while just one in four approve of his decision to demolish the East Wing of the White House to build a private ballroom. Only 16 percent support his commutation of disgraced ex-congressman George Santos, 8 percent favor a potential pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell, and just 4 percent back clemency for Sean “Diddy” Combs.\n\nPerhaps most striking, 63 percent of respondents reject Trump’s effort to seek $230 million in “compensation” from the Justice Department over past investigations into him. And according to the same survey, roughly 8 percent of American adults said they participated in October’s “No Kings” rally, a massive anti-Trump demonstration that, extrapolated nationally, would represent over 27 million people.\n\nSeveral prominent MAGA influencers have spoken out about Trump’s policies that go against his promises, particularly when it comes to America First. For all his boasts of increasing support, Trump’s latest approval numbers show a leader facing a steep fall from grace and a country increasingly ready to move on.","summary":"Trump claims record-high popularity, but new polling reveals the lowest approval rating of his presidency.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-popularity-hits-rock-bottom-new-data-reveal-his-worst-ratings-ever","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donald-trump-3-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 00:00:47","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.034},{"id":373905820,"title":"UW-Madison dean called Trump racist, claimed education system, math is ‘inherently violent’ to Black students","text":"An associate dean at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has publicly called former President Donald Trump a racist and co-authored an academic paper suggesting the American education system, and even mathematics, is \"inherently violent\" toward Black students. Percival Matthews, associate dean for the Office of the Dean and a professor in the Human Development Area at UW–Madison, shared his views in a series of Facebook posts and academic writings reviewed by Fox News Digital. In a January 2018 Facebook post, Matthews appeared to label Trump a racist, writing, \"What’s on my mind?

In a paper co-authored with Pooja Sidney, an associate professor at the University of Kentucky, Matthews claimed that systemic inequities in education leave Black students \"shut out\" of advanced courses, particularly in mathematics. \"This exclusionary narrative continues into the higher grades, with Black children routinely being shut out of advanced mathematics courses despite meeting achievement standards,\" the paper states. \"In stark contrast, more privileged White children are sometimes tracked into advanced courses despite failing to meet those standards.\" UNIVERSITY DROPS JOB POSTING AFTER DEI REQUIREMENT EXPOSED, PROFESSOR SAYS ‘I WOULD NOT BE HIRED’ TODAY The paper goes on to ask, \"How can a Black scholar work to improve a system through rigorous empirical research when that system is arguably inherently violent toward Black children, even the ones who excel at all the tests?\" In an older Facebook post from 2020, Matthews referenced the concept of violence after the death of George Floyd, writing, \"A legitimate (adv) use of violence can legitimate (vb) use of violence.

Everyone knows he wants it but that should not be the reason to nominate him. That, for me, was too much.”\nTakaichi gave Trump a gift of a gold-plated golf ball, presented him with a map showing Japanese investments in the US since 2019 over a lunch of American rice and beef, and signed a rare earths mineral deal with the US president as aides applauded.\n\nYoichi Shimada, a former Liberal Democratic Party member under Abe who now sits in the Diet for the Conservative Party of Japan, described Takaichi’s engagement as “a good performance”.\n“This was her first meeting with Trump and I expect it was quite nerve-racking for her, but Trump knew that she had been a firm supporter of Abe and shared many of his beliefs, so that was an important factor in the two of them getting on so well,” he said.\nThe rapport that the two leaders quickly established could even allow Japan to renegotiate the terms of the trade and investment accord signed during Trump’s time in Tokyo, Shimada added.\n\nBy offering Washington unreserved support and putting up minimal resistance to the Trump administration’s demands, Takaichi might have positioned Japan to receive future benefits unavailable to rival nations, Shimada said. He also backed Tokyo’s proposal to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, calling it “appropriate”.\nSocial media commentary was largely supportive of Takaichi’s tactics. “I think for the first time in a long time we have an administration that gives us hope in politics,” said one Yahoo News user.\nAnother wrote: “The cabinets of the recent past have been a disgrace and I have long felt that Japan is falling apart. But I have been moved by the refreshing and dignified performance of Takaichi. Together with Trump, she has given me confidence that a golden age of Japan-US relations will be built in the future.”\n‘Stop the fawning’\nDespite the effusive support from some quarters, opposition voices were unequivocal in their dissent.\nAkira Koike, secretary general of the Japanese Communist Party, told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday that Trump “is probably the person least likely to win the Nobel Peace Prize”, adding that the US president had “turned his back” on the UN Charter, international law and the global order.\nKoike warned that nominating Trump would be seen as Japan endorsing his foreign policy actions – from bombing Iran to carrying out extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug runners in the Caribbean and his dealings with Russia over Ukraine.\nJun Azumi, leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, told a press conference that a Nobel nomination “is not something that should be brought as a gift to a summit meeting”.\n\nConservative media outlets predictably rallied behind Takaichi’s approach. The right-leaning Yomiuri newspaper reiterated its “alliance for a new era” narrative, arguing that Trump’s three-day visit – on the eve of the Apec summit in South Korea – would underline that the Japan-US alliance “is functioning stably”.\nIn contrast, the liberal Asahi offered a scathing rebuttal, publishing a front-page opinion piece on Tuesday headlined: “Diplomacy with world’s biggest bully should not entail pandering”. The article said that the Japan-US relationship was “definitely off kilter” as Tokyo “tried desperately not to offend the president by making sure to stroke his ego so he will not make unreasonable demands”.\n“Prime Minister Takaichi’s ability is being tested,” it warned. “It is time to stop fawning and flattering, sporting a red hat.”","summary":"When Sanae Takaichi welcomed Donald Trump to Tokyo this week, she did so with a blend of deference and purpose that has divided opinion in Japan.\nWhile detractors derided her overzealous flattery of the US president and warned against pandering to power, many at home saw a Japanese prime minister deftly securing her nation’s interests amid Trump’s unpredictability.\n“Takaichi’s strategy was clear from the outset,” said Tsutomu Harada, a retired businessman from Tokyo. “It was to make use of the...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3330790/japans-pm-wooed-trump-charm-offensive-did-she-go-too-far","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/29/77561749-7b2f-47c5-9a62-12a228c1f4f7_038c9313.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 00:00:13","author":"Julian Ryall","authors":["Julian Ryall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.123},{"id":373897782,"title":"Trump says South Korea has approval to build nuclear-powered submarine","text":"SEOUL: United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday (Oct 30) he has given South Korea approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, a dramatic move that would admit Seoul to a small club of nations possessing such vessels.\n\nThe submarine will be built in a Philadelphia shipyard, where South Korean firms have increased investment, Trump wrote on social media.\n\nThe US president, who has been meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and other regional leaders during his visit, also said Seoul had agreed to buy vast quantities of US oil and gas.\n\nTrump and Lee finalised details of a fraught trade deal at a summit in South Korea on Wednesday.\n\nLee had also been seeking US permission for South Korea to reprocess nuclear fuel.\n\nNUCLEAR RESTRICTIONS EASING?\n\nSeoul is barred from reprocessing without US consent, under a pact between the countries.\n\n\"I have given them approval to build a Nuclear Powered Submarine, rather than the old fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel powered Submarines that they have now,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.\n\nSouth Korea's Industry Ministry said its officials had not been involved in any detailed discussions about building the submarines in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile South Korea has a sophisticated shipbuilding industry, Trump did not spell out where the propulsion technology would come from for a nuclear-powered submarine, which only a handful of countries currently possess.\n\nThe US has been working with Australia and Britain on a project for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines involving technology transfers from the US.

By Wednesday evening, a revised memo, omitting any mention of January 6, was filed.\n\nWithin hours, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White were reportedly locked out of their government-issued devices and were informed that administrative leave was imminent. This information was reported by ABC News, citing unnamed sources. Concurrently, the 14-page legal document they prepared was inexplicably retracted, according to court records.\n\nAs of late Wednesday, no documents have been filed to officially explain the removal of these three items.\n\nIn response, the DOJ promptly submitted two official notices introducing two new prosecutors to the case. These newly assigned Assistant U.S. Attorneys are Travis Wolf, licensed in New York, and Jonathan R. Hornok, a member of the Texas State Bar.\n\nNotably, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, who leads the district-based office, was also listed as an attorney on the undone memo. Pirro has declined to comment directly on the matter, according to Politico.\n\nThe case itself concerns Taylor Taranto, 39, a Washington state man and purported drifter pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the riot at the national legislative seat of government.\n\nIn May, Taranto was found guilty on charges – unrelated to Jan. 6 – following a bench trial in front of U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, a Trump appointee.\n\nTaranto was convicted on charges of illegally carrying firearms without a license, unlawfully possessing ammunition, and false information and hoaxes. That case stemmed from a June 2023 incident where Taranto traveled to Barack Obama”s Washington, D.C., home bearing guns and supplies for an explosive device.\n\nIn a sharp break from other attempts by the government to have Jan. 6 defendants benefit from Trump’s mass pardon in non-Jan. 6 cases, the DOJ moved to keep the charges against Taranto intact. Last week, Nichols set the defendant’s sentencing hearing for Oct. 30.\n\nTuesday’s memo argued in favor of putting Taranto in prison for two years – and mentioned his involvement in the Capitol attack.\n\n“On January 6, 2021, thousands of people comprising a mob of rioters attacked the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election,” the since-deleted memo reads. “Taranto was accused of participating in the riot in Washington, D.C., by entering the U.S. Capitol Building. After the riot, Taranto returned to his home in the State of Washington, where he promoted conspiracy theories about the events of January 6, 2021.”\n\nThe now-gone memo contains one additional mention of Jan. 6 – in a passage where Taranto explains that he visited a school in Maryland because of Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland.\n\nThe passage reads:\n\nThe reason probably we were picking that location was because its, you know, [U.S. Congressman Jamie] Raskin, Raskin, he lives over there and he’s one of the guys that hates January 6 people or more like Trump supporters and it’s kinda like sending a shockwave through him because I did nothing wrong. And he’s probably freaking out, and saying sh*t like, “Well, he’s stalking me!” Like AP there. Even though I didn’t go to his house or anything. I didn’t tell anyone where he is. Because I want him all to myself.\n\n“Taranto’s menacing rhetoric harms public discourse and encourages others to use threats and violence to advance their views or silence their perceived political opponents,” the erstwhile memo goes on. “Accordingly, a substantial term of incarceration is necessary to ‘reflect the seriousness of the offense,’ ‘promote respect for the law,’ and ‘provide just punishment for the offense.’”\n\nThursday sentencing memo clocks in at 12 pages – a full two pages shorter than the excised Valdivia-White memo.\n\nGone are the prosecutors’ own mentions of Jan. 6 – while the Raskin reference in that context remains. The DOJ also saw fit to remove a reference to Trump himself in the replacement memo.\n\nThe original memo reads, in relevant part:\n\nThe next day, on June 29, 2023, then-former President Donald Trump published on a social media platform the purported address of former President Barack Obama. Taranto re-posted the address on the same platform and thereafter started livestreaming from his van on his YouTube channel. Taranto broadcast footage of himself as he drove through the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, D.C., claiming he was searching for “tunnels” he believed would provide him access to the private residences of certain high-profile individuals, including former President Obama…\n\nThe non-verboten memo reads, instead:\n\nThe next day, on June 29, 2023, Taranto broadcasted footage of himself as he drove through the Kalorama neighborhood in Washington, D.C., claiming he was searching for “tunnels” he believed would provide him access to the private residences of certain high-profile individuals, including former President Barack Obama.\n\nLaw&Crime reached out to the new AUSAs assigned to Taranto’s case for comment and further details on this story, but no responses were immediately forthcoming at the time of publication.\n\nA public archive of the later-altered docket is available here.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nInset left: Taylor Taranto in a photo he posted to Facebook while&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: DOJ Withdraws Sentencing Memo Following AUSAs&#8217; Description of January 6 Events first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/doj-withdraws-sentencing-memo-following-ausas-description-of-january-6-events/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DOJ-vanishes-sentencing-memo-after-AUSAs-describe-Jan-6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:55:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.261},{"id":373902164,"title":"Israel killed 100 Gazans in roughly 12 hours. Does the ceasefire still hold?","text":"Almost three weeks since the Gaza ceasefire came into effect, something of a deadly routine has developed.\n\nIsrael and Hamas accuse each other of breaching the truce. Israel launches strikes. Dozens of Palestinians are killed. The Trump administration insists the deal isn't about to collapse.\n\nIt's formulaic and is obviously a source of deep despair for the many innocent Palestinians who are paying the price for it as they're caught up in the onslaught.\n\nBut it also means the suggestion the ceasefire is holding is technically true — an assessment that seems ridiculous when you take into account that more than 100 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in just over 12 hours.\n\n\"No, nothing is going to jeopardise that,\" Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One when asked about whether the deal was on the brink.\n\nIt was the deadliest day since the US president's peace plan came into force. Among the victims, according to local health authorities, were women and children.\n\nHow the devastating day is viewed in the midst of a \"ceasefire\" is to try to understand what the definition of \"ceasefire\" under the Trump deal actually is.\n\nIt's less of a sudden and immediate halting of all hostilities.\n\nAs each day passes it becomes more apparent this ceasefire is about pumping the brakes on the violence wrought over the last two years rather than ending it altogether.\n\nThe Lebanon model\n\nThe deal has Donald Trump's ambition to be the peacemaker in the Midde East at its heart, on the terms he sees suitable.\n\nIt gives Israel significant leeway to decide what it deems a threat from a terrorist organisation during the truce period, and the ability to act on those threats — with the oversight of a US command centre operating in southern Israel.\n\n\"The prime minister made the decision [to launch strikes] with the IDF and then informed President Trump before the action was taken,\" Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said on Wednesday.\n\n\"It was a decision wholly made by the prime minister, although he gave the Americans a heads-up before it took place.\"\n\nIn many ways, it's a similar situation to what has happened on Israel's northern border over the last 11 months.\n\nThe ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, a deal brokered by the Biden administration, also gives Israel the ability to seek out threats.\n\nIn early October, UN peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon reported there had been thousands of instances where Israel had crossed into Lebanese territory and violated the truce.\n\nMany of those strikes focused on areas close to the Israeli border but attacks had also been reported in the Lebanese capital Beirut.\n\nThe intensity of the strikes in Lebanon is far less than what it was at the height of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. In the same way, the scale of strikes in Gaza is far less than what were being launched just three weeks ago.\n\nAnd with Gaza, the Israeli prime minister's strikes are as much about playing to a domestic audience as anything else — appeasing people within his own coalition who want the war to continue and consider any ceasefire as surrender.\n\nViolations by both sides\n\nHamas argues Israel has breached the Gaza ceasefire more than 100 times in the short while it's existed — strikes and restrictions on aid access are just a few examples it points to.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the terrorist group itself hasn't violated the deal — the two aren't mutually exclusive, even if the force behind Israel's response is far greater.\n\nThe ceasefire deal stipulated the return of all of the remaining hostages, living and dead. The remains of 13 are still in the Strip.\n\nFor all of Hamas's insistence it would struggle to find some of those hostages beneath the rubble, potentially incriminating video was released by the Israeli military on Tuesday.\n\nIt appeared to show men dragging a body out of a building and burying it under dirt, for retrieval crews to find soon after.\n\nWhile the ABC hasn't been able to independently verify the footage, the International Red Cross has condemned it.\n\nThe humanitarian organisation, which works as an intermediary between the two sides, said it was \"unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged\".\n\nHamas has distanced itself from militants who allegedly opened fire on Israeli troops.\n\nBut it has also been seen enforcing its own brand of control on the Palestinian population, executing alleged collaborators in the street.\n\nSo while the ceasefire is technically in force, it's not going to be total peace like many had hoped — or an immediate end to the war, like the US president had announced.","summary":"Despite more than 100 Palestinians being killed by Israel in little more than 12 hours, the ceasefire continues to hold, though that technicality does not mean much to those on the ground.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-30/gaza-ceasefire-technically-holding-despite-israeli-strikes/105950142","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/52977bcc20f48cdde90ee37a4219f245?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2454&cropW=4362&xPos=0&yPos=95&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:53:03","author":"Matthew Doran","authors":["Matthew Doran"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.232},{"id":373896936,"title":"A Confederate statue is restored as part of Trump’s efforts to reshape how history is told","text":"By MATT BROWN\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has restored a memorial to a Confederate general in Washington, D.C. that demonstrators took down during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020, part of a broader effort by the president to reshape the way the country’s history is told.\n\nThe statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general and diplomat who later served on the Arkansas Supreme Court, is the only outdoor statue of a Confederate leader in the nation’s capital. It has been contentious since it was first placed in 1901.\n\nRacial justice protestors in 2020 removed the statue from its pedestal and set it on fire on Juneteenth, a holiday among Black Americans that commemorates the end of slavery. The day was recognized as a federal holiday the following year.\n\nThe National Park Service in August announced plans to restore the statue in response to a pair of spring executive orders by President Donald Trump about the administration of the nation’s capital and how history is presented.\n\nThe administration has already ordered a review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions to align the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of American history. The park service is under orders to review interpretive materials at all its historical properties and remove or alter descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” or otherwise sully the American story.\n\nThe statue becomes a political flashpoint\n\nThe statue has returned to Judiciary Square, a downtown complex that includes an array of federal and municipal courthouses and the D.C. police headquarters.\n\nConservatives had seized on the monument’s removal as an example of destructive excess and vandalism by protestors during the summer of 2020. Some rightwing activists praised the statue’s restoration following Trump’s order.\n\nBut critics of the monument argue that the public placement of Pike’s statue endorses his views and actions rather than simply commemorates them.\n\nEleanor Holmes Norton, the city’s lone non-voting elected official in Congress, called the statue’s restoration a “morally objectionable move” in a statement this week. She has proposed legislation in Congress that would permanently remove the memorial.\n\n“Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts, not remain in parks or other locations that imply honor. Pike represents the worst of the Confederacy and has no claim to be memorialized in the nation’s capital,” Norton said.\n\nTrump criticized the statue’s removal in 2020 following its removal by protestors, calling it a “beautiful piece of art.”\n\nThe removal of memorials to Confederate figures was a key goal of the wave of activism that followed the 2015 killing of nine Black church parishioners by a white supremacist gunman who idolized Confederate symbols. More than 480 symbols and statues were removed nationwide since then, according to the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Whose Heritage?” campaign.\n\nAfter the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice, the SPLC recorded more than 160 removals of Confederate symbols in that year alone.\n\nPike statue does not mention his service to the Confederacy\n\nPike was a slave owner, white supremacist and poet who served as an Army general and diplomat for the Confederate states despite being born and raised in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he led Confederate troops in Arkansas and negotiated with slave-owning Native American tribes. Pike received amnesty from President Andrew Johnson in 1865, after which he was accused by former opponents of being involved in the Ku Klux Klan. He moved to Washington in 1870.\n\nPike’s statue was part of a wave of Confederate statues that were erected across the country, largely in former Confederate states, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The statues, often funded and established by Confederate heritage groups, were part of the Southern “Lost Cause” movement that sought to romanticize the Confederacy and downplay the role of slavery as a reason for why states seceded from the Union.\n\nThe statue was authorized by Congress in 1898 and then erected in 1901. It was proposed by the Freemasons, who wanted to honor him for his leadership in the society. Union veterans strongly opposed the statue but relented after being assured that Pike would be displayed in civilian clothing. The plaque recognizes Pike as an author, poet and philanthropist but does not mention his military service to the Confederacy.\n\nNorthern state lawmakers and Union veterans were outraged by the trend at the time of Pike’s statue being erected and countered the movement by erecting statues of Union generals and lawmakers in cities across the country’s northeast and Midwest.\n\nFor instance, the Washington, D.C. neighborhoods of Dupont Circle, Logan Circle and Thomas Circle near the square where Pike’s statue now stands are all named after Union generals.","summary":"Albert Pike is the only outdoor statue of a Confederate leader in the nation’s capital.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/29/confederate-statue-restored-washington-dc/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Confederate_Statue_91273-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:51:23","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":373903658,"title":"Trump Admin Reveals Where $5.3B for Military Pay Comes From During Shutdown","text":"The Trump administration has found another $5.3 billion to pay U.S. military personnel during the ongoing government shutdown, shifting funds from several federal accounts to cover payroll, officials said Wednesday.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nWhile members of the armed forces continue to be paid, hundreds of thousands of other federal employees remain furloughed or are working without pay as the shutdown stretches into its 29th day. \n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe money comes from multiple sources, including $2.5 billion redirected from the administration’s summer tax cut legislation, $1.4 billion from a military procurement account and another $1.4 billion from research and development. \n\nU.S. military personnel capture moments on their smartphones as U.S. President Donald Trump (front) arrives to give a speech aboard the aircraft carrier George Washington at the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, eastern Japan, on Oct. 28, 2025.

The official did not address President Donald Trump’s earlier claim that an anonymous friend donated $130 million to help pay the troops — a fraction of what is required for military payroll.\n\nIt marks the second time since the shutdown began that the White House has moved money to ensure service members receive their paychecks.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration used $8 billion from military research and development accounts to cover payroll, but it remains unclear whether officials are willing or able to shift funds again to pay the nation’s 1.3 million active-duty service members.\n\nVice President JD Vance told reporters Tuesday after lunch with Senate Republicans at the Capitol, “We do think that we can continue paying the troops, at least for now.

We have to get this funding as quickly as possible,\" she said.Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which was founded during the Cold War to broadcast inside the Soviet bloc and was a loose inspiration for RFA, has survived in part due to pledges of support by European governments led by the Czech Republic.Voice of America, which unlike the others was directly part of the US government, ground to a halt immediately after the Trump cuts, with its English-language website still featuring a top story on US lawmakers averting a government shutdown -- in March.Gift' to Beijing?Radio Free Asia has long infuriated Beijing, which accuses it of \"false news.\" Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of the state-run Global Times, in March called action against RFA \"truly gratifying.\"Trump has long railed against media and questions why the government should fund coverage that may be unfavorable.Shutting the broadcaster, which produced news in multiple Asian languages, \"is a gift to dictators like Xi Jinping\" especially \"at a time when Beijing has worked quite assiduously to control what stories can and can't get told the country,\" said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders.Richardson, a veteran scholar of rights in China, noted that Trump has also terminated funding for non-governmental groups that documented developments in the country.\"I think in the not too distant future we'll see more clearly whether there are topics that become much harder to write about -- or aren't written about anymore -- because we aren't able to verify or confirm things or research trends,\" she said.Nicholas Burns, the US ambassador to China under former president Joe Biden, wrote on X that shuttering RFA was a \"major mistake\" that \"will prevent us from telling the truth to the Chinese people and countering Beijing's propaganda.\"RFA said that China has already taken transmission signals vacated by the outlet and has increased its own broadcasting in Uyghur and Tibetan.Radio Free Asia was a rare outlet with a Uyghur-language service not linked to Beijing and was at the forefront of reporting on mass detention camps set up for members of the mostly Muslim ethnic group in China's Xinjiang region.RFA also recently won two Edward R. Murrow Awards, a US prize for broadcasting, for a series on young people in Myanmar coping with the aftermath of the 2021 coup.RFA laid off its stringers in Myanmar a day before a devastating March earthquake.Nonetheless, during the earthquake \"we saw our numbers really skyrocket in terms of social media engagement, because we were that last man standing, so to speak,\" RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan said.\"We're able to be that voice, that news, in that language, reporting on things like the weather and not just political insurrection or political dealings,\" he said.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Radio Free Asia, founded nearly three decades ago to report on China and other Asian countries without independent media, said Wednesday it will halt production after the US government ceased funding.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/radio-free-asia-suspends-operations-after-donald-trump-cuts-funding-government-shutdown-9541678","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2025-10/rq0rn4mc_radio-free-asia_625x300_30_October_25.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:49:41","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":373902360,"title":"Judge Appointed by Biden Demonstrates Partiality in Decision on DOJ Probe of Doctors Providing Transgender Care","text":"In a notable case this week, a district court judge reviewed legal proceedings concerning the Trump administration’s Justice Department and its inquiry into doctors providing “transgender care” surgeries and prescribing “gender-affirming” treatments to their patients.\n\nJudges are expected to base their decisions on constitutional principles, yet it remains uncertain if this was adhered to on Monday at the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Western District of Washington.

If, in international waters, the United States sees a boat that is allegedly carrying drugs, an agreement is reached and either the Mexican Navy or U.S. government institutions [should] intervene to arrest the alleged criminals,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum said that she had asked her foreign affairs minister, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, to convey the message to the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ron Johnson, that what the Mexican government wants is for the aforesaid protocol to be improved “within the framework of the security agreements we have with the United States.”\n\nDe la Fuente and Mexico’s Navy Minister Raymundo Pedro Morales met with Johnson on Tuesday.\n\nSheinbaum said that the ambassador “agreed in principle” with Mexico’s position.\n\nHowever, she noted that he has to discuss the issue with “different authorities of the U.S. government.”\n\n“But in principle he agreed with promoting the continuation of a protocol” favoring the arrest of suspected drug traffickers, Sheinbaum said.\n\nShe stressed that “we do not want there to be a violation of our sovereignty, nor for there to be these kinds of operations in … [Mexico’s exclusive] economic zone.”\n\nSheinbaum explained that another reason why her government opposes military strikes of the kind the U.S. military has been conducting in both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean is that there could be Mexicans on board the boats that are targeted.\n\nHegseth said on X that 14 people had been killed in “three lethal kinetic strikes on four vessels operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations (DTO) trafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific.”\n\nHowever, he didn’t say where the victims came from or where the vessels departed and where they were headed. Hegseth didn’t provide any specific evidence to support his claim that the boats were carrying “narco-terrorists,” saying only that “the four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics.”\n\nRecent U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats have killed a total of 57 people.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Tuesday that “a broad range of experts in laws governing the use of armed force have said the strikes are illegal.”\n\nThe Times also wrote that the Trump administration “has offered tenuous legal rationales” for its attacks “while releasing little evidence to support its smuggling allegations.”\n\nMexico seeking information from US about victims of strikes \n\nSheinbaum said that her government is asking the Trump administration to provide details about the nationalities of the people killed in, and the survivor of, the military strikes in the Pacific Ocean on Monday.\n\nAsked whether the survivor, if rescued, would be handed over to the U.S. government, the president said that her government would have to look at the relevant Mexican and international laws.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States repatriated two survivors of a strike in the Caribbean Sea to their home countries of Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said earlier this month that his government was “totally prepared” to start targeting alleged drug traffickers on land as well.\n\nSo far in 2025, the Trump administration has designated 10 Western Hemisphere crime groups, including six Mexican cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nSheinbaum has ruled out the possibility of U.S. armed forces targeting Mexican cartels on Mexican soil.\n\n“Mexico is a free, independent and sovereign country, and no foreign government would dare to violate our sovereignty,” she said in August when asked whether a U.S. strike against Mexican cartels was a possibility.","summary":"The U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats transporting alleged \"narco-terrorists\" in the Pacific Ocean on Monday were a key focus of President Claudia Sheinbaum's Wednesday morning press conference.\n\n\nThe post Sheinbaum condemns US boat strikes near Mexico&#8217;s waters: Wednesday&#8217;s mañanera recapped appeared first on Mexico News Daily","url":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/politics/sheinbaum-condemns-us-boat-strikes-wednesdays-mananera-recapped/","image":"https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1054397_Conferencia-del-pueblo-Claudia-Sheinbaum_impreso.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:45:28","author":"MND Staff","authors":["MND Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"mx","sentiment":-0.399},{"id":373904334,"title":"A Confederate statue is restored as part of Trump's efforts to reshape how history is told","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has restored a memorial to a Confederate general in Washington, D.C. that demonstrators took down during racial justice protests in the summer of 2020, part of a broader effort by the president to reshape the way the country’s history is told.\n\nThe statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate general and diplomat who later served on the Arkansas Supreme Court, is the only outdoor statue of a Confederate leader in the nation’s capital.

Not a good sight for our younger generation.’\n\nIt is understood the submersibles, which usually ferry cocaine along the coasts of South and Central America towards the United States, could have been using a route via the Solomon Islands to reach Australia, which lies less than 2,000km away.\n\n‘These are low-profile, hard-to-find, hard-to-stop vessels,’ Strategic Analysis Australia founder Michael Shoebridge told news.com.au on Tuesday.\n\n‘They can go about 10 knots, so it can take about a month to go from South America to Australia – and you can carry tonnes of drugs in them.\n\nHe argued Australia’s border and defence force should work with Pacific partners to ‘disrupt and arrest drug smugglers’. \n\n‘The problem of very profitable drug routes coming from South America to Australia via the South Pacific is something that should be a higher priority than it is, and our navy is not well-equipped to surveil and disrupt these narco subs,’ he said.\n\nThis was echoed by Jose Sousa-Santos, head of the Pacific Regional Security Hub at Canterbury University, who said the boats are proof cartels are active in the region.\n\n‘(Those discoveries) definitely show a new trend being used by trans-criminal syndicates in South America and Mexico, to traffic drugs to Australia and New Zealand, the “cash cows” in the region,’ he told RNZ.\n\n‘There are choke points – we see movement between Tonga and French Polynesia, Samoa and the wider Pacific, Fiji and the Solomon Islands, PNG and Australia, which we need to patrol more effectively.’\n\nThe issue is not entirely surprising, with a similar craft appearing north of Isabel Island in August last year, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project reported. \n\nPhysician-turned-businessman Dr Reginald Aipa found the abandoned boat, which was missing starter motors, steering connections, and a battery.\n\nAn Ecuadorian voter ID card was found on board, suggesting a possible link to South America. \n\nPacific Community Centre for Ocean Science head Jerome Aucan said long, low vessels ‘can absolutely cross oceans’.\n\n‘There is definitely a pathway for an object to drift from the coast of South America all the way to Malaita,’ he said. \n\n‘But it might just as easily have crossed under its own power … (The fuel tank) could contain thousands and thousands of litres of fuel.’\n\nHe warned that, if abandoned near Fiji or Vanuatu, currents could have pulled the submersibles toward Australia before looping it north into the Solomon Islands.\n\nWhile the issue appears to be more uncharted territory for Australian authorities, it has dominated headlines in the United States.\n\nEarlier this week, Donald Trump ordered three strikes against four boats accused of carrying drugs in the Pacific ocean, killing 14 ‘narco-terrorists’.\n\nThe announcement was made by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who noted one ‘narco-terrorist’ survivor was captured by Mexican search and rescue.\n\nHegseth said Mexico ‘assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue’ but did not clarify if the survivor would be handed over to the US.\n\nFootage of the strikes on the drug boats was posted to social media, where one vessel visibly filled with large numbers of parcels suddenly explodes while moving in the water.\n\nOther footage shows two stationary drug boats with at least two people seen moving along them before a US bomb engulfs the vessels in flame.\n\nThe total number of strikes on drug boats since early September 13 has risen to 13, with approximately 57 ‘narco-terrorists’ killed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDrug-laden phantom vessels are approaching the Australian coastline, raising concerns about the&#8230;\n\n\nThis

Tylenol and autism","text":"United States Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has partially walked back his warning that taking Tylenol during pregnancy is directly linked to autism in children.\n\nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Kennedy struck a more moderate tone than he generally has in his past public appearances.\n\n“The causative association between Tylenol given in pregnancy and the perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism,” Kennedy told reporters. “But it’s very suggestive.”\n\n“There should be a cautious approach to it,” he added. “ That’s why our message to patients, to mothers, to people who are pregnant and to the mothers of young children is: Consult your physician.”\n\nWednesday’s statement is closer in line with the guidance of reputable health agencies.\n\nWhile some studies have raised the possibility of a link between Tylenol and autism, there have been no conclusive findings. Pregnant women are advised to consult a doctor before taking the medication.\n\nThe World Health Organization reiterated the point in September, noting that “no consistent association has been established” between the medication and autism, despite “extensive research”.\n\nBut claims to the contrary have already prompted efforts to limit the availability of Tylenol, a popular brand of acetaminophen, a fever- and pain-reducing medication.\n\nOn Tuesday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, the companies behind the over-the-counter pain reliever, of deceptive practices.\n\nIn doing so, he reiterated misinformation shared by President Donald Trump and government officials like Kennedy.\n\n“By holding Big Pharma accountable for poisoning our people, we will help Make America Healthy Again,” Paxton said in a statement, giving a nod to Kennedy’s MAHA slogan.\n\nThe suit alleges that Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue violated Texas consumer protection laws by having “deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women”.\n\nIt was the latest instance of scientific misinformation being perpetuated by top officials. Both Trump and Kennedy have repeatedly spread scientific misinformation throughout their political careers.\n\nTrump linked autism and the painkiller during a news conference in September, without providing reputable scientific findings to back the claim.\n\n“[Using] acetaminophen – is that OK? – which is basically, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said on September 22. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good.”\n\nKennedy has offered his own sweeping statements about Tylenol and its alleged risks, despite having no professional medical background.\n\n“Anyone who takes this stuff during pregnancy, unless they have to, is irresponsible,” he said in a cabinet meeting on October 9.\n\nKennedy also mischaracterised studies on male circumcision earlier this month. He falsely said the studies showed an increase in autism among children who were “circumcised early”.\n\n“It’s highly likely because they’re given Tylenol,” he added.\n\nKenvue stressed in a statement on Tuesday that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women, noting that high fevers and pain are potential risks to pregnancies if left untreated.\n\n“We stand firmly with the global medical community that acknowledges the safety of acetaminophen and believe we will continue to be successful in litigation as these claims lack legal merit and scientific support,” Kenvue said.","summary":"US official urges &#039;cautious approach&#039; after Trump baselessly claimed taking Tylenol is linked autism in children.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/29/rfk-jr-walks-back-trump-administrations-claims-linking-tylenol-and-autism?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_6902899d-1761773982.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:36:41","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.357},{"id":373891790,"title":"Trump suggests he knows he can’t run again: ‘It’s too bad’","text":"President Donald Trump seemed to concede Wednesday that he was not eligible to serve a third term, lamenting that it was an unfortunate result of the constitutional prohibition that he has mused about violating for months.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to South Korea, the last leg of his three-country diplomatic tour across Asia, Trump said it was “too bad” that he couldn’t run in 2028.\n\n“We have the greatest economy we’ve ever had, I have my highest poll numbers that I’ve ever had,” he boasted (his approval rating remains low, at 43%, according to a New York Times average). “And, you know, based on what I read, I guess I’m not allowed to run. So we’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe remarks came after House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday there was no path around the Constitution’s two-term limit.\n\n“I don’t see a way to amend the Constitution — I don’t see the path for that,” Johnson said — but not before complimenting the “Trump 2028” cap that the president likes to wear and display in the Oval Office, and noting that it was still fun to entertain the idea.\n\nTrump, asked about Johnson’s conclusion, which the speaker said he had discussed with the president, said he didn’t “want to talk about it” before listing accomplishments, such as resolving several conflicts and rising stock prices, that he said made him the ideal candidate.\n\nSince retaking the White House, Trump has repeatedly teased that he may never leave. For several months, Trump has discussed serving a third term, vacillating between joking to goad his critics and signaling that it would be one of many ways he would seek to test the bounds of his constitutional authority.\n\nEven as recently as Saturday, Trump said, “I would love to do it,” when asked about serving another four years.\n\nAsked Wednesday whether he had been “trolling” or serious about serving, Trump indicated that he had come to terms with the 22nd Amendment, which states that no one can be elected president more than twice (consecutively or not).\n\n“If you read it, it’s pretty clear — I’m not allowed to run,” he said. “It’s too bad.”\n\nLast week, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, said vaguely that there was “a plan” to help the president get elected to a third term.\n\n“Trump is going to be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” he said.\n\nTrump’s allies have floated the possibility of finding a legal loophole, such as a scenario in which Trump runs on a ticket as vice president and ascends to the presidency once elected.\n\nOn Monday, Trump said that although it would be legal for him to do that, he wouldn’t want to. “I would rule that out, because it’s too cute,” he said. “I think the people wouldn’t like that.”\n\nTrump has said that the Republican Party has other great candidates, and has floated the notion of his vice president, JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio running together on a ticket.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Despite the Constitution’s two-term limit, Trump had mused for months about a third term.            \n\n\nThe post Trump suggests he knows he can’t run again: ‘It’s too bad’ appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2025/10/29/trump-suggests-he-knows-he-cant-run-again-its-too-bad/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trump-6902a266c48bf-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:28:25","author":"New York Times Service","authors":["New York Times Service"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":373902588,"title":"Bill O’Reilly Shocked by Nicolle Wallace’s ‘Gall’ to Claim No Democrat Has Called Trump Hitler | Video","text":"Bill O’Reilly was shocked by the “gall” Nicolle Wallace had saying no Democrat has referred to Donald Trump as Hitler.\n\nWhile talking on Wednesday’s episode of “No Spin News,” the host played a conversation between Wallace and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker about accusations of calling the president Hitler. Pritzker denied making any comments himself and Wallace went one step further saying that no Democrat had done so.\n\n“I don’t think any Democrat has,” Wallace said. “I think it’s a smear that they project back onto critics. JD Vance called Donald Trump cultural heroin, he called him America’s Hitler. The attacks on Donald Trump as a fascist came from three-star generals who worked for him.”\n\nO’Reilly than played a number of clips of multiple Democrats making those exact accusations. To name a few prominent faces who have said things about Trump: Joe Biden said he uses “Hitler language,” Kamala Harris compared him to Hitler, Hillary Clinton said a Trump rally looked like “a Nazi rally” and Rep. Jasmine Crockett said he was a “wannabe Hitler.”\n\n“That woman has the gall to say to her audience that she doesn’t think any Democrat has referred to the Trump administration as the Third Reich and Hitler,” O’Reilly said. “I mean, this is just beyond belief.

Total collapse.”\n\nWallace’s comments came earlier this week on her podcast “The Best People” where Pritzker remained adamant he had never called Trump Hitler. This came after comments he made at The Economic Club of Chicago drew parallels between Trump’s leveraging of ICE and the border patrol against illegal immigrants to the Nazi’s attacks on Jews.\n\n“This is how authoritarian regimes do it,” Pritzker said. “They create these kind of fake ideas that there’s an enemy out there and it could be sitting next to you at one of these tables. So just somebody sitting at your table that you don’t like might be one of those enemies. So let’s round them up, let’s make sure they are the subjects of the laws that we’re passing, because we don’t like who they are. That is what authoritarian regimes do.”\n\nHe added: “I can tell you, sitting next to Holocaust survivors, that what they will say in this moment is ‘This is what happened. This is what happened — people’s rights started getting taken away. People got accused of being immigrants’ — this is before the Holocaust really took place.”\n\nYou can watch the full “No Spin News” segment in the video above.","summary":"\"I think it’s a smear that they project back onto critics,\" Wallace said earlier this week about Dems comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich\n\n\nThe post Bill O’Reilly Shocked by Nicolle Wallace’s ‘Gall’ to Claim No Democrat Has Called Trump Hitler | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bill-o-reilly-nicolle-wallace-democrats-call-trump-hitler/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BillOReilly-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:28:11","author":"Jacob Bryant,Nicolle Wallace","authors":["Jacob Bryant","Nicolle Wallace"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.474}]}
