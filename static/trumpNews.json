The picture quality wasn’t perfect, but that was a minor inconvenience, all things considered.\n\nProgrammes such as Pano-rama and Tomor-row’s World brought the gravity, whereas the levity could be found in the long build-up to kick-off on FA Cup final day; catching some of TV-am in the mornings as I ate my bowl of Frosties before heading off to school; or, indeed, on the occasional sick day from school, the sheer novelty of watching Henry Kelly’s Going for Gold from the comfort of the sofa at lunchtime.\n\nHappy days.\n\nEnda McEvoy, Mountmellick, Co Laois\n\nEinstein would hate the violence in Gaza\n\nMadam — Eilis O’Hanlon suggests Albert Einstein, as a founder of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJ), would be denied co-operation or the chance to visit Trinity College Dublin under the terms of the new dispensation regarding Israeli companies and institutions. But the picture regarding Einstein is much more complicated.\n\nEinstein was indeed one of the founders of the HUJ. He served on its board of governors and campaigned for its funding. But he was not a member of staff. Further, he was not “proudly Zionist” in the manner Ms O’Hanlon suggests.\n\nHe was against the founding of a Jewish state or an Arab state to replace the British Mandate for Palestine. Rather, he was associated with Brit Shalom, a small group of Jewish intellectuals who argued for a binational state in Palestine and were against partition.\n\nMore broadly, Einstein was a peace activist and an advocate of global federalism and international law. He would be horrified by the slaughter in Gaza. He would, in all likelihood, be denied entry to the state of Israel.\n\nConor McCarthy, Monkstown, Co Dublin\n\nIt’s Israeli policy to forge academic ties\n\nMadam — Eilis O’Hanlon is correct in pointing out the apparent inconsistency in TCD’s cancellation of its ties with Israel and its continuing connections with academic bodies in some other dubious states.\n\nHowever, it must be borne in mind that, from the very beginning, Israeli society was a European population moving, unwanted, into an Asian country. Every part of that society was encouraged to foster the deepest possible relations with their European counterparts.\n\nThis motivation was particularly strong in academia, where the country’s brightest minds worked to create strong bonds of scientific friendship with foreign institutions.\n\nThis was never a normal academic relationship like that between Irish and other foreign institutions. It was a part of Israeli state policy.\n\nAnthony Hanrahan, Renvyle, Co Galway\n\nWhy doesn’t Trinity cut ties with Russia?\n\nMadam — Eilis O’Hanlon is to be lauded for calling out Trinity College Dublin for cutting its links with Israeli academics and students. Cutting such links serves no purpose other than to build barriers between people.\n\nWhile TCD has a Department of Russian and Slavic Studies, I don’t recall any moves to cut off either Russian academics or students from the college.\n\nConsidering Russia has been slaughtering many more people than Israel — and doing it on a grand scale on this very continent — one would imagine that what is sauce for the Israeli goose should be sauce for the Russian gander.\n\nGerard Murphy, Kilkenny Road, Carlow\n\nThanks for letting us share views on Gaza\n\nMadam — It is good to see the Sunday Independent giving space to readers’ views on what is now a tragic, humanitarian, man-made disaster in Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s government has shown no limits in what it is doing there and in the West Bank. At the same time, let us not forget the brutal attack on Israel by Hamas in October 2023. The response from Israel has been extreme.\n\nIn Europe, political leaders discuss the two-state solution; it has been discussed, forgotten and discussed again for over 30 years. That solution now seems obliterated.\n\nMary Sullivan, College Road, Cork\n\nCarna protests were not about housing\n\nMadam — Regarding Naoise Dolan’s column last week, the US administration is entitled to take policy decisions regarding illegal and legal immigrants.\n\nRegarding housing immigrants in Carna, the issue wasn’t about housing. It related to altering the character of an Irish-speaking community already short of services.\n\nThe same protest would occur should it be proposed to move 80 people from Wexford or any other county to the area.\n\nPJ Kelly, Carraroe, Co Galway\n\nProgramme makers did not distort texts\n\nMadam — As the writer and producer of the documentary series From that Small Island — The Story of the Irish, I wish to take issue with some of the claims made by Eilis O’Hanlon in her review (People & Culture today; online earlier last week).\n\nMs O’Hanlon is entitled to her opinion. What she is not entitled to do is accuse the programme makers of deliberately falsifying or distorting texts.\n\nShe talks at length about our use of a quotation from St Patrick’s Confession, a fifth-century text written in Latin by Saint Patrick, which we show on a screen and is voiced by an actor.\n\n“Ego Patricius, peccator rusticicus … My name is Patrick… so I am first of all a simple country person, a refugee, and unlearned….”\n\nShe writes: “Where did that word ‘refugee’ come from? I looked up a number of translations of Confessio, and not a single one used the word ‘refugee’ or anything remotely like it. At a guess, the relevant Latin phrase in the original Confessio must be ‘contemptiblis sum apud plurimos’, which is generally translated as ‘most contemptible to many’ or ‘despised by most’. In deciding, on extremely dubious etymological grounds, to render that as ‘refugee’, the programme-makers were undoubtedly making a political statement.”\n\nThe implication is that we deliberately made up or changed the translation for our own nefarious purposes. We sourced the exact quote used in the programme from the Royal Irish Academy’s website on the Confessio, which gives the original text in Latin as well as translations. A Google search would bring you to paragraph 12 in the English translation: “...so I am first of all a simple country person, a refugee, and unlearned”.\n\nThis translation is the most authoritative and most recent English translation of Patrick’s own words.\n\nMany different translations exist of the same text, particularly in regard to one as well disseminated as this. Earlier translations — for example, that by Professor Philip Freeman in his book, The World of St Patrick, use the word “exile” to translate the Latin word “profuga”. One of the synonyms for “exile” is “refugee”.\n\nMs O’Hanlon’s ‘guess’ about the relevant Latin quotation is incorrect. The proper reference is “Unde ego primo rusticus, profuga; indoctus scilicet, qui nescio in posterum prouidere”. The relevant word here is “profuga/profugus”, which translates as “exile/refugee”.\n\nI’m not quite sure why she finds the word “refugee” in relation to Saint Patrick so triggering. It is common knowledge that he was Romano-British in origin.\n\nShe accuses programme makers of having a political agenda: “Sneakily pushing such superficial arguments with licence fee payers’ money is why public service broadcasting is no longer trusted as objective by many viewers. It also makes no sense. To imply that people with concerns about mass migration should just pipe down because their distant ancestors came from abroad is as absurd as suggesting that Irish people 8,000 years from now should be bound by 21st-century geopolitical trends.”\n\nWe imply no such thing, as anyone who takes the time to watch the series will attest.\n\nProfessor Bríona Nic Dhiarmada, Writer and producer, ‘From that Small Island’\n\nThink ‘tractor snail’ and slow right down\n\nMadam — I am a dairy farmer and I would just like to suggest the phrase “tractor snail” as something to print in people’s minds to save lives.\n\nThis phrase reflects the true reality of the vast difference in the speed of a car compared with an agricultural tractor.\n\nWhen you see a tractor in the distance, you should immediately slow down in your car, whether it is on a major or minor road, to prevent an accident or collision that can cause death or serious injury.\n\nPlease think “tractor snail” and slow down.\n\nMichael Flynn, Rathgormack, Co Waterford\n\nI’m from a family of two, but we were big\n\nMadam — According to an article in last Sunday’s paper, the days of large families have gone. I was interested in this, as I come from a big family myself. There were only two of us, but we were huge.\n\nNoel Kelly, Doonbeg, Co Clare\n\nTrust in the BBC will never be recovered\n\nMadam — I largely agree with Declan Lynch that the BBC offered us brilliance; the plays, documentaries, sport and the full entertainment day in, day out for adults and children. But that was then.\n\nIn February, the BBC apolo-gised and admitted “serious flaws” over the documentary Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, when it emerged it was narrated by the son of a Hamas official. Where once there was objectivity and impartiality, now the director general had to apologise for “the significant and serious damage done to the corporation”.\n\nRecently in Dublin, Gerry Adams was successful in his defamation case against the broadcaster. I doubt the trust placed in the BBC will ever be recovered fully.\n\nEna Keye, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14\n\nTransport abroad put ours to shame\n\nMadam — I am in total agreement with Brendan Langley (Letters, June 8).\n\nI have travelled quite a bit and lived overseas and I marvelled at how well things worked, from health services to housing to public transport.\n\nI often asked myself if our politicians ever went anywhere or saw anything that made them ask: “Could we do that at home?”\n\nWe have a great country with great people; it’s a pity our politicians, with a few notable exceptions, let the side down.\n\nPaul Mullan, Navan, Co Meath\n\nJail overcrowding was predictable\n\nMadam — It has been reported that the head of the Irish Prison Service is concerned at the level of prison overcrowding, with its attendant dangers for staff and prisoners.\n\nHow has this grim scenario come to pass, given government have been aware of rapidly rising population levels for the past 20 years and have not got round to building any new prison spaces?\n\nIt says it all that the last prison opened (other than an exten-sion to Limerick Women’s Prison) was Cloverhill in 1999, while in the interim both St Patrick’s Institution and Shanganagh have been closed.\n\nMichael Flynn, Bayside, Dublin 13\n\nBrolly’s hatchet job on O’Rourke unfair\n\nMadam — As an Armagh man, from just across the Blackwater River, I’ll admit I’ve no great love for Tyrone GAA (‘Tyrone have no plan for the modern game’, June 8). But even I can’t stand idly by while Joe Brolly launches a demolition job on Malachy O’Rourke in these very pages.\n\nJoe casts Malachy as some sort of managerial medievalist, all blanket defence and no imagination, then crowns himself with glory by reminding us that the U20 manager Paul Devlin once held him to 1-4. Only Joe could slip in a humblebrag mid-execution.\n\nMalachy O’Rourke is a decent man and a proven manager. He deserves time, not theatrics. If Tyrone people ever tire of Malachy, they’ll be spoilt for choice — I’ve no doubt Joe would happily step in as his successor, clipboard in one hand and column deadline in the other.\n\nEnda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh\n\nPolicing toilets is just not workable\n\nMadam — E Bolger worries that “one man” with a gender recognition certificate might make toilets or changing rooms mixed-sex (Letters, June 8).\n\nOn a practical level, the Gender Recognition Act has no effect on these services. If your correspondent believes men are abusing this system, the solution would require not just repealing the act, but posting security at every toilet to demand ID or birth certs of every person trying to enter.\n\nThat simply isn’t workable and, as such, the bureaucratic consequences of the act are irrelevant to these examples.\n\nThe alternative is to mind one’s own business and leave people alone to use the toilet in peace, as we have done without any adverse effect since 2015. Just wash your hands please.\n\nBernie Linnane, Dromahair, Co Leitrim\n\nTrump is a felon, so stop him travelling\n\nMadam — With Donald Trump proscribing people from many countries, stating many are criminals or terrorists, surely it follows that as a convicted felon, Trump should be banned in a similar manner from entering many countries?\n\nGeorge Coe, Gowran, Co Kilkenny\n\nUS has the facility to remove Trump\n\nMadam — There is a facility in the US constitution — if an American president proves himself or herself unfit for that position, they can be removed by legal means.\n\nSurely the time has come to invoke this. How bad does Trump have to be before Congress decides to remove him?\n\nSusan Bevan, Dublin 8\n\nA little joke for the day that’s in it\n\nMadam — Father’s Day reminds me of a quip from Tommy Cooper, along the following lines: “My father was a famous magician, you’ll all know his name... it escapes me for now.”\n\nTom Gilsenan, Beaumont Dublin 9","summary":"Madam — Declan Lynch’s article (‘BBC offered us brilliance in an era of RTE mediocrity’, June 8) reminded me of my own broadened horizons when we first received the four British TV channels in our Co Laois home in 1987.","url":"https://www.independent.ie/opinion/letters/letters-declan-lynch-summed-up-the-sheer-thrill-of-finally-getting-to-watch-british-tv-shows/a1796560461.html","image":"https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/469nHa0epIlI83Z7OVtOy0f0tfA=/0x0:654x437/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/59dbe51a-534c-4e18-8be0-60a47861529a/e4ce1a62-4aa3-4503-b02f-a1839f69026a/59dbe51a-534c-4e18-8be0-60a47861529a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 01:30:00","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.136},{"id":331491390,"title":"Naoise Dolan: State violence is too often the spark that ignites public protests","text":"You know it’s an -effective protest when Donald Trump considers it a riot.

Protest organizers expected rallies in all 50 US states, calling them the largest since Trump returned to office in January, with the aim of \"rejecting authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.\" Wielding signs with messages like \"No KKKings,\" \"No crown for the clown\" and \"The Trump fascist regime must go now!\" the protests stood in stark contrast to a massive military parade in Washington on Saturday. The parade was meant to commemorate the founding of the US Army, but also fell on the president's 79th birthday. \"I am here today to tell the world that we don't have kings in America. In America, the law is king,\" Ilene Ryan told AFP at a demonstration in Boston. In New York, tens of thousands of people, wearing raincoats and carrying colorful umbrellas, marched down Fifth Avenue in a downpour to the sounds of drums, bells and chants of \"Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!\" Actors Susan Sarandon and Mark Ruffalo were seen getting drenched among the protesters. 'Outraged' ==============A few blocks away, Polly Shulman was preparing to join the march with her \"Protect the Constitution\" sign. \"I'm miserable and outraged about how this administration is destroying the ideals of the American Constitution,\" the 62-year-old museum employee told AFP. The most shocking thing, she said, was \"the illegal deportations of law-abiding residents.\" They are \"being kidnapped and disappeared and sent to torture prisons in foreign countries.\" In March, the Trump administration expelled more than 250 Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador after accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang, which it has declared a terrorist organization. At least four protesters in New York were arrested at a separate, smaller protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, police said. 'Mad as hell' ================= \"I think people are mad as hell,\" said Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician who urged others to show \"the administration that we're not going to take this.\" Bill Kennedy, a retired psychologist from Pennsylvania, was in Washington protesting a few hours before Trump's $45 million parade. \"I'm tired of the current administration. I think they're a bunch of fascists,\" he said, describing the military parade as \"ridiculous.\" Suzanne Brown in Boston also lamented the money spent on the parade \"for one man's vanity.\" Massive \"No Kings\" protests were underway in Los Angeles, which in recent days has been rocked by demonstrations over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, as federal agents swept up even law-abiding undocumented people. On Saturday, protesters shouted \"You are not welcome here\" at some of the 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines that Trump dispatched to the city against the wishes of local and state authorities. With a giant orange Trump-in-a-diaper balloon towering above them, thousands filled the city streets, sporting slogans like \"No faux-king way\" and \"Impeach Trump.\" Members of Russian feminist protest and performance art group Pussy Riot held up a large banner in front of city hall warning: \"It's beginning to look a lot like Russia.\" Iris Rodriguez, 44, explained that her family arrived in the United States without papers. \"I find it really, really personal... If this was my mom, if this were the 80s, this would be happening to her,\" she told AFP. \"I was a little scared, but I refuse to be too scared to not come.\" The country-wide demonstrations overwhelmingly took place peacefully and without incident. But in Culpeper, Virginia, police said a man \"intentionally\" rammed his car into a group of protesters as they left the event. No injuries were reported. In Los Angeles, police used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters in front of the downtown federal building, the focus of anti-ICE demonstrations for the last week. AFP reporters said there was no disorder, but it appeared officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines were stationed.","summary":"The parade was meant to commemorate the founding of the US Army, but also fell on the president's 79th birthday","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/americas/tens-of-thousands-throng-us-streets-against-king-trump-1885324","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/06/15/1928000-us.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 01:24:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":331491348,"title":"Police evacuate Texas state Capitol after credible threat to lawmakers","text":"The Texas State Capitol and grounds in Austin were evacuated on Saturday ahead of a planned protest after a credible threat to lawmakers, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.

(Minnesota legislature/AP pic)MINNEAPOLIS: A gunman posing as a police officer killed a senior Democratic state assemblyman and her husband yesterday in an apparent “politically motivated assassination”, and wounded a second lawmaker and his spouse, said Minnesota governor Tim Walz and law enforcement officials.A major search backed by the FBI was underway for the suspect, who fled on foot after firing at police and abandoning a vehicle in which officers found a “manifesto” and a list of other legislators and officials, law enforcement officials said.The suspect was identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension superintendent Drew Evans told a news briefing.Boelter should be considered “armed and dangerous” and is believed to still be in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, Evans said, adding that it was too soon to determine a motive.The suspect had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa, according to his online postings and public records reviewed by Reuters.Boelter also described himself online as a former employee of food service companies.Evans said investigators were aware of similar reports of his connections and would be exploring them.The list found in the abandoned vehicle that looked similar to a police SUV contained about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources.ABC News, also citing law enforcement officials, said the list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, US representative Ilhan Omar, senator Tina Smith and Minnesota attorney-general Keith Ellison.The killings of Melissa Hortman, a former assembly speaker and her husband, Mark, prompted reactions of shock and horror from Republican and Democratic politicians across the country and calls for dialling back increasingly divisive political rhetoric.The shootings come on the heels of a heated hearing in congress on Thursday in which Walz and two other Democratic governors defended their states’ policies to maintain sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, drawing attacks from Republicans who support Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.Minnesota state patrol chief colonel Christina Bogojevic said that police found flyers in the suspect’s vehicle with “No Kings” printed on them, but he had no direct links to the thousands of nationwide “No Kings” protests against President Donald Trump’s policies taking place today.The protests were timed to counter Trump’s long-sought military parade in Washington.The organising No Kings Coalition cancelled all protests in Minnesota, citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect’s at-large status.Trump said he was briefed on the “terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers”.“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” Trump said in a statement.Police impersonator US President Donald Trump escaped an assassination attempt by a gunman in Pennsylvania last year. (AP pic)Hortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, Walz said.The Minneapolis suburb is located in the northern part of Hennepin County, a Democratic stronghold in a state where Republicans have made gains in recent years.Prior to Hortman’s killing, the Minnesota house of representatives she served in was evenly split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans.Hortman’s official website says she and her husband have two children.Walz said that the gunman went to the Hortmans’ residence after shooting senator John Hoffman and his wife multiple times in their home in the nearby town of Champlin.They underwent surgery, Walz said, adding that he was “cautiously optimistic” that they would survive “this assassination attempt”.“This was an act of targeted political violence,” he said.“Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”Law enforcement officials said the gunman attacked the Hoffmans at around 2am and then drove about five miles to the Hortmans’ residence.Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said that a “very intuitive” police sergeant who responded to the Hoffman attack asked colleagues to “proactively” check the Hortmans’ residence.The two officers arriving at the Hortmans’ home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in the driveway with its emergency lights on and an individual dressed and equipped as a police officer leaving the home, he said.The suspect “immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire and the suspect retreated back into the home”, Bruley continued.The suspect wore a vest with a taser, other police equipment and a badge when he fled the home.The Hortmans and Hoffmans were on the list of names found in the suspect’s car, officials said.The FBI called the shooting a “deliberate and violent attack on public servants and their families”.It offered a reward of up to US$50,000 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest.Political violence surgeThe pre-dawn Minnesota killings come amid a surge in US political attacks in recent years, underscoring the dark side of the nation’s deepening political divisions.These include the attempted 2020 kidnapping of Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and a man who broke into Democratic Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro’s residence in April and set it on fire.In July last year, then-candidate Trump escaped an assassination attempt by a gunman while speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.The Texas department of public safety said it arrested a person in connection with a threat against state lawmakers who had planned to attend a protest at the state capitol in Austin, which it evacuated.There was no indication of a direct link to the Minnesota killings.Trump has faced criticism from some opponents over his handling of incidents involving political violence.In one of his first moves in office earlier this year, Trump pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol attack.","summary":"The gunman, identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, is considered armed and dangerous.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/06/15/minnesota-cops-fbi-hunt-suspect-in-lawmakers-deadly-shooting/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7f519b6d-minnesota-lawmakers-ap-150625.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 01:05:08","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":331491352,"title":"EU's von der Leyen says she had 'good call' with Trump ahead of G7 summit","text":"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday she had a good call with U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of the G7 summit.

Trump turns 79. Cue funnel cakes, festive bling, military might — and protest","text":"By OLIVIA DIAZ, LEA SKENE, JOEY CAPPELLETTI and CALVIN WOODWARD\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — There were funnel cakes, stands of festival bling and American flags aplenty. There were mighty machines of war, brought out to dazzle and impress. And there was the spray of tear gas against demonstrators in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and rolling waves of anti-Trump resistance coast to coast.\n\nIn scenes of celebration, protest and trepidation Saturday, masses of Americans cheered for a rousing Army parade like none seen in Washington in generations. Masses more rallied across the country against a president derided by his critics as an authoritarian, would-be king.\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. Army turned 250 and President Donald Trump 79. The double birthday bash energized crowds of well-wishers and military families in the capital while others decried the militarization of city streets — in Los Angeles, where a federalized National Guard and U.S. Marines remained deployed against unrest, and in Washington for the parade.\n\nIn these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.\n\n“One nation under distress,” read a sign carried in a crowd of 1,000 protesters on the grounds of Florida’s old Capitol in Tallahassee. Forewarned of a heavy state response if the crowd caused any trouble, organizers implored the peaceful protesters to not so much as jaywalk.\n\nYet, in his Trump 2024 shirt, retired American Airlines pilot Larry Stallard happily lived out “one thing on my bucket list” from his perch on the parade route. Stallard, 82, came from Kansas City for the event. He declared Trump “one of the best presidents in my lifetime” and concluded, “It’s been a long day, but it’s worth it.”\n\nProtests unfold across the nation\n\nSpirited “No Kings” protests unfolded in cities and towns across the American republic. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz asked people to stay away from anti-Trump demonstrations after the assassination of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, by a gunman still on the loose.\n\nIn Los Angeles, epicenter of days-long protests sparked by Trump’s crackdown on immigrants, police on horseback charged a previously calm crowd, firing tear gas and crowd control projectiles. “We weren’t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,” said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in Atlanta deployed tear gas to divert several hundred nonviolent protesters heading toward Interstate 285 in the northern part of the city. In Culpeper, Virginia, one person was struck by an SUV that police say was intentionally accelerated into the crowd as protesters were leaving an event.\n\nIn Washington, more than 6,000 soldiers marched in period-by-period uniforms, dating back to the garb of the ragtag Continental Army and the rise of a nation that would become the world’s most potent military power. In the mix: tanks, parachute jumps and flyovers by more than 60 aircraft.\n\nWith evening thunderstorms in the forecast, the parade started well ahead of schedule. In the first 40 minutes, it sped through more than 200 years of Army history, from 1775 to 1991.\n\nVietnam-era helicopters, including the Huey, roared overhead, as did World War II-vintage aircraft. Sherman tanks, used extensively in that war’s European theater, rumbled in the procession along with modern machinery. The Army’s Golden Knights parachute team jumped early, releasing streaks of red smoke across the sky and making the crowd scream with excitement as they floated to the ground.\n\nAt the festival earlier, attendees sported apparel celebrating both the Army and Trump. Vendors moved through the crowd, selling Trump-themed merchandise, while others offered gear commemorating the Army’s milestone.\n\nIt was all too much for Wind Euler, 62, who flew from Arizona to join the protesters. “My father was a Marine in Iwo Jima, and he was a Republican,” Euler said. “I think he would be appalled by the fascist display this parade shows.”\n\nOpinions as plentiful as the imagery\n\nIn a camouflage jacket and Army baseball hat, Army veteran Aaron Bogner of Culpeper, Virginia, decried how he believes Trump is using the U.S. military to advance a personal agenda. “I think it’s shameful,” Bogner said. “It’s just an engineered birthday party. It’s an excuse to have tanks in your streets like North Korea.”\n\nAbove all, Bogner said, he came to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Los Angeles after lawlessness broke out in pockets of the city along with peaceful demonstrations. “I’m struggling to understand when it became unpatriotic to protest,” he said.\n\nIn Atlanta, police yelled “unlawful assembly” and “you must disperse” into megaphones as they used tear gas to divert protesters off the road. The tear gas caused the crowd to disperse away from the interstate. Two police helicopters flew above as the crowd moved.\n\nPolice in Charlotte, North Carolina, used bicycles to corral marchers. After the main “No Kings” march ended in Charlotte, a second, unpermitted march began, producing a police confrontation.\n\nOfficers formed a barricade with bicycles and yelled “move back” as protesters attempted to march through uptown Charlotte. In response, demonstrators chanted “let us walk” as police continued to shift them back. Protesters also shouted “peaceful protest” and “no more Nazis.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Mike Stewart in Atlanta; Kate Payne in Tallahassee, Florida; Jake Offenhartz in Los Angeles and Jacques Billeaud in Culpeper, Virginia, contributed.","summary":"In these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/06/14/trump-military-parade-scene/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump_Miltary_Parade_24820-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 01:00:09","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.237},{"id":331489088,"title":"World News | Israel's Military Says It Has Targeted Iran's Defence Ministry Headquarters","text":"Dubai, Jun 15 (AP) Israel launched an expanded assault on Iran on Sunday, with direct strikes targeting its energy industry and Defence Ministry headquarters, while Tehran unleashed a fresh barrage of missiles blamed for the deaths of four people.

Israel -- widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East -- said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days have killed a number of top generals, nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's UN ambassador has said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran's nuclear programme his top priority, said Israel's strikes so far are \"nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days\". In what could be another escalation if confirmed, semiofficial Iranian news agencies reported an Israeli drone struck and caused a \"strong explosion\" at an Iranian natural-gas processing plant. It would be the first Israeli attack on Iran's oil and natural gas industry. Israel's military did not immediately comment.

Iran calls nuclear talks 'unjustifiable' Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only, and US intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran was not actively pursuing the bomb. But its uranium enrichment has reached near weapons-grade levels, and on Thursday, the UN's atomic watchdog censured Iran for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran's top diplomat said on Saturday the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes. Abbas Araghchi's comments came during a call with Kaja Kallas, the European Union's top diplomat. The Israeli airstrikes were the \"result of the direct support by Washington\", Araghchi said in a statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency. The US has said it is not part of the strikes. On Friday, US President Donald Trump urged Iran to reach a deal with the US on its nuclear programme, adding that \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left\". US helps to shoot down Iranian missiles Iran launched its first waves of missiles at Israel late on Friday and early on Saturday. The attacks killed at least three people and wounded 174, two of them seriously, Israel said. The military said seven soldiers were lightly wounded when a missile hit central Israel, without specifying where. US ground-based air-defence systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a US official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the measures. Israel's main international airport said it will remain closed until further notice. Earlier on Saturday, Israel's army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, said Israel had attacked more than 400 \"missile-related\" and other targets across Iran, including 40 in Tehran, where dozens of fighter jets were \"operating freely\".

It’s pretty scary, but (this protest) gives me hope, especially the fact that this is going nationwide.” \n\nAlthough the protest in downtown San Diego had an estimated crowd count at 60,000, the community’s energy, vigor and convictions in Mira Mesa were palpable.\n\nThe protest, like the one downtown, remained peaceful throughout its two-hour duration. No police or counter-protesters were present. \n\nMira Mesa was one of several communities hosting smaller “No Kings” demonstrations rather than joining the downtown march. They included Carlsbad, Del Mar, Chula Vista and Escondido, among others.\n\nMany of the protesters that Times of San Diego spoke to were Mira Mesa residents who said that it was important to them to have a demonstration close to home. Some, like McLean, identified themselves, but others were hesitant to give their full names, citing safety or privacy concerns.\n\n“We wanted people to know that this isn’t something just happening in big cities far away,” said Margaret. “We feel this way right here in this neighborhood.”\n\nSigns they carried covered a range of recent events, responding to everything from President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign and increased immigration enforcement to cuts from scientific research funding.\n\nBrenda Bowman cited concerns over Trump’s funding cuts to USAID, public health initiatives and national parks. For Bowman, who worked on a Department of Energy-funded research project that contributed to the development of the MRI, slashed funding is deeply personal. \n\nSome signs referenced the ‘No Kings’ movement, stating “No crown for a clown,” “Democracy has no kings” and “More like king of scams.” \n\nOther signs took on the administration’s immigration policies. “I prefer my ICE crushed,” one read.“ Another proclaimed, “Immigrants make San Diego great,” and another criticized federal law enforcement – “My dog is more well-trained than your ICE agents.” \n\nAnd for an 11-year old Mira Mesa resident and protester, who attended with his father and younger brother, the turnout meant a lot of people cared. He said he wanted to support immigrants like his grandmother because “they came here for a better life.”\n\nThroughout the protest, the chant “Hey hey, ho ho Donald Trump has got to go” echoed throughout the street, with one man playing a conga drum along to the crowd’s beat. \n\nCars continuously honked in support and protesters with megaphones asked “What do we do when democracy is under attack?” The crowd responded, “stand up, fight back!”\n\nMany also cited the significant immigrant population in Mira Mesa as a reason for their solidarity. \n\nCristen, for example, held up a sign with the Tagalog phrase “Kapwa,” which means togetherness and community. \n\n“I think it’s important that we all come together in solidarity to fight for the rights of all of our folks — our friends, our family, our coworkers, our classmates, our colleagues and our neighbors,” Cristen said. “There’s so much power to the people. That’s what democracy is, and we’re showing (Trump) what democracy looks like.”","summary":" For Deb McLean, the No Kings turn-out in Mira Mesa, a community of about 80,000 residents, was a reason for optimism.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/06/14/nearly-1000-protesters-in-mira-mesa-join-no-kings-day/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/621B94B8-7439-45D8-B4BD-EDEF325CB9C4-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:59:42","author":"Swasti Singhai","authors":["Swasti Singhai"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.073},{"id":331487652,"title":"Is It Time to Eliminate the Troubling American Federation of Teachers?","text":"The primary objective of the entire education system is to prepare young individuals, as future citizens, with skills that are valuable in the marketplace. Ideally, these skills should also foster an understanding and appreciation for the unique experiment in liberty that characterizes the United States of America.\n\nHowever, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), seems to have a different perspective. Her vocal activism appears to disregard education and oppose the principles of effective education. She acts more like an agitator than an educator, and nowhere is this more evident than today. For example, at a “No Kings” rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, she delivered a particularly frenzied speech. Her behavior was as if she had an uncontrollable case of St. Vitus’s dance or some unwanted creature scurrying in her clothing.

The American Federation of Teachers, American Postal Workers Union, and Communications Workers of America are all listed as partners of No Kings Day.\nAFT president Randi Weingarten is set to speak at the Philadelphia No Kings Rally.\nSchool choice activist Corey DeAngelis told The Post Weingarten’s involvement reveals “that teachers unions are more invested in political activism than in prioritizing education.”\n“Their actions expose them as little more than an arm of the Democratic Party, pushing a radical agenda that puts taxpayers on the hook for funding the K-12 education of illegal immigrants,” DeAngelis said.\n\nThis comes as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to this harridan for any time at all.

(Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nIf you’re like me and wanted to watch live cable news coverage during the past 24 hours or so of anything from Israel’s attack on Iran (and Iran’s reciprocal bombing of Tel Aviv) to the protests over ICE raids happening in Los Angeles and other cities — plus other major events like President Trump’s military parade in Washington D.C., or the manhunt in Minnesota for a shooter who killed a state lawmaker by impersonating law enforcement — you may have found yourself pausing for a second.\n\nSpecifically, pausing to try and figure out what subscriptions and apps you actually pay for — and, more importantly, which of them, if any, include a way to stream live news as it’s unfolding.\n\nThe news cycle has certainly been unrelenting over the past few days. Figuring out how to keep up with it all, however, is not the easy proposition that it once was when, if you had a cable box, all you needed to do was flip on the TV and change the channel to CNN, MSNBC, or Fox to get instantly plugged into the story. The fact of the matter, today, is that with so many people having cut the cord, the answer to “Can I watch this live?” depends on what apps you’ve got and how much you’re willing to spend.\n\nIf you pay for live TV\n\nThe best option for a news junkie who doesn’t want to pay for cable is to pay instead for a service like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling, or Fubo. All three of the major cable news channels — CNN, MSNBC, and Fox — are available to stream live through those platforms. You’ll get the channel’s full lineup, in real time, from Anderson Cooper to Bret Baier, Rachel Maddow and everything in between.\n\nLive news options without cable or live TV\n\nIf you’re not paying for cable or any kind of live-TV streaming service, your options narrow dramatically. Here’s what to know, as of June 2025.\n\nCurrently, CNN is the only one of the big three cable news providers that offers any kind of live news stream outside of a traditional TV package. You can access the network’s “CNN Max” service if you also subscribe to HBO Max.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nTwo Nations: Trump’s Military Parade Rolls On Amid Nationwide ‘No Kings’ Protests\n\n‘How To Train Your Dragon’ Just Set A Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score Record\n\nSamsung Suddenly Raises Trade-In Prices In Rare New Offer\n\nThe catch: CNN Max offers a live feed, but it’s not the full CNN channel feed. Rather, it’s a curated mix of live breaking news and some original programs — CNN-lite, as it were. You won’t see Anderson Cooper or Jake Tapper doing their regular thing according to their normal live schedule, but at least it’s something.\n\nAs of this writing, MSNBC does not offer a standalone live streaming option. You can’t access it through NBC’s streaming service Peacock, nor is there a separate app or subscription that gets you the channel without also paying for either cable or a live TV bundle like YouTube TV or Hulu Live.\n\nSame as with MSNBC. Both the Fox News app as well as FoxNews.com require a TV provider login. Fox Nation is a separate app that includes things like opinion shows and documentaries, but not the actual Fox News Channel live feed – which is what you’d want if you’re looking for real-time news coverage, particularly of things like the major world events that have dominated news coverage over the last several days.\n\nThe bottom line for news junkies\n\nIf you don’t pay for cable or a live-TV app, then (again, as of June 2025) CNN via HBO Max is the only option for getting some kind of live news from a mainstream cable network. Even then, it’s not the full version of CNN but rather a streamlined feed. Still, it’ll keep you loosely connected to the news cycle.\n\nUnfortunately, the shift to streaming still hasn’t fully caught up with how people want to watch the news. Until more standalone live streaming options emerge, cord-cutters like me who don’t want to pay for cable or a live TV subscription will keep asking themselves the same question every time news breaks: “Where can I actually watch this live?”\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Trying to stream live news about things like Israel-Iran or the ICE protests?

One was his surprise meeting with Syr-ia’s new leader, Ahmed al-Shara, and the subsequent lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, notwithstand-ing Shara’s history as a leader of a militant Islamist group. Anoth-er was his decision not to include Israel on the itinerary, despite his administration’s ongoing efforts to end the war in Gaza. The trip followed the administration’s de-cision in early May to sign a bilat-eral cease-fire with the Houthis in Yemen, without consulting or including Israel. Along with Trump’s initiation of direct talks with Iran—a step that Israel ada-mantly opposes but Arab leaders in the Persian Gulf welcomed and even helped facilitate—these developments suggest how much the regional balance of power has changed since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nThe war in Gaza has altered the geopolitical landscape of the Mid-dle East. In the years before the October 7 attack, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other Gulf states shared with Israel the perception that Iran and its alliance of proxy forces were the region’s overriding threat. They supported the first Trump administration’s “maximum pres-sure” campaign on Tehran, and they began to normalize relations with Israel. Today, the situation has dramatically shifted. Twen-ty months into the war, Tehran appears far less of a threat to the Arab world. Meanwhile, Israel looks increasingly like a region-al hegemon.\n\nAmid these developments, Washington’s Arab allies and Is-rael are now in opposite camps on the merits of a new nuclear deal. Israel still sees a deal as a lifeline for the Islamic Republic and has been urging the Trump administration instead to take military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities. The Gulf states, by contrast, dread a new and po-tentially uncontainable war on their doorsteps and view a dip-lomatic resolution with Tehran as vital to regional security and stability. They are also wary of creating a Middle East in which Israel has free rein—even in a future in which normalization with Israel can move forward. In their effort to achieve a new bal-ance between Israel and Iran, the Gulf states have become primary players in Trump’s push for a new nuclear deal. Together, they aim to become the fulcrum of a recon-figured regional order.\n\nPRESSURE FAILURE\n\nTo grasp the extent of the Gulf states’ shift on Iran, it is crucial to recall Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s reaction to the first U.S.-Iranian nuclear deal a decade ago. When Iran and the United States signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, in July 2015, the Gulf states shared Israel’s concern that it would bolster Iran’s regional influence. At the time, the Arab world was still re-covering from popular uprisings during the 2010–11 Arab Spring, which had toppled once powerful rulers and sparked civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen. Iran had profited from the tumult, carving a sphere of influence stretching from the Arabian Peninsula to the Levant. In a speech before the U.S. Congress in March 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned, “Iran now dominates four Arab capitals— Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and Sanaa.” The Gulf Arab states, like Israel, worried that the United States, in its push for the nuclear accord, was ignoring the grow-ing regional threat posed by the Islamic Republic and its proxies. The same month as Netanyahu’s speech, Saudi Arabia announced it was leading a military interven-tion in Yemen against the Houth-is, the insurgent group that was expanding Iran’s sphere of influ-ence into the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nand Washington’s Gulf allies may have overstated the prospect of Iranian hegemony in the Mid-dle East, but there was no denying that the turmoil in the Arab world had tilted the regional balance of power in Iran’s favor. To its Mid-dle East detractors, the JCPOA was not just about Iran’s nuclear capabilities but also about Iran’s relative influence. According to the terms of the deal, Iran got sanctions relief just for agree-ing to limit its nuclear program; it was not required to rein in its proxy forces in the region. As a result, the deal threatened to increase Iran’s sway even as it curbed the country’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. Arab states thus joined hands with Israel to underscore this flaw and used it in a high-profile effort to undermine the JCPOA. In addition to aggres-sively lobbying members of Con-gress—an offensive symbolized by Netanyahu’s 2015 speech—this effort included a public and media campaign against the deal.\n\nDuring his first administra-tion, Trump concurred with the deal’s critics. The United States unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and placed Iran under “maximum pressure” eco-nomic sanctions. At the time, the Trump administration expected that this pressure would weak-en Iran and shrink its regional influence in favor of a new re-gional order centered on Israel\n\n and Washington’s Arab allies. The administration promoted expanded Arab-Israeli security and intelligence cooperation, culminating in the 2020 Abraham Accords—the agreement that nor-malized relations between Israel and a series of Arab and North African states, including Bahrain and the UAE, and subsequently Morocco and Sudan. It also took a harder line toward Iran’s support for proxy forces across the region, to the point of making the highly unusual decision to assassinate Iranian General Qasem Soleima-ni, the powerful head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Baghdad in 2020.\n\nThe tougher U.S. strategy toward Iran continued under President Joe Biden. Contrary to expectations, the Biden adminis-tration did not restore the JCPOA\n\n and eschewed engaging with Iran—agreeing to talks only after Iran raised the stakes by ac-celerating its accumula-tion of highly enriched uranium. Biden’s focus, much like Trump’s, was instead on forging an Arab-Israeli axis. Nor-malization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia thus became the lodestar of Biden’s Mid-dle East policy. Indeed, at the time of Hamas’s Oc-tober 7 attack, the admin-istration thought it was on the cusp of an Israe-li-Saudi deal that would bring lasting peace to the region.\n\nISRAEL UNLEASHED\n\nAs events would soon make clear, that assumption was terri-bly misguided. The Trump-Biden strategy only aggravated regional tensions. Iran responded to U.S. pressure by expanding its nucle-ar program and its support for the Houthis in Yemen in their war with the Gulf states. It also began directly attacking U.S. and Gulf interests, most notably Saudi oil facilities, in 2019. Even before the October 7 attack, the Gulf states had lost confidence in Washington’s strategy. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia broke ranks to normalize ties with Iran—in a deal brokered by China. One immediate benefit was an end to Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Gulf states re-mained committed to expanding ties with Israel, but maintaining a balance between Iran and Israel would prove difficult.\n\nThen came Hamas’s attacks and Israel’s blistering war in Gaza, which derailed normal-ization between Israel and Sau-di Arabia. A resurgent “axis of resistance,” backed by Iran—in-cluding Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, who, along with Hamas saw the prospect of Israeli-Saudi normalization as an existential threat—was now at open war with Israel. The Biden administration assumed that this new regional conflict would strengthen the case for an Israel– Gulf state security alliance, but the Gulf states were loath to be dragged into that conflict. In Jan-uary 2024, when Biden resolved to respond militarily to the Houthis’ attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea, Saudi Arabia and the UAE assiduously avoided get-ting involved, despite their years-long struggle against the group. Arab states also had to account for the growing anger among the Arab public about the treatment of the people of Gaza, which pre-cluded any further tightening of Arab-Israeli security cooperation.\n\nThen, in the fall of 2024, a se-ries of Israeli successes turned the tide of the war. In late Septem-ber, Israel eliminated Hezbollah’s top leadership, including the orga-nization’s longtime leader, Hasan Nasrallah, in a targeted bomb\n\n attack—a strike that followed on the heels of a successful under-cover operation that decimated the group’s command-and-control structure using exploding pagers. The following month, Israeli forc-es killed Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who had masterminded the October 7 attack. And in early December, the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, a longtime close Iranian ally, collapsed. Mean-while, dangerous exchanges of missiles and drones between Iran and Israel raised the stakes but also further dented Iran’s aura of power, with Israel claiming to have neutralized many of Iran’s air defenses.\n\nBy the end of the year, the axis of resistance had been dimin-ished, and Tehran found itself largely cut off from the Levant. Even Iran’s defense of its home-land looked vulnerable. With Trump, a strong backer of Isra-el, poised to return to the White House, a confident Netanyahu government in Israel saw a rare opportunity to deal a decisive blow to Iran, destroying its nu-clear facilities and devastating its economic infrastructure in an at-tack that would push the Islamic Republic to the brink.\n\nIRAN IN THE BALANCE\n\nYet Trump has not followed the expected Israeli script. Wor-ried that military strikes on Iran will pull the United States into a costly war, the president has thus far resisted Israeli pressure to dispense with diplomacy and wage open war on Iran. Instead, he has pushed for a new version of precisely the thing he repudiat-ed during his first term: a nuclear deal. In doing so, he is backed by the Gulf states, which, despite their opposition to the earlier deal, also now favor diplomacy with Iran. Since Trump took of-fice, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have all counseled against war and acted as inter-mediaries and mediators between Tehran and Washington. The most obvious reason for this shift is fear of what war in the Gulf would do to their economies. At a more fundamental level, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states see a nuclear deal as central to achiev-ing a new balance of power in the Middle East.\n\nIn part, Gulf support for an Iran deal has to do with Israel’s own changed position in the re-gion. Even as it continues its of-fensive in Gaza, Israel has already begun to emerge triumphant, confident in its absolute military superiority, and ready to use it to assert domination over the Mid-dle East. In addition to expanding its occupation of Gaza, which Is-raeli leaders have suggested could be put under indefinite military rule, Israel has been imposing its will on south Lebanon and is occupying and carrying out mili-tary incursions into large swaths of Syria. And now it wants to ex-tend its victorious campaign in the Levant to the Gulf, with a mil-itary attack on Iran. In addition to provoking Iranian retaliation that could soon include targets on the Arabian Peninsula, such an attack could disrupt world energy supplies and cast doubt on the long-term viability of the economic boom in the Gulf.\n\nSource: FOREIGN AFFAIRS (www. foreignaffairs.com) June 10, 2025.","summary":"&#8230; America, Iran, and the Emerging Arabian Axis. &#160;During his visit to the Middle East in May, U.S. President Donald Trump did several things that few would have predicted months&#8230;","url":"https://independent.ng/the-new-balance-of-power-in-the-middle-east/","image":"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/3-45.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:41:00","author":"VALI NASR","authors":["VALI NASR"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.068},{"id":331487160,"title":"Donald Trump's Mega Military Parade Marking Army's 250th Birthday In Washington, D.C. | N18G","text":"Last Updated:June 15, 2025, 06:09 IST Videos\n\nPresident Trump is attending a military parade in Washington, D.C., Saturday to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, as he also celebrates his 79th birthday.

The Shermans were retired by the US in the early 1950s, shortly after the Korean War.\n\nIt was preceded by a B-25 bomber, which became famous for conducting bombing raids of Japan.\n\n11:40 PM BST\n\nSecond Family watches parade\n\nJD Vance, the vice president, has published a photo of his children watching the military parade as it heads through Washington, DC.\n\n“Quite a view!” he wrote on social media. They appear to be standing behind bulletproof glass.\n\n11:39 PM BST\n\nSoldiers dressed in historic uniforms\n\nAs the parade gets into swing, more than 6,000 soldiers dressed in uniforms ranging from the Revolutionary War up to the present day are marching along the National Mall.\n\n11:34 PM BST\n\nB-25 bomber flies over skies of Washington\n\nSince gaining fame for its daring raids during the Second World War, the B-25s have become one of the US’ iconic bombers.\n\nThe last aircraft was retired in 1960, but it has now returned to the skies one more time for the military parade, flanked by a P-51 Mustang on either side.\n\n11:24 PM BST\n\nAttendees travelled for ‘days’ to see parade\n\nWhen you think of an American patriot, you think of Brian Dubuc. Donning a white shirt embroidered with that an American flag the size of his back, he’s here for one thing only; the military.\n\n“I love the military, I’m very patriotic, from the bottom of my foot to the top of my head,” the 61-year old said.\n\nHe has travelled a staggering two days with his family to reach the foot of the monument with a perfect view of the stage where Trump will speak tonight.\n\n“I’m here because I love the military. My dad was in the military,” he adds.\n\n“It’s a tough time right now. There’s a lot going on.”\n\n11:22 PM BST\n\nA ‘moving timeline of the army’s history’\n\nThe thudding of the 21 gun salute is the only thing louder than the cheers for President Trump, who has just arrived at the parade.\n\nHail to The Chief follows and so does the start of the parade. Soldiers march wearing the dress form every period the army has fought. It’s a moving timeline of the army’s history.\n\n11:18 PM BST\n\nTroops march through the streets\n\nUniformed servicemen have begin marching through the streets of Washington DC as the US army’s 250th anniversary parade kicks off proper.\n\nSoldiers carrying American flags have joined bands to march along a stretch of the National Mall.\n\nDonald Trump and his wife, Melania, can be seen applauding and smiling, with the President occasionally saluting the soldiers.\n\n11:13 PM BST\n\nParade begins early amid adverse weather warnings\n\nTonight’s festivities have kicked off almost half an hour early, with rain forecast later tonight.\n\nFollowing reports the festivities could be postponed or even cancelled owing to the weather, Donald Trump this morning wrote on Truth Social that the celebration would go ahead “rain or shine”.\n\n11:10 PM BST\n\nTrump and Melania head onstage\n\nDonald Trump and his wife, Melania, took the stage to address crowds at the 250th anniversary parade for the US army.\n\nCrowds cheered and screamed as Mr and Mrs Trump entered, shortly after which a gun salute rang out against a back drop of chants of “USA, USA”.\n\nChief Musician SSG Caroline Nielson is now performing a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.\n\n11:01 PM BST\n\nLone anti-Trump protester at DC festivities\n\nTim Pohle, 60, is a brave man. Among the sea of patriots, he holds a sign mocking the president.\n\nHe has never protested before. But the military parade proved to be the final straw that drove him to demonstrate.\n\n“It’s the kind of thing you do in North Korea, or Russia. I don’t think this is the right thing for the country to be doing,” he said.\n\n“I just feel I’ve come to a point where you need to hopefully convince some folks that in the next election, they pick someone who can take the country in another direction.”\n\nWe’re interrupted by a man who shouts, “Trump is my king”. But he says he’s had nothing but friendly interactions.\n\n“There are some proud boy who walked by me and showed me a gang sign or something threatening, he adds”.\n\n10:26 PM BST\n\nHuge crowds turn out for LA ‘No Kings’ protest\n\n10:16 PM BST\n\n‘This is a once in a lifetime experience’\n\nJuliana Balogh, 72 and Kim Muygen, 31, who met at a Donald Trump rally, say they’re here for a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nOriginally from Vietnam, Ms Muygen says the president’s pledged to clamp down on illegal immigration is why she voted for him.\n\n“I’m an immigrant from Vietnam and we came here legally. It took a long time to come here and we pay tax. After five years we applied to become citizens,” she said.\n\nMs Muygen became a US citizen after legally entering the country and living in LA for more than two decades\n\n“I see people just crossing the border and guessing in it’s not fair you have to come here legally.”\n\n09:46 PM BST\n\nView from the scene\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas. But my goodness have they given a good go here in Washington.\n\nHundreds of tanks, thousands of troops and countless more Maga hats fill Washington DC’s National Mall.\n\nBut it’s not the kind of atmosphere you’d perhaps expect from a gathering of such fierce Trump supporters.\n\nIt is instead akin to something much more like a family friendly day out.\n\nIronic of course, given the sheer amount of weaponry on display.\n\n09:41 PM BST\n\nMelania Trump to make an appearance\n\nDonald Trump’s wife, Melania, is to make an appearance at the festivities later today.\n\nThe president is to speak this evening, following a 21 gun salute and “hail to the chief”.\n\nMrs Trump is understood to potentially be joining her husband onstage.\n\n08:52 PM BST\n\nBernie Sanders attends ‘No Kings’ protest in Vermont\n\n08:31 PM BST\n\n‘No Kings’ protest through LA\n\n“No Kings” protesters marched through the streets of Los Angeles following a week of riots over ICE arrests in the city.\n\nThousands of protesters could be seen, some carrying Mexican flags, marching through the Southern Californian city’s streets.\n\nCritics have drawn parallels between today’s display of military mite and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines on the streets of LA to help police the riots.\n\nDonald Trump has been locked in an on-going row with California’s governer Gavin Newsom after the president went over his head to involve the military in the containment of the protests.\n\n07:43 PM BST\n\nProtesters march through Washington ahead of parade\n\nA steady stream of protesters is heading past The Telegraph’s Washington, DC offices, apparently heading to the White House.\n\nFootage posted on social media shows demonstrators streaming down 14th Street, waving banners that read “The fascist Trump regime must go” and “Trump must go now”.\n\nIt raises the prospect of clashes with law enforcement, after Donald Trump vowed anyone who disrupted his military parade would face “very heavy force”.\n\n“No Kings”, a collection of protest groups which is organising demonstrations across the country, deliberately avoided the US capital to avoid confrontations with the authorities.\n\n07:11 PM BST\n\nPictured: ‘No Kings’ protests take place across US\n\n06:28 PM BST\n\nCapitol Police ‘aware of Minnesota incident’\n\nA spokesperson for the United States Capitol Police (USCP) confirmed they were aware of the violent incident in Minnesota today.\n\nMelissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota’s House of Representatives, along with her husband, was shot by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nJohn Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. Both have received surgery and are expected to survive, officials say.\n\nA spokesperson for the USCP told NBC News: “The United States Capitol Police is aware of the violence targeting state lawmakers in Minnesota. We have been working with our federal, state and local partners. For safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our security posture.”\n\n06:04 PM BST\n\nNetanyahu wishes Trump and army a ‘happy birthday’\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has wished Donald Trump and the US Army a “double happy birthday”.\n\nMe Netanyahu, speaking as Israel strikes Iran in an attempt to derail its nuclear programme, paid tribute to Mr Trump as a “decisive, courageous” leader who had been an“extraordinary friend to the Jewish state and to me personally”.\n\n“We appreciate what you’re doing now, helping protect Israeli lives against the criminal regime in Iran,” he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu added: “I want to wish also a 250th Happy Birthday to the American Army.\n\n“The men and women of the armed services of the United States have protected freedom for two and a half centuries. We would not have a free world without you. Thank you on behalf of free peoples everywhere.”\n\n05:51 PM BST\n\n‘No Kings’ leaflets found in Minnesota shooting suspect’s car\n\n“No Kings” protest leaflets have been found in the car of a man suspected of shooting dead a Democrat politician and her husband in Minnesota.\n\nMelissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker in Minnesota’s House of Representatives, along with her husband, was killed by a gunman in their home in the early hours of Saturday, in what authorities said appeared to be a “politically motivated assassination”.\n\nJohn Hoffman, a Democratic state senator, and his spouse were also shot multiple times. The pair are expected to survive, officials said.\n\nMinnesota police released an image of dozens of leaflets about the “No Kings” protests, demonstrating against Donald Trump and his military parade, on the seat of a car belonging to the suspect.\n\n“Given the targeted shootings of state lawmakers overnight, we are asking the public to not attend today’s planned demonstrations across Minnesota out of an abundance of caution,” they said in a statement.\n\n05:46 PM BST\n\n‘No Kings’ organisers hope to rain on Trump’s parade\n\nAs US tanks and troops parade through the streets of Washington, DC, protests are expected to take place across the country.\n\nOrganisers say the “No Kings” demonstrations, protesting against Donald Trump, will be held in around 2,000 towns and cities across the US - but not the capital, to avoid clashes with law enforcement.\n\nThey hope to create a “split-screen” between the displays of military power in Washington contrasted against anti-Trump protests elsewhere.\n\n05:35 PM BST\n\nParade is on ‘rain or shine,’ says Trump\n\nDonald Trump has insisted the military celebration will go ahead “rain or shine” following a report that the military celebration could be cancelled or rescheduled owing to adverse weather conditions.\n\nA source told The Times that a looming thunderstorm warning for this weekend could be a threat to public safety, and may see the event cancelled.\n\nResidents of America’s capital last night also received mobile phone alerts, warning them of flash flooding in the city.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump this morning wrote on his Truth Social site: “Our great military parade is on, rain or shine. Remember, a rainy day [parade] brings good luck. I’ll see you all in DC.”\n\n05:23 PM BST\n\nPictured: Wreath laid at Tomb of Unknown Soldier on army anniversary\n\n05:21 PM BST\n\nTroops in LA, tanks in DC - but Trump is winning the battle for public opinion\n\nThere are thunderstorms forecast for the weekend, and protesters planning to rain on his military parade, but there’s one piece of good news for Donald Trump on his 79th birthday.\n\nPolling shared with The Telegraph shows significant support for the president’s deployment of troops to clamp down on riots in Los Angeles, with the public backing his move by a margin of 14 per cent.\n\nInitially, Mr Trump’s decision to send the National Guard and US Marines to the city of angels had threatened to cast a cloud over his parade on Saturday, with soldiers detaining US citizens during what was meant to be a shared celebration of the country’s military history.\n\nJames Johnson, co-founder of JL Partners, which conducted the polling, said it showed the president was “very much winning the battle of public opinion when it comes to the protests”.\n\nRead the full preview of Mr Trump’s military parade here.\n\n05:19 PM BST\n\nPictured: Civilians pose with weapons ahead of military parade\n\n05:15 PM BST\n\nHello and welcome to the live blog.

Couple who lost bitter war against neighbours over Bond-villain mansion finally remove illegal barrier after failing in their attempt to create a new access route\n\nDo YOU have a story? Email:john.james@mailonline.co.uk \nBy TOM BEDFORD and JOHN JAMES \n Published:01:12 BST, 15 June 2025 |Updated:01:35 BST, 15 June 2025 \n\nA couple who defied a council enforcement order to remove a £10,000 set of gates stopping locals accessing a beauty spot they've enjoyed for generations have had to tear them down in a humiliating defeat.\nInstead of immediately complying with their enforcement notice, Adam and Laura Drew spent a fortune building two new paths a few metres further away from their £500,000 home nicknamed the James Bond House.\nThe Drews hoped the new entrances to the forestry paradise would allow them to keep the 8ft-high gates and retain their privacy.\nBut council chiefs warned the couple to take them down this weekend - or else. Today to the delight of locals the 'gates of hell' were finally removed. \nWalkers, cyclists and horse riders said they had used the path next to the sprawling 11-bedroomed property for as long as anyone can remember.\nIt leads to Cwmparc Forestry, a haven for wildlife and a place of natural beauty where some locals had their ashes scattered.\nBut a year ago the Drews bought the ugly grey house and began complaining of anti-social behaviour by people accessing the mountain.\nChartered accountant Mr Drew and his slimming consultant wife Laura, both 40, claimed they were subjected to illegal parking, dangerous driving, out-of-control dogs, people urinating, dog-fouling, aggression, theft, drugs, and people with air rifles.\n\nAdam and Laura Drew purchased the 11-bedroom mansion for £500,000 and swiftly installed the gates for their 'security' before being told to remove them\n\nWhen MailOnline revisited the stunning mansion earlier this week the imposing gates remained firmly in place\n\nBut yesterday campaigners were jubilant again as access was finally restored \n\nLocals had been angered further when an official-looking sign went up at the entrance saying 'No unauthorised access' \n\nThe Drews stunned their village community by creating two new entrances to the mountain 'paradise'\n\nTons of chippings were laid, steel fences were erected and 50-year-old conifers felled to make a 15ft wide road\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThey said the last straw came when torches were shone into bedrooms where their three children were sleeping.\nIn a statement the wealthy couple said: 'A decision was made that we needed to put security gates at our home to keep our children safe.'\nResidents of Cwmparc, near the historic Welsh Valleys coal mining town of Treorchy, disputed the couple's claims and launched the\n'No to the Gates' campaign, staging peaceful protests and getting up a 4,000 signature petition.\nAfter an investigation, Rhondda Cynon Taf Council gave the Drews 30 days to take the gates down saying highway rights exist because the path has been in public use for over 20 years.\nLocals looked forward to seeing them dismantled and taken away but last Sunday(June 8) the deadline passed and the gates were still standing.\nIt appears the Drews believed they had solved the problem by building a road on their land for fire service and other official bodies to access the mountain and a narrower path for walkers, cyclists and horse riders.\nTons of chippings were laid, steel fences erected and 50-year-old conifers felled to make way for the two unofficial thoroughfares.\nBut campaigners want the original right of way opened up because the new road and path are not legal highways.\nRichard Clarke, 57, a local businessman, said: 'We've kept this campaign as clean as we possibly can, in fact we've protected these people (Mr and Mrs Drew) by stopping some of the remarks about them posted on social media.\n'I sincerely hope they do the right thing and return to us what we started off with - a legal right of way to Cwmparc forestry.'\nThe council agreed and gave the Drews until midnight on Sunday to pull down the gates or they would send in their own contractors.\n\nResidents then watched in disbelief as a wide footpath was laid next to it and more steel fencing put up.\n\nThe gate blocked a public footpath which winds up the valley to Cwmparc Forest in South Wales\nCouncil leader Andrew Morgan said: 'Following the expiry of the notice served on the homeowners, Council officers are not satisfied with the current access arrangements which do not provide the public with unfettered access.\n'The current unapproved arrangements do not fulfil the legal order for the gates to be removed.\n'As a result, the Council requires the homeowners to remove the gates with their specialist contractors and we expect this to be done over the weekend.\n'If the gates are not removed then the Council will dispatch contractors to remove them.'\nMr Morgan said diversions and changes to the highway must follow the correct legal process and rest with local magistrates.\nHe added: 'This remains a delicate situation and we ask that the community act responsibly. The Council is committed to seeing this through.'\nThis week, the quiet road has been thronging with furious villagers arriving to inspect the damage caused by the installation of the new road and pathway\n\nCampaigner Richard Clarke, 57, had been monitoring the gates since they were installed\n\nOminous signs installed by the Drews promised 24-hour surveillance of the perimeter\n\nNature lover Rhiannon Evans, 49, said she used to walk the mountain tracks with her three-legged dog Belle\n\nShe was outraged by the number of trees that have been felled for the new path \nNature lover Rhiannon Evans, 49, who used to walk the mountain tracks with her three-legged dog Belle said: 'They've chopped down at least six large conifers where magpies were nesting. There are bats roosting up there too.\n'They have no planning permission for what they've done and have shown utter contempt for the law and the villagers who have enjoyed the forestry for years.'\nRetired probation office manager Irene Price, 77, told Mail Online: 'I'm outraged by what's been going on since these people moved here.\n'If you buy a house next to forestry you can expect people to walk past. The walk up the mountain was one of my favourite things in the village. What they've done is a disgrace.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nA gate too far!

Why do we hand out honours to a bunch of self-satisfied sycophants?","text":"What a relief it must have been for the His Majesty the King to discover that Sir Sadiq Khan, knighted by the monarch in the New Year’s honours, was well satisfied with his experience at the Palace last week.\n\nAs Sir Sadiq told reporters after his investiture, ‘He [the King] was very chuffed that he managed to personally give me this honour, and he actually apologised for it taking so long – which is not a problem at all.’\n\nWell, that’s a relief. God forbid the humble King should dare to inconvenience His Supreme Eminence Sir Sadiq.\n\nAs to why the monarch feels the need to apologise to Khan – or anyone, for that matter – for not knighting him sooner, that just seems bizarre. \n\nBut then the King does seem to have an affinity with the current crop of Labour politicians.\n\nHis friendship with the Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, for example, has become notable in recent months, even though she once referred to his brother, Prince Andrew, as a ‘nonce’.\n\nThe pair are frequently pictured together, and by the look of it he finds her enthralling. For her part, she says: ‘He’s got a really good sense of humour. I know this might sound odd coming from me but he’s easy to get along with.’\n\nExcellent. Give that monarch a five-star Google review!\n\nBut I digress. Khan’s remarks are telling because they expose the astonishing extent of his entitlement, not to mention elitism.\n\nI always thought those on the political Left felt themselves above such baubles as knighthoods and other honours, being as they are, well you know, symbols of the oppressive white imperialist establishment that they are so generally keen to eradicate.\n\nExcept, of course, when it suits their purpose. In the same way that David Lammy can describe Donald Trump as a ‘tyrant’ and ‘woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath’ one moment and practically his best friend the next, the world looks very different once you’re on the other side of the velvet rope.\n\nThe problem here, I think, is that I have this naive belief that a knighthood (or any other sort of honour) is something that is to be deserved, not expected. \n\nWhen I think of a knight of the realm or a dame, I think of someone who has done something brave and unique, proven themselves in the face of adversity, gone against the grain, broken new ground, defied the odds – that kind of thing.\n\nSomeone, for example, like J.K. Rowling, who has worked harder to protect the rights of vulnerable women and girls than almost anyone in recent years, and at no small cost to her own safety.\n\nThat, and given millions of children untold joy with her writing. She has twice been offered a peerage, we are told – but has turned it down.\n\nAnd with the likes of Khan now among the realms of the knighted, I can see why.\n\nQuite apart from his woke appeasement of every crackpot pressure group going, I challenge anyone to find many Londoners who think Khan has changed the capital city for the better.\n\nThe place is in constant gridlock thanks to miles of cycle lanes and low emission zones, overrun by gangs of feral youths on scooters, knife crime has increased by more than 50 per cent, the Tube is covered in graffiti and the entire place smells so strongly of weed you can practically get high just walking down the street.\n\nIt’s a mess, and it’s on his watch. Why such a generous gong for such obvious failure? It makes no sense – but worse of all, it devalues the entire system.\n\nLikewise, the elevation of David Beckham. Unlike Khan, Beckham is at least universally popular and greatly loved, and with good reason. He’s a very amiable chap who has made a huge success of his life, and he looks absolutely super in a pair of swimming trunks. But does that mean he should be a knight of the realm?\n\nSure, he does stuff for charity, but so do lots of people, and like all these celebrities with their eyes on a gong, one can’t help feeling it’s a tad performative. \n\nIt’s just part of the box-ticking exercise necessary to qualify, along with his new-found passion for horticulture and bee-keeping, both passions that are shared by the King. \n\nAnd, of course, when it comes to entitlement, let’s not forget those leaked emails in which he called the honours committee a disgrace and ‘a bunch of unappreciative c***s’. \n\nThat was back when they rejected him over questionable tax status (now resolved). I imagine now the tone is rather different.\n\nBut that’s the problem: these things have become a bureaucratic process rather than genuine, heartfelt rewards, which means that they tend to go to those who, while not necessarily undeserving, do nonetheless know how to play the game and are therefore, by definition, already part of the establishment.\n\nThere is an unspoken protocol and a series of hoops to be jumped through. If you know what these are, and have the right advocates, you can make the grade. It’s as simple as that.\n\nAnd it can cut both ways: there are plenty of very deserving people who don’t get their acknowledgement for the simple reason that they aren’t prepared to play the game, or they don’t have the right ‘optics’.\n\nThey are the ones who are truly deserving – not this skilled army of smug, self-satisfied sycophants.\n\nAlexa’s plastered!\n\nThe fashionistas were out in force in London last week to celebrate the re-opening of the Miu Miu shop in Bond Street. \n\nI own precisely one item of Miu Miu, a vintage yellow handbag that my daughter bought for me via eBay for my birthday. I love it. \n\nSadly the same can’t be said of their clothes. When even the delectable Alexa Chung, left, who never puts so much as a sartorial toenail wrong, looks like she’s wearing a surgical bandage, you know someone’s lost the plot.\n\nA friend of mine went to something called ‘Founders Forum’ the other day, which is essentially a summit for entrepreneurs scouting for the next Big Thing. \n\nAll the talk was of the ‘limbic economy’. \n\nThe limbic part of the human brain is the region that responds to pleasure stimuli – by targeting our predilection for addiction, instant gratification and other harmful behaviour, companies can turn big profits. \n\nRemember that next time you find yourself scrolling TikTok Shop. \n\nSurvivor’s miracle escape \n\nHow Vishwashkumar Ramesh, the passenger in seat 11A on the doomed Air India flight that crashed shortly after take-off last week, survived virtually unscathed is a mystery that will no doubt puzzle aviation experts for years to come. \n\nGiven the tragic loss of life – more than 240 souls – it seems nothing short of miraculous. \n\nOne thing is for certain, though: now there’s always going to be a scramble for seat 11A.\n\nAfter seven more members of an Asian grooming gang from Rochdale were convicted of exploiting two girls aged 13 as ‘sex slaves’, the PM has finally announced a long-overdue national inquiry. \n\nThe next step is to ensure it is properly independent. \n\nGiven that on Thursday Dominic Cummings claimed that when the Coalition took over from Labour in 2010 ‘there were mass cover-ups of the whole thing in Whitehall’, perhaps he may be the right person to lead it. \n\nAfter all, no one can accuse him of sparing anyone’s blushes. \n\nSome people think it’s a bit naff, but for me there’s nothing sweeter than mums and their daughters wearing the same, or similar, outfits, as seen on the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte, ten, right, at Trooping the Colour. \n\nEnjoy it while you can, Ma’am – in my experience it won’t be long before she won’t want to be seen dead in the same room as you, let alone the same outfit!\n\nI am very ambivalent about Israel’s strategy in Gaza – as, I know, are many Israelis. However, when it comes to Iran, Israel is doing the world a favour. \n\nSomeone has to stand up to this wicked, misogynistic regime, and it seems Israel is the only country in the world with the courage to do so. \n\nWhen are our politicians going to show the same backbone?","summary":"What a relief it must have been for the King to discover that Sir Sadiq Khan, knighted by the monarch in the New Year's honours, was well satisfied with his experience at the Palace last week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14812739/SARAH-VINE-knighthood-Sadiq-Khan-London-mess-devalues-entire-hand-honours-bunch-self-satisfied-sycophants.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/14/21/99380809-0-image-m-25_1749932294851.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:34:51","author":"Editor,Sarah Vine","authors":["Editor","Sarah Vine"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":331489102,"title":"World News | Trump Says Putin Wished Him Happy Birthday, Both Agree to End Israel-Iran War","text":"Washington DC [US], June 15 (ANI): US President Donald Trump on Saturday (local time) revealed that he received a call from Russian President Vladimir Putin on his 79th birthday and and talked about the war between Israel and Iran, which both leaders agreed \"should end.\"\nThe conversation occurred before Trump is set to mark hi 79th birthday in the evening by attending a military parade on the streets of Washington DC to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US Army.\nAlso Read | Israel Warns ‘Tehran Will Burn’ as Iran Fires Missiles in Response to Deadly Strikes.\nTrump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social, \"President Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran, a country he knows very well.\"\nThe phone call, which lasted around an hour, primarily focused on the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Trump mentioned that Putin is well-versed in Iranian affairs and shared his concerns about the conflict.\nAlso Read | Israeli Drone Strikes Refinery in Iran's South Pars Gas Field, Iranian News Agencies Say.\n\"The call lasted approximately 1 hour. He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end, to which I explained, his war should also end,\" said Trump.\nTrump emphasised that the situation in the region is \"very alarming\" and urged Putin to end Russia's involvement in the Ukraine.\nTrump said he and Putin spent \"much less time\" talking about Russia's war in Ukraine during the approximately one-hour call. He said that topic \"will be for next week.\" The leaders also touched on a potential prisoner swap, with large numbers of prisoners being exchanged immediately from both sides.\n\"We talked at length. Much less time was spent talking about Russia/Ukraine, but that will be for next week. He is doing the planned prisoner swaps - large numbers of prisoners are being exchanged, immediately, from both sides,\" added Trump.\nAlthough the majority of the conversation centered around the Middle East, Trump did bring up the Ukraine conflict, stating that they would discuss it further the following week. Putin reportedly briefed Trump on his recent talks with Iranian and Israeli leaders, reiterating Russia's proposal for mutually acceptable solutions on the Iranian nuclear issue.\nThe conversation marks the fifth call between the two leaders since Trump took office and signalled a shift in US policy toward Russia, a significant departure from the stance held by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\nWhile Biden rallied international support to condemn Russia's 2022 invasion, Trump has cultivated a friendly relationship with Vladimir Putin, often praising the Russian leader's strategic thinking. Trump's stance has raised eyebrows, particularly his tendency to blame both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the ongoing war.\nTrump has criticised Zelenskyy's handling of the conflict, even labeling him a \"dictator\" due to postponed elections in Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed the call between Trump and Putin. He said, \"Vladimir Putin condemned Israel's military operation against Iran and expressed serious concern about a possible escalation of the conflict, which would have unpredictable consequences for the entire situation in the Middle East.\"\nAccording to Ushakov, Trump described events in the Middle East as \"very alarming.\" The two leaders also said they do not rule out a return to the negotiating track on Iran's nuclear program, Ushakov said.\nOn Friday, June 13 Israel launched a large-scale strike on Iranian territory, targeting nuclear sites, Iran launched three retaliatory waves of missiles at targets in Israel.\nProjectiles were seen in the skies above Jerusalem late Saturday as Iran and Israel launched another round of missiles at each other, according to CNN.\nIsrael has launched a wave of strikes targeting different areas of Iran, according to the Israeli military and Iranian media.\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson Effie Defrin said that the Israeli Air Force's (IAF) \"ongoing operation\" has lasted nearly 40 hours and targeted over 150 objectives.\n\"IAF aircraft are completing a wave of strikes against military and strategic assets, nuclear program sites, and high-ranking figures in Iran's terror leadership.

Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for their handling of the violent protests that erupted in Los Angeles last weekend. The 69-year-old actor previously denounced Newsom and Bass for their involvement in the Palisades and Eaton fires that devastated Southern California communities in January. The \"Braveheart\" star vented his frustration over the local government's response to the ongoing protests on Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo's \"Arroyo Grande\" podcast. \"Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass have already proven their incompetence and poor leadership during the Los Angeles wildfires,\" Gibson said.

Whether it's sheer incompetence or outright malevolence, the reality is stark. \"California's in a state of turmoil,\" Gibson added. \"And I ask my fellow Angelenos, ‘Why are Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass still in office? How much more of their destructive decision-making masquerading as leadership are we going to tolerate?’ \"It's time to take back our community and our state and put the power and the privilege in the hands of competent leaders whose goals are to protect us and the way of life this nation was founded upon and promises to offer.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Newsom and Bass for comment. WATCH: MEL GIBSON SLAMS CALIFORNIA LEADERSHIP AFTER ‘RAMPANT LAWLESSNESS AND CIVIL UNREST’ Gibson, who was appointed a special ambassador to Hollywood by President Donald Trump, lost his home in the Palisades Fire that broke out Jan. 7. In February, Gibson joined the Saving California movement in its efforts to recall Newsom. The \"Passion of the Christ\" director appeared at a press conference in Altadena Feb. 27. \"We deserve much more and much better, and there is absolutely no adequate excuse the governor or mayor can make for this gross mismanagement and failure to preemptively deal with what they knew was coming,\" Gibson said, referring to Newsom and Bass, according to KTLA. \"Was it incompetence? Was it indifference, complacency, carelessness? Was it negligence? Absolutely,\" Gibson added. The LA protests, which began as demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) June 6, escalated into street violence, rioting and theft last weekend. In response, Trump authorized the deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 7,000 U.S. Marines to the nation's second most populous city. Trump took control of California's National Guard without the permission of Newsom, the first time in 60 years a president had federalized National Guard troops without a governor's request. Newsom, leading the resistance to Trump's moves, took legal action to try and reverse the order. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support in the region. I will be clear-eyed in relation to our duties and obligations and my duties as Prime Minister.'\n\nAsked if the UK would help Israel stop the attacks, he replied: 'These are obviously operational decisions and the situation is ongoing and developing'.\n\nBritain already has fighter jets in the Middle East as part of an operation to counter threats in Iraq and Syria.\n\nSir Keir's announcement came as Iran and Israel continued to trade missiles and airstrikes yesterday, a day after Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a devastating air offensive aimed at smashing Tehran's nuclear weapons programme.\n\nIsraeli hit more than 400 targets in the past 24 hours as part of Operation Rising Lion, including dozens of missile sites and air defence systems in Tehran.\n\nThey killed more than 20 army and Revolutionary Guards commanders, including armed forces chief Mohammad Bagheri amd and intelligence chief Gholamreza Mehrabi. Tel Aviv also claimed nine nuclear scientists were among the dead.\n\nAnd around 60 people, including 20 children, were reportedly killed in an attack on a housing complex in Tehran, according to Iranian state TV.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian leader Vladimir Putin and US president Donald Trump discussed the hostilities in a 50-minute phone call, with Putin condemning the Israeli attacks.\n\nMr Netanyahu said the strikes had set back Iran's nuclear programme by years but he rejected international calls for restraint, saying attacks would intensify. \n\n'We will hit every site and every target of the Ayatollahs' regime, and what they have felt so far is nothing compared with what they will be handed in the coming days,' said the Israeli Prime Minister.\n\n'We have paved a path to Tehran. In the very near future, you will see Israeli planes, the Israeli air force, our pilots, over the skies of Tehran.'\n\nLast night, it was also reported that Ali Shamkhani, Iran's top adviser to its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, died in hospital a day after being wounded in the first night of Israeli airstrikes.\n\nShamkhani had previously served as Iran's top national security official for a decade and was seen as a rising star of Iranian diplomacy, having represented Iran in talks which sealed a landmark agreement to restore diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's military said: 'Since the beginning of the operation [on Friday], over 20 commanders in the Iranian regime's security apparatus have been eliminated.'\n\nThe targets also included Iran's Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, where Israel claimed nine senior scientists were killed. An Israeli official said it would take more than a few weeks for Iran to repair the damage at the two sites.\n\nIran later responded by saying only three of its scientists had been killed. They were named by Tasnim, the semi-official news agency, as Ali Bakaei Karimi, Mansour Asgari and Saeid Borji.\n\nAcross Israel, air raid sirens sent residents into shelters as waves of missiles streaked across the sky and interceptors rose to meet them. At least three people were killed overnight.\n\nAn Israeli official said Iran had fired around 200 ballistic missiles in four waves. The wounded included Croatia's consul in Israel and his wife, who suffered only minor injuries.\n\nDefence minister Israel Katz warned: 'The Iranian dictator [Ayatollah Khamenei] is taking the citizens of Iran hostage, bringing about a reality in which they, and especially Tehran's residents, will pay a heavy price for the flagrant harm inflicted upon Israel's citizens. If Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front, Tehran will burn'.\n\nMr Trump applauded Israel's strikes and warned that much worse was to come unless Iran quickly accepted the sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.\n\nMr Netanyahu sent effusive 79th birthday wishes to Mr Trump, saying: 'You've been an extraordinary leader, decisive, courageous, with a clear vision and clear action. You have done great things for Israel.'\n\nHe added that Israel was striking a blow for the free world, saying: 'Our enemy is your enemy and what we're doing, we're dealing with something that will threaten all of us sooner or later. Our victory will be your victory.'\n\nGulf Arab states that have long mistrusted Iran but fear coming under attack in any wider conflict have urged calm. Meanwhile, worries about disruption to the region's crucial oil exports caused the price of crude oil to soar.\n\nThose fears intensified yesterday when Iranian general Esmail Kosari said Iran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, the exit point for oil shipped from the Gulf.\n\nTehran insists its nuclear programme is entirely civilian in line with its obligations under a nuclear non-proliferation treaty and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. But, it has repeatedly hidden some parts from international inspectors, and on Thursday it was judged to be in violation of the treaty.\n\nSir Keir Starmer told reporters there would be 'intense discussions' about the Middle Eastern conflict at the annual G7 gathering of world leaders this week.He said he had had a 'good and constructive discussion' with Mr Netanyahu on Friday over the 'safety and security of Israel, as you would expect, between two allies'.\n\nMeanwhile Foreign Secretary David Lammy has spoken to his Iranian counterpart to urge calm.\n\nSir Keir said: 'We do have long-standing concerns about the nuclear programme Iran has.\n\n'We do recognise Israel's right to self-defence, but I'm absolutely clear that this needs to de-escalate. That's the primary focus.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer ordered the deployment of fast jets and refuelling aircraft from UK bases to bolster UK forces despite bloodcurdling warnings from Tehran not to meddle in the conflict.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14813357/Tehran-threatens-UK-Starmer-scrambles-RAF-Prime-Minister-sends-jets-Middle-East-war-rages-Iran-Israel-refuses-rule-British-action.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/15/00/99385011-0-image-m-72_1749944829415.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/14/3766545512500935092/1024x576_MP4_3766545512500935092.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:29:48","author":"Editor,Martin Beckford,Natalie Lisbona,Padraic Flanagan","authors":["Editor","Martin Beckford","Natalie Lisbona","Padraic Flanagan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":331487408,"title":"Anti-Trump 'No Kings' Protests Spread Across Nation: See The Pictures","text":"Multiple groups carried out demonstrations against President Donald Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, the most prominent of which was the \"No Kings\" protests that spread to many states.Several protests have already taken place against Trump or his administration's policies, especially in the aftermath of his decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles as some protests against his immigration policies turned violent in the city.Most of the protests in Los Angeles have been peaceful, but some have taken the opportunity to burn or vandalize property, loot, and throw projectiles at law enforcement. Trump responded to these incidents with his military deployments, but doing so against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, escalating the situation and tensions with the Democratic leaders.Similarly, the protests on Saturday have largely remained peaceful, with little interaction between law enforcement and protesters, but as the afternoon dragged on, tensions between Los Angeles and New York City started to rise and small clashes broke out.The protests will likely continue into the night.Los Angeles Remains Epicenter of ProtestsProtesters in Los Angeles have remained largely peaceful but the city remains under immense tension as the National Guard and Marines maintain their deployments in the city.Trump scored a temporary legal win thanks to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which issued an injunction against an initial ruling for the White House to return control of the National Guard to California, pending a final ruling after arguments on Tuesday.But the Los Angeles protests took a turn as police tried to disperse protesters near federal buildings by launching tear gas into the crowds.Small Clashes in New York CityOutside of Los Angeles, New York City has seen the most tension between law enforcement and protesters, with some individuals arrested.Puerto Rico Takes To the StreetIn an unusual move, Puerto Rico took part in national U.S. protests, demonstrating against Trump and his policies, taking to the streets of San Juan to express their discontent about the president's immigration policies.Many of the biggest protests have taken place in U.S. cities with heavy Hispanic populations, where concern about deportation is most acute.Austin, Texas Festive In ProtestThe Texas capital displayed an on-brand and creative protest, with drag queen performances and poetry slams while demonstrators took to the parks in scenes reminiscent of hippies in the 1970s protesting the Vietnam War.Philadelphia, Birthplace of American DemocracyPhiladelphia, where the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence and wrote the United States Constitution, protesters listened to a series of speakers who urged the need to remember the roots of the nation.","summary":"The \"No Kings\" protests have taken aim at President Donald Trump's policies, particularly his decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/anti-trump-no-kings-protests-spread-nation-see-pictures-2085624","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2663292/los-angeles-no-kings-protest.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:29:17","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.093},{"id":331487396,"title":"Bella Hadid shows off her cowgirl skills with boyfriend as she ditches world of fashion for new Texas life","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Jun 15th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIran launches fresh barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel amid all-out war in the Middle East as IDF strikes oil and gas sites after vowing 'Tehran will burn'\n\nPolice searching for former appointee of Tim Walz in connection with fatal shootings in Minnesota, according to reports\n\nBritish Air India crash survivor reveals how he 'just walked out' out of burning plane moments before it EXPLODED - as he admits it's a 'miracle' he escaped with 'minor injuries'\n\nDonald Trump and Melania arrive at military parade as crowd sings president 'happy birthday'\n\n'Only Dave and I knew how much pain he was hiding as he filmed Hairy Bikers one last time...'

Checklick Jr., 21, drove his SUV through a dispersing crowd in a parking lot, which led to him 'striking at least one person with his vehicle,' police said in a statement.\n\nThe protest took place throughout Saturday afternoon in Culpeper, a small town roughly 70 miles from Washington, D.C. \n\nPresident Donald Trump's birthday military parade was just starting when the incident occurred.\n\nAs of 3:45pm, the Culpeper Police Department said no injuries had been reported as a result of Checklick's alleged attack.\n\nThe person who was struck by his vehicle also hasn't been identified.\n\nAs of now, Checklick has been charged with reckless driving, which is merely a class 1 misdemeanor under Virginia state law. This kind of crime comes with no jail time and a mandatory minimum fine of $250.\n\nChecklick could face more charges in the future, as the investigation is active and ongoing, police said. He is being held without bond at the Culpeper County Jail.\n\nCulpeper Democrats posted on Facebook, thanking Culpeper Police Department for their 'quick response and for keeping our protest safe.'\n\nThe Culpeper Police Department told DailyMail.com that it asking anyone who has information or witnessed the incident at the protest to contact Detective Payne or email the department at tips@culpeperva.gov.\n\nBecause the investigation is still in its early stages, a police spokesperson said 'we aren’t releasing any information regarding potential or alleged motives for Mr. Checklick Jr’s actions.' \n\nSocial media reports showed large crowds at the 'No Kings Day' protest in Culpeper, with organizers claiming that more than 600 people showed up.\n\nAcross the country, there have been some 2,000 'No Kings Day' protests, with attendees pushing back against what they describe as Trump's march toward authoritarianism on issues such as immigration enforcement, civil rights and cuts to the federal government through DOGE.\n\nIt's unclear what Checklick's possible motives were, but Saturday hasn't been a day lacking in political violence.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning, a gunman entered the residence of Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife early Saturday, shooting both and leaving them critically injured.\n\nHe then proceeded to the home of former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, where she and her husband were fatally shot. \n\nVance Luther Boelter, 57, who was appointed by Governor Tim Walz in 2019 to serve a four-year stint on the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, has been identified as the suspect in the quadruple shooting.\n\nThe first shooting occurred just after 2am at Hoffman's home in Champlin, about 20 miles from Minneapolis. Hoffman and his wife were shot multiple times, KSTP reported. \n\nThe second attack took place at around 4am at Hortman's Brooklyn Park residence, eight miles south. After that shooting, police engaged the suspect in a gunfight on the street, officials said. \n\nDrew Evans, head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, confirmed that the suspect escaped during the exchange and remains at large.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Boelter stands at 6-foot-1, weighs roughly 220 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes.\n\nHe was last seen on Saturday morning in Minneapolis, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, a dark long-sleeve shirt, and light pants.\n\nAuthorities have urged residents not to approach Boelter if they see him. He is considered 'armed and dangerous.","summary":"A man who police say intentionally drove into a crowd of protestors at a 'No Kings Day' rally in Virginia has been arrested and charged. Joseph R.

But they were one of dozens of social media users across platforms who began circulating instructions in recent days for how to reserve tickets to the rally, even if you had no intention of attending it.\n\nOn Saturday evening, amidst rain and a threat of thunderstorms, the crowds for Trump’s parade appeared to be modest. (It is notoriously difficult to accurately assess crowd size, especially during the middle of an event.) On social media, though, users were gleeful, taking credit — as they did in a similar incident in 2020 — for impacting the rally’s attendance. “We’re preparing for an enormous turnout — hundreds of thousands of attendees,” Matt McCool, the special agent-in-charge for the U.S. Secret Service’s Washington, D.C., field office, said at a security briefing on Monday.\n\n“I got 10 tickets here in Australia. Whoops, my bad, won’t be there,” wrote one. Said another, “We Europeans couldn’t use our tickets here. Solidarity from Scotland!”\n\nIn 2020, at the height of Trump’s first (and failed) reelection campaign, he kicked off a rally tour with a large event planned for Juneteenth in Tulsa. Users across social media — including, notably, kpop stans, who command a large and organized following online — implored their followers to get involved, reserving tickets to the rally with the intent of leaving the stadium open and the president high and dry. When the president did, in fact, speak to a half-empty stadium in his comeback rally, online teens claimed credit for the paltry crowd (although COVID surges in a pre-vaccine era might have done as much or more to explain it).\n\nNow, social media denizens are claiming credit again for a muted response to Trump’s heavily publicized birthday party and military parade.\n\nThis incident comes at a particularly tricky moment for social media companies, and for TikTok especially, which is only online today because President Trump has chosen not to enforce a binding law that would ban it from the United States unless its parent company, ByteDance, sells it to a non-Chinese company.\n\nForbesEXCLUSIVE: TikTok Spied On Forbes JournalistsBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesThe FBI And DOJ Are Investigating ByteDance’s Use Of TikTok To Spy On JournalistsBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesTikTok Creators’ Financial Info, Social Security Numbers Have Been Stored In ChinaBy Alexandra S.

Tim Walz said House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were shot and killed early Saturday in what he called a \"politically motivated assassination.\"\n\nMinnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were also both shot multiple times, Walz said, adding that they were out of surgery and he was \"cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt.\"\n\n\"This was an act of targeted political violence,\" Walz said. \"Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don't settle our differences at violence or at gunpoint.\"\n\nReferring to Hortman, Walz said he had lost a friend and Minnesota had \"lost a great leader.\"\n\n\"She was a formidable public servant, a fixture and a giant in Minnesota,\" Walz said. \"She woke up every day determined to make this state a better place. She is irreplaceable and will be missed by so many.\"\n\nWalz said Minnesota has \"the most closely divided state Legislature in the country\" but has navigated through politically charged times and found agreements through compromise and civil discourse.\n\nMinnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said a call reporting the shooting at the Hoffman residence in Champlin came at around 2 a.m. and a call regarding the shootings at the Hortman residence in Brooklyn Park occurred at about 3:35 a.m. Two officers checking on the Hortman residence encountered an individual who shot at them and \"was able to escape during that exchange of gunfire,\" he said.\n\nOfficers at the Hortman home found an individual who \"was clearly impersonating a police officer,\" Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said at Saturday's press conference.\n\n\"They noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the lights, the emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house,\" Bruley said. \"When our officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire and the suspect retreated back into the home.\" He fled on foot out of the back of the house, Bruley said.\n\nDuring a search of the suspect's vehicle, officials found a \"manifesto,\" Bruley said, \"that identified many lawmakers and other officials.\" Authorities immediately issued alerts and provided security, he said.\n\nAt a later press conference, Evans said authorities were looking for Vance Boelter, 57, as a \"person of interest.\"\n\nIn statements released while authorities hunted for the shooter, top Massachusetts elected officials expressed a combination of shock, sadness and outrage over the shootings and said their thoughts are with the victims and their families.\n\n\"Political violence of any kind has no place in America, nor does the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that can often incite that violence,\" House Speaker Ron Mariano said. \"This is not the America that we want for ourselves and for future generations. We must all strive for something better.”\n\nGov. Maura Healey said she was \"horrified to hear about the shootings in Minnesota.\"\n\n\"Lawmakers and their loved ones getting shot for their beliefs is yet another sickening act of political violence in a country where it’s become all too common,\" Healey said. \"This is not normal. It is not who we are as Americans, and we must all condemn political violence in the strongest possible terms.”\n\nIn July, Healey condemned the attempted assassination of Donald Trump at a presidential campaign rally.\n\n\"Horrifying, horrifying. You don't want to see violence in any form anywhere, and you don't want to see violence when it comes to a political rally or political violence,\" Healey said in July. \"It's important that everybody across the board — all Americans, Democrat, Republican, anything and everything in between — denounce political violence in all its forms. There's no place for it — there's no tolerance for it in this country.\"\n\nReacting to the Minnesota shootings, Senate President Karen Spilka: \"This is political violence, pure and simple, and must be condemned in the strongest possible terms by every leader in this country. America’s founders envisioned a country where we address our differences through debate, not violence. We must continue to use our voices to keep advocating for the country we dream to be, even as acts of political violence seem more common.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr said he was \"united with those across the country who refuse to allow fear or violence to silence the voices of public servants or the people they represent.”\n\n\"These senseless and appalling attacks are a direct affront to the principles of democracy and civil society,\" Tarr said. \"When violence enters our public life – whether in the streets, online or behind closed doors – it undermines the very fabric of our shared civic trust.\"","summary":"Top lawmakers in Massachusetts expressed outrage Saturday over the shootings of two state legislators and their spouses in Minnesota, which officials in that state described as acts of political violence.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/state/massachusetts-officials-condemn-attacks-on-minnesota-lawmakers/article_e2897e4a-7bd4-4659-9edb-04bd14197fed.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/dc/ddc8fad1-f08d-485f-8a02-db0cc1578ac2/684e12ef52206.image.jpg?crop=1024%2C538%2C0%2C46","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:20:00","author":"By Michael P.

This will be the Prime Minister’s first foreign visit after Operation Sindoor. \n\nBefore participating in the G7 Summit on Monday, PM Modi will visit Cyprus, the first by an Indian Prime Minister in more than two decades, and will also travel to Croatia, marking the first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister.\n\nThe Prime Minister will pay an official visit to Cyprus, Canada and Croatia from June 15 to 19, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Saturday.\n\n“At the invitation of the President of Cyprus, Nikos Christodoulides, PM Modi will pay an official visit to Cyprus on June 15 to 16.

On June 6, PM Modi received a call from Canadian PM Carney inviting him for the summit.\n\nWhile PM Modi will have a meeting with his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney, his other bilateral engagements are still being worked out, official sources said. \n\nPM Modi will also come face to face with US President Donald Trump for the first time since their meeting in February this year.\n\nThe visit to Cyprus is significant also as it comes in the middle of India’s tensions with Turkey over the latter’s support to Pakistan. \n\nAnkara’s recognition of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the northern region that was seized by Turkish forces in 1974 and differences over gas exploration rights in the Eastern Mediterranean remain a constant source of tensions between Turkey and Cyprus.\n\nPM Modi is expected to reach Canada on June 16, a day after the opening of the G7 Summit.\n\nThis would be PM Modi’s sixth consecutive participation in the G7 Summit. \n\n“At the summit, the PM will exchange views with leaders of G7 countries, other invited outreach countries and heads of international organisations on crucial global issues, including energy security, technology and innovation, particularly the AI-energy nexus and Quantum-related issues,” said the government in its announcement.\n\nFor the final leg of his tour, PM Modi will undertake an official visit to Croatia on June 18.\n\nThis will be the first ever visit by an Indian PM to Croatia, marking an important milestone in the bilateral relationship. \n\n“The visit to Croatia will also underscore India’s commitment to further strengthening its engagement with partners in the European Union,” said the government.","summary":"New Delhi, June 15 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi will commence the first leg of his three-nation tour from Cyprus on Sunday before participating in the G7 Summit in Canada&#8230; Continue reading PM Modi to begin 3-nation tour from Cyprus today, 1st foreign visit post Operation Sindoor\n\n\nThe post PM Modi to begin 3-nation tour from Cyprus today, 1st foreign visit post Operation Sindoor first appeared on Australia India News.","url":"https://indianews.com.au/pm-modi-to-begin-3-nation-tour-from-cyprus-today-1st-foreign-visit-post-operation-sindoor/","image":"https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202506153428453.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:19:52","author":"India News Newsdesk","authors":["India News Newsdesk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.25},{"id":331485958,"title":"Photos show the US Army's 250th anniversary parade held on Trump's birthday","text":"President Donald Trump has long expressed interest in holding a military parade.

(AP pic)WASHINGTON: Tens of thousands of Americans protested president Donald Trump at rallies and marches in major cities from New York to Los Angeles yesterday, a day marred by the assassination of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota and conflict in the Middle East.The protests marked the largest outpouring of opposition to Trump’s presidency since he returned to power in January, and came the same day that thousands of military personnel, vehicles and aircraft will march through and fly over Washington, DC, in a parade celebrating the US army’s 250th anniversary.Yesterday was also Trump’s 79th birthday.National guard troops and US marines are also in Los Angeles, having been ordered there by Trump to secure the heavily Democratic city amid protests over his immigration policies – a deployment that California governor Gavin Newsom has challenged in court.Meanwhile, Israel yesterday pounded Iran with a second barrage of strikes in a bid to destroy its nuclear programme after Iran retaliated with strikes the evening before, stoking fears of a mushrooming conflict between the two nations.Anti-Trump groups planned nearly 2,000 demonstrations across the country to coincide with the parade.Many are taking place under the theme “No Kings”, asserting that no individual is above the law.All planned “No Kings” protests in Minnesota were cancelled following what Democratic Minnesota governor Tim Walz said was the “politically motivated assassination” of one Democratic lawmaker and wounding of a second.Authorities in Minnesota said that flyers promoting the protests were found in the suspected gunman’s car.A massive manhunt was underway.Trump condemned the shootings, saying in a social media post: “Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.”The Texas department of public safety said in a statement it had identified a credible threat against state lawmakers planning to attend a protest yesterday, and had evacuated the state capitol and its grounds.People in Washington for the parade encountered a massive security presence, with some 30km of 2.4m-high black fencing, much of it reinforced with concrete traffic barriers, cordoning off streets and surrounding landmarks including the Washington Monument.The celebrations will cost the US army between US$25 million and US$45 million, US officials have told Reuters.That includes the parade itself as well as the cost of moving equipment and housing and feeding the troops.Critics have called the parade an authoritarian display of power that is wasteful, especially given Trump has said he wants to slash costs throughout the federal government.‘Disgusting display’US President Donald Trump turned 79 yesterday.

We say, ‘hell no.'”Rare spectacleMilitary parades in the US are rare.Other countries usually stage them to celebrate victories in battle or showcase military might.In 1991, tanks and thousands of troops paraded through Washington to celebrate the ousting of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in the Gulf War.Thousands of agents, officers and specialists will be deployed from law enforcement agencies from across the country and drones operated by the secret service will keep watch overhead.The US army has brought nearly 7,000 troops into Washington, along with 150 vehicles, including more than 25 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker armoured vehicles, four Paladin self-propelled artillery vehicles, and artillery pieces including the M777 and M119.The flyover will include Apache and Black Hawk helicopters along with Chinooks.Older aircraft like the World War II-era B-25 bomber and P-51 Mustang will also take part.","summary":"The protests mark the largest outpouring of opposition to his presidency since he returned to power in January.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/06/15/tens-of-thousands-of-americans-rally-ahead-of-trumps-military-parade/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/313962f2-no-kings-protest-ap-150625.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:15:28","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":331487268,"title":"White House slams 'utter failure' of anti-Trump protests as America celebrates Army's historic milestone","text":"White House communications director Steven Cheung addressed the nationwide \"No Kings\" protests on Saturday, describing them as \"a complete and utter failure with minuscule attendance.\" Thousands of planned protests, which remained peaceful as the Army’s 250th anniversary parade commenced, followed a week of violent anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles and other cities.

on the so-called Squad minilateral grouping of nations aimed at countering China’s influence in the Asia-Pacific, after US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the bloc as the most “strategically positioned to manifest deterrence”.\nObservers, however, are mixed on such a stance, pointing to Washington’s transactional approach and seemingly erratic policy shifts under President Donald Trump, warning there may be “little appetite” in focusing on the group.\nAt last month’s major security conference, the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, the defence chiefs of countries comprising the Squad – Australia, Japan, the Philippines and the United States – met to discuss countering China’s military assertiveness.\nIn his summit opening remarks, Hegseth underscored the Squad’s potential to “bring about peace” amid “an unprecedented military build-up by China.” In a joint statement following the forum, the defence chiefs expressed concerns about Beijing’s actions in the East and South China Seas.\nBefore forming last year, security chiefs from the future Squad members met for the first time in June 2023 on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, amid ongoing naval skirmishes between China and the Philippines.\nTheir defence forces have also conducted joint maritime activities in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.\n\nStill informal\nUnder the Trump administration, which focuses on defence and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region, the Squad may be “emerging as a priority” for Washington, according to Lucas Myers, research affiliate at the Sigur Centre for Asian Studies at the George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.\n“[As] the Squad is openly security-oriented and clearly intended to counter China in the first island chain, it is likely that [Washington] will elevate the Squad as its preferred minilateral [relationship] in the Indo-Pacific,” Myers said.\nThe first island-chain refers to the chain of islands including Japan, Taiwan, portions of the Philippines, and Indonesia.\nIn his address at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Hegseth urged Asian countries to increase their military spending to bolster deterrence against China, while reaffirming commitments to boost Washington’s presence in the region.\n“To be clear, this does not necessarily mean de-emphasising the Quad, rather that the Squad will receive additional attention,” Myers noted, referring to the partnership comprising Australia, India, Japan, and the US.\nAlthough Washington still values the Quad, Myers said that its focus has shifted from security to providing public goods like vaccines, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies.\nRushali Saha, a security risk analyst with Horizon Intelligence, a Belgium-based threat intelligence firm, said the US had “little appetite” to revive the Squad given Trump’s “transactional approach, public disdain for multilateralism and erratic policy shifts”.\n\nHegseth’s comments were intended to offer reassurance of Washington’s commitment to regional security, she said, noting that the Squad would remain as one of several regional partnerships America had forged to counter China.\nThis year’s Squad meeting took place on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, unlike the previous meeting last May, which former US defence secretary Lloyd Austin hosted in Hawaii, the location of the US Indo-Pacific Command headquarters.\n“This indicates that the grouping still remains informal, showing no indication towards institutionalisation,” Saha said, adding that the Squad was largely driven by the US and so far Southeast Asia had not emerged as a focal point of Trump’s foreign policy.\nRommel Jude Ong, professor at the Ateneo School of Government, said that Manila needed to collaborate with the US and other strategic partners to counter Beijing’s maritime ambitions and “coercive activities” in the South China Sea.\n“For the US, it needs the help of the region’s middle powers to compensate for the shortfall in US naval capabilities available in the Indo-Pacific,” Ong said, who is also a retired rear admiral of the Philippine Navy.\nPooja Bhatt, associate professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs, said the US needed allies that acted as a “military force multiplier” in the region.\n“As China’s military aggression in the region would increase, it would provide enough reasons for the Squad to collectively work and act together,” she added.\nIn March, the Philippines’ Armed Forces chief, General Romeo Brawner, announced during the Raisina Dialogue security forum in New Delhi of the Squad’s intent to include India and South Korea.\nDescribing Brawner’s call for expansion “premature”, Ong said Seoul and New Delhi were unlikely to engage in any serious military commitments in the South China Sea due to strategic concerns in their respective regions.\n“For the Philippines though, both countries are critical partners in defence logistics, being principal sources of weapons systems critical to its military modernisation programme,” Ong said.\nGiven the different comfort levels and comparative advantages of India and the Philippines, the Quad and Squad play different but complementary roles\nLucas Myers, analyst\nMyers said India had always been careful not to completely align with the US and its treaty allies, especially on security affairs, due to New Delhi’s long-standing non-aligned foreign policy and “unwillingness to unnecessarily antagonise China”.\nSouth Korea had always been less willing to counter China than Japan or other US regional allies, even under its more conservative governments, Myers said, instead opting to forge a middle path between the US and China.\n“Given the different comfort levels and comparative advantages of India and the Philippines, the Quad and Squad play different but complementary roles,” Myers said.\nSaha said India would be selective about where it challenges Beijing openly, likely focusing on the Indian Ocean rather than the South China Sea, at least in the near future.\nFollowing last month’s clashes between India and Pakistan and what New Delhi perceives as a lack of support from the global community, especially Washington, it will be reluctant to be part of any initiative that resembles a US-dominated military alliance, Saha added.\n“We can expect more India-Philippines cooperation, but at the bilateral level, rather than at a multilateral level.”","summary":"The spotlight is back on the so-called Squad minilateral grouping of nations

Gunmen who killed 11 worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, 23 shoppers at a heavily Latino Walmart in El Paso in 2019 and 10 Black people at a Buffalo grocery store in 2022 each cited the conspiracy theory that a secret cabal of Jews were trying to replace white people with people of color. That has become a staple on parts of the right that support Trump’s push to limit immigration.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League found that from 2022 through 2024, all of the 61 political killings in the United States were committed by right-wing extremists. That changed on the first day of 2025, when a Texas man flying the flag of the Islamic State group killed 14 people by driving his truck through a crowded New Orleans street before being fatally shot by police.\n\n“You’re seeing acts of violence from all different ideologies,” said Jacob Ware, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who researches terrorism. “It feels more random and chaotic and more frequent.”\n\nThe United States has a long and grim history of political violence, from presidential assassinations dating back to the killing of President Abraham Lincoln to lynchings and violence aimed at Black people in the South to the 1954 shooting inside Congress by four Puerto Rican nationalists. Experts say the past few years, however, have likely reached a level not seen since the tumultuous days of the 1960s and 1970s, when icons like Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated.\n\nWare noted that the most recent surge comes after the new Trump administration has shuttered units that focus on investigating white supremacist extremism and pushed federal law enforcement to spend less time on anti-terrorism and more on detaining people who are in the country illegally.\n\n“We’re at the point, after these six weeks, where we have to ask about how effectively the Trump administration is combating terrorism,” Ware said.\n\nOf course, one of Trump’s first acts in office was to pardon those involved in the largest act of domestic political violence this century — the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, intended to prevent Congress from certifying Trump’s 2020 election loss.\n\nThose pardons broadcast a signal to would-be extremists on either side of the political debate, Dallek said: “They sent a very strong message that violence, as long as you’re a Trump supporter, will be permitted and may be rewarded.”\n\nIdeologies aren’t always aligned — or coherent\n\nOften, those who engage in political violence don’t have clearly defined ideologies that easily map onto the country’s partisan divides. A man who died after he detonated a car bomb outside a Palm Springs fertility clinic last month left writings urging people not to procreate and expressed what the FBI called “nihilistic ideations.”\n\nBut, like clockwork, each political attack seems to inspire partisans to find evidence the attacker is on the other side. Little was known about the man police identified as a suspect in the Minnesota attacks, 57-year-old Vance Boelter. Authorities say they found a list of other apparent targets that included other Democratic officials, abortion clinics and abortion rights advocates, as well as fliers for the day’s anti-Trump parades.\n\nConservatives online seized on the fliers — and the fact that Boetler had apparently once been appointed to a state workforce development board by Democratic Gov.

Right-wing figures theorized the assailant was a secret lover rather than what authorities said he was: a believer in pro-Trump conspiracy theories who broke into the Pelosi home echoing Jan. 6 rioters who broke into the Capitol by saying: “Where is Nancy?!”\n\nOn Saturday, Nancy Pelosi posted a statement on X decrying the Minnesota attack. “All of us must remember that it’s not only the act of violence, but also the reaction to it, that can normalize it,” she wrote.\n\nTrump had mocked the Pelosis after the 2022 attack, but on Saturday he joined in the official bipartisan condemnation of the Minnesota shootings, calling them “horrific violence.” The president has, however, consistently broken new ground with his bellicose rhetoric towards his political opponents, who he routinely calls “sick” and “evil,” and has talked repeatedly about how violence is needed to quell protests.\n\nThe Minnesota attack occurred after Trump took the extraordinary step of mobilizing the military to try to control protests against his administration’s immigration operations in Los Angeles during the past week, when he pledged to “HIT” disrespectful protesters and warned of a “migrant invasion” of the city. \n\nDallek said Trump has been “both a victim and an accelerant” of the charged, dehumanizing political rhetoric that is flooding the country.\n\n“It feels as if the extremists are in the saddle,” he said, “and the extremists are the ones driving our rhetoric and politics.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe murder of a Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her spouse, along&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Political Violence: A Recurring Theme in Recent US History with Diverse Motives and Justifications first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/political-violence-a-recurring-theme-in-recent-us-history-with-diverse-motives-and-justifications/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Political-violence-is-threaded-through-recent-US-history-The-motives.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:07:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.083},{"id":331490178,"title":"Democrat Eric Swalwell Claims Trump Is 'America's Hitler'","text":"Rep.

His big, beautiful age is a reminder that he is the oldest president in history to have taken office for his second tenure. So it’s double the celebration for the MAGA supporters as it’s Trump’s birthday as well as the 250th US Army birthday. Turning 79, Trump has broken the record for the oldest president yet.\n\nWhen he took the presidential position for the second time in 2025, he was older than his predecessor. Biden was 78 and 2 months at that time. On the other hand, the president was seven months senior than him. During his first time as the president. He was seventy in 2017. Even during that tenure he was the oldest leader of that time. Trump’s born in 1946 and takes the cake for the oldest president in both his terms.\n\nLet’s rank the oldest presidents:\nDonald Trump (2nd term): 78 years, 7 months\nJoe Biden: 78 years, 2 months\nDonald Trump (1st term): 70 years, 7 months\nRonald Reagan: 69 years, 11 months\nWilliam Henry Harrison: 68 years, 23 days\n\nTrump’s birthday was all about the great celebration featuring tanks, aircraft and soldiers for the military parade. The budget for this parade is supposed to be between 25-45 million USD. People online aren’t much impressed by this and mocking him for throwing himself a multi million dollar birthday parade.\n\nSeveral people have scheduled protests for Mr. President’s birthday. They are planning to have a peaceful protest. Over 2000 protesters are expected to be seen in rallies in an attempt to show their dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. The same-day celebration for Pope Leo is also scheduled in his hometown, Chicago. His video message will be played at the celebration as he won’t be able to come to address the people.\n\nHappy Birthday President Trump? Maybe not so happy…\nAttendance is predicted to be low for Donald’s fascist parade.\nTrump bragged “We have the greatest weapons in the world and we’re going to celebrate it.” Um, no, we’re good.\nHotel bookings point to low turnout 😱 pic.twitter.com/4bT2FpQfR4\n— Make it Stop – Liberty and Justice for All 💙 (@mcarr2021) June 14, 2025\n\nSo, Trump’s birthday will be quite eventful for everyone. Turning 79 is a milestone age for him, but it comes with backlash if he’s fit to be the president. Oftentimes, his cognitive decline due to age has been a topic of significant discussion. He slurs speeches, including his own name. Moreover, he has to be herded from the stage or is often clueless in public. Recently, he was also seen slipping while climbing the airplane stairs. Many people are questioning his motor skills, too.\n\nTrump trips walking up the steps to Air Force one…\nWhere are you MAGA👀@esaagar @krystalball @BreakingPointsN pic.twitter.com/OWMMvIjoBw\n— The Devils Advocate 😈 🔴 ⚫️ (@TheAdvocate410) June 8, 2025\n\nHis gait has changed according to the expert as now he has an old people stance when he stands and walks. Leaders who are older often suffer from public flack considering decline in health. However, Trump passed his mental and physical checkup as declared by the White House. He was deemed fit to work. He even took a cognitive test which other presidents have not before. So he claimed to have performed better than everyone else.","summary":"Trump is the oldest president yet to take the role at 78 years and 7 months.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-age-raises-eyebrows-netizens-ask-how-old-is-too-old-to-lead","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-turns-79.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:04:10","author":"Diksha,Gage Skidmore/flickr","authors":["Diksha","Gage Skidmore/flickr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.364},{"id":331487660,"title":"Texas Representatives at Anti-Trump Rally Cautioned About ‘Credible Threats’","text":"The Texas Department of Public Safety alerted on Saturday of ‘credible threats’ targeting state legislators and staff intending to participate in an anti-Trump demonstration at the Capitol in Austin.\n\nThis comes hours after two Democratic Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses were shot by a former appointee of the state’s governor, Tim Walz.\n\nThe DPS alert was sent out just before 1pm on Saturday, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune.\n\nAustin’s ‘No Kings Day’ march was slated to kick off at 5 pm, and about 30 minutes prior, Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair and state Representative Gene Wu confirmed that the event would proceed as planned, in spite of the threats.\n\n‘We have every indication from the Austin No Kings organizers and Hands Off Central TX that our demonstration will continue,’ Wu said in a statement.\n\nHe stated, ‘We are actively communicating with public safety officers, as well as state and local authorities, to ensure that everyone can exercise their First Amendment rights free from fear, intimidation, or violence.’\n\nAnd ten minutes before 5pm, a man was arrested in connection to the threats made this afternoon, a spokesperson with Texas DPS told DailyMail.com\n\nA state trooper with DPS arrested the man in La Grange, a city 65 miles southeast of Austin.\n\nThe spokesperson said there is no longer an active threat against the Austin protest, which is one of more than 2,000 ‘No King Day’ events across the country on Saturday meant to protest President Donald Trump’s actions in his second term.\n\nOfficials scheduled to speak at the Capitol protest include Democratic US Reps. Greg Casar and Lloyd Dogfgett; Democratic state Reps. Lulu Flores and John Bucy III; and Democratic state Sen.

Hoffman and his wife were shot multiple times, KSTP reported. \n\nThe second attack took place at around 4am at Hortman’s Brooklyn Park residence, eight miles south. After that shooting, police engaged the suspect in a gunfight on the street, officials said. \n\nDrew Evans, head of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, confirmed that the suspect escaped during the exchange and remains at large.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Boelter stands at 6-foot-1, weighs roughly 220 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes.\n\nHe was last seen on Saturday morning in Minneapolis, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, a dark long-sleeve shirt, and light pants.\n\nAuthorities have urged residents not to approach Boelter if they see him.

The protests were organized in defiance of Trump’s military parade for the Army’s 250th anniversary which, coincidentally, marked the president’s 79th birthday.\n\nSome 1,000 protesters marched toward Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach with “No Kings” banners, while Los Angeles saw more than 20,000 demonstrators march on the city following a week of unrest over the Trump administration’s anti-immigration agenda. \n\nProtests were largely peaceful with few arrests nationwide and rallies were winding down by late afternoon, but there were reported clashes with police in pockets of the country and several acts of violence apparently targeting demonstrators.\n\nTensions escalated in downtown LA late afternoon as police sought to disperse demonstrators by using flash bangs and canisters of tear gas. Protesters responded with loud fireworks and calls to “hold the line.”\n\nIn San Francisco, a driver struck four protesters in what police are investigating as “a possible act of intent.” Another driver in Culpeper, Virginia “intentionally” drove into a crowd of protesters, according to police.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Texas evacuated the state capitol in Austin after “credible threat” to lawmakers who planned to attend today’s protests.\n\nThe protests followed early morning news of what officials are calling a “politically motivated assassination” in Minnesota, where police have launched a manhunt for Vance Boelter, who is suspected of gunning down state Senator Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.\n\nMore than 1,000 people marched towards Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach but were blocked off by police with riot shields.\n\nProtesters were stopped roughly 300 yards from Trump’s Florida home and met by dozens of state and local police who formed a line to block the group from getting too close to the property.\n\nA “handful” of Trump supporters were also there but the march was reportedly peaceful. Protesters turned back to West Palm Beach after being stopped by police.\n\nIn Ocala, three people were arrested after a dispute broke out between a protester and a counter-protester.\n\nIn DeKalb County, Georgia, at least eight people were arrested as officers fired tear gas on demonstrators at a nearby protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nPolice in riot gear were seen using tear gas on anti-ICE protesters who ran away and climbed over shrubs to escape. DeKalb County Police reportedly gave the crowd 15 minutes to disperse. Protest organizers urged people back onto the sidewalk.\n\nAt least eight people were taken into custody.\n\n“The right to protest is fundamental and respected in DeKalb County,” the county’s CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson said in a statement. “But when a protest shifts from peaceful and law-abiding to one that threatens public safety and disregards lawful orders, I trust our officers to respond appropriately. Our duty is to protect both the rights of individuals and the wellbeing of the broader community.”\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nAt the “No Kings” flagship protest, the Philadelphia Police Department police said 80,000 people descended on the city. There were no arrests.\n\nMarchers shouted “Whose streets? Our streets!” as they approached the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they listened to speakers on the steps made famous in the movie Rocky.\n\n“So what do you say, Philly?” Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. “Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?”\n\nThe whole crowd joined in a chant of “No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here” in response to speaker Lorella Praeli, co-president of the Community Change organization.\n\nRaskin addressed Trump and said: “You are not our king and we are not your subjects.”\n\nMartin Luther King Jr’s eldest son also spoke at the rally.\n\n“We still believe in a nation without kings, without tyrants, without rulers who place themselves above the law,” Martin Luther King III told the crowd. “We are here to say this land belongs to the people, not to the monarchs, not to the autocrats, not to strong men, but to the people. You.”\n\nLos Angeles & San Francisco\n\nThere were worrying scenes in San Francisco when a motorist reportedly hit four protesters and fled, law enforcement officials told The Independent.\n\nThe driver was detained and police are investigating the incident “as a possible intentional act,” law enforcement sources told NBC News.\n\nOne man was taken to a nearby hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that it happened. We definitely put a lot of safety methods for our marches in place,” said Andy Sheehan of Indivisible SF. “We’re very happy that the person is OK and that the law is talking to the person driving.”\n\nAnd after a week of unrest in LA following last weekend’s protests against ICE raids and ramped-up immigration arrests, Mayor Karen Bass urged protesters to keep the peace at Saturday’s demo.\n\nMore than 20,000 people marched through the city, where demonstrators deployed a giant Constitution, and protests were largely peaceful.\n\nBut scenes turned angrier later in the day as police appeared to deploy riot-control weapons, including rubber bullets and tear gas, against a large crowd of protesters.\n\nA dispersal order was issued for a crowd outside a federal building complex as photos from the scene showed protesters fleeing officers.\n\nNew Yorkers showed up by the tens of thousands despite persistent drizzle, packing Fifth Avenue from 42nd Street to Madison Square Park, and then spilling into side streets and neighboring Broadway.\n\nOrganizers estimated 75,000 were in attendance.\n\nA diverse crowd ranged in age from children in strollers to seniors, and the mood was upbeat.\n\nSigns, placards and even costumes covered a multitude of frustrations, complaints and anger toward the Trump administration, including furious denouncements of ICE, the president’s parade in Washington, D.C., and the work of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nOthers focused on the trampling of checks and balances in government, fears over a rise of authoritarianism, and — the central focus of the day — that America was founded through a revolution against the rule of a king. Police stood back along the route, many sheltering from the rain in doorways and storefronts.\n\nVolunteers marshaled demonstrators off Fifth Avenue at 26th Street, the official end of the march, and small groups assembled nearby to continue the protest, waving wet placards and flags and chanting: “Donald Trump must go!”\n\nAdditional reporting by Io Dodds in San Francisco and Oliver O’Connell in New York","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/san-fran-mar-lago-anger-223200257.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/9c9fe7b37b29c40725c3bedbbabc564c","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 00:01:04","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":331485066,"title":"Tesla's market share in Ireland diminishes","text":"The CSO’s data for January to May show that 1,076 new Teslas were licenced for the first time in Ireland in that period. \n\nThis compared to 1,080 Teslas licenced in the first five months of 2024.\n\nHowever, while this was a slight drop, it comes as sales of EVs have risen considerably again after nosediving in recent years.\n\nThe CSO data shows that 9,548 new EVs were licenced in Ireland in the first five months of 2024.\n\nIn the first five months of 2025, however, 11,877 new EVs were licenced.

Thousands attend 'No Kings' protests rebuking President Donald Trump across the Berkshires","text":"From Williamstown to Great Barrington, thousands of Berkshire County residents gathered and marched Saturday to protest President Donald Trump’s disregard for and violations of the U.S. Constitution as part of the “No Kings National Day of Defiance.\" \n\nMarches led by people holding signs of “scrubbed words” removed from government websites at Trump’s insistence — “Indigenous,” “climate change” and “Black” among them — took short laps in downtown North Adams and Pittsfield, with hundreds of sign-toting protesters marching and chanting as they walked. Events also took place in Williamstown, Stockbridge, West Stockbridge, Becket, Lee, Dalton and Great Barrington. \n\nIt coincided with Flag Day and Trump's military parade in Washington, D.C., which comes at the cost of tens of millions of dollars to taxpayers. \n\nAt least 2,000 people attended the afternoon event at The Common in Pittsfield, with some crowd estimates as high as 5,000. In South County, an estimated 2,000 people gathered in downtown Great Barrington in front of Town Hall. \n\n“I’ve lived out here for 40 years and never seen anything like this,” Susan Angle said in Great Barrington. She added the turnout has left her hopeful, but it’s important to “not be fooled into thinking this is it.”\n\nGreat Barrington organizer Jeff Schneider said the turnout made him feel energized and hopeful, and that the parcipitation is a result of people realizing they “can’t take freedom for granted.”\n\nLinda Frankel, holding a sign reading “now you’ve pissed off Grandma,” said she’s angered by the direction of the country. She stood alongside a group of friends who nodded along as she spoke.\n\n“The rule of law means nothing to them,” Frankel said. “It really saddens me that my children and grandchildren are growing up with this.”\n\nThe Berkshire rallies were among more than 2,000 nationally. Organizers planned events in all 50 states, and some sprung up overseas as well. \n\nIn North Adams, signs voiced opposition to Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests without due process, Trump’s calling the National Guard and Marines to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles, his attempts to sidestep Congress via executive orders, and his military parade, which also fell on his 79th birthday. \n\nEvent co-organizer Wendy Penner of Greylock Together Indivisible said she estimated more than 500 people were in attendance in North Adams.\n\nTragedy in Minnesota\n\nWhat began as an energized and festive mood in North Adams turned more somber when attendees learned of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed along with her husband at her home early Saturday. In a separate incident, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were also shot at their home and suffered serious injuries. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said it was both were politically motivated attacks. \n\nAuthorities believe all four were shot by the same person. As of Saturday afternoon, a manhunt for suspect Vance Boelter, 57, was still in progress. \n\nOrganizers cancelled all \"No Kings\" events in Minnesota following the shootings. In North Adams, former state Rep. Sherwood Guernsey broke the news to the crowd and asked for a moment of silence.\n\n“Never in my wildest dream did I fear being shot. What a time we face,” Guernsey, an event organizer, said. “But those of us who have served in any elected capacity, I don't want us to be afraid. And the way to not be afraid is to stand firm.”\n\nSpeakers then focused on Trump, who they say has ignored the separation of powers between the executive branch, Congress and the judiciary and is using ICE, the National Guard and the Marines to consolidate power and intimidate political opponents.\n\nChuck Roberts, a U.S. Army veteran who served from 1975 to 1995 and reached the rank of master sergeant, was twice deployed in Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He pointed out parallels between the restrictive Soviet Bloc government of East Germany and the Trump administration's policies, and castigated what he sees as a lack of honor in the White House. “No convicted felon should be allowed to hold office or be president of the United States,” he said.\n\n\"I have never been politically active in my entire life, until 2015,\" Roberts said. \"I am tired of the chaos, the lies, the lack of honor, integrity and morals. I am tired of the complete disdain for our Constitution, our laws, the judicial system and our history. I'm tired of having a totally incompetent president 'leading' our country. I'm tired of him being a bully, mocking people, calling them names.\"\n\nRoberts wasn’t the only veteran speaking out. In Pittsfield, city resident Robert Fitch, 62, a Marine Corps veteran who served in the 1980s, held a “veterans against Trump” sign. He said he’s unhappy with Trump deploying 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell protesters. He said it was a “bad use of Marines.”\n\nThousands flood Pittsfield\n\nPittsfield is a force to be reckoned with, speaker Jeromie Whalen said at The Common in Pittsfield on Saturday afternoon. \n\nResidents marched from The Common to First Street, then made their way to Willis Street before circling back. Chants included “No Kings,” and “No ICE.”\n\nOne protester said it's “time to start the revolution.” After the march, hundreds of people remained on First Street with cars honking loudly in support. \n\n“I knew [this] would be a peaceful, joyful event,” event organizer Robin O’Herin said. “It was everything I hoped for.”\n\nWhile the Berkshire events were peaceful, other \"No Kings\" events were not as fortunate. Notably, protesters clashed with police in Georgia, where several rally-goers and police deployed tear gas. A \"credible threat\" against state lawmakers also briefly closed the grounds of the Texas state Capitol ahead of its rallies. \n\nReclaiming the American flag\n\nIn Pittsfield, signs had messages of “Veterans against Trump,” and “This is our power.” One sign said: “Pro-America. Anti-Trump.”\n\nOne attendee made a tank that said “No Kings. No Tanks,” referencing Trump's military parade. \n\nCity resident Richard Dassatti was critical of ICE at the North Adams rally. He noted that his uncle was a North Adams Police officer and his cousin served in the Massachusetts State Police.\n\n\"They were never ashamed of their uniform. They never hid their faces. They took an oath,” he said.\n\nCheryl Witherell of North Adams was in attendance with her sister Judi Willette of Pownal, Vt. She says her father Gerald Willette served in the South Pacific in World War II and that her uncle Neland Willette was at D-Day.\n\n“They fought not in their own country, but for this freedom we have right now, which is being taken away right now,” she said.\n\nBrian Isaac of North Adams said he was there because of “everything … all the stuff that Trump is doing to this country with immigrants, unjustly deporting innocent people and all that. It's ridiculous. It's a total joke.”\n\nEarlier in Williamstown, a steady rain greeted about 200 protesters who gathered to hear speeches and send off an American flag to protests in Vermont, with the Canadian border as its destination.\n\nThe late Lyle Hurtubise, who landed on Utah Beach on D-Day, had a dairy farm near the Canadian border. The flag flew over the U.S. Capitol and was given to Hurtubise by former U.S. Sen.

These include Bosch India, Marelli Powertrain India, Mahle Electric Drives India, TVS Motor and Uno Minda, they said.Sona Comstar, whose application was recently rejected by China’s commerce ministry due to procedural issues, has reapplied and is among the 21 companies, said a senior industry executive.“These companies have duly filled in and got endorsed the end-user certificate and shipped the requisite documents to their suppliers for procuring rare earth magnets from China, but licences are yet to be awarded by the government there,” said the executive, who did not wish to be identified.It comes in the wake of China’s April 4 order mandating exporters that ship medium and heavy rare earth magnets to seek a licence from its commerce department after getting an end-user certificate from the buyer. The certificate requires buyers to make certain guarantees.121853960These include the guarantee that these items will not be used for storing, manufacturing, producing or processing weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.Although the order had come in response to Donald Trump’s tariffs, the US President this week announced a bilateral trade deal under which China will supply rare earth magnets to the US.Meanwhile, Indian authorities are in the process of reaching out to their counterparts in China via diplomatic channels to secure meetings for a dialogue to resolve the issue, but not much has happened on that front yet, said the sources.While some automotive parts makers in Europe recently got approvals to source rare earth magnets, their Indian arms are yet to get a go-ahead from China’s commerce ministry. The issue is complicated by the two nations’ tense business and political relationship, experts said.As per the latest data collated by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, 52 companies based in the nation source magnets from China to supply to automobile manufacturers across India.If licences are not awarded soon, industry stakeholders fear disruptions in production as stocks are set to run out in early July. India imported 870 tonnes of rare earth magnets valued at ?306 crore in 2024-25. “While the value of imports compared to the industry size is minuscule, vehicles cannot be manufactured even if we are short of one component where a rare earth magnet is being used,” said an executive.","summary":"The number of India-based companies awaiting rare earth magnet procurement licences from China has nearly doubled to 21. This delay, following China's new export regulations requiring end-user certificates, threatens production disruptions for Indian automobile manufacturers who rely on these magnets.

It played out against the counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the US leader as a dictator and would-be king.During the parade, which coincided with Trump's 79th birthday, he sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and dark clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until this year, when the parade was added to an event recognising the Army's 250th anniversary.Parade shrouded by nationwide 'No Kings' protestsHours before the parade started, demonstrators turned out in streets and parks around the nation to sound off against the Republican president. They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the US capital.In Washington, anti-war protesters unfurled signs that said “Homes not drones” not far from a display of armoured vehicles, helicopters and military-grade equipment on the National Mall set up to commemorate the Army’s birthday. Vendors outside the festival sold gear marking the military milestone. Others hawked Trump-themed merchandise.Doug Haynes, a Navy veteran who voted for Trump, attended the daylong festival to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday, but said that the parade “was a little over the top.”Pointing at a nearby tank, Haynes said that having them roll down the street is a “very bold statement to the world, perhaps.”“No Kings” rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organisers said were Trump’s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and flag day. Organisers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.The parade was added just a few weeks ago to the planned celebration of the Army’s birthday and has drawn criticism for its price tag of up to $45 million and the possibility that the lumbering tanks could tear up city streets. The Army has taken a variety of steps to protect the streets, including laying metal plates along the route.The daylong display of America’s Army comes as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other US presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard without the governor's permission and dispatched the US Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments.Ongoing tensions in Los AngelesA previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.Officers then fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles at the large group, sending demonstrators, hot dog vendors and passing pedestrians fleeing through the street. Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order.“Less lethal has been approved. Less lethal may cause discomfort and pain. It is advised that all persons leave the area,” police said in a post on X.“It was a total 100% over-reaction. We weren’t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,” said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.Marines appeared for the first time at a demonstration since they were deployed to city on Friday with the stated mission of defending federal property.Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear, hands on their rifles, beside other law enforcement, including Department of Homeland Security officers at the National Guard.Directly in front of them, hundreds of protesters jeered in English and Spanish, telling the federal troops to go home.","summary":"A massive military parade commemorating the 250th birthday of the US Army, which coincides with President Donald Trump ’s 79th birthday, was staged in Washington, DC on Saturday.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/06/15/trump-hosts-military-parade-for-us-army-anniversary-amid-no-kings-protests-across-the-coun","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/32/85/79/1440x810_cmsv2_786cd44d-9e80-5bb9-af3f-ab5364cf689e-9328579.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 23:57:41","author":"Emma de Ruiter","authors":["Emma de Ruiter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.033},{"id":331487758,"title":"Trump and Putin agree Iran-Israel conflict ‘should end’ in hour-long phone call | World News","text":"US President Donald Trump has revealed details of a one-hour phone call with his Russian counterpart, in which they agreed the conflict between Israel and Iran should end.\n\nPosting on his Truth Social platform, Mr Trump added that he told Vladimir Putin that “his war [in Ukraine] should also end”.\n\nIran has retaliated following Israel’s attack on its nuclear sites on Friday – which killed senior army officers and nuclear scientists.\n\nIsrael-Iran latest: Follow live updates\n\nThe Iranian response has resulted in at least three people killed and dozens of injuries in Israel, according to medics.
