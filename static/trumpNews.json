Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top House ally of President Donald Trump and a MAGA firebrand with a national following, is passing on a 2026 Senate run. The three-term conservative lawmaker who represents a solidly red district in northwest Georgia, in a lengthy statement posted to social media on Friday night, took aim at Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Ossoff, a top GOP target that Republicans view as extremely vulnerable in next year's midterm elections. But Greene saved much of her venom for fellow Republicans, many of whom feared a polarizing campaign if Taylor Greene became the party's 2026 nominee in Georgia, and for the institution of the Senate itself. \"Someone once said, ‘The Senate is where good ideas go to die.’ They were right. That’s why I’m not running,\" Greene wrote as she announced her decision. THIS POPULAR CONSERVATIVEGOVERNOR PASSES ON A 2026 SENATE RUN And Greene argued, \"Here’s the hard truth: the Senate doesn’t work. It’s designed to obstruct the will of the people and protect the Uniparty’s grip on power. Nearly everything requires 60 votes to pass, and even when we have a majority, a pack of Republican Senators always votes \"no\" on the bills that matter most.\" FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES SECOND STRAIGHT BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT-HELD SENATE SEAT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND Greene's announcement came four days after two-term Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was the National Republican Senatorial Committee's top recruit in battleground Georgia, revealed that he would also pass on a Senate bid. The popular conservative governor, who is term-limited and prevented from seeking re-election in 2026, was the GOP's dream candidate to take on Ossoff, as Republicans aim to expand their 53-47 Senate majority in next year's elections. ONLY ON FOX NEWS: SENATE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS HOW MANY SEATS HE'S AIMING FOR IN 2026 Greene, in her statement, claimed, \"Beating Jon Ossoff? That would be easy. He’s a silver-spoon progressive who’s never held a real job or worried about putting a roof over his family’s head.\" \"So, Jon Ossoff, you can stop with the fundraising emails and campaign ads claiming I’m your opponent. I’m not running,\" she added. While criticizing Ossoff, Greene turned up the volume on her own party, including \"the same elites who scoffed at me when I first ran for Congress in 2020.\" \"Most elected Republicans, propped up by consultants and rich donors, fail to deliver on their campaign promises. Why? Because their donors and handlers don’t want change. They want to protect their own interests, not yours,\" Greene charged. She took aim at \"the Republicans who see Trump as a speed bump,\" and argued that \"polling has become so dishonest that most people barely pay attention to it anymore. Voters are sick of the consultants who keep getting rich whether we win or lose.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Greene described herself as \"effective, fearless, and relentless, not because I serve the Republican Party, but because I serve the American people.\" But she added that \"I won’t fight for a team that refuses to win, that protects its weakest players, and that undermines the very people it’s supposed to serve… To the elite retreaters, the consultants, and the establishment: consider this your warning.\" In the wake of Kemp's announcement, GOP Rep.Buddy Carter, who represents coastal Georgia, launched a Senate campaign this week. Other Georgia Republicans expressing interest in running are Reps. Mike Collins and Rich McCormick, and state Insurance Commissioner John King.","summary":"Republican Rep.

But he added: 'Critically, it must be done without impeding our ability to get a comprehensive free trade agreement with the United States.\n\n'The Government must not go into this surrender summit on May 19 giving up our fishing, reopening free movement and tying us so tightly to European standards that we prejudice these really important agendas.'\n\nThis week Brexit minister Nick Thomas-Symonds confirmed the Government is ready to sign up to permanent alignment with EU rules in areas such as agriculture in return for a closer trading relationship – a move that could limit the scope for trade deals with other countries. \n\nOther potential concessions on the table in the negotiations include a 'youth mobility deal', which would allow tens of thousands of young Europeans to live and work temporarily in the UK.\n\nMinisters are also ready to bow to French demands to give EU trawlers long-term access to British fishing grounds.\n\nMr Bailey yesterday told the BBC that ministers were right to pursue closer trade ties with Brussels.

The terrifying threat of the alliance of autocrats now menacing us seems utterly lost on Europe's naive leaders: ANDREW NEIL","text":"There was a gathering of the ghouls in Moscow yesterday as Russia held its own commemoration of the end of the Second World War in Europe 80 years ago.\n\nSomewhat ironically for an event meant to mark the final surrender of a terrible tyranny, President Putin was surrounded in Red Square by some two dozen of today’s worst tyrants (among whom he can include himself) from the likes of Belarus, Venezuela, Cuba, Zimbabwe and Republic of Congo.\n\nPride of place went to China’s President Xi, on whom Putin has come to depend for so much as he continues to wage unrelenting war in Ukraine. The two dictators sat side by side smiling as a massive display of military might passed before them, including a contingent of crack Chinese troops and truckloads of Iranian drones.\n\nNorth Korea’s very own ‘Rocket Man’, Kim Jong Un, didn’t make it to Moscow. But he paid a symbolic visit to the Russian embassy in Pyongyang with his daughter, describing Russian-North Korean relations as the ‘invincible alliance’. Putin showed how much that means to him by warmly embracing the North Korean general whose troops helped Russia take back the Ukraine-held Kursk region.\n\nThese images coming out of Moscow brought to life, in stark and symbolic fashion, the theme of the London Defence Conference which was taking place at King’s College on the Strand this week as the tyrants mingled in Moscow. This theme was that an alliance of the autocrats – most notably those of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, collectively referred to as the ‘Crinks’ – is taking shape. It represents the most serious geopolitical threat to democracy in the 21st century – at a time when the democracies are in no shape to deal with it.\n\nThe extent to which the Crinks are a de facto alliance is not widely appreciated in the West outside defence circles. But it is already operating with deadly effect in Ukraine.\n\nIran has provided Russia with hundreds of Shahed-136 attack drones, used for strikes on Ukraine’s towns and cities. It has helped Russia build a massive drone factory in Tatarstan with the capacity to pump out 6,000 drones a year. Tehran has also sent Russia more than 400 Fateh-110 short-range ballistic missiles, another deadly threat to Ukraine’s urban population.\n\nNorth Korea is an even bigger supplier of military hardware to the Kremlin. By last October it had dispatched 20,000 containers packed with artillery shells, short-range missiles and anti-tank rockets to replenish Russia’s stockpiles. But ‘Rocket Man’ went further than that.\n\nHe deployed 12,000 North Korean troops to help Russian forces take back the Kursk region after a surprise Ukrainian incursion. Remarkably, the huge significance of North Korean troops fighting on European soil to help snuff out a European democracy – and what that portends – still seems lost on Europe’s complacent leaders.\n\nChina has so far avoided providing Russia with lethal weapons. But its contribution to rebuilding Putin’s war machine has been immense. More than 70 per cent of the machine tools and 90 per cent of the microchips Russia is using to rebuild its defence industrial base come from China. The two dictatorships also engage in regular joint military exercises, most recently in the Gulf of Oman, with its crucial sea lanes.\n\nChina is also replenishing the Kremlin’s depleted coffers by buying more than two million barrels of Russian oil every day, accounting for almost 50 per cent of Russia’s crude oil exports and worth billions to Putin, whose regime is being squeezed by sanctions. China also obliges by taking 30 per cent of Russia’s gas exports by pipeline and over 20 per cent in the form of liquefied natural gas.\n\nAnd, as if to demonstrate that the autocrats are all in it together, by the second half of last year China was also buying 1.5million barrels of oil a day from Iran – more than 90 per cent of Iran’s oil exports and as much a boon to Tehran’s empty coffers as China’s purchases of Russian oil are to the Kremlin.\n\nThe consequences of all this for Europe are terrifying.\n\nUndeterred by the carnage Russia has endured in Ukraine, Putin is intent on building an even bigger military. His navy and air force are largely unscathed by the Ukrainian conflict. Nato’s top general says he’s restocking his army with men, weapons and ammo at an ‘unprecedented pace’.\n\nIn recent testimony to the US Senate, he revealed that Putin’s factories will produce 1,500 tanks this year, 3,000 armoured vehicles and 250,000 shells per month – ‘on track to build a stockpile three times greater than the United States and Europe combined’. He is creating a 1.5million-strong army, much of which would be deployed on Russia’s western front with Europe, with the active support and aid of China, Iran and North Korea.\n\nThe world is an especially dangerous place because the alliance of the bad guys is growing closer, stronger, more intimidating – just as the alliances that bind together the good guys are in disarray and threatening to unravel.\n\nAbove all, we face an increasingly united evil at the very moment that doubts are growing about the commitment of the most important democracy of all – America – to the various democratic alliances that have kept us free since the fall of Hitler’s regime eight decades ago. We are at a watershed, facing some historic choices.\n\nDo we proceed on the basis that despite all Donald Trump’s bluster, America will remain the essential ally as we confront united and re-energised autocrats?\n\nOr must we realise that we have to adjust existing alliances and build new ones without America’s central involvement? It would surely be prudent to reconfigure our defence and security capabilities on the basis that America cannot be relied on as she has been – and be prepared to be pleasantly surprised if that calculation proves wrong and the US is still with us.\n\nMost of Europe’s politicians don’t get this. Complacency still stalks Paris, Berlin and London. They know Europe has to rearm but they remain oblivious to the scale and speed required. President Macron is capricious and unreliable, missing in action when it comes to rearming France. Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is untried and untested, his accession to power this week a shambles. Only Poland, the Baltic states and Scandinavia really get it, perhaps because they are on the front line.\n\nKeir Starmer opened the London Defence Conference with his usual mixture of robotic platitudes and petty party politics, unsuitable for such a distinguished gathering. He claimed, unconvincingly, that his minuscule increase in defence spending – rising from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.5 by 2027 – would strengthen our military and rebuild our industrial base.\n\nTellingly, he framed the benefits in terms of what it would do for what he calls ‘working people’. But the purpose of rearming is not to pander to a demographic Labour thinks it needs to be re-elected. It’s to secure the defence of the realm, which is above party politics.\n\nHis rhetoric soared far ahead of reality. The extra money for defence amounts to a mere £6billion a year after allowing for inflation – chicken feed compared with what’s needed. The ambition for 3 per cent of GDP is vague, kicked into the next parliament. There are no plans for 3.5 per cent, which experts I spoke to at the conference thought the bare minimum required to equip our military for these dangerous times.\n\nTimes in which we need to reconfigure Nato without America – or at the very least diminished American participation – to make it clear to the alliance of autocrats we will be no pushover. Times in which we will need new structures to guarantee our security, for a divided and slow-moving European Union most certainly cannot pick up the slack.\n\nBritain, as Europe’s most formidable military power, could play a pivotal position in all this. We should be taking the lead in creating, on the back of Nato, a military coalition of like-minded nation-states: the major EU powers plus the UK, Canada and Norway. But our allies will only follow us if we lead by example, which means being serious about defence spending. Everything else is mere political posturing.","summary":"There was a gathering of the ghouls in Moscow yesterday as Russia held its own commemoration of the end of the Second World War, bringing to life the image of an alliance of autocrats taking shape.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14696617/terrifying-threat-alliance-autocrats-Europes-naive-leaders-ANDREW-NEIL.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/09/19/98233831-0-image-m-6_1746817155516.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 00:37:25","author":"Andrew Neil,Editor","authors":["Andrew Neil","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.072},{"id":319728056,"title":"World News | IMF Approves USD 1B Loan to Pakistan Amid India's Objection over Cross-border Terrorism","text":"Washington DC [US], May 10 (ANI): The International Monetary Fund approved the first review of Pakistan's economic reform program under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), enabling a disbursement of approximately USD 1 billion.\nIndia, however, firmly opposed providing funds to a country that continues to sponsor cross-border terrorism, warning that such support carries reputational risks for global institutions and undermines international norms.\nAlso Read | IMF Approves USD 1 Billion Loan for Pakistan, Announces PM Shehbaz Sharif's Office.\nIn a post on X, the IMF said, \"IMF Board approved the first review of Pakistan's economic reform program under the EFF, enabling a disbursement of ~ $1 billion, reflecting strong program implementation which has contributed to continuing economic recovery.\"\nhttps://x.com/IMFNews/status/1920931733551411303\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Wants India-Pakistan Tensions to 'De-Escalate as Quickly as Possible', Says White House.\nThis stand was taken during the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) review of a USD 1 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and consideration of a fresh USD 1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for Pakistan, sources within the Government of India said.\nIndia abstained from the recent IMF vote on approving a loan to Pakistan, not due to a lack of opposition, but because IMF rules do not permit a formal \"no\" vote, sources added.\nFurther, New Delhi conveyed its strong dissent within the constraints of the IMF's voting system and used the opportunity to record its objections formally.

He's previously sparked outrage by calling for a Palestinian town to be erased and saying \"there's no such thing\" as Palestinian people, and he once told Arabic members of Israel's Parliament: \"You’re here by mistake, it's a mistake that [Israel's first Prime Minister] Ben-Gurion didn't finish the job and didn't throw you out in 1948.\"\n\nJoe Biden considered Smotrich so extreme, his administration wouldn't deal with him. Smotrich accused Biden of pushing an \"antisemitic lie\" when he put sanctions on Israeli settlers accused of killing Palestinians and torching their homes and farms.\n\nBut in March, the US welcomed Smotrich. \n\nHe and his American counterpart, Scott Bessent, had a \"highly impactful\" meeting and promised \"a significant step-up\" in ties.\n\nIt's representative of how the US, under Trump, is now embracing the more extreme elements of the Israeli government — elements that even Biden, a self-proclaimed Zionist who was criticised for unconditionally providing bombs to Israel, couldn't stomach.\n\nA guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago\n\nAlongside Smotrich, another Israeli ultranationalist with influence in Netanyahu's government is Itamar Ben-Gvir.\n\nBen-Gvir, the national security minister, is a proponent of the siege that's been stopping food and medicine from entering Gaza for more than two months. \n\nHe's also called for food warehouses in Gaza to be bombed, he says to put more pressure on Hamas.\n\nLike Smotrich, Ben-Gvir was boycotted by Biden.\n\nBut things have changed for him too.\n\nLast month, he was a guest at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. \n\nAgain, the visit attracted relatively little attention.\n\nTrump wasn't there, but Ben-Gvir said in a tweet that he met other senior Republican Party officials, and that they supported his proposal to bomb Gaza's food stores. \n\n(The US State Department later said such an idea would contradict its policy to provide aid in Gaza.)\n\nWhen Smotrich was asked about Ben-Gvir's proposal this week, he said: \"I do not argue with Minister Ben-Gvir morally, but practically, the world will not let us starve or thirst 2 million people in Gaza.\"\n\nBut food supplies are already running out.\n\nIn April, the World Food Program said its food stocks were all gone. \n\nAnd this week, World Central Kitchen — the aid group run by Washington celebrity chef José Andrés — said it was shutting its depleted soup kitchens and Gaza's last working bakery, which had run out of flour.\n\nThe group said it had been serving 133,000 meals a day, but its food and cooking fuel has been stuck at the border for weeks and there's none left.\n\n'Despairing' by design\n\nAs Trump prepares to travel to the Middle East next week – though probably not to Israel — there's talk of allowing some food into Gaza.\n\n\"People are starving,\" Donald Trump said when asked about the situation this week. \"And we're going to help them get some food.\"\n\nIt's been reported that private contractors could be used to distribute future aid to prevent theft by Hamas, which Israel blames for food shortages in Gaza. \n\n\"Hamas is the one starving them,\" Israeli military spokesperson Effie Defrin said in a televised address this week.\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Thursday, local time: \"We are steps away from that solution, from being able to deliver the aid and the food.\"\n\nThe solution, though, appears to be wrapped up in Israel's newly announced plan to intensify the bombardment of Gaza — possibly completely flattening it — and occupy it indefinitely. \n\nThat plan, called \"Gideon's Chariots\", is due to go ahead if no hostage-release and ceasefire deal is reached before Trump concludes his Middle East tour on March 15.\n\nIsrael's military says it would involve \"the movement of the majority of the Gaza Strip's population — in order to protect them in a Hamas-free zone\".\n\nBut Smotrich, a member of the cabinet that approved the plan, laid out the horror of it.\n\nHe said Palestinians would be \"concentrated\" into a small strip of land near the Egyptian border, and: \"They will be totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places.\"\n\nThe UN, aid groups and some western allies are appalled. \"We strongly oppose the expansion of Israel’s operations,\" the UK’s Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, said.\n\nThere's outrage in the US, too, including from officials in previous administrations. \"What we are looking at is the slow-motion ethnic cleansing of Gaza,\" said podcaster Ben Rhodes, who was deputy national security advisor to Barack Obama. \"It's just an absolute calamity in that there's just nothing stopping it.\"\n\nBut it's not inconsistent with the ideas Trump has floated for the region, such as the \"clean out\" of Gaza he suggested earlier this year, and his proposal to take it over and turn it into the \"Riviera of the Middle East\".\n\nWar crime charges pending\n\nThe international community roundly rejected Trump's plan, illegal under international law, and Trump has said little about it since he first mentioned it.\n\nNow it appears similar ideas — and the wishes of Israel's far-right — are manifesting in formalised Israeli policy.\n\nThe question of whether Israel's actions constitute the international crime of genocide is still before the World Court.\n\nIsrael is fighting the allegation, arguing it's been acting in legitimate self-defence after the October 7 attacks that left more than 1,200 dead.\n\nNetanyahu is also still wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using starvation as a method of warfare. \n\nThe Israeli PM has called the allegations absurd and false, and labelled the warrant antisemitic. Biden, as president, criticised the court. Trump then sanctioned it.\n\nBut the prolonged blockage on food and aid is lending more weight to the charges. \n\nAnd so are the statements of the powerful ultranationalists in Netanyahu's government — men who were once shunned by the US but are now welcome guests under Trump.","summary":"The controversial leaders of Israel's far-right politics were boycotted by the US in the past.

We’ll fight to the end. A talk? Our door remains wide open.”\n\nHenry Wu, macroeconomist and Taiwan AIA Capital lead economics researcher, told The Epoch Times that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) aggressive rhetoric is aimed at preserving its public image.\n\n“It keeps saying it will fight to the end, but the truth is that Xi Jinping misjudged the impact of U.S. tariffs. Instead of tackling the real issues, he resorted to nationalist sentiment, ultimately dragging down China’s economy,” Wu said.\n\nIn recent weeks, China’s export sector has been hit hard, with a surge in business closures and rising unemployment. Videos of industry workers and business owners complaining about the downturn have circulated widely on Chinese social media.\n\nBeijing initially tried to rally international opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs through diplomatic outreach and appeals to shared economic interests, but found little success—particularly in its efforts to court the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the EU—as other countries prioritized their own interests.\n\n“Despite occasional political friction with Washington, neither bloc can afford to alienate the United States,” Wang He, a U.S.-based China affairs commentator, told The Epoch Times.\n\n“In 2024, the EU and ASEAN both ran large trade deficits with China, which were effectively offset by their trade surpluses with the United States. Moreover, with China’s economy weakening and its outlook uncertain, Beijing has little to offer in terms of tangible economic benefits. As a result, very few countries aligned with China, leaving it increasingly isolated on the global stage,” Wang added.\n\nHe noted that the Chinese regime had also hoped the United States would fall into disarray under tariff pressure, but that didn’t happen.\n\n“On the contrary, it was China’s economy that took the hit,” Wang said.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet in Switzerland on May 10–11 for the first in-person trade talks since the tariff conflict began, aiming to ease tensions—weeks after Trump announced 145 percent duties on Chinese imports and Beijing responded with 125 percent tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump on May 9 signaled that he is considering cutting tariffs on China from 145 percent to 80 percent ahead of the meeting.\n\nAn “80 percent Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” Trump wrote on his social media account on Friday morning, referring to Bessent.\n\nAlthough China has publicly denied that Xi Jinping had spoken with Trump or that senior Chinese officials held private trade talks with the White House, reports suggest that China quietly lowered tariffs on certain U.S. imports, particularly high-tech products, including semiconductors.\n\n“The two sides must have remained in contact through various levels and channels, but Beijing was playing semantic games, insisting such contact does not constitute formal negotiations,” Wang said.\n\nHe said that Trump used tariffs as leverage to force China to negotiate and open its markets.\n\n“Trump was proactive and flexible, while China, defensive and image-conscious, remained stubborn—creating a sharp contrast,” Wang remarked.\n\nRegarding the future of U.S.-China trade relations, Wu noted that during Trump’s first term, Washington made significant efforts to negotiate, only to find that agreements were often not honored. “Even when China signed, implementation was typically superficial and short-lived—just enough to meet the bare minimum.”\n\nIn his view, Trump may not be interested in talks this time, pointing out that he raised tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145 percent without initiating negotiations, while actively pursuing trade deals with Canada, Mexico, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam.\n\n“The United States has realized the problem isn’t just Xi Jinping—it’s the whole authoritarian system of the CCP,” Wu said. “In that system, all economic gains are eventually captured by elites through political power. Integrating China into globalization only strengthened this authoritarian model. Trump now clearly sees that this is not just about negotiation, it’s about applying maximum pressure to bring down the CCP regime and rebuild a China based on democracy, rule of law, freedom, and human rights.”\n\nWang predicted that going forward, the U.S.-China trade war is likely to follow a pattern of ongoing fighting and talking, with no short-term resolution.\n\n“But Trump is expected to quickly finalize trade deals with other countries this week, which would strengthen his position. If the United States forms a tariff alliance, China will face even greater pressure. At this point, the initiative firmly lies in Trump’s hands,” he said.\n\nWu suggested another possibility. He said the talks in Switzerland might not lead to a positive outcome. It might become a one-time event, with no follow-up negotiations.","summary":"Analysts say the United States has an advantage in the trade dispute, while China sees surge in business closures and rising unemployment.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/china/us-holds-the-stronger-hand-in-tariff-standoff-with-beijing-experts-5855042","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/04/11/id5840321-GettyImages-2208843021-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-10 00:22:17","author":"Haizhong Ning,Luo Ya,Olivia Li","authors":["Haizhong Ning","Luo Ya","Olivia Li"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.032},{"id":319731470,"title":"Trump's latest executive orders affect homeless vets, criminal prosecutions, regulatory efficiency","text":"May 9 (UPI) -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed three executive orders -- establishing a national center for homeless veterans, reducing criminal prosecutions for violations of the Code of Federal Regulations and increasing efficiency of the Federal Register.\n\nTrump directed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins to establish the National Center for Warrior Independence on the West Los Angeles VA campus.

The imbalance leaves Nigeria vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations. However, there is good news from the non-oil sector. A recent report from the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) showed that the non-oil sector recorded $1.7 billion in Q1, 2025, the highest in 49 years. This is a remarkable achievement.\n\nThis could signal a path forward for strengthening the economy if the government provides all the necessary incentives for exports and move the economy away from the present over-reliance on oil revenue. According to the Executive Director, NEPC, Nonye Ayeni, the value of the non-oil exports recorded in Q1, 2025 is 24.75 per cent higher than the corresponding value in Q1 2024. This is as a result of the significant contributions of some agriculture and processed commodities like cocoa and its derivatives that contributed 45 per cent of the total revenue. Others are cashew nuts, sesame seeds, and soyabeans.\n\nOther non-oil sector contributors to the GDP growth include trade, telecommunication, insurance and financial services, manufacturing and real estate. All of them played crucial role in stimulating infrastructure, and providing human capital development. Statistics show that in recent years, the non-oil sector has been contributing about 90 per cent of Nigeria’s GDP, and a significant number of jobs across various industries in the labour market. While the oil sector dominates foreign exchange earnings, the non-oil sector generates revenue that makes diversifying the economy and promoting sustainable development a priority. \n\nThe huge contribution of the non-oil sector in the Q1 2025 reflects the new structure of the economy, which is dominated by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), with 96.7 per cent. In all of this, government policies, including protectionism, trade liberalisation and a robust export promotion incentives, are vital to strengthening growth in the non-oil sector, especially at this time that President Donald Trump’s administration has unleashed sweeping tariffs across many economies, including Nigeria.\n\nWith volatility in the global oil market, government should build a strong, diversified economy that thrives outside the oil sector. This is what countries like Brazil, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia have been doing. For instance, Vietnam generates over $50billion annually from electronics as export, and additional $4billion yearly from rice exports, thereby solidifying its position as the world’s second-largest rice exporter. Also, Brazil’s economy generates more than $41billion from soyabeans exports, making it the world’s largest exporter of soyabeans. \n\nIts beef export contributes $9billion to its foreign exchange earnings annually. Malaysia, which in the sixties imported palm seedlings and rubber from Nigeria, is now a global exporter of these commodities. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), Nigeria accounts for 70 per cent of global yam production, and 10 per cent of global sorghum. But this has not been leveraged for exports. By capitalising on the commodities that abound in the country, Nigeria can replicate the successes recorded by Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries in export-value products like cassava, palm oil that can boost nation’s foreign exchange earnings and enhance the value of the naira.\n\nUndoubtedly, the non-oil sector is the key to unlocking the economy and making it self-sufficient in food security. \n\nIn all, to boost Nigeria’s non-oil sector, the government should design policies that will focus on infrastructure development, improve the regulatory environment in key areas like agriculture and manufacturing. Besides, there should be expanded irrigation of wheat cultivation across the country, supporting agricultural research and improving market access for agricultural products, including the development of Mining Resource Corridors (MRC) necessary to enhance Nigeria’s abundant mineral resources.\n\nBeyond this, the development of the agro-allied value chain will help boost value addition and generate more employment. The much-talked about diversification of the productive sector and broadening the revenue base is a policy imperative the government should aggressively pursue. But the country remains at the crossroads in terms of revenues and veritable forex receipts. This requires a pragmatic multi-agency approach and the collaboration of all stakeholders as well as the support of Nigeria’s international development partners.\n\nThis is the time to elevate the value of the nation’s non-oil products. The Nigerian Export and Import Bank (NEXIM) should rise to the challenge of sensitising the people on the country’s export potential and encourage state governments to focus on production of non-oil products, which they have competitive advantage.","summary":"For decades, Nigeria’s economic health has been heavily tied to oil exports, accounting for over 80 per cent of the country’s foreign exchange earnings despite abundant non-oil resources.

Although the administration locked in a trade deal with Britain and says it has others on the horizon, Trump&apos;s tariff policies have spurred on market volatility and been met with skepticism from many Americans, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The Golden State governor shared his take on Trump&apos;s trade agenda Friday, arguing the administration is taking an \"inconsistent, chaotic approach\" to trade. \"Even if I was going to be charitable, I would say his inconsistent, chaotic approach does the opposite. It freezes investment, consumer confidence, small businesses, large, medium-sized businesses. Everybody I talk to feels very similarly,\" Newsom said on \"Kudlow.\" \"This chaos is not the kind of predictability and stability that would ultimately inure, I think, to Trump&apos;s favor in terms of, again, making his case.\" COMMERCE SECRETARY SAYS MORE DEALS TO COME FOLLOWING US-UK TRADE AGREEMENT: ‘GOING TO DRIVE OUR ECONOMY’ Since April, Trump&apos;s trade war has shaken up financial markets and raised fears of a recession, with central bankers and business executives wrestling with often chaotic policy-making that is rippling through world supply chains and a host of industries. The Trump administration announced widespread tariffs for multiple countries on \"Liberation Day\" in April, following criticism that other countries&apos; trade practices are unfair toward the United States. The administration later adjusted its initial proposal and announced in April it would immediately impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, while reducing reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days to a baseline of 10%. China responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. Newsom, who said he was not an \"absolutist\" when it comes to the tariff policy, argued Trump&apos;s \"quixotic,\" \"destructive\" approach is \"having a profound impact on our confidence and our relationships around the globe.\" \"If it wasn&apos;t so chaotic, I would at least engage in a very reasonable conversation about addressing those issues with a little bit more muscularity, but this is recklessness,\" he added. DEMOCRATS TRYING TO FORCE RETAILERS TO DISPLAY COST OF TRUMP TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS The Democratic executive also warned the impacts on businesses, consumers and the global supply chain \"can&apos;t be unwound quickly and easily.\" Newsom expressed he also fears Trump&apos;s decision-making \"seems to come on news cycles, not on the basis of a grand strategy,\" arguing it is \"the great impediment in terms of getting to the place we all want to go.\" FOX Business host Larry Kudlow also pressed Newsom on China as the Trump administration plans for negotiations with China in Geneva, Switzerland, this weekend. While hopeful, Newsom fears the talks will not be successful. Trump on Friday suggested an 80% tariff on China, which would be significantly lower than the current 145%, but ultimately the final number would be up to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer are set to meet with Chinese economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland over the weekend. CLICK HERE TO GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing Friday, \"That was a number the president threw out there, and we&apos;ll see what happens this weekend,\" adding that Trump wouldn’t unilaterally lower the tariff and China would be required to make \"concessions.\" As the trade war with China is set to reach a crossroads this weekend, Newsom said Trump&apos;s approach to trade and tariffs have put \"a chill on the ability to make wise decisions\" economically. \"It&apos;s a very serious moment. There&apos;s a better approach. If he wanted to take it, he hasn&apos;t taken it yet,\" he added. Although not sharing concrete details, Newsom championed a \"step-by-step\" approach to alleviating the chronic trade imbalance with \"worker-centered industrial policy.\" Fox News Digital&apos;s Danielle Wallace, Brie Stimson and Bradford Betz contributed to this report.","summary":"Gov.

The Tahoe Truckee Unified School District (TTUSD) in Truckee, California, is leaving the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) to join the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). The change will go into effect in Fall 2025 and comes after the NIAA voted to ban trans athletes from the girls' category during its April 2 Board of Control meeting. It was made in order to comply with President Donald Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. However, California has continued to defy the order and enable trans inclusion in girls' sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Multiple TTUSD parents and girls' athletes pleaded with school officials not to make the switch to California's federation at the Truckee Unified school board meeting Wednesday night. Not only did they speak out the notion of letting trans athletes in girls' sports, but many speakers also pointed out that other details of the switch would affect the district's sports teams' ability to conduct their seasons, including travel and scheduling changes that would bring about potential weather complications for outdoor events. The current setup with Truckee competing in the NIAA allows its teams to travel east into Nevada for most of its away competition, as the town sits near the northern California-Nevada border. But with the coming change, the student athletes could soon have to travel west for most of their away competition. This means that students will often have to travel through California's Donner Pass, a 7,056-foot-high mountain pass. During winter, the pass is known for being dangerous due to extreme weather conditions like heavy snowfall, strong winds and icy roads. The high elevation and frequent storms contribute to treacherous travel conditions, including the potential for avalanches. Truckee high school girls' track and field athlete Ava Cochram expressed her fears of playing against trans athletes. \"Men generally have more muscle mass, higher lung capacity and greater bone density that gives them greater advantages, physically, in sports, and I think that it's very unfair to watch all of our hard work as women to go down the drain,\" Cochram said. \"I do not have anything against trans people, but I think this is a violation of our privacy.\" Truckee High School girls' soccer, track and basketball athlete Kenzie Zilstorf lamented the idea of changing with trans athletes in the same locker room, and having to increase the risk of travel with the change. \"It's even more bad if a woman has to go in the locker room with a man and change with them. There's two genders, a man and a woman,\" Zilstorf said. \"And I think it's unfair that we have to take a dangerous drive to risk our lives over the summit when there's snow, all because of a privacy rule. This is wrong.\" North Tahoe High School girls' soccer player Anna Holly said she isn't even going to be playing girls' soccer anymore because of the change. \"It's sad for me, because this is the only time I get to play soccer in my life, and I really do enjoy it, but I'm choosing basketball over that,\" Holly said. \"And biologically, boys are born with greater speed and strength than girls, and having to play against them, they do have an unfair advantage, and I would not feel safe with them. There's also safety concerns about how much stronger they are than us.\" CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN TTUSD still defended its decision to switch to CIF in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"A recent Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) policy change made on April 2, 2025, directly conflicts with California state law, specifically the California Education Code’s mandate against discrimination and protection of student privacy. Given the direct conflict between the NIAA's recent policy changes and the mandates of California state law, TTUSD viewed joining a California athletics association as a necessary action to ensure legal compliance,\" read a statement from the TTUSD to Fox News Digital. TTUSD also said it anticipates the new arrangements will lead to shorter travel times for its student athletes for away competitions, despite concerns over the Donner Pass. \"TTUSD is working with CIF on details related to league assignment, schedules, and travel distances. We anticipate that the overall mileage student-athletes travel within the CIF will be less than our current travel schedules,\" the district's statement read. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CIF is one of many high school sports conferences located in blue states to defy Trump's executive order since it was signed on Feb. 5. It is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for its defiance of the order, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon has warned Governor Gavin Newsom that his state could be subject to federal funding freezes if it continues to defy.

In his latest letter, Bessent attributed the August deadline, known as the “X-date,” in part to receipts from the latest tax filing season.\n\nA Bipartisan Policy Center analysis released in March estimated that the U.S. could run out of cash by mid-July if Congress did not raise or suspend the nation’s debt limit.\n\nPresident Donald Trump had previously demanded that a provision raising or suspending the debt limit — something his own Republican Party routinely resists — be included in legislation to avert the last potential government shutdown under his Democratic predecessor, President joe Biden.\n\n“Anything else is a betrayal of our country,” Trump said in a statement in December. That deal did not ultimately address the debt limit.\n\nThe letter to Johnson comes as Republicans consider a massive tax cut and border security package that includes an increase in the debt limit.

The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology.”\n\nThe dramatic departure of dozens of career attorneys inside the division “is just further evidence that this is not an administration that cares about civil rights,” said Jin Hee Lee, director of strategic initiatives at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nThe rapid transformation of the department is “really unprecedented and and really threatens the foundations of our multiracial democracy, and it’s something that all Americans should be very, very alarmed about,” she told The Independent.\n\n“This is a real moment in history in terms of trying to thwart efforts to undermine our democracy,” she said.\n\nThe Trump administration’s crusade against so-called “woke” ideology is a direct assault on civil rights progress, according to civil rights groups and advocates. Dhillon has even suggested that the depth of discrimination in the United States that inspired the civil rights movement and creation of the Civil Rights Act in the first place no longer exists.\n\n“It’s 2025, today,” she said. “The idea that some police department or some big employer can be sued because of statistics, which can be manipulated, is ludicrous and it is unfair.”\n\nThe Trump administration is not merely shifting priorities for enforcement of civil rights abuses, Vanita Gupta, who ran the Civil Rights Division during the Obama and Biden administrations, told The New York Times.\n\n“The division has been turned on its head and is now being used as a weapon against the very communities it was established to protect,” she said.\n\nJon Greenbaum, a former senior trial attorney for the voting rights section at the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, called Trump’s gutting of the agency and the departure of career officials “the end” of the division itself.\n\n“This is what we are faced with for the next three and three-quarter years in the Civil Rights Division and the executive branch as a whole,” he wrote last month. “Federal agencies that follow the dictates of one person and his friends while largely ignoring their Congressionally mandated responsibilities.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-gutting-civil-rights-enforcement-232836274.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/6bea5a317d68331bcccfefd830dd1d07","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-09 23:28:36","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":319721824,"title":"World News | Pakistan Claims India Targeted Three Airbases with Missiles, Drones","text":"Lahore, May 10 (PTI) Pakistan early Saturday claimed that its three airbases were targeted by Indian missiles and drones.

Additionally, the judge identified one of the more intricate arguments as insufficiently developed and instructed the parties to submit further motions, giving them a final opportunity.\n\nThe court was, however, withering in its estimation of the government’s efforts to have the case dismissed so far.\n\n“[A]s the record currently stands, the Court is unable to conclude that the Government is not acting in bad faith, and the parties will be directed to provide additional briefing,” Bredar intoned.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nThe timeline of what, exactly, occurred before either party sought to apply the 45th and 47th president’s pardon to the gun crime case is instructive to the judge in the strongly worded order.\n\nIn February 2021, the defendant, Elias Costianes, was brought up on firearms charges following the execution of warrants by federal agents investigating the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol Complex. At roughly the same time, federal prosecutors also brought a formally separate case, directly based on allegations that Costianes joined the pro-Trump mob at the Capitol and filmed himself inside the building.\n\nIn September 2023, Costianes pleaded guilty to one count of possession of firearms and ammunition by an unlawful user of any controlled substance. He was subsequently sentenced to serve 24 months in prison, followed by two years of supervised release.\n\nIn February, on the same day he reported to prison, Costianes filed motions with the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to have his sentence enjoined, stayed and overturned — based on Trump’s blanket pardon issued to all Jan. 6 defendants on Jan. 20.\n\nProcedurally, the case was quickly a mess: the defendant’s pre-pardon appeal was effectively abandoned; then the 4th Circuit asked the defendant and the government to answer specific questions; instead the parties filed a joint motion to vacate the sentence; that motion was followed by an appellate court order and additional briefing; and then came a remand back down to the district court.\n\nAt the same time, lawyers were busy at the district court level. A motion to vacate was tersely denied by Bredar in early March. Then, a motion for release from custody and to stay the sentence pending appeal was volubly nixed by the lower court in late March.\n\nIn early April, the case was back before Bredar, with instructions from the 4th Circuit to decide the pardon issue. In response to a series of rulings, the judge told both parties to clarify, fully support, and resubmit their arguments, warning them not to be conclusory.\n\nNow, having more or less tried to do so, the judge says the positions taken by the Trump administration and Costianes are unavailing.\n\nThe court identifies the operative language in the pardon as the instruction for the U.S. attorney general “to pursue dismissal with prejudice to the government of all pending indictments against individuals for their conduct related to the events at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.”\n\nFor Bredar, the inquiry is simple.\n\n“The language in the Pardon is plain, and the terms are clear and unambiguous,” the opinion reads. “As another court easily concluded, ‘for an offense to fall within the Pardon’s scope, it must be tethered to a specific time — January 6, 2021 — and place at or near the U.S. Capitol.’ In short, the Court concludes that the Pardon means what it says.”\n\nThe judge goes on to say he is relying on a “simple canon of construction” — legalese for a framework used to interpret a document. This canon is identified as the notion that an “unambiguous” statute should result in a quick end to judicial inquiry.\n\nHere’s how the court applied the pardon to the facts:\n\nAccordingly, if an individual was convicted of an offense related to events that occurred (1) at or near the United States Capitol and (2) on January 6, 2021, the Pardon applies. Otherwise, it does not.\nAnd in this case — where Costianes pleaded guilty to possessing firearms and ammunition by an unlawful user of any controlled substance in violation 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) on February 12, 2021 at his home in Maryland-the Pardon does not apply. The offense occurred on February 12, 2021, not on January 6, 2021, in the District of Maryland, not at or near the United States Capitol. The offense itself in no way related to the events of January 6, 2021 at the Capitol.\n\nIn their briefings, the government and the Jan. 6 defendant tried to convince the court that the pardon needed to be judicially massaged and to apply a liberal reading of the phrase “related to.”\n\nThe judge did not oblige.\n\n“The parties, resisting the plain and unambiguous meaning of the Pardon, wish to draw the Court into an interpretive exercise,” Bredar goes on. “The Government and Costianes argue that the Court should conclude that the Pardon applies to his offense because it was discovered as a result of the execution of a warrant arising out of his conduct at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that the Pardon’s ‘related to’ language is broad enough to cover it.”\n\nWhile the court admits Costianes’ gun crime “would likely not have been uncovered had he not been present” at the pro-Trump riot, Bredar says the “plain language” of the pardon “cannot be stretched so far as to cover Costianes’ offense” in Maryland.\n\n“The Court recognizes that ‘related to’ can have a broad meaning,” Bredar muses. “But even such a broad term cannot be unlimited.”\n\nUltimately, the court believes the government and Costianes are trying to advance a severe misreading of Trump’s pardon.\n\n“The context here makes abundantly clear that the Pardon does not extend so far as to cover offenses discovered as a result of investigations relating to January 6,” the opinion goes on. “The Pardon applies to offenses — not investigations — related to January 6.”\n\nThe parties also essayed an argument that, regardless of how the court might interpret the pardon, the government and Costianes have a “reasonable” reading that the grant of clemency engulfs the gun crime. The court sharply rubbished this line of thought.\n\nAgain, the opinion, at length:\n\n[T]he Government’s interpretation is unreasonable, and the language of the Pardon does not bear the construction the parties urge…\n[T]he Pardon’s text is plain and unambiguous, and the parties’ reading — that the Pardon applies to offenses discovered as a result of the execution of January 6-related warrants is unreasonable. The parties essentially ask that the Court read in additional words to the Pardon. This the Court may not do. The unreasonableness of the Government’s position is underscored by its inconsistent application of the Pardon. In short, the meaning proposed by the parties is patently in conflict with the plain terms of the Pardon. Thus, the Court concludes that the Pardon does not apply…\n\n“There might be all manner of good faith reasons to seek the dismissal of this case,” Bredar continues later on. “But if reliance on the Pardon arguably was once one such reason, it is no longer, given the Court’s unequivocal rejection of the parties’ proposed interpretation. The President did not pardon Costianes for the instant offense. Any contention otherwise is now bad faith because it is not just incorrect, it is as the Court has concluded above — unreasonable.”\n\nBut there is one bright spot for Costianes.\n\nThe government used a so-called “Rule 48 Motion” to force the issue in the present case. Under this federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, which governs dismissal of cases, a court has very limited discretion whether or not to grant the government’s dismissal request. Underscoring the often complicated nature of law, the parties and the court treated the Rule 48 arguments as distinct from those about the text of the pardon and its relationship to the firearm offense.\n\nIn other words, arguing the pardon on the merits was one method for dismissal; using a Rule 48 procedural attack was another.\n\nHere, the merits argument failed. And, while the court calls the Rule 48 arguments “spare” — and spends pages doubting their validity — Bredar concedes the parties did not yet have the ruling “on the applicability” of the pardon before briefing their procedural argument.\n\nNow, the Trump administration and Costianes have until May 27 to file additional motions on Rule 48. Those final attempts will try to convince the judge that he is essentially powerless to deny dismissal.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nInset left to right: Elias Costianes (Justice Department).

Despite sharp criticism from US President Donald Trump, who has labeled the tax as an attempt to plunder American companies, the British government maintains its stance.\n\nA Global Digital Tax Discussion\n\nBritain’s digital services tax is part of a broader international trend. Approximately 20 countries have implemented similar taxes as authorities worldwide adapt to the rapid digitalization of the economy. This development has sparked an international conversation about fair taxation in the digital age, as giant tech companies amass enormous revenues without corresponding local tax contributions.\n\nThe Local Economic Perspective\n\nThe UK’s stance on the digital services tax reflects an effort to level the playing field for local businesses competing with global giants. By taxing the revenues garnered from the UK market, Britain seeks to ensure that tech behemoths contribute fairly to the economies from which they profit. Such measures are seen as crucial in supporting local industries and services while promoting balanced economic growth.\n\nUS Reaction and Diplomatic Dynamic\n\nDespite the friction it incites, the UK’s decision to uphold the tax might serve as a precedent for other nations grappling with the same issues. Although the tax remains a point of contention in US-UK trade talks, the recent deal indicates both nations’ willingness to navigate these economic waters carefully. According to StartupNews.fyi, this diplomatic dynamic might soon lead to a more unified approach to global digital taxation.\n\nFuture Implications for Tech Giants\n\nFor now, big tech companies operating in the UK must continue to adhere to the 2% tax on their revenues. As discussions over digital taxation evolve, both in Britain and globally, tech firms are urged to prepare for potential changes that might redefine how they contribute to the international markets they dominate. This developing narrative could shape future engagements between technology companies and governmental policies worldwide.\n\nIn summary, Britain’s resolute stance on its digital services tax highlights both its commitment to economic fairness and the nuanced interplay of global trade dynamics, setting the stage for what could be a significant shift in how digital revenues are taxed globally.","summary":"Amid a new trade deal, Britain's 2% levy on big tech revenues remains untouched, resisting critiques from the US President.","url":"https://internetprotocol.co/big-tech/2025/05/09/britains-digital-tax-on-big-tech-stays-firm-despite-us-trade-deal/","image":"https://internetprotocol.co/content/images/2025/05/3639055151.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-09 23:22:58","author":"Kay Lee","authors":["Kay Lee"],"language":"en","source_country":"co","sentiment":0.226},{"id":319723198,"title":"Supreme Court Justice Says Lawyers Can't Lose 'Battles We Are Facing'","text":"Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that as lawyers, the job is to \"stand up for people who can't do it themselves\" adding that right now, \"we can't lose the battles we are facing.\"Newsweek reached out to the Supreme Court via email Friday for comment.Why It MattersDuring his second term in office, President Donald Trump's push for mass deportations has been routinely held up in the courts.Within his first 100 days, the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, granting him authority to deport and detain noncitizens. The implementation was originally blocked in court, with a judge calling for planes to turn around mid-flight.Republican appointee Chief Justice John Roberts, in a rare statement in March, reacted to Trump calling for the impeachment of judges who've ruled against him.\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" Roberts said.What To KnowWhile speaking at an American Bar Association (ABA) event to hundreds of lawyers and judges Thursday night, Justice Sotomayor spoke on the importance of the job.\"If you're not used to fighting and losing battles, then don't become a lawyer,\" the Democratic nominee said, according to The New York Times.\"We need trained and passionate and committed lawyers to fight this fight,\" she said. \"With all the uncertainty that exists at this moment, this is our time to stand up and be heard. For me, being here with you is an act of solidarity,\" the justice said, according to the ABA.Her remarks follow Chief Justice John Roberts' comments this week as well, who said that in order for the judiciary to work, it needs to be independent.\"Its job is to obviously decide cases, but in the course of that, check the excesses of Congress or the executive, and that does require a degree of independence,\" the chief justice said in part.Justice Sotomayor was interviewed alongside D.C. federal appeals court judge J. Michelle Childs at the event. When accepting an award on Thursday, The Times reports that Childs seemingly took a swipe at the Trump administration, saying, \"We're not trying to be activist judges,\" adding, \"We're just trying to uphold the Constitution.\"The president has repeatedly taken aim at \"activist judges\" across the country who have ruled against him in immigration cases, notably calling for their impeachment. The president has also taken aim at big law firms, via executive order, for their previous advocacy work.What People Are SayingJudicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino on X, formerly Twitter, reacting to Sotomayor's remarks on Friday: \"Justice Sotomayor just told an ABA audience that 'Our job is to stand up' and that 'we can't lose the battles we are facing.' Also: 'We need trained and passionate and committed lawyers to fight this fight.' That makes a mockery of any appearance of objectivity in cases challenging the administration or involving the ABA.\"In a follow up post on X, Severino said, \"So what do the Democrats who regularly look for lame pretexts for conservative justices to recuse from cases have to say about this? And are the journos worried about the ethics of what she said or are we all good?\"David Limbaugh, conservative commentator and lawyer, on X on Friday: \"This should be considered stunning, but when it comes to leftist judges, even Supreme Court justices, I guess it's not shocking. It's still disgraceful IMHO.\"Trump on Truth Social this week: \"Our Court System is not letting me do the job I was Elected to do. Activist judges must let the Trump Administration deport murderers, and other criminals who have come into our Country illegally, WITHOUT DELAY!!!\"Former Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg previously told Newsweek via X regarding Chief Roberts' most recent comments: \"Chief Justice Roberts is very measured with his words, and tries to avoid any appearance of partisanship. That's why his mild rebukes of President Trump and Congress speak volumes. He is trying to respond to the moment, understanding that he seems to be one of the few individuals in government that Trump respects.

Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\"\n\nMiller said judges should stop blocking the deportation of undocumented immigrants in cases in which those people are exercising habeas writs.\n\nOne Democratic aide told The Hill that \"Stephen Miller is not a lawyer but he plays an (expletive) one on TV. No one in their right mind would take his advice seriously, but sanity is in short supply in this administration.\"\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, in Article 1, section 9, reads: \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"\n\nThe writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only four times, according to the National Constitution Center. They were during the Civil War from 1861 to 1865, when parts of South Carolina was overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction in 1871-1872, when two provinces in the Philippines were under unrest in 1905 and in Hawaii after the bombing at Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett and attorney Neal Katyal in 2017 wrote the Constitution \"does not specify which branch of government has the authority to suspend the privilege of the writ.

Murphy was appointed by President Joe Biden.\n\nAlso, students, including Rumeysa Ozturk at Tufts and Mahmoud Khalil at Columbia, have challenged their detention.

House GOP lawmakers have been struggling to find $1.5 trillion in spending cuts to help offset trillions of dollars of tax reductions.\n\n“The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election!” Trump wrote.\n\n“In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I’m OK if they do!!!” he continued.\n\nThe White House has made the suggestion to Congress with the thought that not only would it help achieve much needed offsets, it could also help wipe away Democrats’ argument about tax cuts for the rich, the source familiar said.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has indicated that he supports raising taxes on the wealthy, even though throughout last year’s presidential campaign, he repeatedly promised to cut their taxes. The president recently told Time magazine, “I actually love the concept,” when asked about a proposal circulating to raise taxes for those earning more than $1 million a year.\n\nThe idea, however, is not being warmly embraced among the House GOP and is far from guaranteed to make it into the president’s final “one big beautiful” bill, which aims to make permanent the sweeping Trump 2017 tax cuts and incorporate the president’s campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and certain other income.\n\nJust extending the 2017 individual tax provisions – which expire at the end of this year – could cost more than $4 trillion. Republican lawmakers are also fractured on how deeply they’d have to cut spending – including on Medicaid and food stamps – to meet their targets.\n\nWithin the House Ways and Means Committee, members have discussed two ideas. One is to let the tax breaks for the richest Americans expire, returning their top income tax rate to 39.6% – which is what it was before Trump’s 2017 tax overhaul – from the current 37%. This has drawn some criticism, however, as some Republicans fear it could impact small business owners.\n\nBut it could hit roughly 1.5 million households and cut about $409 billion of the cost, as well as greatly limit potential economic growth from making the tax cuts permanent, according to the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nAnother idea is to create a brand-new tax bracket for the wealthy. The proposal, though limited in scope, could contribute to offsetting costly tax provisions, such as restoring the state and local tax deduction – known as SALT – that has become another flashpoint in Congress’ tax debate.\n\nThe new tax bracket would raise about $59.3 billion over a decade, according to the Tax Foundation. And it would affect between 150,000 and 200,000 households and would have a much smaller dampening effect on the package’s economic growth potential.\n\nLevying a higher income tax rate on the very wealthiest of Americans would raise less money because much of that group’s earnings come from dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at lower rates, said Garrett Watson, the foundation’s director of policy analysis. Also, there are much fewer of them.\n\nOne of the considerations for Republicans is what the goal of such a provision would be – to limit how much of the benefit is going to the rich or to raise more money to offset other tax cuts, Watson said.\n\nDespite Trump’s apparent openness to raising taxes on the wealthy, his economic adviser said Friday that the president “is not a strong advocate” of the idea.\n\n“He has cited his priorities, and he understands that in the end, the final bill will include some priorities of members of the House of the Senate. That’s how the democratic process works, and that’s really what this conversation is about.”\n\nTrump reaffirmed Friday evening, however, that he’s open to taxing rich Americans, calling it “good politics.”\n\nA reporter asked Trump in the Oval Office what his message would be to conservative Republicans who warn it’s a tax increase on small business owners. Trump cast it as a “redistribution.”\n\n“People would love to do it — rich people. I would love to do it, frankly,” the president said.\n\nWhen asked how the White House expects to pay for the bill, given a number of its stated priorities are expensive, Hassett argued Congress has already identified clear areas for cuts, without detailing what they are and whether they are achievable.\n\n“Well, the budget rules in the House and the Senate are very clearly identified that include spending cuts and so on, and they don’t include dynamic scores,” he told CNN. “And so in the fullest of time with the spending cuts that we’re achieving ,and the dynamic score of the tax bill, we’re highly confident that we’re going to reduce the deficit that make bond markets celebrate.”\n\nHassett has been meeting almost weekly with Johnson, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others regarding Congress’ budget. Earlier this week, the group met in the Roosevelt Room of the White House.\n\nCNN’s Betsy Klein and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

In fact, when Trump unexpectedly won the presidency in 2016, many scrambled to rebook at his Washington hotel.\n\nIn addition, members of the Republican party and elected officials made the same arrangements as a sign of loyalty: They paid financial tribute to Trump, hoping for favors or appointments, or even pardons. When Trump sold the hotel, the GOP bookings dried up.\n\nAnd in the second term, the corruption has been even more insidious: Trump has increased his and his family’s wealth by an estimated $3 billion with crypto schemes, social media stock offerings, foreign real estate dealings and more.\n\nEven top MAGA influencers — many who also are crypto proponents — have applauded Trump’s bold leverage of the presidency for his own wealth and to further pad the bank accounts of billionaire cabinet members (with alleged market manipulation) and advisor Elon Musk (with government contracts).\n\nOthers have said they feel betrayed. \n\nBut the bottom line is: They all know Trump is grifting big-time.\n\nSo, that’s why one Democrat activist said Americans would have to be “an idiot” to believe press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s latest ridiculous lie:\n\n“I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,“ she said on Friday. ”He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service ... this is a president who has actually lost money for being president.”\n\nAs former GOP advisor David Frum said, \" ... it looks like in his second term, [Trump] thought, You know, if I ever get another chance, this time I’m going to think big. And it looks as if through his various mysterious crypto ventures, hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, are moving from all kinds of people all over the planet to himself and to his family. And again, this is shadowy. It can’t be very precise, but it looks like vastly more money than in the first term has already moved into his hands in the second.\"\n\nFrum’s podcast partner Anne Applebaum, an authoritarian expert, chimed in as she explained how Trump is operating “The Most Corrupt Presidency in American History,” pointing out four areas where Trump is using government to enrich himself, his family and cronies:\n\n— Violations of the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which says a president can’t benefit from relationships with foreigners. Trump is making real estate deals and hosting Saudi golf tournaments, to name only two examples.\n\n— By putting Musk in charge of the federal government, Trump is creating conflict of interest that will line his pockets or those of his supporters, like Musk, who are steering contracts and cash to himself. Musk gave more than $250 million to Trump’s campaign.\n\n— By installing loyalists at the Department of Justice, Trump is removing any chance that alleged corruption will be investigated.\n\n— He is engaging in direct corruption with the creation of his crypto company, World Liberty Financial, which allows people to secretly give him money.\n\nAccording to Wired, business leaders are paying as much as $5 million to meet one-on-one with the president at his Florida compound, sources tell WIRED, while others are paying $1 million to $1.5 million apiece to dine with him in a group setting.\n\nEvidence shows that the notion that Trump — whose wealth plummeted while he was out of office from 2020-2024 — sacrificed financially to be president is absurd.\n\nZack Guzmán, a crypto journalist and founder of Coinage, said that while some crypto founders and investors remain optimistic about the Trump presidency, there’s already some buyer’s remorse.\n\n“When he talked on the campaign trail about making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world, was it just about Trump trying to make money for himself and his family?” Guzmán said. “It’s definitely fair to say the latter has been his priority so far.”\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

movements’: RBA cautioned on aggressive rate cuts","text":"Australia’s central bank is being urged to learn the lessons from previous cycles and not cut interest rates in order to stop surging house prices, even in the event of a global recession.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s tariff policy is causing turmoil in financial markets, with Australia’s usual response of slashing interest rates being questioned.\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake cautioned against using interest rates as the first line of defence due to their history of punishing would-be homeowners.\n\n“When the Reserve Bank cuts the cash rate by a lot, as we saw in the GFC and Covid, what takes off is house prices,” Mr Eslake told NewsWire.\n\n“I would think and would like to think the government is thinking that if a US recession comes to pass and that pushes Australia into a recession via the impact on China, that maybe we should be cautious assuming the right response is a big cut in interest rates as that would just trigger house price movements,” he said.\n\nPropTrack data confirms this, showing Australia’s median house price is already at a record high in April, rising 0.20 per cent to $805,000, although prices in Australian cities are more expensive.\n\nSince March 2020 during the depth of the Covid lows, house prices nationally have recovered by 48.6 per cent, putting more pressure on those looking to get into the market.\n\nInstead of using the cash rate, Mr Eslake said Australia should be looking at fiscal policy from the federal government to support the national economy if there was a global recession.\n\nNED-7083-Housing-price-changes\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy has wreaked havoc on markets since its announcement on April 2, impacting just about every trading partner with the world’s largest economy.\n\nAlthough Mr Trump announced a temporary 90-day tariff pause on April 9, there is still a 145 per cent tariff on China alongside the universal 10 per cent tax on other countries that lifts the US average tariff rate to about 30 per cent.\n\nJP Morgan chief global economist Bruce Kasman said there was a 60 per cent chance of a recession due to the tariff measures.\n\n“Even with the latest step-back from the draconian Liberation Day measures, what remains is still enough to push the US and China — and thus likely the global economy — into a recession this year,” he wrote in an economic note.\n\nDespite highlighting the issues for would-be homeowners, Mr Eslake concedes there are likely to be two interest rate cuts in the short term.\n\n“I think it is very likely the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates on May 20th by 25 basis points and more likely than not they will cut in the meeting in August. but I do not hold a strong view they would do more than that,” he said.\n\n“If that happens we might get four rate cuts, but we don’t know that’s what is going to happen and the Reserve Bank doesn’t know it with the confidence it would require to cut rates before it sees evidence of it happening.”\n\nThe major banks are all calling for at least three rate cuts in 2025, with NAB being the most bullish on rate reductions.\n\nNAB economist Sally Auld on Tuesday said the RBA would cut the cash rate by 50 basis points in May, followed by 25 basis point cuts in July, August, November and February.\n\nThe major bank is expecting five cuts in this rate-cutting cycle, with the central bank needing to “catch up” with recent global developments.\n\nThis would take the cash rate down to 2.6 per cent and shave an estimated $526 off monthly repayments for the average $600,000 loan.\n\nCanstar director of data insights Sally Tindall said the major banks would likely be in a rush to pass on any rate cuts to their mortgage holders.\n\n“In this environment, I do not see a world where the banks do not pass on a rate cut to their borrowers because the bank knows better than everyone just how difficult it has been for their mortgage holders,” she said.\n\n“If we see a flurry of cuts, like what NAB is forecasting, then yes, you don’t have to look back too far in history to find evidence of banks not passing rate cuts in full or at all.\n\n“If we see a number of cuts in quick succession then we might start seeing that.”\n\nMr Eslake said: “I would be astonished if the banks tried to avoid passing on in full any reduction to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s cash rate.”","summary":"The Reserve Bank of Australia is being urged to go easy on interest rate cuts to avoid exacerbating an issue that just won’t go
