The implications for Australia are severe","text":"Hockey offers a similar view. He points to the positions taken by senior Republicans and Democrats as key factors for Australia. “Even if Donald Trump is agnostic about the defence of Taiwan, the Congress, which is an equal power source in the US, will have very definite views about China,” he says.\n\nAustralian defences are weak\n\nEven so, Australia is more vulnerable at the very point when America is less predictable. The country is badly exposed after almost two decades of domestic instability: we have had six prime ministers and four leadership spills since 2007, installing a series of one-term governments. Commonwealth debt is forecast to surpass $1 trillion next year and the budget will fall back into deficit.\n\nThe nation’s submarine fleet, the Collins class, was built over two decades from 1990. The first vessel put to sea in 1996. When the time came to replace the fleet, three Coalition governments pursued three different submarine designs over nine years: the Japanese, the French and the nuclear-propelled AUKUS plan with the US and UK. If the French deal had delivered on time, the first of 12 vessels would have arrived in the early 2030s.\n\nThe indecision and delay have left Australia with a shocking capability gap.\n\nChina has just highlighted the vulnerability by sending three warships down the east coast of Australia and into the Great Australian Bight. The Royal Australian Navy dispatched a frigate to shadow the Chinese task group. Jennifer Parker, a former Royal Australian Navy officer, says there is an urgent need for a stronger navy.\n\n“We have less ships at sea this year than we did last year, and we had less ships at sea last year than we did the year before,” says Parker, who is now an adjunct fellow at the University of New South Wales and an expert fellow at the Australian National University’s National Security College. The country only has 10 surface combatants – frigates and destroyers – in today’s fleet. This is the lowest since the 1950s.\n\n“We need to start investing, and we need to make rapid decisions,” says Parker. This is not just about the AUKUS submarines. The government’s stated plan is to acquire more vessels so we have up to 20 frigates and destroyers, but the fleet will actually shrink next year (due to decommissioning an older ship) and will not be any bigger until early next decade.\n\nHow did this happen? A decision was made to replace the frigates in 2009, but it took until 2018 for the new design to be chosen. “Nine years to make a decision was unacceptable,” says Parker. The first construction of the new frigates began in 2024. “Six years to get to the point of laying steel is also unacceptable,” she says. Others might call it scandalous.\n\nAUKUS is in doubt\n\nThe great hope for Australian security, and the great test of the American alliance, is now subject to the whims of the White House.\n\nAustralia assumes it will be able to buy at least three Virginia-class nuclear-propelled submarines from the US during the 2030s to fill the capability gap, while building the next-generation AUKUS submarines with the UK for delivery in the 2040s. But the sale of the Virginias is subject to Trump’s approval. Australia also needs US agreement to transfer the nuclear technology for the later submarines.\n\n“I’d feel a damn sight more secure if we were ready to take possession of those lethal but affordable French subs,” says Bob Carr. He believes the nuclear-propelled submarines will never arrive.\n\n“I think the Americans will have an AUKUS Plan B,” says Carr. “And it’s a frightful one: ‘We can’t do what we promised, but we will place our Virginia-class boats in your ports’ – so Fremantle becomes a Western Australian Pearl Harbour. There might be pressure on us to offer up an east coast base, like Port Kembla.”\n\nThis is the scenario in which Australia loses sovereignty. It is the outcome former prime minister Paul Keating predicted soon after AUKUS was unveiled.\n\nTurnbull, another AUKUS critic, says Trump or his successor may cite US law to stop the transfer of the Virginia vessels. The law states the president can only approve the transfer if it “will not degrade the United States undersea capabilities” and if the US has ensured “sufficient submarine production” at home. This is in subchapter III of the AUKUS Submarine Transfer Authorisation Act.\n\n“There’s got to be an honest assessment of what we do in the scenario where we don’t get any Virginia-class submarines, and potentially no British ones either,” says Turnbull.\n\nRear Admiral Peter Briggs, a former submarine commander who led two fleet bases and the RAN’s submarine capability team, says the US is falling behind in building submarines and will therefore struggle to sell any to Australia. The Congressional Budget Office says the US needs to complete two each year to replenish the fleet and meet the AUKUS requirements – a target that is not being met.\n\nBriggs comes to a dire conclusion: Australia should admit its mistake with AUKUS, go back to the French, and choose the nuclear-propelled Suffren design from Naval Group.\n\nIs there a case for AUKUS at all?\n\nThe central problem with AUKUS is that it magnifies the Australian reliance on America when America is less reliable. This is a truth that no cabinet minister or shadow minister can admit. Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles expresses full confidence in the project. So does Dutton, who was defence minister when it was announced.\n\nHegseth was jokily transactional when Marles flew to Washington earlier this month and announced the first Australian payment of $US500 million ($790 million) to the US under the AUKUS pact.\n\n“The cheque did clear,” the defence secretary quipped. This is the first instalment of a total $US3 billion to support US industry, ahead of any submarine purchases. Importantly, however, Hegseth said Trump supported AUKUS.\n\n“This is not a mission in the Indo-Pacific that America can undertake by itself,” Hegseth said. “It has to be robust. Allies and partners, technology sharing and subs are a huge part of it.” This may be a sign that Trump will stand by the deal.\n\nThe argument for AUKUS is that America will not risk losing it. Sinodinos, for instance, says AUKUS means Australia’s defence posture becomes essential to US security in the Indo-Pacific. “From now on, our mantra should be not so much that we need them, but that they need us,” he says. In this view, it means investing more in the US alliance, not less, as well as doing more in the region with countries such as Japan and South Korea.\n\n“We’re likely to get the Virginias on schedule,” says Hockey, flatly countering critics like Carr and Turnbull. “That’s because America is focusing more on the Indo-Pacific than on other battles. If the massive industrial military complex of the United States is focusing on the Indo-Pacific, it’s to our great advantage, and it makes the schedule for delivering the Virginias more likely.”\n\nHockey also rejects the idea the US will send its submarines to new bases in Australia rather than letting Australia control its own fleet. “Australia has a history of demanding to be an equal party in these sorts of partnerships,” he says. “And when we are an equal party, we are known by the Americans to deliver, and therefore they trust us.”\n\nIs defence spending too low?\n\nAustralia had two defence ministers from 1984 to 1996 – Kim Beazley and Robert Ray – but has had 15 of them since then. Most have lasted less than two years. Spending on defence will grow to $53 billion in the year to June 2026, but many voters also want generous spending on social services. This places incredible pressure on the budget in a new era when Australia cannot rely on an American security umbrella.\n\nSpending on defence is slightly above 2 per cent of GDP after falling to record lows in recent years. Defence Minister Marles says it is on track to reach 2.4 per cent in the coming years. Coalition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie says the arrival of Chinese ships in recent weeks is a reminder of the need to spend more on the military.\n\nOther American allies are facing the same questions: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer promised to lift UK spending on defence to 2.5 per cent of GDP, funded by cuts to foreign aid, on the eve of his visit to see Trump at the White House on Thursday.\n\nThe long wait for AUKUS obscures key questions about what else Australia needs. The government is buying more missiles, but the $4.1 billion guided weapons project will take until 2027 to manufacture missiles with Norwegian company Kongsberg at an Australian factory.\n\nWhat about more drones, or long-range aircraft? The country may need all of them. “There is no silver bullet solution,” says Parker, the naval warfare expert.\n\nJustin Bassi, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says the US will require more from its allies. “We have to continue showing that we are investing in our own security to ensure that the US know that maintaining their investment in our collective security is in its interests,” he says.\n\nHockey says our defence spending has to get to 3 per cent of GDP. “And in a hurry,” he adds. Turnbull, however, poses a question: why on earth did the previous government commit $3.5 billion to Abrams tanks in early 2022, just before the last election? Land warfare is not the priority.\n\n“We talk a lot about increasing our expenditure on defence, and I believe we’ll need to, but we don’t seem to focus enough about what on, what we’re actually getting for the dollar,” he says.\n\nA target of 3 per cent is immensely ambitious when Australians expect more spending on pensions, hospitals, disability care and schools. Achieving 2.4 per cent, for instance, requires spending $100 billion a year on defence by 2034. That would be as much as the country spends on the Age Pension in that year. The National Disability Insurance Scheme would be about the same, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.\n\nWill any political leader want to tell Australians to tighten their belts so we can buy more weapons?\n\nAn election debate worth having\n\n“The news at the moment is dominated by the disruptive actions of Donald Trump and the way in which he is upending American foreign policy,” says Turnbull.\n\n“But we see nowhere in the election debate any attention to what that means for Australia. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party are in lockstep in claiming that nothing has changed – that everything’s going to be the same. And we know it isn’t.”\n\nAustralia is about to enter a formal election campaign that can be rocked at any moment by a new shock from Trump. One early test is due to be decided within two weeks: will Australia gain an exemption from the president’s 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium? It seems unlikely. The cost multiplies if Trump drives the world into a trade war.\n\nAmerica has changed. Australia cannot assume the second Trump administration is a four-year blip. Trump’s catch-cry – “make America great again” – has captured voters who want a new direction for their country, which means the MAGA movement can last more than one presidency. The America First doctrine looks like isolationism one day and foreign dealmaking the next.\n\nAustralians were told to believe in the American alliance, but the past five weeks have told them they cannot take that alliance to the bank. Australia stands instead at the doorway of the Trump casino.\n\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

document dump after warning the files were 'pretty sick'","text":"Pam Bondi began 'Phase One' of releasing the long-awaited, mysterious files related to pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein Thursday evening. \n\nThe first wave of files posted on the Justice Department website have largely been circulating in the public domain for years but Bondi has promised more to come after being disgusted by what she'd seen.\n\n'What you're going to see, hopefully tomorrow, is a lot of flight logs, a lot of names, a lot of information,' Bondi told Fox on Wednesday. \n\n'But, it's pretty sick what that man did, along with his co-defendant,' referring to Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nThe Justice Department released a blacked-out list of over 250 masseuses and an evidence list showing entries for more than 150 items, including nude images, massage tables, sex toys and other items. \n\nThere wasn't any indication whether the list was from Epstein's case, Maxwell's case or some other investigation. \n\nThat was one of ten different links were posted to the DOJ website Thursday evening, which include several flight logs and Epstein's infamous 'little black book.'\n\nCelebrity names connected include the Hollywood, fashion and political elite, such as Tony Blair, Mike Bloomberg, Alex Baldwin, Courtney Love, Naomi Campbell, Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. \n\nBondi had teased the documents during a Fox News appearance Wednesday, declaring, 'Breaking news right now, you´re going to see some Epstein information released.' \n\nThe Justice Department said it was making the documents public to show its commitment to transparency.\n\nBondi suggested in a Thursday letter to FBI Director Kash Patel that more records were recently discovered. \n\nShe ordered the FBI to hand over 'the full and complete Epstein files' to her by Friday morning, and directed Patel to 'conduct an immediate investigation' into why her order to the FBI to turn over all documents was not followed.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who was in office when Epstein was arrested, suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's files.\n\nPedophile billionaire Epstein took his own life in jail on August 10, 2019, awaiting trial for sex trafficking and other heinous crimes.\n\nThe well-connected financier kept a wide circle of friends from fellow billionaires to politicians like Trump and Bill Clinton, and entertainment icons.\n\nEpstein flew numerous well-heeled friends to his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James, where some of them sexually abused children.\n\nMany Americans have been waiting for the lengthy FBI investigation files to be released publicly after Trump promised to do so before he was reelected. \n\nThe case has drawn widespread attention because of Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell´s links to royals, presidents and billionaires. \n\nMaxwell herself is the daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who once owned the New York Daily News.\n\nOver the years, thousands of pages of records have been released through lawsuits, Epstein´s criminal dockets, public disclosures and Freedom of Information Act requests. \n\nIn January 2024, a court unsealed a trove of documents that had been collected as evidence in a lawsuit filed by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.\n\nMuch of the material, including transcripts of victim interviews and old police reports, had already been publicly known. \n\nThey included mentions of Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew and magician David Copperfield, as well as testimony from one victim who said she met Jackson at Epstein´s Florida home but nothing untoward happened with him.\n\nThe previously released files included a 2016 deposition in which an accuser recounted spending several hours with Epstein at Trump´s Atlantic City casino but didn´t say if she actually met Trump and did not accuse him of any wrongdoing. \n\nThis is a developing story.","summary":"Pam Bondi began 'Phase One' of releasing the long-awaited, mysterious files related to pedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein Thursday

Google’s search data shows queries for “economic blackout” have surged in recent days.\n\n“Don’t buy stuff on February 28,” author Stephen King posted on Bluesky. “Money’s the only thing these d—- understand.”\n\nActors John Leguizamo and Bette Midler have shared similar sentiments in recent days to their social media accounts. \n\nThe call to action, or inaction in this case, comes as the prices of essentials such as groceries continue to rise, the housing market remains frozen and U.S. credit card debt has reached a record high. Adding to those woes, a closely followed consumer confidence report recently logged its sharpest decline since August 2021.\n\nSchwarz, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, also recently created a website for the protest effort — The People’s Union USA — to essentially unionize working-class people across the country.\n\nIn several videos posted online, Schwarz has said his campaign is a nonpartisan attempt at economic resistance against corporate greed, political corruption and economic exploitation. \n\nAs part of the protest effort, Schwarz is asking shoppers to halt all nonessential purchases online and in stores. If people must spend, he said, they should funnel their dollars to only small and local businesses. He is also urging people to take the day off from work if possible.\n\nSince he began promoting the idea of a 24-hour economic blackout, Schwarz has gained hundreds of thousands of new followers across TikTok and Instagram, according to the social media analytics website Social Blade.\n\n“This is not just a protest. This is our warning shot. For too long, corporations have treated the American people like an endless source of profit,” Schwarz said in a video Monday. “They raise prices because they can. They pay workers the bare minimum while raking in record profits. They also lobby politicians to keep the system rigged in their favor. But what is it they fear the most? It’s us.”\n\nEconomic analyst Mark Hamrick said he has observed a growing public awareness of wealth and income inequality, driven by what he called “the financialization of the economy, where essentially the interests of shareholders are prioritized over the interests of stakeholders.”\n\nStill, retail analyst Neil Saunders said translating online traction into action could prove difficult.\n\n“It may gain enough support to have a small impact on the day itself, but in the scheme of all the spending that goes on in the US economy it’s unlikely that it will create a huge hole,” Saunders wrote in an email, adding that many consumers will most likely only defer their spending to the following day.\n\nAfter the initial 24-hour blackout, The People’s Union has scheduled additional weeklong boycotts of specific companies throughout the year, targeting Amazon, Nestlé, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald’s. Another general 24-hour economic blackout is also scheduled for April 18.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon, Nestlé, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald’s didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nThe online movement has echoes of the Occupy Wall Street movement that broke out in 2011, a culmination of public discontent and distrust in corporations after the 2008 economic recession. The scheduled inaction, however, is a contrast to the Occupy movement, which had protesters flooding the streets for months to mobilize against economic inequality and corporate corruption.\n\nSchwarz’s campaign insists it isn’t political, and it doesn’t explicitly mention widespread cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives — which have ramped up in the wake of rhetoric from conservative pundits and recent directives from the Trump administration. Still, many online have called for the more targeted boycott of brands that have slashed their DEI efforts.\n\nSeveral political organizations have added their support to Friday’s planned blackout, specifically citing the rollback of DEI initiatives. (Such initiatives, which typically include policies geared toward ensuring fair treatment of people from different backgrounds, have become a cultural flashpoint as the Trump administration describes them as “discriminatory” and anti-merit.)\n\n“We encourage members to avoid buying anything that day unless it’s from a small, local business,” the Colorado League of Women Voters said on Instagram. “Especially avoid large companies that are rolling back or eliminating their DEI programs, including Target, Walmart, McDonald’s and Amazon.”\n\nMajor companies such as Walmart, Lowe’s, Ford and Toyota were among the first to dial back their DEI programs late last year, particularly after social media-driven campaigns by influencers like Robby Starbuck, who reported last week that PepsiCo was one of the latest to follow suit.\n\nCompanies across the country had pledged sweeping support for diversity efforts after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020 initiated a national social justice movement. But President Donald Trump has issued a slew of executive orders against DEI in his first weeks in office, some of which have faced legal hurdles as civil rights organizations sued and a federal judge blocked his administration from terminating DEI-related grants.\n\nLast month, Target also said it will end its three-year DEI goals, stop reports to external diversity-focused groups like the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index and end a program focused on carrying more products from Black- or other minority-owned businesses.\n\nThe move drew immediate calls for a boycott as shoppers urged one another to switch to Costco, which is among the companies that have expressed intentions to continue their diversity efforts. The comments on Target’s latest social media videos have been filled with mentions of Costco as users reply that they’re “[w]atching this while eating a Costco hot dog” or that they’d “rather shop at Costco!”\n\nThe boycott Friday coincides with the ongoing “Latino Freeze” movement, which similarly describes itself as a nonpartisan grassroots effort “advocating that everyday purchases be made with American businesses that support the Latino community.” Its website describes it as a response to the erosion of DEI efforts in a variety of industries, as well as the “growing fear and marginalization of our immigrant communities” as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration.\n\nThe Latino Freeze campaign urges people to shop only for essentials and avoid major purchases while supporting local businesses or businesses that support DEI and immigrant communities. It provides lists of major retailers that have demonstrated commitments to DEI, as well as lists of those that have scaled back on such initiatives.\n\n“We encourage all consumers to explore the information provided and make their own informed decisions about which companies align with their values and priorities,” the movement says on its website. “The choice to support or engage with any company is entirely up to the individual consumer.”\n\nHamrick, the economic analyst, said any visible impact from large-scale boycott campaigns would most likely require more consistency — which is difficult to achieve when many people in the United States depend on chain corporations for their daily purchases.\n\n“If there were more substantial and sustained movement toward buying local, targeting privately owned businesses, that could gain some momentum,” Hamrick said. “One of the challenges is there aren’t many choices out there. In other words, how many entities can you do business with that fit this description over a long period of time? And the answer is there aren’t many.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAn effort to encourage U.S. consumers to participate in a day of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Understanding the

from the Trump administration – listen to Welcome to MAGAland here\n\nBy CHARLIE SPIERING, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, WASHINGTON, DC\n\nPublished: 00:24 GMT, 28 February 2025 | Updated: 00:45 GMT, 28 February 2025\n\nFormer White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre revealed what it was like during her last year in the job, as she scrambled to cover for former President Joe Biden in his last weeks of his reelection campaign.\n\nJean-Pierre participated in an event at the Institute of Politics Harvard Kennedy School to talk about the historic 2024 campaign, where her boss former President Joe Biden was forced out of the race after his disastrous debate performance in June 2024.\n\n‘Personally what I think was the toughest thing in the three weeks, there was a disconnect for me what was happening in the leadership of the Democratic party,’ Jean-Pierre said.\n\nAfter his disastrous first debate performance against former President Donald Trump, Democratic party donors and leaders

Immediate, Extremely Strong Response: Canada on US' Tariffs","text":"Ottawa [Canada], February 28 (ANI): Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday issued a warning regarding the potential imposition of tariffs by the United States, stating that \"Canada will have an immediate and extremely strong response,\" CBC News reported.\n\"We will continue to do that work and do everything necessary to avoid these tariffs coming in, but like I said, if on Tuesday there are unjustified tariffs brought in on Canada, we will have an immediate and extremely strong response, as Canadians expect,\" Trudeau said.\nAlso Read | Famous Birthdays on February 28: Hazel Keech, Ravindra Jain, David Willey and Sunil Varma - Know About Influential Figures Born on February 28.\nThe statement comes amid growing tensions over trade between the two countries. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the flow of illicit drugs into the US, allegedly coming from both Canada and Mexico.\nAs a result, Trump has decided to move forward with the imposition of tariffs on both countries, starting March 4. Additionally, reciprocal tariffs are set to continue with full force from April 2.\nAlso Read | Air India Says Connection Time for Flights From Europe to Australia, South East Asia via India Reduced to 2-and-Half Hours.\nFurther, Trudeau added that, \"the first thing on tariffs is to emphasise that our government, and indeed all of Team Canada, premiers, business leaders, community leaders, are focused on one thing, making sure that come Tuesday and for the weeks that follow, there are no tariffs imposed on Canada,\" as per CBC News.\n\"The tariffs that the president speaks of for next week are centered around the fentanyl crisis that they're facing in the United States, but that we are also facing in Canada,\" he added.\nAddressing concerns regarding fentanyl trafficking into the United States, he said \"And for months now, I've been emphasising that less than one per cent of the fentanyl that arrives in the United States comes from Canada. But we know that even that one per cent, or less than one per cent, should be reduced, which is why we've invested USD 1.3 billion in strengthening our border capacities with Blackhawk helicopters, with drones, with 10,000 people patrolling our borders and keeping Canadians and Americans safe. \"And that Canada is not the source of problems for the United States,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, on February 4, the US President paused tariffs on imports from both countries for 30 days, saying that he had secured new commitments from the two countries to improve border security. The pause was put in place after President Trump said he spoke to his counterparts from Mexico and Canada.\n\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by China. More than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\nCiting the smuggling of drugs across the border, Trump has vowed to stop or \"seriously limit\" such drugs, especially Fentanyl.\n\"Millions of people have died over the last two decades. The families of the victims are devastated and, in many instances, virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH 4 will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" read Trump's post.\nIn addition, China will also be charged an additional 10 per cent tariff from March 4.

Just last week, AP journalists were removed from the president’s trip to Mar-a-Lago and Miami after refusing to use the White House’s preferred term, “Gulf of America,” instead of the Gulf of Mexico.Baker took to social media on Tuesday to express his concerns, likening the Trump administration’s move to Kremlin tactics.“Having served as a Moscow correspondent in the early days of Putin’s reign, this reminds me of how the Kremlin took over its own press pool and made sure that only compliant journalists were given access,” he wrote on X.Leavitt swiftly fired back with a clown emoji, followed by a sharp rebuttal.“Give me a break, Peter,” she responded.She pointed out that “moments after” Baker’s X post, Trump had invited journalists into the Oval Office for nearly an hour of questions. Leavitt dismissed Baker’s concerns as “hysterical” and defended the White House’s decision as a necessary change to an outdated system.She then took a direct jab at Baker and the wider media landscape, posting on X she said, “Gone are the days where left-wing stenographers posing as journalists, such as yourself, dictate who gets to ask what.”For decades, the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) has determined press access, deciding which journalists could cover the president most closely. However, that changed earlier this week when Leavitt announced the administration would now take full control of the selection process.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1onz2ReKRQ“A group of DC-based journalists, the White House Correspondents’ Association, has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the President of the United States. Not anymore,” Leavitt said.She called the move a step towards fairness.“Today, I was proud to announce that we are giving the power back to the people,” she said. “Moving forward, the ‘White House Press Pool’ will be determined by the White House Press Team.”Leavitt assured that traditional outlets would not be excluded but insisted that access decisions would now rest with the administration.Baker responded with another sharp critique, suggesting the move was designed to silence tough questioning.“Every president of both parties going back generations subscribed to the principle that a president doesn’t pick the press corps that is allowed in the room to ask him questions,” he wrote. “Trump has just declared that he will.”He vowed that professional journalism would continue as usual.“None of this will stop professional news outlets from covering this president in the same full, fair, tough and unflinching way that we always have. Government efforts to punish disfavoured organisations will not stop independent journalism,” Baker said.— peterbakernyt (@peterbakernyt) “The United States is not Russia by any means, and any comparisons risk going too far… But for those of us who reported there a quarter century ago, Mr Trump’s Washington is bringing back memories of Mr Putin’s Moscow in the early days,” Baker wrote.A New York Times spokesperson also criticised the White House’s new approach.“The White House’s move to handpick favoured reporters to observe the president — and exclude anyone whose coverage the administration may not like — is an effort to undermine the public’s access to independent, trustworthy information about the most powerful person in America,” the newspaper said in a statement.","summary":"Karoline Leavitt, newly appointed White House press secretary, criticized New York Times journalist Peter Baker for comparing President Trump’s media tactics to those of Russian President Putin.

The meeting was the latest in ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations, which have radically shifted since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.\n\nIn exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico crack down on cartels, illegal migration and fentanyl production, despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year.

Caro Quintero, for whose arrest the U.S. had offered a $20 million reward, was number one on that list, according to the person.\n\nThe person said President Claudia Sheinbaum’s government, in a rush to seek favor with the Trump administration and show itself a strong ally in the fight against the cartels, bypassed the formalities of the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty to remove Caro Quintero and the other defendants.\n\nThat means it could potentially allow prosecutors in the U.S. to try him for Camarena’s murder — something not contemplated in the existing extradition request to face separate drug trafficking charges in a Brooklyn federal court.\n\n“If he’s being sent to the U.S. outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn’t place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the U.S. wants,” according to Bonnie Klapper, a former federal narcotics prosecutor in Brooklyn who is familiar with the case.\n\nThe U.S. had sought the extradition of Caro Quintero shortly after his arrest in 2022.

Kennedy Jr., during his 2024 independent presidential campaign, was a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin. He actively campaigned for establishing a US Bitcoin Reserve, and pro-crypto leadership in the White House. He even disclosed significant investments in bitcoin which included a purchase of 21 Bitcoins with three allocated for each of his children.\n\nKennedy views Bitcoin as a safeguard against inflation and a means to stabilize the U.S. dollar. He actively proposed that the U.S. Treasury should acquire Bitcoin to strengthen the nation's financial position. He suggested purchasing 550 Bitcoins daily until amassing a reserve of 4 million Bitcoins. This initiative aimed to bolster the U.S. dollar and provide a hedge against inflation.\n\nAs of February 13, 2025, the Senate voted 52-48 to confirm Kennedy as the new Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As the newly appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under President Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has outlined several healthcare policies that reflect his longstanding views and recent administrative actions.\n\n1. Vaccine Policies and Public Health Initiatives\n\nKennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, has influenced significant changes in public health messaging. Notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were directed to suspend their flu vaccination advertising campaign, shifting the focus toward \"informed consent\" rather than promotion.\n\nThis directive aligns with Kennedy's emphasis on vaccine safety and personal choice.\n\nRecent events have tested this stance. A measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico resulted in the death of an unvaccinated child and numerous hospitalizations. Public health experts are urging the administration to actively promote vaccinations to curb the outbreak, highlighting the tension between Kennedy's vaccine policies and emergent public health crises.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nActor Gene Hackman And His Wife Found Dead With Pills Scattered Nearby, Police Say\n\nTrump’s DOJ Still Hasn’t Publicly Released Jeffrey Epstein Files—What To Know As ‘Phase 1’ Binders Spotted\n\nWarner Bros.

Chronic Disease and Mental Health Medication Oversight\n\nUpon taking office, Kennedy chaired the \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) Commission, tasked with investigating the prevalence of chronic childhood diseases and assessing the impact of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\n\nThis initiative reflects his commitment to scrutinizing pharmaceutical practices and their effects on public health.\n\n3. Definition of Sex and Gender in Healthcare\n\nUnder Kennedy's leadership, the HHS redefined sex as an immutable biological classification, effectively excluding transgender and intersex individuals from certain healthcare protections. This policy change has faced criticism for disregarding scientific complexities and potentially undermining civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ communities.\n\n4. Healthcare Coverage and System Reform\n\nHistorically, Kennedy has expressed support for a single-payer healthcare system that coexists with private insurance options. However, he acknowledges the political challenges of implementing such a system. He also advocates for the inclusion of alternative and holistic therapies within the mainstream healthcare framework, aiming to diversify treatment options available to patients.\n\nSecretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s healthcare stance emphasize vaccine safety and personal choice, critical evaluation of pharmaceutical practices, traditional definitions of sex and gender in healthcare, and the integration of alternative therapies into the healthcare system. These policies have sparked considerable debate and are poised to significantly influence the direction of U.S. healthcare under his tenure.

The bill would establish a stronger federal precedent to keep trans athletes out of women's and girls' sports as multiple states defy President Donald Trump's recent executive order to address the issue. But despite a Republican majority in the Senate, the bill will still need support from seven Democrats in order to beat the filibuster and reach the president's desk. In the House of Representatives, all but two Democrats voted against the bill. For women athletes across the country who have been impacted by trans inclusion, they are holding out hope that more Democratic senators will break from the party's general stance. Former San Jose State University volleyball player Brooke Slusser, who was at the center of a widely-publicized national controversy in the fall after suing her school, conference and the NCAA citing her experience with a trans teammate, is asking those Democrats to consider the well-being of their daughters and other young female athletes across the country. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Do they have kids? Would they ever want their daughter having a man swinging a crazy ball straight at their face when they're a child? Maybe even unknowingly, and then they can never play sports again,\" Slusser told Fox News Digital of her message to those Democrats. \"How can you think of that and still want to fight for something that could potentially injure and end a young athlete's career? And overall, that it's just not fair. I feel like I could go on and on to them about it. I just don't see how they could support it.\" Slusser's lawsuits allege she was made to share changing and sleeping spaces with trans teammate Blaire Fleming during their first season together in 2023. After months of speaking out against trans inclusion and garnering national media attention, Slusser recently made the decision to leave SJSU's campus after facing alleged threats and harassment from other students over her stance. Still, she doesn't regret any of it due to her activism helping to inspire legislative changes, including potentially the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Meanwhile, fellow women's athletes Payton McNabb and Selina Soule went to the White House on Thursday to meet with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondie and several other state attorneys general across the nation to share their stories and to lobby for the national banishment of trans athletes in girls' and women's sports. Soule is a former high school track and field athlete and four-time National Qualifier who was forced out of a regional championship due to two trans athletes taking women’s spots and who lost out on the chance to earn attention from college scouts and potential scholarships because of those snubs. It was a consequential turning point in her life that set her on the path to activism; she first started speaking out against trans inclusion to local media in 2018. DEMOCRAT VOTERS ABANDON PARTY AFTER AOC, JEFFRIES SAY ANTI-TRANS ATHLETE BILL EMPOWERS SEXUAL PREDATORS \"I would tell all of those senators that are unsure about this bill to think about your daughters, think about your nieces and granddaughters. Would you want them to be forced into a situation where they have to compete against someone who is physically superior to them? Would you be okay with them sharing a bathroom, changing next to a man, sharing a bed with a man if they didn't want to?\" Soule asked. \"If you say no to any of that, then vote for this bill to protect women and girls.\" McNabb, a former volleyball player who received a spike to the head from a transgender player when she was 17 that caused brain trauma and a neck injury, wants to remind the Democrats that most Americans, including the majority of their own voters, oppose trans inclusion in girls' and women's sports, according to various data. \"The time is now to vote and to stand up for women and these basic rights that they deserve, because the majority of America agrees with this, and a lot of Democrats agree with this as well, but I don't understand why they won't vote on it, they try to push this agenda so hard,\" McNabb said. \"Think about your daughters, think about every woman in your life, because this affects them and their vote matters, and they need to vote for them.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McNabb and Soule hope that their conversations with the state attorneys general on Thursday will ultimately result in conversations between those attorneys general and Democratic senators in their states, and get the bill enough votes to make it to Trump's desk. Prominent Republican leader Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., does expect the bill to get some bipartisan support, she previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"I would expect there would be, I would hope there would be,\" she said. \"Many of my friends who are Democrats will tell you that they think Title IX is a thing and to have biological males competing against women is inappropriate, and they want opportunities for their daughters or nieces or granddaughters, and it's frustrating to them when they hear about or witness a transgender male playing in a women's or girls' league.\" A recent New York Times/Ipsos survey found the vast majority of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, do not think transgender athletes should be permitted to compete in women's sports. Of the 2,128 people who participated, 79% said biological males who identify as women should not be allowed to participate in women's sports. Of the 1,025 people who identified as Democrats or leaning Democrat, 67% said transgender athletes should not be allowed to compete with women.

Yields on Nigeria’s $1.5 billion eurobond due in 2034 have declined to 9.69 per cnt, the lowest since its early December launch, and a domestic debt auction was three-times oversubscribed recently, with the Open Market Operation bills allotted at 21.45 per cent versus 22.65 per cent.\n\nEconomic prospects\n\nThe Nigeria’s economy and businesses will have so many things to cheer in 2025 and the impact of the economic reforms in FX market, exchange and huge budge outlays begin to pay off for them.\n\nNigeria’s economy is already exiting the most painful phase of the reform adjustment process in 2025, Non-Executive Director of Parthian Partners, Bismarck Rewane has predicted.\n\nRewane projected that the economy would begin to recover from the toughest phase of its reform adjustments by 2025, emphasizing the importance of strategic policy implementation and institutional reforms.\n\nHe noted that while the fundamentals of Nigeria’s exchange rate indicate that the Naira should be stronger, achieving stability depends on an efficient and effectively managed FX system.\n\nHe stressed that the primary challenge lies not in the reforms themselves but in their management, citing poorly sequenced policy changes and insufficient structural reforms as significant obstacles.\n\nHe underlined the critical role of investment in driving economic growth. “Revenue alone is not enough,” Rewane stated. “Investment is key, but it will be influenced by confidence, transparency, and the right policies,” he added.\n\nHe also called attention to persistent challenges such as power supply inefficiencies and the lack of transparency in the oil and gas sector, which require immediate attention through structural reforms.\n\nRewane said that 2025 is going to be less hard, less painful, less difficult than last year. He said the fact that things were so difficult in 2024, does not in anyway indicate that the difficulties will persist this year.\n\nAssociate Dean of Lagos Business School, Professor Olayinka David-West, emphasised the importance of adopting a “digital-first mindset,” advocating for the use of technology and AI to improve fiscal discipline and economic planning.\n\nDirector-General/CEO of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Chinyere Almona, identified high energy costs as a major driver of inflation and stressed the need to resolve power supply issues to stabilise prices.\n\nCEO of NGX Regulation Limited, Olufemi Shobanjo, emphasised the role of liquidity in capital markets, stressing initiatives that enhance investor confidence and ensure market stability.\n\nExecutive Director of Parthian Group, Yemi Sadiku, highlighted the need for an enabling environment to attract infrastructure investment, urging the government to create policies that encourage private sector participation.\n\nAs Rewane aptly remarked, “the things outside our control far exceed what we can control, but by addressing these root causes, Nigeria can unlock sustainable growth and economic stability.”\n\nChief Executive Officer, FirstBank Group, Olusegun Alebiosu said the improving government revenues, improved revenue-to-debt service ratio at 68 per cent and the growth in foreign reserve balances to over $40 billion represent positive indicators for the economy.\n\nHe further said: “Early signs such as the stability that characterised the forex market after the introduction of the electronic foreign exchange matching system in December 2024; the emergence of competition on the supply side of our nation’s downstream sector that is leading to falling prices in premium motor spirit (PMS) and the coming back on stream of the Port Harcourt & Warri refineries are indicative that there is, indeed, light at the end of the tunnel for us as a country.”\n\nAlebiosu said the sheer timing of the emergence of these developments has strengthened optimism about the Nigerian economy, especially coming into the new year 2025. Also, the government’s proposed N49.7 trillion 2025 budget is expected to provide sufficient economic stimulus in view of the lower\n\nThe naira broke key resistance levels at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) began the implementation of the new Electronic Foreign Exchange Matching System (EFEMS)\n\nlikelihood for poor budget implementation due to improving government’s revenue position, adding that the projected GDP growth rate of 3.68 per cent for 2025 is a very likely outcome.\n\nHe disclosed that due to the impacts of some of the “painful but necessary” reforms that the Government had pursued, inflationary pressures exerted considerable strain on household and corporate incomes in 2024, with the inflation rate reaching a three-decades high of 34.60 per cent in November 2024.\n\nIn response, the Central Bank of Nigeria, through its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), had steadily raised the benchmark Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 27.5 per cent in a bid to tame inflationary pressures.\n\nThe combination of these actions has resulted in significantly higher cost of living/operations and funding for households and corporates.\n\nAlso speaking, Founder and Chief Consultant of B. Adedipe Associates Limited, ‘Biodun Adedipe, said that pressure in the forex market will continue to drop in the coming months, which will lead to rebound in the naira exchange rate against global currencies.\n\nHe said the improvement in local oil production has contributed significantly to reduced pressure in the forex market. Adedipe said the fundamental problems of developing countries have been reduced food deficit, energy deficit and manufacturing deficit.\n\nHe called for an expansive domestic manufacturing, agribusiness and relentless, deliberate and focused export drive in the new year.\n\nExchange rate stability\n\nThe naira broke key resistance levels at the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) began the implementation of the new Electronic Foreign Exchange Matching System (EFEMS).\n\nThe platform, addresses long-standing issues of market opacity and inefficiency by facilitating smooth trading and consistency among participants. In the currency market, the naira appreciated against the dollar across all segments.\n\nCBN Governor, Olayemi Cardoso, had at the 2024 Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) dinner held November 29 in Lagos, expressed strong optimism that measures being deployed by his administration will deliver benefits that would be felt by every Nigerian in no distant time.\n\nHe said the need for reassurance on the expected outcomes from policy measures being deployed by the CBN was necessitated by the growing pains of Nigerians due to the further deterioration of key macroeconomic variables (notably, inflation and exchange rate) that are within the purview of the monetary policy authority relative to when he assumed office last year September.\n\nCardoso over time, prioritized stabilising the exchange rate, curbing inflation, strengthening banks’ capital buffers, and fostering an environment conducive to the success of both businesses and individuals.\n\nBesides, the CBN under Cardoso also initiated banking industry recapitalisation to strengthen capital buffers for banks and redefined Net Open Position ceiling for banks (25 per cent short and zero per cent long on foreign currency) to unlock FX liquidity.\n\nOn recapitalisation of banks, Cardoso said: “This strategic move ensures that banks are well-capitalized, enabling them to take on greater risks, particularly in underserved markets.\n\nWith stronger capital bases, banks can provide more loans and financial products to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), rural communities, and other vulnerable segments that have previously struggled to access formal financial services.”\n\nCardoso said the recapitalisation policy not only strengthens financial stability but also serves as a catalyst for inclusive growth.\n\n“By enabling banks to extend more credit to MSMEs, we enhance job creation and productivity. Furthermore, with increased capital, banks can invest in technology and innovation, crucial for driving digital financial services such as mobile money and agent banking.\n\nThese technologies are key to breaking down geographic and economic barriers, bringing financial services to even the most remote areas,” he added.\n\nMore views \n\nAnalysts at Commercio Partners said Nigeria’s financial landscape had seen significant developments with the CBN introducing revised guidelines to enhance transparency and gover nance in the foreign exchange market.\n\nThese guidelines emphasize ethical practices, real-time reporting, and regulated interbank trading while mandating compliance from banks, dealers, and BDC operators.\n\nManaging Director, Afrinvest West Africa Limited, Ike Chioke said naira recovery could be attributed to improved market confidence following the successful launch of the EFEMS designed to promote trading transparency.\n\n“Also, the liquidity supply boost provided by Nigeria’s successful pricing of $2.2 billion in Eurobonds earlier last week significantly boosted the exchange rate position against the dollar.\n\nWe anticipate the Naira to regain more ground against the dollar, driven by aforementioned factors,” he said. Chioke, listed other key policies of the apex bank that supported naira rally as the clearance of the $7 billion FX backlog and resumed sales of Open Market Operation (OMO) bills to Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) at market reflective rates.\n\nCBN’s policies, including the exchange rate unification, have led to significant foreign capital inflows to the economy while reducing the its intervention in the forex market.\n\nThe floatation of the naira and the clearing of over $7 billion FX backlog improved the country’s outlook with foreign investors as well as multilateral organizations, like the World Bank describing it as bold intervention to improve the economy’s sustainability in the long run.\n\nCardoso disclosed that upon assuming office, his leadership prioritised rebuilding Nigeria’s economic buffers and strengthening resilience.\n\nBefore he assumed office, inflation, which had surged to 27 per cent, was one of the most pressing challenges, partly driven by excessive money supply growth.\n\nWhile the GDP growth had stagnated at a meagre 1.8 per cent over the previous eight years, money supply expanded rapidly, averaging about 13 per cent growth annually.\n\nThis imbalance not only fueled inflation but also contributed to a significant depreciation of the naira. He explained that inflation creates uncertainty for households and businesses, acting as a silent tax by eroding purchasing power and driving up living costs.","summary":"ShareEmployment and the nation’s economy will soon experience a boost as investors across the globe are swooping on Nigerian assets as the impact of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) reforms in the financial sector spreads to key sectors of the economy, Sunday Ojeme reports &#160; Nigeria is finally getting a favorable nod from investors,...\n\n\nThe post Job Boost As Nigerian Assets Attract Investors On Reform Benefits’ Spread appeared first on New Telegraph.","url":"https://newtelegraphng.com/job-boost-as-nigerian-assets-attract-investors-on-reform-benefits-spread/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot_20250227-172055.jpg?fit=800%2C526&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 00:15:22","author":"Sunday Ojeme","authors":["Sunday Ojeme"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":295114560,"title":"World News | Trump Says 'yes' to King Charles' Invitation for State Visit","text":"Washington, DC [US], February 28 (ANI): King Charles III extended an invitation to United States President Donald Trump for an official state visit to the United Kingdom, The Hill reported.\nDuring their meeting on Thursday in Washington, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer brought a letter from Charles to their meeting in the Oval Office, during which Trump called Charles a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man.\"\nAlso Read | Famous Birthdays on February 28: Hazel Keech, Ravindra Jain, David Willey and Sunil Varma - Know About Influential Figures Born on February 28.\n\"This is a letter from Your Majesty, the king.

And after expressing concern that oil prices and other uncertainties threatened to tip Alberta into its first deficit since the height of the COVID pandemic, his budget brought in the rate cut anyhow.\n\nWhen Smith told CBC News in December that she'd be OK with going into deficit to bring in her tax cut, she also said Horner had \"robust conversations\" with her on this question, and he tended to be the cautious sort of finance minister.\n\nHorner made that reluctance clear when asked about it Thursday.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the position that we're in with the tariffs coming in — the uncertainty — I might have had to get drug [dragged] to this point if I was going to do this,\" Horner told reporters. \"Balanced budgets mean a lot to me.\"\n\nDanielle and Donald\n\nIt would appear, based on that assertion, that Smith's own lobbying proved less persuasive than the high likelihood that U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on Canada. A tax cut that could save individuals up to $750 a year, Horner now reasons, offers some affordability relief against the coming economic blow.\n\nHistorically, balanced budgets have meant a lot to Albertans, too, including former premier Ralph Klein's triumphant erasure of the provincial debt two decades ago, and Jason Kenney's return to surpluses after the oil-price slump and recession the NDP government oversaw.\n\nBut these days, Horner isn't sure he's governing over a province of anti-deficit hawks. The minister says he tells provincial counterparts: \"I don't know how fiscally conservative Albertans are, but they're definitely tax averse.\"\n\nSmith's first budgets as premier hiked spending more in two years than Rachel Notley's NDP did over four, and 2025's edition raises spending in many areas, largely to keep up with the rapid growth that will push Alberta's population past five million this year.\n\nShe and Horner appear to have judged that the populace doesn't want the sort of Klein-era cuts that chased away unbalanced budgets. Rather, Albertans may want a little extra something for themselves if the government is adding to taxpayer debt instead of curbing it.\n\n\"Conservatives, we don't like deficits. We're allergic to them,\" conservative strategist Sarah Biggs told the West of Centre podcast this week.\n\n\"But if the deficit is caused because of a tax cut to the middle class, I think they will be OK.\"\n\nWill the big question marks around Trump tariffs add to the public's deficit tolerance? \n\nCertain uncertainties\n\nThe province based its budget on the assumption that the president will slap 10 per cent tariffs on Canadian oil and gas soon, and that tariffs on other exports will average 15 per cent for the year — the calculation being that the tariffs will either be less than the 25 per cent Trump has declared, or that they won't stick around for the whole year.\n\nIf it's worse than projected — and as tough as Trump has threatened — Alberta's deficit will be nearly $9 billion this year, the province could flirt with recession, and unemployment could reach eight per cent next year, according to provincial forecasts.\n\nJoblessness in Alberta hasn't been that high, outside the pandemic spike, since the rough patch in 2016 and 2017.\n\nAlberta's budget-makers are perennially used to unpredictability, having to guess what global oil prices and the exchange rate will do for the year ahead. In fact, the \"low\" and \"high\" scenarios in past financial blueprints have been far greater than in Budget 2025.\n\nBut those are based on economists' best predictions on crude price and other indicators. This year, the province's optimistic and pessimistic scenarios narrowly focused on a single highly volatile factor: what one man in the White House will decide to do on Canadian trade.\n\nAnother slice of the Smith government's first deficit is due to a contingency fund set at $4 billion, not the $2 billion of past years — some of it to cope with climate-related disasters like wildfires, some to potentially settle employee wage negotiations, and some to brace for necessary relief programs in response to tariffs.\n\nBritish Columbia's government considered the same dire economic threat from our neighbours and decided to backtrack on the affordability measure its NDP government pledged in an election. It cancelled a $1,000 grocery rebate — which would have been more of a temporary bit of relief than Alberta's permanent tax rate cut.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Nova Scotia last week tabled the first pre-tariff budget. Stop us if this sounds familiar to Albertans: that province's Conservatives introduced a deficit budget that sets aside a reserve for tariff relief, but also cuts income tax rates.\n\nEven federal Liberals campaigning for the party leadership would see their own ideas in what Horner did. Both Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland are promising middle-class tax breaks in budgets that wouldn't yet be balanced.\n\nHorner is forecasting that Alberta budgets for 2026 and 2027 will feature deficits as well, but provincial fiscal policy would require a return to balance after that.\"We do need a path out of this,\" the minister said.\n\nTrump will still be president in 2028, and it's difficult enough to peg where oil prices will be for the rest of this year, let alone later this decade.\n\nBut as for Horner, he's hoping that Albertans — and his premier, presumably — will have an appetite for some of the restraint and sacrifice he believes in to end this red-ink streak.","summary":"Nate Horner really didn't want a deficit.

What does that mean?","text":"An effort to encourage U.S. consumers to participate in a day of protest by not spending money Friday has picked up momentum online, with thousands of people across social media saying they plan to take part in the “economic blackout.” Started roughly a month ago by John Schwarz, a Chicago-area medication and mindfulness educator, the idea has taken off on social media, where searches for the term surface hundreds of posts of people sharing screenshots of infographics and encouraging others to participate in the protest. Google’s search data shows queries for “economic blackout” have surged in recent days. “Don’t buy stuff on February 28,” author Stephen King posted on Bluesky. “Money’s the only thing these d---- understand.” Actors John Leguizamo and Bette Midler have shared similar sentiments in recent days to their social media accounts. The call to action, or inaction in this case, comes as the prices of essentials such as groceries continue to rise, the housing market remains frozen and U.S. credit card debt has reached a record high. Adding to those woes, a closely followed consumer confidence report recently logged its sharpest decline since August 2021. Schwarz, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, also recently created a website for the protest effort — The People’s Union USA — to essentially unionize working-class people across the country. In several videos posted online, Schwarz has said his campaign is a nonpartisan attempt at economic resistance against corporate greed, political corruption and economic exploitation. As part of the protest effort, Schwarz is asking shoppers to halt all nonessential purchases online and in stores. If people must spend, he said, they should funnel their dollars to only small and local businesses. He is also urging people to take the day off from work if possible. Since he began promoting the idea of a 24-hour economic blackout, Schwarz has gained hundreds of thousands of new followers across TikTok and Instagram, according to the social media analytics website Social Blade. “This is not just a protest. This is our warning shot. For too long, corporations have treated the American people like an endless source of profit,” Schwarz said in a video Monday. “They raise prices because they can. They pay workers the bare minimum while raking in record profits. They also lobby politicians to keep the system rigged in their favor. But what is it they fear the most? It’s us.” Economic analyst Mark Hamrick said he has observed a growing public awareness of wealth and income inequality, driven by what he called “the financialization of the economy, where essentially the interests of shareholders are prioritized over the interests of stakeholders.” Still, retail analyst Neil Saunders said translating online traction into action could prove difficult. “It may gain enough support to have a small impact on the day itself, but in the scheme of all the spending that goes on in the US economy it’s unlikely that it will create a huge hole,” Saunders wrote in an email, adding that many consumers will most likely only defer their spending to the following day. After the initial 24-hour blackout, The People’s Union has scheduled additional weeklong boycotts of specific companies throughout the year, targeting Amazon, Nestlé, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald’s. Another general 24-hour economic blackout is also scheduled for April 18. Representatives for Amazon, Nestlé, Walmart, General Mills, Target and McDonald’s didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. The online movement has echoes of the Occupy Wall Street movement that broke out in 2011, a culmination of public discontent and distrust in corporations after the 2008 economic recession. The scheduled inaction, however, is a contrast to the Occupy movement, which had protesters flooding the streets for months to mobilize against economic inequality and corporate corruption. Schwarz’s campaign insists it isn’t political, and it doesn’t explicitly mention widespread cuts to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives — which have ramped up in the wake of rhetoric from conservative pundits and recent directives from the Trump administration. Still, many online have called for the more targeted boycott of brands that have slashed their DEI efforts. Several political organizations have added their support to Friday’s planned blackout, specifically citing the rollback of DEI initiatives. (Such initiatives, which typically include policies geared toward ensuring fair treatment of people from different backgrounds, have become a cultural flashpoint as the Trump administration describes them as “discriminatory” and anti-merit.) “We encourage members to avoid buying anything that day unless it’s from a small, local business,” the Colorado League of Women Voters said on Instagram. “Especially avoid large companies that are rolling back or eliminating their DEI programs, including Target, Walmart, McDonald’s and Amazon.” Major companies such as Walmart, Lowe’s, Ford and Toyota were among the first to dial back their DEI programs late last year, particularly after social media-driven campaigns by influencers like Robby Starbuck, who reported last week that PepsiCo was one of the latest to follow suit. Companies across the country had pledged sweeping support for diversity efforts after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020 initiated a national social justice movement. But President Donald Trump has issued a slew of executive orders against DEI in his first weeks in office, some of which have faced legal hurdles as civil rights organizations sued and a federal judge blocked his administration from terminating DEI-related grants. Last month, Target also said it will end its three-year DEI goals, stop reports to external diversity-focused groups like the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index and end a program focused on carrying more products from Black- or other minority-owned businesses. The move drew immediate calls for a boycott as shoppers urged one another to switch to Costco, which is among the companies that have expressed intentions to continue their diversity efforts. The comments on Target’s latest social media videos have been filled with mentions of Costco as users reply that they’re “[w]atching this while eating a Costco hot dog” or that they’d “rather shop at Costco!” The boycott Friday coincides with the ongoing “Latino Freeze” movement, which similarly describes itself as a nonpartisan grassroots effort “advocating that everyday purchases be made with American businesses that support the Latino community.” Its website describes it as a response to the erosion of DEI efforts in a variety of industries, as well as the “growing fear and marginalization of our immigrant communities” as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration. The Latino Freeze campaign urges people to shop only for essentials and avoid major purchases while supporting local businesses or businesses that support DEI and immigrant communities. It provides lists of major retailers that have demonstrated commitments to DEI, as well as lists of those that have scaled back on such initiatives. “We encourage all consumers to explore the information provided and make their own informed decisions about which companies align with their values and priorities,” the movement says on its website. “The choice to support or engage with any company is entirely up to the individual consumer.” Hamrick, the economic analyst, said any visible impact from large-scale boycott campaigns would most likely require more consistency — which is difficult to achieve when many people in the United States depend on chain corporations for their daily purchases. “If there were more substantial and sustained movement toward buying local, targeting privately owned businesses, that could gain some momentum,” Hamrick said. “One of the challenges is there aren’t many choices out there. In other words, how many entities can you do business with that fit this description over a long period of time? And the answer is there aren’t many.”","summary":"An effort to encourage U.S. consumers to participate in a day of protest by not spending money Friday has picked up momentum online, with thousands of people across social media saying they plan to take part in the “economic blackout.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/consumers-plan-economic-blackout-feb-28-rcna193767","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240514-walmart-ch-1434-b75fd5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 00:10:51","author":"Angela Yang","authors":["Angela Yang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":295110712,"title":"Stories We Can’t Stop Thinking About: Deepfakes, the Tesla Backlash, and All Things Chips","text":"You can follow Michael Calore on Bluesky at @snackfight, Lauren Goode on Bluesky at @laurengoode, and Zoë Schiffer on Threads @reporterzoe.

How's everyone doing?\nLauren Goode: I am good. I am feeling better than I was feeling last week, I was a little bit sick. I have to say, I'm excited about a gadget right now.\nZoe Schiffer: Uh-oh.\nMichael Calore: Lauren!\nLauren Goode: I know.\nMichael Calore: You're excited about a gadget.\nLauren Goode: It's like the old days of the Gadget Lab. It's been such a long time since I've been excited about a new piece of hardware, but I am.\nMichael Calore: OK. Is it a Tesla?\nLauren Goode: Yes. It's the model ... Actually, I got all of the models, S, E, X, Y. Isn't that what they're called now? X3. Oh, God. I really bungled that one, didn't I? No, it's not a Tesla. It's not.\nIt's the Oura Ring. It's not new, but new to me. Have you guys heard of the Oura Ring?\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my God. You know this is a personal obsession with mine. I've been wanting one for months, and months, and months. I'm seething with jealousy. Tell us everything.\nLauren Goode: The sleep tracking. I'm not a good sleeper, and this has been giving me some really good insights into my sleep. And stress. I got a stressful email this morning, and I swear, about seven minutes later, the ring had logged that I was stressed.\nZoe Schiffer: It's so obvious when you have a bad night of sleep. You wake up and you feel like trash. The idea that we need our phones to verify this. No, you know when it's happening, and yet I so deeply want the validation. I love the quantified life, I want to be able to see it in numerical form. I'm all in.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. Zoe, I could totally see how as a parent of two babies, you would still want that validation. Yes, I am very tired.\nIt also gives you something called a Readiness Score, which supposedly signals how ready you are to tackle the day based on sleep.\nZoe Schiffer: Yet again though, I'm like we have no choice. What, I have a low Readiness Score, sorry, boss, I can't come in. It all feels a little superfluous, and yet I have never wanted a gadget more.\nLauren Goode: And yet. We have to get you one. We have to get you one just so you can go to Katie Drummond, our global editorial director, the next time there is huge breaking news on any of the broligarchy. I need you to say, \"Katie, my Readiness Score is suboptimal. I'm not sure I can do this right now.\"\nMichael Calore: Welcome to Uncanny Valley, a show about the people, the power, and influence of Silicon Valley. I'm Michael Calore, director of consumer tech and culture here at WIRED.\nLauren Goode: I'm Lauren Goode, senior writer at WIRED.\nZoe Schiffer: And I'm Zoe Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry.\nMichael Calore: If you've been listening to Uncanny Valley for a while now, you may have noticed something new in your podcast feed. We have added an additional episode.\nLauren Goode: That's right. We have two episodes a week now. There's the one you're listening to with me, Mike, and Zoe. Then each week, there's a shorter, newsier episode with WIRED's Global Editorial Director Katie Drummond. These episodes have been great. I don't know if you guys have had the chance to listen to the past two, but they're just so good.\nMichael Calore: Oh, yeah.\nLauren Goode: Such clear information. Everyone should check them out.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. We've been super busy at WIRED, covering politics, science, culture, security, and gear, and we'd thought we'd share more of our reporting with you all.\nToday we're talking about three stories from this last month that we just can't stop thinking about.\nMichael Calore: That's right. Today we're going to talk about what is going on in the world of chips. We're going to talk about the Tesla backlash. And we'll walk through a saga involving deepfaked images. OK, let's get into it.\nZoe, you have officially been part of the WIRED team since the beginning of the year. It's been a little over a month. I know you've been working on several stories in your time here. There was a pretty big one that dropped recently and I'm sure it's still at the top of your mind right now, so we want to ask you to talk about it.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. It's funny. I feel like I've been so deep in the Elon Musk, shall I say takeover of the federal government. I keep hesitating. Earlier on the phone with someone I said, \"Elon Musk and his impact on the federal government.\" But, however you want to put it.\nThe story that I can't stop thinking about was a piece that was published last week by two reporters at WIRED, Paresh Dave and Matt Burgess. It's about a woman named Breeze Liu, who's a former venture capitalist and a startup founder, who faced a situation that I think a lot of people fear, have heard about. Which is that in 2020 when she was in college, a friend called her one day and told her that explicit videos and images of her that had been filmed when she was underage without her consent, some were real, some were deepfaked, were spreading around on websites like Pornhub. The impact on her was really profound. She said she lost friends. She contemplated taking her own life.\nInterestingly, while some of the videos were shared on the sites you might think of like Pornhub, the company at the center of the saga is actually Microsoft.\nMichael Calore: How is that?\nLauren Goode: Interesting. Yeah. In what way?\nZoe Schiffer: Isn't that wild? It's interesting because she was I think in college when a friend called her one day and said, \"Hey, videos of you are on Pornhub.\" She was alerted to the fact that this content was out there. It took multiple years for her to ... There were various stages of this where she tried to get it taken down. Sites like Pornhub were actually I think some of the first to comply, to take down the non-consensual images and videos. But then it turned out that a lot of the content was stored on Microsoft's Azure cloud servers. When she contacted Microsoft, she was basically stonewalled for years.\nAt first, the company said that they needed more information from her. Then it allegedly just didn't respond to her for a while. It took her and a colleague actually confronting a member of Microsoft's public policy team at a conference in San Francisco in-person. Her friend was pointing to her being like, \"This is the person. You need to take action. This is impacting her life.\" Finally, after that Microsoft took down a lot of the content.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nMichael Calore: They approached the Microsoft employee at a conference?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. At the hotel bar.\nMichael Calore: Wow.\nLauren Goode: Wow.\nZoe Schiffer: Another wrinkle to the story is that she says she was about 17-years-old when the videos were taken without her consent. It put her in this really tricky situation because a lot of the nonprofits and the victim aids groups that could theoretically help her couldn't even watch the content, much less aid with take downs, because it's illegal to host or watch explicit content depicting a minor in the United States. But then when she went to NCMEK, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Kids, they also couldn't help her because she couldn't prove that she was under the age of 18. She was caught in this really weird middle ground that just shows how complicated this issue really is.\nLauren Goode: I have a question. First of all, this is horrific. It's terrible this woman had to go through this, and actually had to confront someone in-person to say, \"I'm the human face of this. Please take care of this. Please fix your policies.\"\nI'm wondering how Azure played a role technically. Since Azure is the cloud storage service, but it's not like people go to azure.com and are searching for things directly through that as a portal. The fact that the images were stored there, did that mean that other websites could then still retrieve them? How did she even know that they were still on Azure?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. My understanding is that the people who were continuing to share the content were storing it on Azure cloud servers. While they could take it down every time it popped up on a porn website, they wanted to get to the source and say, \"You can't even store this content on Microsoft.\" But Microsoft, it's a behemoth. It's a tech company. I think a lot of us have experienced trying to get technical support for a large tech corporation, which is not great. Not to mention when you have all these other complicated factors involved.\nMichael Calore: Don't the big companies, like Microsoft and other big cloud computing companies, have policies about taking things down? Particularly things that are spread around the web, like her pictures were?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, they do. They actually said they updated their policies as a result. They talked to our reporters a fair amount for the story and said, \"No one should have to experience this.\" I think their goal is to respond within a timeframe that's shorter than a couple weeks when someone reports stuff like this. Unfortunately for Breeze, it took over eight months. But they were like, \"We never want that to happen again.\" They're saying they have better contact with the various victim aids groups and are hoping to move faster in the future.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: You mentioned these advocacy groups that she tapped to try to help her with this. In general, aside from that, what are the mitigating forces here that help keep people safe from it? This could just very easily happen every day and it does.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, it does.\nLauren Goode: What's the best guardrail we have against this happening?\nZoe Schiffer: I think it's so tricky. I think making enforcement a lot stronger so that the content can't spread is really important. But I know that some of the big tech companies have also said that they're trying to make the cost of sharing this type of content higher. I think Microsoft or Google sued a group of people who were involved in sharing illegal images or videos.\nBut yeah, it's difficult. I feel like when we think about deepfakes, we often think about politicians, like a video of Nancy Pelosi slurring her words that was AI generated. But actually, that type of content is in some ways the least harmful because there's an entire media apparatus around politicians to debunk anything that's misleading. Nudify apps and AI generated, this stuff is spreading in high schools and it's incredibly damaging. If you're a young person who has this type of content spread about you, it can be used to bully you, harass you, blackmail you. I think there's not really an apparatus of support around it. I don't think there's a great understanding of how to handle it.\nLauren Goode: I actually think the Nancy Pelosi example, that was just careful editing, right?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: The video was edited to slow down her speech and make her sound intoxicated, or whatnot. Since then, we've seen AI generated videos of Zelensky, for example, that are clearly not real.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, you're exactly right. As I was saying, the Nancy Pelosi example, I thought this was the wrong example to use even though I'm sure there is an actual deepfake of her. But the famous one was just editing.\nLauren Goode: Right. Well, it's interesting the point you make too, about the mitigating forces of media against some of these deepfakes. For example, when Balenciaga Pope came out, there was a moment of, \"Oh, is it real, is it not real? It's gen AI. OK, great.\" But then, we collectively as a society came to the realization it was not real, it was a party trick. Now it exists as a meme, but it does not exist as fact. I think when it comes to someone's personal life, you don't necessarily have all those mitigating forces there to say, \"I didn't want for this to happen. This isn't exactly me. This is now a replicated or altered version of me.\" It's just you shouting into the void.\nZoe Schiffer: Exactly, yeah. Although, I think the Balenciaga Pope was actually an example of a deepfake helping someone's reputation. If you think, he absolutely benefited from that moment.\nMichael Calore: With regards to the nudify apps that people used in order to generate these non-consensual images of the subject in the story that Paresh and Matt wrote. Those have been banned places. States are banning them. Governments are considering banning them in different places like the UK. We've seen that even though the bans come down, and everybody's aware that these apps are terrible, and they get taken from app stores, they still show up.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: People still find ways around those gatekeepers or guardrails to make these apps available. People can download them from different app stores and side load them. You can use them on the web. There's all different ways to make this stuff and it doesn't seem like that's going to be slowing down at all.\nZoe Schiffer: No. I think that's a really good point. I also just think we don't have the collective understanding of this technology to be able to combat it effectively. I can imagine so clearly if a young person did have an image or a video of them floating around that was AI generated, that the perception from adults even if it was literally completely faked would be like, \"Well, they must have done something.\" It's hard to believe that truly, you can just be any regular person, have done nothing. No one deserves to have, regardless of what you've done or not done, non-consensual images or videos float around the internet. But I just think the impact can be so severe regardless of what's actually happened or not.\nLauren Goode: Zoe, what's been the fallout since?\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. Basically, Breeze and her colleague confronted the Microsoft person at the conference, a lot of the content is taken down. During this time period, she has decided to leave her job in venture capital and start an AI company that works to use facial recognition to detect deepfakes on all the websites that we're thinking of. She's actually working in this space trying to fill a gap that she identified as a victim.\nI think she told our reporters that it's not a perfectly happy ending, that the situation has obviously had a profound impact on her life. But I think she's also doing everything in her power to make sure that other people have the support that she didn't have if they're going through something similar. And almost all of the content has been taken down. But even that, the fact that we're saying almost. It's really difficult to scrub this completely from the internet. There is still stuff floating out there.\nMichael Calore: All right. Well, Zoe, thanks for walking us through that story. Let's take a quick break and come right back.\nWelcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nLauren, you're up next. What is the big story that's been on your mind that you would like to share with us?\nLauren Goode: It sounded like I was in the waiting room of a doctor's office.\nMichael Calore: You're up next.\nLauren Goode: \"You're up next.\"\nMichael Calore: I do have my clipboard.\nLauren Goode: Get ready.\nZoe Schiffer: Lauren.\nLauren Goode: I wanted to talk about chips.\nMichael Calore: Nice.\nLauren Goode: As you guys know, I've been out of the office now for a little bit because I've been doing some book work. But I have been keeping up with the news because it's impossible not to. One of the things that has really been fascinating to me is seeing what's going on in the chip market right now. Because it's not just right now, it's this moment we've been accelerating towards for the past several years.\nI think we can't talk about chips without talking about Intel.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nZoe Schiffer: Ooh.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: Not a company I associate with exciting news, but I am all ears.\nLauren Goode: Intel is one of the defining Silicon Valley companies and it's currently just not in a great place. Last year, its loyalist CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned. Now The Wall Street Journal is reporting that both Broadcom and TSMC are kicking the tires on Intel. They're looking at Intel's chip design business and its hip making factories. If deals like that were to happen, it would effectively split Intel in two.\nWhat is going on with Intel isn't just a tiny emblem of what's going on in the chip market, it's a giant flashing sign that we really are in this new era of chips because our computing needs are just very different.\nMichael Calore: Right. The mobile business, the mobile revolution of the early 2000s, Intel got left out of that. It also got left out of the AI explosion over the last couple of years.\nZoe Schiffer: I feel like I need some table setting at the beginning. Can you just take me through why are chips important? Why do they matter?\nLauren Goode: Well, chips are important because they power the computers we use literally every single day. The ones that we're staring at right now as we record this podcast, and the ones that we drive in, and watch television on, and strap to our bodies, and are powering medical devices. They're just an essential part of our world, semiconductors. There are different kinds of them. There are central processing units, and there are graphics processing units, and there are different flavors of those as well. I think what we're going to talk about in a few minutes is also quantum computing and how that effectively changes the binary units of information that have been processed before in the new era that we're getting into.\nWhat started to happen within the past decade or so is a lot of the emphasis on chip processing started to get more and more focused on AI. What we're starting to see now is chip companies, like Intel for example, which is one of the great defining Silicon Valley companies, starting to experience a pretty significant decline. Then you saw the rise of companies like Nvidia, which was then built on GPUs, very smartly started to tailor those towards AI computing now is on the rise.\nZoe Schiffer: GPUs are just more sophisticated chips?\nLauren Goode: It's for graphics processing in particular. It's not just processing, to boil it down really simply, the type of word processing that we would do on a computer, but actual visual imagery. It treats light differently. It uses something called parallel processing, which is it's executing different tasks simultaneously. In general, it's more powerful. When you think of the early days of graphics, you think of video games on computers. That's graphics processing.\nZoe Schiffer: I feel like we talk a lot in Silicon Valley about companies that are over-valued or people who are paid obscene amounts of money. If you design a GPU, you deserve every dollar. That sounds so complicated.\nLauren Goode: Well, the interesting thing too is that we colloquially will refer to these companies as chip makers, but they're not actually all chip makers. In many instances, they're designers. They're designing the GPU. Or if you're a company like ARM, you have this proprietary intellectual property for the architecture of the chips that we use. Or if you're a company like TSMC, you are literally the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company because you have the fab and you are manufacturing them.\nOne of the things that, here in the US, both Trump and the Biden Administration in recent years have been focused on, is trying to bring more chip manufacturing to the United States. That's an incredibly hard thing to do. It is a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar if not more proposition to try to spin up these fabs, which is why we are still so reliant on companies like TSMC.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. I remember talking to someone about this recently. They were like, \"The US manufacturing chips, that chip can maybe power your microwave.\" I was like, \"Oh, OK. I guess we're not as close as I thought.\"\nLauren Goode: Right.\nMichael Calore: What's going on in the world of quantum chips?\nLauren Goode: Oh my gosh, quantum. How nerdy do we want to get?\nZoe Schiffer: I want to go there.\nLauren Goode: OK. Hands down, the most significant news in chips I think over the past month. The same day that Apple was like, \"Look, we made a slightly cheaper iPhone,\" Microsoft was like, \"Check out the Majorana 1.\" This is basically, it's a quantum computing processor that Microsoft says it's been working on for 17 years.\nZoe Schiffer: What?\nLauren Goode: Which means it's almost old enough to work for DOGE. Yes.\nZoe Schiffer: Lauren, wow. That was low key the best joke we've ever told on Uncanny Valley, and you did it so casually.\nLauren Goode: You're welcome. I don't know how nerdy we should get into what is quantum computing exactly, but it's computer science that uses quantum mechanics to solve problems that are a little bit too complex for classical computers. Classical computers store information in binary form. Then in quantum computer, the units of information are called qubits, folks. The qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. It's not like on-off in the same way that binary units work. It's just everything everywhere all at once.\nZoe Schiffer: OK. But my understanding was that this is so complicated that you need a quantum computer to vet whether the quantum mechanics are actually ... We don't have a great way of understanding what is actually going on in quantum computing right now. Is that true, or no? We get it now.\nLauren Goode: That sounds right. No, we need a quantum computer to help us with this podcast quite literally, just to explain it. Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: Put the chip in me, I'm ready.\nLauren Goode: Right. Also, when you ask experts in the field how long they think it's going to take for quantum computing to actually, not necessarily even become mainstream, but just become usable and measurable, you'll hear various things. Some people will say it's going to be a decade at least, some people will say it's going to be 20-years-plus. Sometimes it depends on whether that person is heavily invested in another kind of chip.\nBut regardless, if what Microsoft said bears out, this is a pretty significant advancement I think in quantum computing chips. They're saying, this was reported by The Verge, that the Majorana 1 can potentially fit a million qubits onto a single chip. That's equivalent to the same size of the CPUs that are inside all of the computers that we use now.\nZoe Schiffer: Wild.\nMichael Calore: See, I would say that sounds like a lot of qubits, but also I don't really know how big a qubit is. I have to trust that that is a breakthrough.\nLauren Goode: Chips in general, when you think about them, are just a modern miracle. When you just think about the lithography technology that actually etches these tiny little bits of light into these chips that are the size of our fingernails, and the amount of computing that we can do on them, it's a modern miracle. If this works, this means a single chip with a million qubits could perform simulations that basically help us unlock all of these computing breakthroughs in material science and medicine. It's a big promise of quantum computing. It doesn't mean that we're there yet, but it was quite a mic drop from Microsoft when they announced this.\nMichael Calore: Nice. All right, well thanks for schooling us, Lauren. Let's take another break.\nZoe Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley.\nAll right, Mike, it's your turn. What's the story that you're really into right now?\nMichael Calore: I am fascinated by the Tesla backlash.\nZoe Schiffer: I thought you were either going to talk about the Humane AI pin or this, and I would have been really excited for either one. This is probably more important.\nMichael Calore: It is. It is more important. It's quite a ride, so if you're ready, we'll take that ride together. We're going to go full self-driving.\nLauren Goode: Oh, he made a ride joke!\nMichael Calore: I did.\nZoe Schiffer: Woo!\nLauren Goode: What's it called? Isn't there Ridiculous Mode or something in the car?\nMichael Calore: Yeah, Ludicrous Mode.\nLauren Goode: Ludicrous.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Let's go into Ludicrous Mode.\nZoe Schiffer: OK. Set the scene for us.\nMichael Calore: We have to go back to the end of 2024, because 2024 was Tesla's first down year. The company opened the year by saying that its deliveries of new cars had shrank by 1.1% in 2024. Which does not sound like a huge number, but it's pretty significant considering how many cars Tesla ships. The stock price had already begun to dip at the end of 2024. But at this point, Tesla really goes into a slump. There are some blunt economic reasons for this that we should talk about.\nFirst of all, there's a lot of increased competition from other automakers who are building more EVs, particularly from China where EVs are cheaper. There's a company called BYD which is eating into Tesla's market share in China and in Europe. The company also suffers from a lot of manufacturing slowdowns, supply chain woes that the rest of the auto industry is suffering from. And there are a lot of folks that are just waiting. There's a new Tesla model due in 2025 and they don't want to buy a Tesla at the beginning of 2025 or the end of 2024.\nBut we can't talk about Tesla's financial slump without talking about Elon Musk's involvement in politics because the two are connected.\nZoe Schiffer: I'm very excited about this because my understanding was that, for a very long time, the fact that Tesla was such a widely-traded retail stock and Elon had such a close relationship with his fan base ... His fan base was pretty rabid, and into him and into Tesla. That Tesla could go through the ups and downs of any business, but stock price stayed really high because people were obsessed with Elon. But that seems like it's starting to change?\nMichael Calore: Yes. There's a measurable turn that happens at the beginning of the year. Starting back in 2024, Elon Musk was campaigning for Donald Trump. He threw a bunch of money into the campaign and he started supporting conservative causes more vocally on X. That just immediately alienated half of the country. Then Donald Trump tasked Elon Musk with running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency in Washington. More people get upset that this billionaire is messing around with our government systems. That sours people on Elon Musk's allure a little bit more.\nThen of course, something extraordinary happens on January 20th, 2025. At Trump's inauguration rally, Elon twice made what we shall call a one-armed gesture toward the crowd. It looked a lot like a fascist salute. It was certainly Nazi-like in appearance. It really solidified for a lot of people, liberals and conservatives alike, that they felt like they should just reject this guy's ideology. Which means rejecting him and rejecting his products that his companies make. If there was any question about Elon's politics, we know now that he's been very vocal in his support for AFD in Germany, which is a far-right party in Germany.\nWe can see this turn against Tesla manifest in two ways. There's the financial response. Tesla's drop in sales was most notable in Europe in January. I'm going to quote some stats at you because they were very stark. In Germany, Tesla's year-over-year sales in January fell by 59%. In France, they fell by 63%.\nLauren Goode: Whoa!\nMichael Calore: In Spain, they fell by 75%.\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my gosh.\nMichael Calore: In the UK, they fell by 12%. But in Norway, the country where there are more EVs than internal combustion cars on the road, Tesla registrations are down 38%.\nZoe Schiffer: That is so high. That's way higher than I would have thought.\nMichael Calore: It is. Some of those drops are because of the problems that we outlined earlier. The cheap EVs, the age of Tesla's auto line, the fact that a lot of people were just not wanting to buy a Tesla now. But auto industry experts have been saying that it's impossible to measure the effect that the public's distaste for politics are having on sales, but they are certainly contributing.\nLauren Goode: Are those places where people were more inclined to have lots of Teslas to begin with, so therefore the drops seem precipitous?\nMichael Calore: Yes and no. Tesla is still a very big presence in the EV world, but more car manufacturers are making electrics. In this country, we have Ford, and GM, and Chevrolet all putting out new electrics this year and last year. In Europe, you've got brands like Volvo, and Polestar, and Audi, and Volkswagen also making a lot of EVs. They are selling in Europe. They're certainly not selling as much now.\nLauren Goode: I've also wondered if part of this could just be that we're in that five to seven year post-purchase period where people are like, \"Oh, I don't actually want a full-on electric car. I don't want to deal with the battery maintenance. The resell market is poor because of that.\" If there are other factors here aside from the ideologies, which also seem like a very real part of this.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Factors for the sales dipping?\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nMichael Calore: Yes, for sure. There's still a lot of anxiety around electrics. People are afraid to buy them because they don't know where they'll be able to charge them, or whether they're going to get access to a fast charger. Ever since the Trump Administration has come into power, they have been cutting back on infrastructure projects that were there in order to provide more chargers in more places around the United States.\nZoe Schiffer: Is the Cybertruck part of this, too? Because I feel like I remember reading very disparate things about the rollout. Where there were tons and tons of people on the wait list to get it, and then sales were lower maybe at the beginning. Where does that play into all of this?\nMichael Calore: Well, I think the Cybertruck is really interesting because it's at the center of the debate of how you feel about Tesla.\nZoe Schiffer: Because it's the most obvious?\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Well, it's such an expression of masculinity.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's an expression of something, that's for sure. Who's the person who buys a Cybertruck? Are they the person who needs to haul things around? Are they the person who is a prepper and they want the most indestructible, bulletproof, waterproof vehicle they can buy? Is it somebody who just needs to take up a lot of space on the road?\nLauren Goode: Mike, the next time I drive down to Palo Alto, because I literally just drove down there the other day and I saw four in one trip to Palo Alto, I'm going to take you with me just so you can have fun counting them.\nMichael Calore: OK.\nLauren Goode: Yeah. I remember when I first moved to Silicon Valley in 2013. I quite literally lived on Sand Hill Road because I was in Stanford-adjacent housing.\nZoe Schiffer: She couldn't not mention it, you guys. She just simply could not.\nLauren Goode: The junior university, OK. When we first moved, my then partner and I used to count the number of Teslas we saw driving up and and down Sand Hill Road because it was still new. I thought they were very cool looking cars. They were these shark-y, sleek vehicles. Then over time, it just stopped counting. They were just literally everywhere.\nMichael Calore: Yeah.\nLauren Goode: Now with the Cybertruck, I feel like it's at square one again. I can count on one hand the number that I see in one trek down the Valley.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. It's been that way for a long time and it remains that way, just because there are so many Teslas here in California. California is the world's center of Teslas. The California Camry, that's what people call it. The Tesla owners love it when you call it a California Camry, by the way.\nZoe Schiffer: That's so funny.\nMichael Calore: But everybody's counting Teslas again because the second part where we can measure the backlash is the cultural response to all of this madness. I'm sure you've seen the bumper stickers that people are putting on their Teslas, \"I bought this before I knew Elon was crazy?\"\nZoe Schiffer: Yes, I was going to mention them.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Hashtag swasticar is often trending on social media.\nLauren Goode: Wow!\nZoe Schiffer: Oh my God.\nMichael Calore: There are activists that are spray-painting swastikas on Teslas. The showrooms are getting vandalized with anti-Nazi vandalism. There was famously in Berlin, the Tesla factory there, some activists projected Elon doing his Nazi-like arm gesture on the side of the building and it said \"Heil Tesla\" on it.\nThis all culminated in the middle of February with an event called Tesla Takedown, where thousands of people all around the country descended on Tesla showrooms and protested Elon's involvement in the US government and protested Tesla ownership in general.\nIt's not really the best time to be driving one of those cars if you're somebody who is ideologically opposed to Elon. What do you do, do you sell it? Do you sell it at whatever you can get for it because you just want it out of your life? Or do you hold onto it? I know there's a lot of people who are wrestling with that right now.\nZoe Schiffer: That's really, really interesting. I'm curious if it's impacting his other companies, because Elon famously runs SpaceX, Neuralink, xAI, X.\nLauren Goode: The US government.\nMichael Calore: The US government.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah, also that.\nMichael Calore: It's certainly affecting X. There's a lot of people who are like, \"I'm out of here. I don't want to be a part of this guy's social network anymore.\" But the only other Elon-owned entity that I've heard anecdotally people are shying away from is Starlink. There are people who have long been interested in satellite internet who are now exploring other connectivity options because of his politics.\nZoe Schiffer: And all the people who are signing up to go to Mars are now canceling those reservations, so that's a bummer.\nMichael Calore: Were people signing up?\nLauren Goode: Yeah, I was going to say, were people signing up to go to Mars?\nZoe Schiffer: No, that was a joke. That was a bad joke. I just was trying to be funny.\nLauren Goode: That's the world we live in though now, Zoe. That could be real. That could really be happening.\nZoe Schiffer: Right. Although Elon does say that he wants to die on Mars, but ha ha, not on impact. That's a joke he makes a lot.\nMichael Calore: Oh, boy.\nLauren Goode: The most amazing thing about the Cybertruck is just seeing how much space it takes up. It is such a huge, protruding vehicle. It's literally parked outside of this quaint, little coffee shop in Palo Alto with flower baskets, and then you see this war vehicle, this militarized vehicle just sitting in front. It's so wild to see. It's massive.\nZoe Schiffer: It does have the feeling of the vehicle version of a man spreading his legs on the subway really wide.\nLauren Goode: Yeah.\nZoe Schiffer: That said, if we have any listeners who are owners of the Cybertruck and you want to talk about why you like it, I'm genuinely curious. Write to us.\nLauren Goode: Do we think Elon Musk cares that there has been this cultural reaction to his antics that have resulted in this sales drop? I think that's my final question.\nZoe Schiffer: Yeah. I don't know. In my experience talking to people who've worked closely with him or associated with him over the years, he's not completely un-self-reflective. I think he can be introspective at different moments. But I don't know, he seems like he's more and more insular these days. He is in a bubble. And while he's getting a ton of opposition, and hate, and feedback all the time, he's more and more insulated from it, ignoring it. Even maybe energized by it because he sees himself as the good guy, the hero, the person trying to save America or the rest of the world and people are trying to stop him. You can really tell when he's talking on these podcasts or on X Live, or whatever, he sees the people who are opposed to him as the authoritarian censors, the people trying to bring down the good guys. He sees himself as the hero.\nLauren Goode: This is also a snapshot of data for this snapshot in time. Tesla's had a lot of highs and lows since its inception. It's not to say that this is the beginning of the end of Tesla in any way. It's just notable that this is happening all on the heels of him essentially becoming one of the key advisors to the government.\nMichael Calore: Yeah. Financial experts are saying that the dip will continue, but it is most likely not the end of the company and it's not the end of the story. However, it is the end of the podcast because we have to wrap this up.\nThank you for listening to Uncanny Valley.

But the rollout of the files — which were given to political commentators in binders that read “The Epstein Files: Phase I” at the White House Thursday afternoon — showed the administration's preference for conservative influencers with large social media followings.By Thursday evening, the files had not been provided to Justice Department reporters or posted publicly online.RELATED STORY | Thousands of Epstein documents were released, questions remainThe documents are unlikely to satisfy online sleuths eager for fresh details about Epstein’s crimes and connections to famous people that have long been the subject of intense media scrutiny. The lack of new information drew criticism even from some conservatives. “GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., wrote on social media, calling the rollout a “complete disappointment.”Bondi suggested in a Thursday letter to FBI Director Kash Patel that more records were recently discovered. She ordered the FBI to hand over “the full and complete Epstein files” to her by Friday morning, and directed Patel to “conduct an immediate investigation” into why her order to the FBI to turn over all documents was not followed.President Donald Trump, who was in office when Epstein was arrested, suggested while campaigning last year that he'd seek to open up the government's files.Epstein was accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls in the early 2000s, but wound up serving just 13 months in jail. He was indicted on federal charges in New York in 2019, more than a decade after he secretly struck a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of similar charges of sex trafficking.RELATED STORY | Trump orders declassification of JFK, RFK and MLK Jr. recordsThe case has drawn widespread attention because of Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell’s links to royals, presidents and billionaires. Maxwell herself is the daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who once owned the New York Daily News.Over the years, thousands of pages of records have been released through lawsuits, Epstein’s criminal dockets, public disclosures and Freedom of Information Act requests. In January 2024, a court unsealed a trove of documents that had been collected as evidence in a lawsuit filed by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.Much of the material, including transcripts of victim interviews and old police reports, had already been publicly known. They included mentions of Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Britain's Prince Andrew and magician David Copperfield, as well as testimony from one victim who said she met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Florida home but nothing untoward happened with him.The previously released files included a 2016 deposition in which an accuser recounted spending several hours with Epstein at Trump’s Atlantic City casino but didn’t say if she actually met Trump and did not accuse him of any wrongdoing. Trump has also said that he once thought Epstein was a “terrific guy,” but that they later had a falling out.RELATED STORY | Jeffrey Epstein's 'little black book' just went up for auction. Here's whose names are listed in itIn 2023, The Associated Press obtained thousands of pages of records shedding light on the final days of Epstein’s life at a now-shuttered federal jail in Manhattan. They included emails between jail officials, psychological evaluations, internal agency reports, memos and other records.The Justice Department’s Inspector General later issued a report finding that a “combination of negligence, misconduct and outright job performance failures” by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and jail workers enabled Epstein to take his own life in August 2019. The watchdog report found no evidence of foul play.","summary":"Attorney General Pam Bondi teased the public release of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein.

I know anonymous sources, probably career bureaucrats, have leaked that to many of you in this room,’ she claimed. \n\n‘But as I said at the beginning of this press conference, everybody is working as one team, and the president respects the decisions of his Cabinet secretaries to tell their staff not to respond to that email because they did so out of interests of national security and they don’t want to, obviously, risk confidential information,’ Leavitt added. ‘It’s pretty common sense.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump cut off federal workers&#8217; credit cards for the next&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Government Credit Cards Frozen by Trump Due to $40 Billion Bill Incurred by Federal Workers first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/government-credit-cards-frozen-by-trump-due-to-40-billion-bill-incurred-by-federal-workers/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/27/17/95627937-14443647-image-a-12_1740678435036.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-28 00:03:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":295108010,"title":"USPS Modifications to First-Class Mail in 2025: When to Expect Changes","text":"The United States Postal Service (USPS) has announced upcoming modifications to First-Class Mail services, aiming to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.The changes, set to take effect later this year, are expected to generate an estimated $36 billion in savings over the next decade, according to USPS. Newsweek reached out to financial experts for comment.Why It MattersUSPS delivers to more than 165 million residential and business addresses daily. The shift marks a continued effort by USPS to cut costs without significantly disrupting mail delivery for most Americans. While some First-Class Mail deliveries will be expedited, others could see slight delays.List of Changes Coming to USPS MailAccording to USPS, the following adjustments will be made to first-class mail:\n75 percent of First-Class Mail will retain its current service standards.\n14 percent of First-Class Mail will see an improvement in delivery times.\n11 percent of First-Class Mail will experience slightly longer delivery times.\nThe path of mail and packages is also being restructured into three legs. Regardless of delivery time, all mail will be processed within 1-5 days - which is the current standard.As part of the changes, postal workers will now use a five-digit regional add-on after the ZIP code to enhance accuracy, replacing the current three-digit add-on.Rural customers may benefit, as post workers will also be permitted to leave facilities earlier and travel greater distances for deliveries.USPS has stated that the majority of customers will not notice any changes, but some deliveries that previously took two days may now take up to three, while others will arrive more quickly than before. Services provided at all post offices will not change.When Are Changes Coming?The modifications are set to be implemented gradually throughout 2025. The first phase will begin on April 1, the second on July 1.Customers can expect notifications from USPS regarding any significant changes to their mail delivery schedules. USPS also reassures that it will continue to monitor the impact of these adjustments.The changes come shortly after USPS was hit with calls to undergo a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) audit.Why is USPS Making Changes?The Postal Service generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations, per a USPS FAQ.USPS has struggled with financial losses in the past, leading to increased pressure to streamline operations. In 2022, the agency launched its \"Delivering for America\" plan, a 10-year initiative designed to modernize the postal network and reduce inefficiencies.Postmaster General Louis DeJoy emphasized the importance of these changes, stating: \"By implementing the new standards and the operational initiatives to which they are aligned, we will be better able to achieve the goals of our modernization plans and create a high-performing, financially sustainable organization, which is necessary to achieve the statutory policies and objectives established for the Postal Service by law.\"What's NextUSPS will continue to refine its operations under the \"Delivering for America\" plan, which includes further network restructuring and cost-cutting measures.The changes come as President Donald Trump is considering merging USPS into the Commerce Department and bringing it under the authority of the executive branch.","summary":"USPS is aiming to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and save $36 billion over 10 years.

CQ Brown Jr. In his past as a Fox News host, Hegseth once questioned if Brown got his job only because he is Black.\n\n\"Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill?” Hegseth wrote in his 2024 book, “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.\"\n\n“We'll never know, but always doubt—which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn't really much matter,” he added.\n\nIn another move to whitewash the military, Hegseth announced it would no longer use federal resources to celebrate things such as Black History Month, Women’s History Month, Pride Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, National American Indian Heritage Month, and National Disability Employment Awareness Month.\n\n“We are proud of our warriors and their history, but we will focus on the character of their service instead of their immutable characteristics,” the guidance says. \n\nIn addition to the military’s attack on diversity and any form of identity, the Pentagon is moving to push out current and future transgender military people within 30 days.\n\nAccording to the policy memo, obtained by Axios, the Pentagon will consider granting waivers on a “case-by-case basis” but only if there is \"a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.”\n\nThe move is in response to a new lawsuit filed on behalf of six transgender military members who have together served for decades. \n\nOne member, Sergeant First Class Kate Cole, has served for nearly 17 years and has been awarded five Army Commendation Medals. She has also been placed in the top 10% of all Armor Branch Sergeants First Class in the Army’s Order of Merit List. \n\nHowever, under Trump’s executive order, she is deemed unfit to serve. \n\nOther lawsuits have hit Trump’s desk since the convicted felon sought to ban transgender people from the military. \n\nLambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign immediately geared up for (legal) war when Trump’s executive order was signed. \n\nIn a statement to Daily Kos, Sasha Buchert, Lambda Legal’s director of the nonbinary and transgender rights project, explained why this move is so harmful to the transgender community and to the military as a whole. \n\n“[The executive order] will harm readiness because it will remove servicemembers that the military has invested millions of dollars in training,\" she told Daily Kos. “Thousands of transgender troops are combat-tested, having been deployed to war zones and executed missions with distinction, many of whom are senior personnel with decades of experience. It will hurt unit cohesion because it will discriminate against otherwise qualified service members, sending the message that identity rather than merit is what is important and that some discrimination is acceptable.\"\n\nAs Trump and Hegseth demand that offices wipe the military’s diverse history from its online presence, one thing is certain: They can’t delete what outlets are reporting on them.

A bilateral trade agreement is in the works.India's departments of commerce and revenue are working to resolve discrepancies in bilateral trade data collected by the two sides, amid US President Donald Trump's accusation that India is a tariff abuser. The analysis assumes significance as data of the two countries differ. Tariff anomalies show up In a February 13 speech, Trump claimed his country's trade deficit with India amounts to $100 billion. However, based on US data, the actual deficit was $45.6 billion, including goods and services, in 2023. The deficit in just goods trade was $45.7 billion in 2024. According to an ET analysis of government data from both sides since 2018, the US has consistently reported higher imports from India than exports reported by New Delhi to that country. For example, the US reported $87.4 billion in goods imports from India in 2024, whereas India recorded $80.7 billion in exports to the US -a gap of $6.7 billion, albeit down from $8 billion in 2023.The White House fact sheet also stated that India imposes a 100% tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. However, the tariff imposed on motorcycles was 50% before the February 1 budget, which lowered it further to 30%.Officials said India's tariff numbers in international databases were on the basis of reported data, while the US usually derives its numbers from the World Trade Organization. Both these need to be examined. Once that's done, we expect there would be a differential, although not too much, once the tariffs are updated, said an official.118611606The US accounts for around 11% of India's total trade.ET's analysis also showed that the US reported exporting goods worth $41.8 billion to India in 2024, while the latter recorded $42.8 billion in imports from that country.Between 2018 and 2024, exports to the US grew 56.8%, according to Indian data. On the other hand, the US recorded it as a 61.1% increase in imports from India. The US captures reexport and reimport separately while India doesn't and this may be one reason for the data discrepancy, said a trade expert.Such discrepancies have also been observed between the US and China.The World Bank, in a blog early in 2024, highlighted several possible reasons for such discrepancies that included differences in valuation methods, transshipment and reexports, and trade fraud.In 2023, India attributed its trade data discrepancy with China to under-reporting, and unfair cross-border trade practices.","summary":"India is scrutinizing recent import tariffs from the US as it prepares for trade treaty negotiations.

The press conference was documented by local media in 2016.\"\n\nNot only was the clip old, it has been debunked as it did not provide any merit to conspiracy theories about Obama's citizenship, which have even been pushed by Donald Trump. \n\nObama previously addressed the theory when the White House published a copy of the then-president's official birth certificate in 2011.An additional link to Obama's birth certificate \"on file at the National Archives\" was also included, along with a previous news article about the fake video. \n\nSocial media users quickly began dunking on Greene in the comments for sharing the debunked clip and stirring up the baseless conspiracy theory. \n\nOne X user wrote: \"I hate to be the one to break it to you… this isn’t new, it’s not credible, you’ve been played (again).\"Another chimed in: \"Only problem is, Marj, it's already been disproved.

His first seven months in power have been virtually moribund – marked by rising taxes, flatlining growth, sleaze and betrayals, and plummeting poll ratings.\n\nWhen it comes to the Special Relationship, however, he has made a much better start.\n\nIn the Oval Office last night, Mr Trump showered him with praise (although an invitation from the King for an unprecedented second state visit to Britain had sweetened the President's mood).\n\nSir Keir repeated his desire for a US security guarantee in Ukraine after any peace deal is agreed, explained he had increased Britain's defence budget and emphasised the mutual benefits of free trade to try to avoid the ruinous tariffs Mr Trump threatens to impose on the EU.\n\nIndeed, Brexit could be the PM's trump card. The President clearly loathes the Brussels bloc, so isn't it foolish for Sir Keir to risk throwing it away with his EU reset?\n\nThe PM'a first seven months in power have been virtually moribund. When it comes to the Special Relationship, however, Sir Keir Starmer has made a much better start, writes the Daily Mail\n\nUnlikely bromance as Donald Trump and Keir Starmer insist Special Relationship is alive and well\n\nMany will raise eyebrows at Sir Keir prostrating himself before a man he recently couldn't say a good word about.\n\nBut that is the art of diplomacy. On the evidence so far, there is quiet optimism they will work closely together – to the great benefit of both our countries.\n\nTake off at Gatwick?\n\nAs the Transport Secretary backs a second runway at Gatwick, is the Government finally acting in the national interest?\n\nHeidi Alexander is 'minded to approve' the £2.2billion privately funded expansion provided measures to reduce noise and traffic pollution are put in place.\n\nTrue, the scheme still needs planning permission. But with Gatwick already at full stretch, it is indisputable Britain is crying out for greater airport capacity and the trade, jobs and investment it offers.\n\nWith Gatwick already at full stretch, it is indisputable Britain is crying out for greater airport capacity and the trade, jobs and investment it offers\n\nThis plan must not be killed off by a green lobby whose concerns, while understandable, always seem to trump our economy.\n\nTo her credit, Ms Alexander says she is 'not some flight-shaming eco-warrior'. The trouble is, Ed Miliband gives every impression of being just that.\n\nHer decision shows the Net Zero Secretary's environmental fanaticism is increasingly redundant. Isn't it time he was too?\n\nPoor judgment\n\nBarely a day passes without another dangerous foreign criminal being spared deportation by the immigration tribunals.\n\nThe suspicion is that these perverse decisions – completely out of step with public opinion – are made by activist judges pursuing their own hyper-liberal agendas.\n\nTake, for example, Judge Sarah Pinder. Her rulings include allowing a Zimbabwean paedophile to stay in Britain to avoid 'hostility' back home. Yet she has frequently written for a pro-open borders website.\n\nWith asylum claims hitting a record 108,000 last year after Labour relaxed the rules, the system appears to be out of control.\n\nImmigration decisions should be taken by accountable ministers, not unelected judges.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, speaking at her weekly press briefing on Thursday, emphasized that the Istanbul talks were just the beginning of broader diplomatic efforts.\n\n“We expect that today’s meeting will be the first in a series of such expert consultations that will bring us and the American side closer to overcoming the differences that have arisen, strengthening confidence-building measures, and so on,” Zakharova said.\n\nThe president of the European Council, António Costa, expressed appreciation to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for hosting the talks.\n\nThe Istanbul meeting came on the same day that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House in Washington to meet with President Donald Trump to persuade him that European leaders should be part of the negotiations if the peace is to last.\n\nTrump said Thursday that talks to end the Ukraine war are “very well advanced” and expressed confidence that Putin will “keep his word” and not restart hostilities if a truce is reached.\n\nTrump also shut down any speculation about the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO, saying that Kyiv’s aspirations to join the transatlantic military pact were a key reason why Russia invaded.\n\n“It’s just not going to happen. That’s what started this whole thing,” Trump told reporters at the White House. He added that he will push Russia to give up as much occupied Ukrainian land as possible in the peace talks with Putin, “but on the NATO [issue], that’s just ... not going to happen.”\n\nMeanwhile, Putin addressed top officials of its Federal Security Service on Feb. 27, expressing optimism about the early exchanges with the Trump administration, saying they “inspire certain hopes.”\n\n“There is reciprocal determination to work toward the restoration of relations between the countries, a gradual solution of the colossal backlog of systemic, strategic problems in the world architecture,” he said, per Russian state media Tass.\n\nPutin also praised the Trump administration’s approach, describing it as pragmatic and realistic, while contrasting it with the policies of previous U.S. administrations. He said that the current administration was moving away from the “messianic ideological clichés of their predecessors,” which he argued had contributed to the crisis in international relations and, by extension, the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Russian leader has repeatedly said that NATO’s eastward expansion over the years has brought the alliance unacceptably close to Russia’s borders, undermining regional security.\n\nThis view is rejected by countries on NATO’s eastern flank in Europe, who say that membership in the defensive military alliance is the only thing that keeps an increasingly assertive Russia at bay as it expands its sphere of influence to countries like Belarus and Moldova.","summary":"The meeting was held at the headquarters of the U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/us-russia-hold-talks-in-turkey-on-restoring-embassy-ties-after-years-of-diplomatic-expulsions-5817396","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2025/02/27/id5817406-Turkey_US_Russia_25058507882314-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:58:27","author":"Tom Ozimek","authors":["Tom Ozimek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.138},{"id":295104862,"title":"Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait","text":"In Donald Trump's White House the vibes really matter. The personal relationships he develops with other leaders can affect how those nations are treated. \n\nSo it was vital for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to not only master the details of their discussions but to build a rapport with the US president. \n\nThe invitation from King Charles clearly set the right tone. Trump looked truly flattered that he would become the first person to enjoy a second state visit to the UK.\n\n\"And that's a great honour, because it's never happened before,\" the president said at the start of their joint news conference. \"I really do call it an honour, but it's not for me, it's for our country. It's respect for our country.\"\n\nThe very diplomatic language deployed by Sir Keir over Ukraine – like praising Trump for creating the conditions in which a ceasefire is being discussed – could not disguise the disagreements over what a peace deal may end up looking like.\n\nWhile Trump says he feels he can trust Russian President Vladimir Putin to stick to any deal, Sir Keir talked of the need to make sure that any truce endures and does not favour the aggressor.\n\nThe prime minister's message about increasing defence spending in the UK was clearly very welcome - but he did not walk away with any commitment from the US to participate in ongoing security guarantees for Ukraine once a peace deal has been signed.\n\nKey takeaways from Starmer's White House visitUK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary' - TrumpKing invites Trump for 'unprecedented' second state visit\n\nThe warm atmosphere and friendly body language we saw when the two men first met in the Oval Office just before lunch did not seem quite so pronounced when they emerged after talks about three hours later.\n\n\"You are a very tough negotiator… I'm not sure I like that, but okay,\" Trump told Sir Keir as they appeared before reporters after their meeting. And he did not seem to be entirely joking.\n\nOn the prospect of trade tariffs being imposed on UK exports to the US, the prime minister did seem to have made some progress. \n\nTrump said Sir Keir had worked hard and \"earned whatever they pay him over there\" when he made the case for a trade deal between the two countries instead of tariffs. That would count as a significant victory for Britain, though any proposed deal would inevitably require lengthy and detailed negotiations.\n\nBefore this meeting it was unclear how the Labour leader's serious and sober demeanour would go down with the bombastic American president. \n\nCarefully worded praise and flattery helped to set the tone, with Sir Keir saying \"the UK has a true friend in the Oval Office\". And he was speaking Trump's language when he highlighted how the two countries were ranked one and two in the world as investment destinations, and for golf players too. \n\nTrump responded enthusiastically to the promise of a new chapter in an historic partnership. \"What a beautiful accent,\" he quipped when the prime minister finished his remarks. \"I'd have been president 20 years ago if I had that accent.\"\n\nThere also appeared to be genuine respect toward the president over the issues on which the two leaders see eye to eye. On other significant matters, they seemed to have agreed to disagree. Which is probably as much as Sir Keir could hope for.\n\nTomorrow it is Volodymyr Zelensky's turn in the Oval Office. A week after Trump called him a dictator, he distanced himself from that description - and his opinion of the Ukrainian president seemed to have softened. \n\n\"I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning.

Epstein, a New York City financier whose social circle included presidents and other rich and powerful figures, died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 after he was charged with running a sex trafficking ring involving minors. His case has long been an obsession of those who are convinced that the names of prominent figures involved in his sex trafficking network have been kept secret. Conspiracy theorists have also have speculated without real evidence that Epstein didn’t die by suicide but was in fact killed in his jail cell to prevent names from leaking out. Thousands of law enforcement files have been released over the years with no such smoking gun revelations. (Some have been redacted or sealed to protect victims and because of ongoing civil and criminal litigation.) But people on the right pushed the new Trump administration for this latest release. And leading up to it, there was discussion in right-wing social media circles suggesting that this time, with President Donald Trump back in office, would be different. Then Thursday, a handful of right-wing media figures were photographed leaving the White House holding binders labeled, “The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The figures included Jack Posobiec, who helped spread the false “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory about Democrats operating a satanic child abuse ring out of a Washington pizzeria that led to a shooting at the restaurant. Some went on to cheer the release of the files on their social media accounts. But almost immediately some of those same figures started downplaying what was contained in the documents. Later Thursday, a letter from Bondi to FBI Director Kash Patel was made public. In it, she said she had learned “from a source” that the FBI Field Office in New York was in possession of “thousands of” Epstein-related documents that were never disclosed to her. Instead, Bondi wrote, she had received only 200 pages of documents. She went on to demand that the “full and complete Epstein files” be delivered to her office by 8 a.m. Friday. “There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access,” she wrote. Bondi acknowledged, though, that some information could not be released to protect the identity of the victims. “The Department of Justice will ensure that any public disclosure of these files will be done in a manner to protect the privacy of victims and in accordance with the law,” she wrote. Two senior Justice Department Officials who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak on the record told NBC News that there would be very little new information contained in any release, given how much has already been made public. One of the senior Justice Department officials said they perceived the purpose and timing of the release of the Epstein documents by Bondi as “a distraction” from other matters. Conservative figures and conspiracy theorists, including some of those who’d received the binder, quickly took to social media alleging a cover up that had kept the revelations they believe must exist out of the binder. Liz Wheeler, one of the right-wing media figures who was at the White House and got the binder, tweeted, \"Be outraged that the binder is boring. You should be. Because the evil deep state LIED TO YOUR FACE.\" \"Who is subverting POTUS?\" wrote radio host Glenn Beck. \"The #Epsteinfiles are a total joke. I know Kash, Pam B and The President. This is not the file.\" \"Send these scumbag traitor agents to prison and throw away the key,\" chimed in the MAGA influencer who goes by Catturd. Epstein was found hanged inside his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City in August 2019, and the New York Medical Examiner has ruled his death a suicide, a conclusion supported by the Justice Department's inspector general. He had been arrested the previous month on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges brought by federal prosecutors in New York. He was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted. The prosecutors in that case said Epstein, who was 66 at the time of his death, sexually abused dozens of underage girls and young women at his properties in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. He was also accused of paying many of his victims to recruit others, allowing him to build a vast network of women to exploit. The charges came more than a decade after Epstein signed a controversial non-prosecution deal in Florida in 2008. The once-secret agreement ended a federal sex crimes investigation against him and spared him the prospect of a long prison sentence. Alex Acosta, the U.S. attorney fwho approved that plea deal, was appointed labor secretary during Trump's first term. He resigned in July 2019 after the deal came under renewed scrutiny. Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months at Palm Beach county jail in that case. The wealthy financier's social circle once inclufded a who's who of famous people, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump. All three have denied being involved in any criminal behavior. A fund set up to compensate women who were sexually abused by Epstein closed down in 2021 after paying out roughly $121 million to about 150 victims. The announcement provided the most comprehensive accounting to date of the number of women and young girls who were allegedly sexually assaulted by Epstein.","summary":"A much-ballyhooed release of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case devolved into anger and disappointment Thursday, with conservative figures and even Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging FBI agents were hiding the full case files.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hyped-release-epstein-files-sparks-anger-disappointment-right-rcna194087","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_07/3228691/200213-barclays-epstein-mc-10423.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:57:43","author":"Michael Kosnar,Rich Schapiro,Sarah Fitzpatrick","authors":["Michael Kosnar","Rich Schapiro","Sarah Fitzpatrick"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.596},{"id":295110778,"title":"Noel and Liam Gallagher reunite at lavish London hotel with surprise peacemakers as they prepare to embark on Oasis reunion gigs","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Feb 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Trump says Ukraine peace deal will be 'soon or not at all' as he hails 'special' Keir Starmer, hints at trade deal, backs off tariffs and supports Chagos handover during White House love-in\n\nGene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa were found mummified at mansion with pills strewn in bathroom\n\nWhat an unlikely bromance!

They then met in a private room. \nOasis guitarist Paul Arthurs, known as Bonehead, also attended the meeting at the lavish hotel and brought his instrument. \nOf the meeting between Liam and Noel, the source added: 'They talked for about an hour before leaving separately.' \nMailOnline has contacted Noel and Liam's representatives for comment. \nIn December, Noel revealed his mother's reaction to the announcement of the Oasis reunion tour as well as the end of the 15-year feud between her sons.\nWhen asked about his mother Peggy's reaction Noel told reporters 'when we told her we were getting back together, she said, 'sure, that will be nice'.\n'My mum couldn't give a s***. My mum never gave a s***, never'.\n\nLiam, 52, brought his sons Lennon, 25, and Gene, 23, (Seen with cousin Anais on Monday) to the meeting with with their Uncle Noel, 57, on Tuesday - after it was revealed they had acted as peacemakers\n\nThe brothers have famously been locked in a feud since the band broke up in 2009. \nNoel said at the time: 'I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.' \nHowever, in August, Liam and Noel reconciled and announced Oasis were reforming for a string of stadium dates in 2025.\nIt's believed a series of late night phone calls between the warring brothers sealed the deal on what would be one of the music events of the decade.\nBut according to music insiders, the long-running feud between the brothers has only barely simmered.\nThe key fact behind the band's hotly-anticipated comeback is said to be purely money. \n\nThe brothers have famously been locked in a feud since the band broke up in 2009 \nA source told MailOnline: 'Noel would only ever consider sharing the stage with Liam again if the money was astronomical and that's what convinced him.\n'They haven't buried the hatchet and Noel will always have huge reservations about being in a band with Liam as he's so unpredictable - both on and off stage.\n'Certain conditions will have to be put in place in regards to safeguarding Noel's presence in this comeback because he really can't handle Liam's form for being a liability.\n'But the sums of money being offered will obviously help through any potential ordeals. It's life changing cash - even for somebody already very rich.'\nOasisHyde ParkLondonLiam Gallagher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNoel and Liam Gallagher reunite at lavish London hotel with surprise peacemakers as they prepare to embark on Oasis reunion gigs\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Gavin Newsom is enlisting veteran Republican lawmaker Ken Calvert to help push his $40 billion wildfire aid request through Congress and secure President Donald Trump’s backing for rebuilding efforts.\n\nCalvert, 71, a longtime member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, has emerged as a key proponent of Newsom’s relief efforts, even as some of his Republican colleagues work to derail it. Calvert’s support runs counter to a broader push within his party to attach conditions to the funding, including changing voter identification laws and rolling back California’s coastal regulations.\n\n“He certainly believes that California and these Los Angeles residents deserve the same federal aid that anyone else in the country deserves,” said Jason Gagnon, a Calvert spokesperson. His office confirmed Calvert’s role leading the congressional push for aid.\n\nThe Los Angeles wildfires, which killed 29 people and caused an estimated $164 billion in economic losses, have left Newsom in a politically delicate position. Once an outspoken Democratic critic of Trump, Newsom has softened his approach in recent weeks with billions in aid on the line. He met privately with Trump at the White House this month, just weeks after greeting the president before he toured the fire damage in hard-hit Pacific Palisades.\n\nOn Friday, Newsom sent a letter to Congress outlining a request for $39.7 billion to support the recovery effort, and said he expects to identify additional funding needs.\n\n“Trump has $40 billion that California needs, and that comes first,” said Dan Schnur, a political analyst who teaches at University of Southern California and the University of California at Berkeley. “Newsom is in a similar situation that many European leaders face with Trump. He needs to play nice.”\n\nTrump and his allies have signaled they are willing to use disaster aid as a bargaining chip. The president has suggested that the state must pass rules requiring voters to show IDs at the polls, while Ric Grenell, a top Trump ally, has proposed dismantling the California Coastal Commission, which regulates shoreline development. Locally, Darrell Issa, a GOP congressman for the San Diego area, said Democrats in California “can’t ask America’s taxpayers to pay for their mistaken liberal policies.”\n\nIt’s a turnaround from former President Joe Biden’s administration, which in the early days of the crisis quickly approved disaster aid. With Republicans now controlling the House and the Senate, Newsom — widely seen as a presidential contender in 2028 — has appeared to put more focus on forging alliances than picking fights.\n\nCalvert’s leadership on the aid package reflects his own political reality.\n\nFor decades, he represented a solid-red district in the Inland Empire, a region known for its suburban sprawl and working-class voters. But after redistricting in 2022 added liberal-leaning Palm Springs to his district, he narrowly won re-election in November with Trump’s endorsement and after speaking at a Trump rally in Coachella, California during the campaign. Now, he’s among the lawmakers a Democratic political action committee is targeting for the 2026 midterm vote, as the party looks to win back voters.\n\nThat shift has pushed the staunch conservative — who voted against certifying the 2020 election and has a history of anti-LGBTQ positions — to moderate on some key issues, said Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist.\n\n“Frankly it’s good politics for both of them,” said Madrid. “Gavin gives Calvert the imprimatur of working in a bipartisan fashion in a district that demands it, and Calvert gives Newsom a lifeline so he’s not totally isolated during the Trump administration.”\n\nCalvert’s support for Newsom’s aid request fits with his bipartisan approach to disaster aid funding — while arguing that policy changes on wildfire prevention and rebuilding efforts could be part of broader relief. Calvert’s district wasn’t directly affected by the fires. The lawmaker has also previously touted his working relationship with the Democratic Senator Alex Padilla to secure firefighting aircraft for the state and on Colorado River issues.\n\n“Those kind of policies are not conditions on aid but rather tools to help our state take commonsense steps to build homes faster and protect residents from wildfires,” Calvert said on X last month.\n\nStill, this week, Calvert voted with most Republicans for a budget blueprint that proposes deep federal spending cuts — reductions that could make it harder for California to secure disaster aid. And Trump has said he wants to overhaul the Federal Emergency Management Agency and last month signed an executive action setting up a council to review its work.\n\nNewsom’s federal request includes $16.8 billion for FEMA public assistance grants and cleanup funding, $16.6 billion for housing and infrastructure rebuilding, as well as $5.3 billion for low-interest loans to fire victims.\n\nNewsom’s office views the request as modest, considering the fire’s destruction. But House Republicans are pushing major budget cuts, including an huge reduction in Department of Housing and Urban Development funding, which could jeopardize $50 billion in grants, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis.\n\nDays ahead of formally requesting the funds, Newsom’s team alerted the Trump administration and congressional leaders, according to a person familiar with the matter. In separate meetings this month, the governor spoke with Trump, Calvert and Representative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican from northern California.\n\n“We’re working across the aisle, as we always have, to ensure survivors have the resources and support they need,” Newsom said in a statement following his White House visit on Feb. 5. “Thank you President Trump for coming to our communities to see this first hand, and meeting with me today to continue our joint efforts to support people impacted.”","summary":"Calvert, 71, a longtime member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, has emerged as a key proponent of Newsom’s relief efforts, even as some of his Republican colleagues work to derail it.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/02/27/newsom-leans-on-veteran-republican-to-push-40-billion-california-fire-aid/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/RPE-L-BIANCO-0217-09-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:55:23","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.033},{"id":295107462,"title":"Trump sees possibility of abandoning idea of duties on UK imports","text":"WASHINGTON, February 28. /TASS/.

I think we've made a lot of progress,\" Trump said, whose week of high-level meetings concludes on Friday with a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump's refusal to acquiesce to Starmer's requests was a blow to European leaders who came to the White House this week to air their concerns that his aggressive efforts to end Russia's war on Ukraine will result in conceding too much to Putin.\n\nThe Starmer trip comes just two days after French President Emmanuel Macron came to Washington to deliver the same message.\n\nZelensky's visit on Friday is expected to produce a controversial minerals deal that Trump contends will give the US access to his country's precious metals as \"payback\" for the tens of billions in military and development aid Washington sent their way since Russia invaded in early 2022.\n\nThe US President will likely adopt the same hard-nosed attitude as Zelensky, who is expected to sign a modified economic development and mineral deal after first bluntly rejecting the idea.\n\nTrump suggested on Thursday that having US companies inside Ukraine mining critical mineral sites will be enough to deter Russia from a second invasion, although some of Ukraine's most lucrative deposits are located in the parts of its territory now occupied by Russian forces.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers,\" the US President said.\n\nHe also made it clear that he doesn't plan to make nice with Zelensky as the two leaders have escalated their feud in recent weeks. When asked if he would apologise for calling Zelensky a \"dictator\", Trump sidestepped the question.\n\n\"I think we are going to have a very good meeting tomorrow,\" Trump said.\n\nStarmer lavished Trump with gifts and produced a surprise personal invitation from King Charles for a state visit to Britain. Trump accepted the offer, although no date for the visit was announced.\n\nThe invitation makes Trump the first elected politician in modern times to be hosted for two state visits by a British monarch, a point repeatedly played up by the visiting Prime Minister. Trump also was invited for a state visit by the late Queen Elizabeth in 2019.\n\n\"This is really special. This has never happened before. This is unprecedented and I think it just symbolises the relationship between us,\" Starmer said.\n\n\"So this is really special.\"\n\nOn another issue, the new British leader appeared to make some headway in shielding the UK from a slate of new tariffs, which Trump is preparing for allies and adversaries.\n\nTrump has vowed to place new tariffs on European imports to compensate for what he says are restrictions on US exports and European restrictions.\n\n\"We're going to have a great trade agreement,\" Trump said at one point, saying Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other aides are working on a US-UK bilateral trade and investment accord that could be struck \"very shortly\".\n\nDespite the efforts to appeal to Trump, there were signs that the two leaders' behind-the-scenes talks were tense.\n\nTrump described their talks as \"outstanding\" but hinted at some difficulties as Starmer pressed him on security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\n\"You've been terrific in our discussions. You're a very tough negotiator, however, I'm not sure I like that, but that's OK,\" Trump said.\n\nStarmer publicly warned Trump against accepting any peace deal that rewards Russia, saying it could set off a chain reaction, making Europe less safe and emboldening other US adversaries such as China and Iran.\n\n\"We have to get it right. There's a famous slogan in the United Kingdom from after the Second World War that 'we have to win the peace,' and that is what we must do now. Because it can't be peace that rewards the aggressor or that gives encouragement to dangerous regimes like Iran,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps most concerning for Starmer was Trump's brushing aside questions about whether the US would respond with its military might if British troops were attacked in post-war Ukraine.\n\nStarmer and Macron, the French President, have endorsed using troops as a peacekeeping force to provide security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Starmer said he would only commit British troops alongside other European nations and \"with the right conditions in place\".\n\nEuropean leaders have argued that using their troops in Ukraine can only work with the support of the more sophisticated American military, an idea that Trump had dismissed. Although the US won’t commit to boots on the ground, it could provide aerial intelligence, surveillance and support, and a quick response if the truce is breached.\n\n“They don’t need much help. They can take care of themselves very well,” Mr. Trump said before adding, “I’ll always be with the British.”\n\nStarmer also suggested that Trump won't provide a military backstop to Europe's security efforts. When asked whether Trump has inched any closer, he responded that a peace deal \"has to come first\".\n\nSince returning to the White House last month, Trump has angered US allies in Europe with his overtures to Putin, hurling insults at Zelensky by calling him a \"dictator\" and insisting Ukraine repay the US for its financial support.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration held peace talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia but excluded Ukraine and other European allies. This week, the US refused to vote for resolutions at the United Nations, blaming Russia for the war, which has persisted for more than three years.\n\nStarmer sought to underscore that a peace deal with Russia that doesn't include Ukraine or European nations could lead to further instability in Europe, which could come back to haunt the US\n\nIt was a similar argument that Macron raised on Monday.\n\nBoth European leaders, however, also pledged to do more to protect Ukraine.\n\nStarmer noted that the United Kingdom had its \"biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the Cold War.\" Earlier this week, Mr. Starmer announced it would raise its military spending from 2.3% of Britain’s GDP to 2.5% by 2027 and then again to 2.6% in 2028.\n\nDespite Trump’s rosy assessment that a peace deal is nearing, an immediate end does not appear close.\n\nRussia continues to bomb Ukraine’s capital.\n\nMoscow’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov threw cold water on the idea of a truce that included European peacekeepers on the ground in Ukraine, and Russian officials rejected the idea that they would give back any of the Ukrainian territory that has now been annexed into the Russian state.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Feb 28 (SocialNews.XYZ) The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer pressed President Donald Trump for a more substantial US commitment to protecting Ukraine if

of UN sanctions.The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.North Korea last conducted such a test in January, when it said it had launched sea-to-surface strategic guided cruise missiles -- Pyongyang's first since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.US and South Korean intelligence also believe that North Korea has sent thousands of troops to Russia to fight against Ukraine and has since suffered hundreds of casualties.On Thursday, South Korean intelligence told AFP that Pyongyang had dispatched more troops to Russia, though it could not give a precise figure.It also said North Korea had redeployed soldiers to the frontline in Kursk, where Ukraine previously said they had been withdrawn following heavy losses.Neither North Korea nor Russia has officially confirmed that Pyongyang's forces are fighting for Moscow.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is

deal in Ukraine to happen 'fairly soon' or not at all","text":"US President Donald Trump says talks to end Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine are “very well advanced” and warned that that there is only a narrow window to broker a deal between Moscow and Kyiv and bring the fighting to a close.He made the remarks on Thursday as he hosted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House, who visited Washington to urge Trump to continue supporting Ukraine, as tensions soared after Trump and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy traded blows last week.The 47th US president also expressed confidence that Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t push to resume the war if a truce can’t be reached. “I think he’ll keep his word,” said Trump on Putin.“I’ve known him for a long time now, we had to go through the Russian hoax together,” added Trump referring to the FBI and Justice Department special counsel investigation that examined whether his 2016 presidential campaign illegally coordinated with the Kremlin to sway the outcome of the election.Starmer’s trip comes just a few days after French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Washington to meet Trump and discuss the war in Ukraine. It also reflects the mounting concern felt by much of Europe that Trump’s over-eagerness to broker a peace deal in Ukraine signals a willingness to concede too much to Putin.“To begin the process of ending this spiral of death, I had historic back to back calls with President Putin,” said Trump in a joint press conference with Starmer following their meeting.Trump also noted that his team have been in contact with Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on several occasions. “We’re working very hard to get that war brought to an end,” said Trump.\"I think we’ve made a lot of progress, and I think it’s moving along pretty rapidly, and I want to thank all of the people that are here that have been working on it, and we’ll let you know what happens.”Trump then dropped a bombshell saying the war in Ukraine will either end “fairly soon”, or not at all. The US president then underlined that the scope in which a deal can be brokered is very narrow.Kyiv has not yet commented on Trump’s remark which comes just one day before he meets with Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss the ongoing peace efforts as well as the Washington-Kyiv minerals deal.The UK’s Starmer also commented on the ongoing peace efforts championed by Washington and expressed his desire to work together with the United States to “deliver a good deal”.Starmer praised Trump for creating a “tremendous opportunity” to reach a historic peace deal, adding that a deal, under the right circumstances, would be celebrated in Ukraine and around the world.The British prime minister then added that there is an urgency to get the deal right. Starmer emphasised that a deal that rewards the aggressor – Russia – sets a dangerous precedent.“There's a famous slogan in the United Kingdom from after the Second World War, that is, that we have to win the peace. And that's what we must do now, because it can't be peace that rewards the aggressor.”“Well, that gives encouragement to regimes like Iran. We agree history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader. So the stakes, they couldn't be higher,” added Starmer.Starmer also reiterated to Trump the pivotal role Washington plays in preserving global peace. He stressed that while there is no confusion in Europe that the US will not be involved on the ground in any peacekeeping capacity, they still play an important role in ensuring peace is sustained.The British premier noted that the presence of European peacekeeping troops is one step to ensure Ukraine’s security, but stressed that the plan “can only work with a US backstop”, stating that Washington must support forces on the ground through aerial intelligence, surveillance and rapid-response cover in the case of a breach of the truce.Trump’s rapprochement with Russia has unsettled Washington longtime allies in Europe. Since his return to the White House, the US president has repeatedly taken jabs at his allies across the Atlantic, levelling threats of pulling the US out of NATO, levying tariffs on the EU and even excluding Europe from peace talks.European countries have found themselves on the back foot with Trump’s second term looking determined to dramatically reshape US foreign policy in line with his “America First” world view, which has increasingly isolated the US on the world stage.Momentum might be shifting for the better as Trump noted that he and Starmer had “tremendously productive” talks and are working on deals that would bring the US and UK closer.Starmer also extended an invitation to Trump on behalf of King Charles to continue dialogue between the two nations and Europe, which Trump accepted.The visit, which Starmer hailed as historic and unprecedented, would be the second invitation for a UK state visit. Trump already received the honour during his first term as president.","summary":"US President Donald Trump says ending the war in Ukraine could either happen fairly soon, or not at all, as he speaks to the media in a joint press conference with visiting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.","url":"https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/28/trump-says-peace-deal-in-ukraine-to-happen-fairly-soon-or-not-at-all","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/08/46/08/1440x810_cmsv2_237b3f33-239c-5534-81f4-c293aa14d299-9084608.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:51:02","author":"Malek Fouda","authors":["Malek Fouda"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.192},{"id":295105504,"title":"AUKUS question stumps Donald Trump","text":"US President Donald Trump appeared to be unaware of Australia's $368billion military pact with the United States when a journliast questioned him about the deal. \n\nWhen asked by a British reporter ahead of a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the White House whether the two leaders would be discussing AUKUS, Mr Trump responded 'what does that mean?' \n\nWhen the reporter described it as a three-way defence technology partnership between the US, the UK and Australia, Trump agreed it was on the agenda. \n\n'We'll be discussing that. We have another great relationship, and you have too, with Australia.\n\n'Yeah, we've had a very good relationship with Australia.' \n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has previously said AUKUS represented a 'new chapter' in US and Australian relations and was the 'biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in our history'. \n\nThe deal is anticipated to cost anywhere from $268billion to $368billion over the next 30 years and extends to matters including quantum computing, hypersonic missiles and artificial intelligence. \n\nUnder the deal, Australia will invest US$3billion in America's submarine industry in exchange for the opportunity to purchase several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines. \n\nThough Joe Biden was in office at the time of the deal's signing, many hoped its size and strategic significance would have curried good favour with the new Trump administration. \n\nWhen Australia confirmed its first $800million payment under the deal earlier this month, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said Trump was both supportive and 'very aware' of the deal. \n\nIn a recent phone call with Trump, Albanese touted the deal as one of a number of reasons why Australia should be exempted from a proposed 25 per cent tariff on all aluminium and steel exports to the US. \n\nImmediately after the call, Mr Albanese fronted the press outside Parliament House to celebrate the success of the 'constructive' call. \n\n'The relationship is in good shape,' he said.\n\nWhen asked what Trump made of the AUKUS deal, Mr Albanese was reluctant to lift the veil. \n\n'Well, quite clearly I've indicated there's very positive support for the AUKUS relationship.\n\n'I have no intention of speaking on behalf of President Trump. That is up to him. \n\n'But quite clearly, I've indicated there's strong bipartisan support for AUKUS in Australia and in the United States.'\n\nEmployment Minister Murray Watt dismissed concern about the US president not knowing immediately what AUKUS was.\n\n'I wouldn't make too much about a president with a very full plate not remembering one acronym. I think all of us go through that sort of thing at different times,' he told ABC Radio on Friday.\n\n'You'll see there that he was able to say very quickly about the strength of the relationship with Australia and the fact that AUKUS will be something he'll be discussing with the British prime minister.'\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton said the Australian alliance with the US was still strong.\n\n'Not everyone you know gets the acronyms, and all the rest of it, but there's no doubt in my mind that the president strongly supports the alliance between our three countries and strongly supports AUKUS,' he told Nine's Today program.\n\n'He stated that previously and the submarine deal ... will underpin the national security of our country for the next century.","summary":"The military pact, touted as Australia's most significant defence uplift, apparently failed to register with the US President.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14444997/AUKUS-question-stumps-Donald-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/27/22/95671307-0-image-a-10_1740696382552.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:48:08","author":"Editor,Nick Wilson","authors":["Editor","Nick Wilson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.016},{"id":295112354,"title":"Elon Musk meets with Senate DOGE Caucus as government waste gets cut","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nSpecial Report February 27, 2025 03:06 \n\n Elon Musk meets with Senate DOGE Caucus as government waste gets cut \n Fox News senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie unpacks President Donald Trump's cost cutting agenda on 'Special Report.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Tags POLITICSSPECIAL REPORTDONALD TRUMP","summary":"Fox News senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie unpacks President Donald Trump&apos;s cost cutting agenda on &apos;Special Report.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369417744112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/beaed511-a6e1-451a-a83f-2fdcfdc21e0c/a4de2e64-0dc8-4e56-a531-a7bbe7c2d03f/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:47:35","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":295114086,"title":"Trump is looking to give Americans ‘affordable, reliable and abundant energy,’ Derrick Morgan says","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air February 27, 2025 04:47 \n\n Trump is looking to give Americans ‘affordable, reliable and abundant energy,’ Derrick Morgan says \n Heritage Foundation EVP Derrick Morgan discusses President Donald Trump’s energy and tariff agenda on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODESV-VIDEOSPOLITICSENERGYECONOMY","summary":"Heritage Foundation EVP Derrick Morgan discusses President Donald Trump’s energy and tariff agenda on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6369414892112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/6c23e060-f391-4881-ace6-c986d6157703/15ae3904-b755-4f54-a308-87747f685fbf/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:46:46","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.105},{"id":295103296,"title":"‘We the people are the economy’: 24-hour boycott planned to take back power","text":"Consumers across the country have committed to boycotting major store chains and avoiding unnecessary purchases for 24 hours Friday, aiming to show large corporations “who really holds the power.”\n\nThough the boycott could serve as a warning to corporations of how many people are upset over current economic and political conditions, experts said that creating substantial change would likely take prolonged action.\n\nOrganized by advocacy group The People’s Union USA, the economic blackout calls on consumers to not make any purchases in-person or online between midnight and 11:59 p.m. Friday, especially spending money at major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy and on fast food or gas, according to their website. Participants are also asked to avoid using credit or debit cards for non-essential spending.\n\n“Corporations and banks only care about their bottom line. If we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,” The People’s Union website reads. “If they don’t listen (they won’t) we make the next blackout longer (we will).”\n\nThe instructions add that participants can still buy essentials such as food, medicine and emergency supplies — and encourages these purchases to be made at small businesses. The movement has spread broadly on social media.\n\nThe People’s Union USA is a movement of people “unionizing to take back control of our economy, government and future of our country,” according to their mission statement. A GoFundMe page raising money for the organization’s mission had raised more than $70,000 as of Thursday.\n\nJohn Schwarz, the founder of The People’s Union USA, encouraged people to “hold the line” and not be discouraged if they see people shopping on Friday in a video posted to his Instagram.\n\n“There are 340 million people in America, and not all of them will stand with us, but millions will,” he said. “Make no mistake. We are already making an impact.\n\n“We the people are the economy. Without us, nothing moves. Without us, there is no profit,” he added. “We hit them where they hurts, and that is their wallets.”\n\nEconomic boycotts can be “very effective,” said Dr. Julian Vogel, an assistant professor of finance at San Jose State University.\n\n“The impact of a one-day boycott is most likely going to be limited, simply because not buying anything [Friday] might also include, for some people, simply buying a little more on Saturday or more on Thursday,” Vogel said. “What is the main benefit of that one-day boycott, I think, is that if there is a height of participation, this can serve as a stark warning that enough people are taking it seriously.”\n\nIf the movement were to turn into an extended boycott, Vogel said, companies will have been warned about how many people would participate.\n\nLarry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State University, explained that spreading the boycott across many different companies could make it less effective, adding that it will be difficult to determine its impact.\n\n“If they targeted one company or another company as an example, I think that kind of approach might result in a greater response,” he said, adding that it is the “easier way out” for people to stop shopping at many stores for just one day and swapping the shopping to another day instead.\n\nVogel added that more impactful boycotts often have specific asks as opposed to Friday’s general message of economic power. He said the planned boycott has a clear aim at high prices but serves primarily as a warning of the consumer’s strength in the longer-term.\n\n“It helps to know what we’re arguing about,” he said. “I think the messaging for [today] is clear enough that change would theoretically be possible. But again, the one day [boycott] is more like a warning.”\n\nVogel explained that it is difficult to find the measurable impact of a boycott without specific variables, as it would look different for corporations with different operating cycles. The most impactful timeline would be to boycott a company for an entire season, such as refusing to buy everything a company produces for the spring season — from decorations to spring chocolates.\n\n“If they didn’t know how long this was going to last, and we’re a week or two weeks in but there is no telling how long this will go on, then this would definitely have a huge effect,” Vogel added.\n\nEconomic boycotts such as Friday’s planned action derive from a combination of emotional factors like frustration and anger and non-emotional factors such as financial hardship, Vogel said.\n\n“I understand the cost, I understand the importance, I understand the frustration that a lot of people have over these incredible changes that are happening right before us, and the fact that some people want to do something, but there’s no easy way out here,” Gerston added. “Things have to be structured in a way where they really make a difference.”\n\nGerston explained how for the first month or so of President Donald Trump’s term people have largely “sat back” but that he is beginning to see wider reactions to some policies being passed. These movements will likely develop into larger protests over the next few months but they often take a while, he said, adding that protest movements are often “herky-jerky.”\n\n“You take a step forward, you take a step backward,” he said. “Some fall apart. Some gather steam. These things, ultimately if they’re going to succeed, have to succeed over time.”","summary":"The boycott aims to show large corporations \"who really holds the power,\" but experts say more focus could provide a stronger message.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/02/27/economic-boycott-feb-28-planned-power-trump/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/OCR-Z-SENIORS-CASH-1215.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:46:29","author":"Caelyn Pender","authors":["Caelyn Pender"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":295104894,"title":"FBI withheld ‘thousands’ of Epstein docs – US attorney general","text":"Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused the Federal Bureau of Investigation of withholding “thousands of pages” of documents related to the investigation of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. In a letter addressed to the newly appointed FBI director, Kash Patel, Bondi demanded the immediate release of all pertinent files.\n\nEarlier that day, the Department of Justice released a set of documents dubbed “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” to a select group of conservative influencers. Notable figures such as Libs of TikTok’s Chaya Raichik, journalist Jack Posobiec, pundit Liz Wheeler and conservative commentator Mike Cernovich were seen exiting the White House with binders labeled with the project’s title.\n\nHowever, these documents were heavily redacted and contained mostly previously reported information. “We got the binder at noon… AG Bondi wanted to get out what they had, which wasn’t anything material,” Cernovich wrote in a post on X, adding that the FBI “held back the real information and AG Bondi directed Kash Patel to start kicking ass.”\n\nBondi’s letter to Patel on Thursday alleges that despite assurances by his predecessors at the FBI that her office had received the complete set of Epstein-related documents, a tip from an insider revealed the existence of additional undisclosed files. The initial batch provided to Bondi’s office reportedly comprised approximately 200 pages, including flight logs, contact information and victim identities, which according to the AG was already enough to “make you sick.” \n\n“By 8:00am tomorrow, February 28, the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained,” Bondi wrote in her letter to Patel. “There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access.”\n\nThe limited release of the Epstein files has drawn criticism from Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads President Donald Trump’s newly established “declassification\" task force. “This is not what we or the American people asked for. Get us the information we asked for instead of leaking old info to press,” Luna wrote on X in all caps.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order shortly after taking office, mandating the release of the Epstein files along with classified documents related to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe Epstein case has drawn significant attention due to his extensive network of high-profile associates, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew, billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, and numerous other celebrities and business leaders. Trump also personally knew Epstein but has denied ever visiting his private island, maintaining that he cut ties with him in the 1990s – years before the financier’s first arrest for soliciting prostitution in 2006 – and has vowed to declassify all files.\n\nRaising concerns about the potential destruction of these sensitive documents, Representative Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) has proposed legislation aimed at preserving all non-public records related to Epstein. In a letter to Bondi on Wednesday, Ogles announced his intent to introduce the Preventing Epstein Documentation Obliteration Act, or the PEDO Act, following “reports that certain FBI agents are allegedly attempting to destroy critical records.”","summary":"Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding “thousands of pages” related to the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/613418-fbi-withheld-epstein-files/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.02/article/67c0f8b620302730b654c8c7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:46:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":295114570,"title":"How Andrew Tate’s release is splintering the American right","text":"There’s an intra-MAGA fight playing out right now over Andrew Tate, a far-right influencer and self-described misogynist who arrived in Florida on Thursday morning. \nTate, along with his brother Tristan, had been awaiting trial in Romania on human trafficking charges, but they were allowed to return to the United States overnight. Some of his supporters in the online right celebrated: It was a triumph for the rule of law, the conservative commentator Candace Owens posted on X. But some conservatives have criticized his release and the alleged role of the Trump administration in securing his return.\nThose critics have tended to be pretty mainstream conservative thought leaders and commentators — folks like the podcaster Ben Shapiro, who complained that “America does not need more self-proclaimed pimps and terror supporters with outstanding criminal allegations of sex trafficking and a history of pornographic distribution.” The critics include members of Trump’s own party, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\nThese split reactions to Tate’s arrival are revealing an underlying schism on the right: between the more conventional social conservative wing of the coalition, and the more provocative, manosphere-adjacent realm of tech bros and podcasters who seem ascendant in the second Trump term.\nTate became a far-right podcasting star in the 2020s with his explicitly sexist philosophy of masculinity. He quickly gained a wide following among both young men specifically, and several prominent MAGA figures, including Trump’s own former personal attorney and current adviser Alina Habba, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump Jr.\nHe and his brother were arrested in 2022, when Tate was charged with rape and the brothers were accused of leading a human trafficking operation. (Both have denied the allegations.)\nBut reports had been circulating that people in Trump’s orbit were taking on the task of trying to free them. The Financial Times reported that US special envoy Ric Grenell raised the Tates’ case to Romania’s foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month. \nBut not everyone was pleased with the Tates’ return.\nIn Congress, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley was among the critics. “I would hope our government wasn’t involved in any way,” he told reporters. “I don’t think conservatives should be glorifying this guy at all.”\nDeSantis also condemned them, and asked the state’s attorney general to see what legal recourse they had to respond.\n“Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct,” he said. “I don’t know how it came to this. We were not involved. We were not notified. Clearly the federal government has jurisdiction whether they want to rebuff his entry into the United States.”\nThroughout the first month of Trump’s presidency, Trump has been nearly universally praised by his coalition. The Republican base has remained loyal, even as his popularity among other segments of the American electorate have steadily declined. So this split among elites in the coalition stands out — and raises questions about just how durable these pro-Trump bonds will be.\n“We should wait and see, but I can say that if Trump really did bless allowing the Tate brothers to come to the US, it would be the primary exhibit that his administration is guided by a hyper-online right that is very out of touch with the real world and needs to touch grass,” the conservative radio host Erick Erickson posted on X.\nTrump, at least, for now, seems to be distancing himself. When asked if he had intervened, Trump was curt. “I know nothing about that,” he said. “I didn’t know anything about it.”\nWe may still get more details about how or why Tate’s restrictions were lifted, and the Romanian charges haven’t been dropped. But as he reenters the American public square, this schism may continue to widen — especially as both sides vie for more influence over Trump’s policy, over the Republican Party, and over the future of conservatism.","summary":"There’s an intra-MAGA fight playing out right now over Andrew Tate, a far-right influencer and self-described misogynist who arrived in Florida on Thursday morning.&#160; Tate, along with his brother Tristan, had been awaiting trial in Romania on human trafficking charges, but they were allowed to return to the United States overnight.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised the flow of illicit drugs into the US, allegedly coming from both Canada and Mexico.As a result, Trump has decided to move forward with the imposition of tariffs on both countries, starting March 4. Additionally, reciprocal tariffs are set to continue with full force from April 2.Further, Trudeau added that, \"the first thing on tariffs is to emphasise that our government, and indeed all of Team Canada, premiers, business leaders, community leaders, are focused on one thing, making sure that come Tuesday and for the weeks that follow, there are no tariffs imposed on Canada,\" as per CBC News.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"The tariffs that the president speaks of for next week are centered around the fentanyl crisis that they're facing in the United States, but that we are also facing in Canada,\" he added.Addressing concerns regarding fentanyl trafficking into the United States, he said \"And for months now, I've been emphasising that less than one per cent of the fentanyl that arrives in the United States comes from Canada. But we know that even that one per cent, or less than one per cent, should be reduced, which is why we've invested USD 1.3 billion in strengthening our border capacities with Blackhawk helicopters, with drones, with 10,000 people patrolling our borders and keeping Canadians and Americans safe.\"And that Canada is not the source of problems for the United States,\" he added.Meanwhile, on February 4, the US President paused tariffs on imports from both countries for 30 days, saying that he had secured new commitments from the two countries to improve border security. The pause was put in place after President Trump said he spoke to his counterparts from Mexico and Canada.\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels. A large percentage of these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and supplied by China. More than 100,000 people died last year due to the distribution of these dangerous and highly addictive POISONS,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Citing the smuggling of drugs across the border, Trump has vowed to stop or \"seriously limit\" such drugs, especially Fentanyl.\"Millions of people have died over the last two decades. The families of the victims are devastated and, in many instances, virtually destroyed. We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH 4 will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,\" read Trump's post.In addition, China will also be charged an additional 10 per cent tariff from March 4.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday issued a warning regarding the potential imposition of tariffs by the United States, stating that \"Canada will have an immediate and extremely strong response,\" CBC News reported.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/will-have-immediate-extremely-strong-response-canada-on-us-tariffs-7811853","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/vqp3pmb_justin-trudeau_625x300_21_December_24.jpeg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:44:06","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.047},{"id":295110100,"title":"Meet the Transgender Troops the Trump Administration Is Barring","text":"SAN DIEGO -- Sgt. 1st Class Julia Becraft circled up a dozen infantry soldiers at Fort Cavazos, Texas, and introduced herself as their new squad leader. She let them know they were in experienced hands: She had deployed to Afghanistan three times, seen a fair share of combat and been awarded the Bronze Star.\n\nAlso, she told them, she was transgender.\n\nShe had worried about this moment since transitioning a year earlier. How would the soldiers react? Would they accept a trans woman as their leader?\n\nFor a few seconds, no one spoke. Then there were nods of acceptance. Other soldiers started introducing themselves as well, sharing something about their own lives.\n\nThen they all went to do morning physical training, just like every other squad in their battalion.\n\n\"At first, you could tell some were surprised,\" Becraft recalled earlier this year. \"But they saw I was genuine and respected my experience. Me being transgender just wasn't that much of a thing.\"\n\nBecraft does not recognize herself in the Trump administration's portrayal of transgender service members. The administration says, without providing evidence, that trans troops saddle the government with costly health care and corrode military effectiveness. An executive order last month asserted that being transgender \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful and disciplined lifestyle.\" Late on Wednesday, the Defense Department released a memo saying that trans troops now serving would be forced out.\n\n\"It is the policy of the United States government to establish high standards for service-member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity,\" the memo explaining the policy said.\n\nEssential troops may be able to get a waiver, the policy states, if they don't transition and can show \"compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\"\n\nSome trans military members are challenging the policy in court.\n\nTrans troops say their experiences in uniform hardly fit the dark descriptions of their critics. In two dozen interviews, many told The New York Times that despite the dire depictions being transgender in the military is no big deal.\n\nThe troops interviewed -- three pilots, an explosives expert, a special operations officer, a nuclear reactor supervisor, a flight nurse, a missile battery commander and others -- said they have faced some institutional barriers and heard a few cutting comments. But mostly, they say, they have been treated with respect. Their leadership has supported them, their peers have accepted them, and they have earned good performance reviews and promotions.\n\nOfficers and troops who are not trans said in interviews they had not seen any negative impact from trans troops.\n\nNot that coming out was easy. Many of the trans troops said it was hard to come to terms with something they had been trying to deny for years. Becraft's marriage didn't survive. But when she told the Army that she was trans, her brigade offered her a temporary desk job with a more flexible schedule while she began her transition and went to therapy. A year later, she returned to leading soldiers.\n\n\"If anything, since I've transitioned, I've become a better leader,\" Becraft said in an interview before the ban was announced. \"I'm more comfortable. I don't have to hide anything. Now, maybe, I have more wisdom, and I think my soldiers respond to that.\"\n\nBefore the decision to discharge all trans soldiers was announced, she had hoped to be promoted to platoon sergeant this spring.\n\nMany trans troops, like millions of others in America, saw the military as a patriotic pathway for opportunity -- one that has become open to an increasingly diverse group of Americans.\n\nThe policy on trans military service, however, has been a tug of war between competing visions of the military for a decade. In 2016, six years after he signed a bill to let gay service members serve openly, President Barack Obama lifted a ban on transgender service. The next year, President Donald Trump announced a new ban, which President Joe Biden reversed in 2021.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, thousands of trans service members who had been serving in uniform for years came out.\n\nEven so, trans troops still make up only a tiny portion of the armed forces. There are currently 4,240 trans troops in the military, or about 0.2% of the force, according to numbers released Thursday.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nMany of them volunteered to serve not yet recognizing that they were transgender.\n\nChief Warrant Officer Jo Ellis was just out of high school in 2009 when she joined the Army National Guard as a helicopter mechanic. She deployed to combat as a door gunner, then became a Black Hawk helicopter pilot. In 2021, while going through the military's brutal survival school, where pilots endure mock torture, sleep deprivation and solitary confinement, she had a sudden realization that she was trans.\n\n\"I had been raised very conservative, church twice a week, home-school,\" Ellis said. \"Throughout my life, I was plagued by the desire to be a woman, but I never understood why. And suddenly I was so exhausted that I had no defenses left, and it just smacked me in the face.\"\n\nWorried that coming out would ruin her career, she hid how she felt for two years.\n\n\"Maybe there were trans people serving somewhere in the Army, but definitely not in my unit,\" she said. \"We're a very blue-collar, good-old-boy-type environment.\"\n\n\"I assumed the worst, but I was wrong,\" she said. \"When I came out, everyone in my unit just opened their arms to me.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth has called trans troops \"weird\" and \"a distraction.\" A number of military officers who have commanded units with trans troops said that was not their experience.\n\n\"They've tried to make a big deal out of this, just like they did in the past with integrating women or African Americans, but it's just a nothing-burger,\" said Capt. Justin Long, who retired from the Navy in 2023 after more than 20 years in uniform. \"I've had 15 trans sailors in my command over the years and never had an issue. The other sailors treat them like anyone else. All they want to know is, Will you show up and do your job?\"\n\nIn recent years, the military has looked at gender affirming medical care the same way it has regarded broken bones, cancer diagnoses or scores of other medical issues that troops encounter. To receive treatment, there must be a diagnosis, a treatment plan and coordination with commanders to avoid interference with deployments or critical training.\n\n\"We don't treat them any differently, and we shouldn't,\" Long said.\n\nHe said that forcing all trans troops out ignores the recommendations of senior leaders, and \"flies in the face of science and reality.\"\n\nThe Trump administration also claimed the cost of gender-affirming care is too high -- though it had not offered any figures.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Defense Department to release numbers for the first time. The figures showed the military has spent $52 million on gender-affirming care since 2015, or about $9,000 per individual. The department said about half of trans troops required no gender-affirming medical care, and only a quarter received gender-affirming surgery.\n\nThere is another cost that is rarely mentioned, said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy fighter pilot: the cost of losing highly trained service members.\n\nShilling, who has flown 60 combat missions and is the president of SPARTA Pride, an advocacy organization for trans troops. She said many trans troops are people like her: senior personnel who will be difficult and expensive to replace.\n\nThe Navy spent millions of dollars on her training and flight hours, and sent her to graduate school to prepare her for greater responsibilities, she said. She now helps to oversee a multibillion-dollar carrier-launched drone program.\n\n\"We're an extremely valuable asset to just throw away,\" Shilling said. \"Why would you want to get rid of someone you have so much invested in?\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nThe new policy makes clear that even people who transitioned years before, and are unlikely to represent any extra costs or time lost for the armed forces, can no longer serve.\n\nPetty Officer 2nd Class Paulo Bautista transitioned more than 10 years before he joined the Navy. His surgery was done, his hormone levels were stable, and the emotional turmoil of the process had long ago settled into a quiet confidence.\n\nThe only gender-related medical care he requires is a weekly testosterone shot. The military provides the same shots to about 5,000 men in uniform who are not trans and have low testosterone levels.\n\n\"Honestly, most people don't even know I'm trans, unless I tell them,\" he said.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, trans troops who had already started their transition in uniform were allowed to keep serving. Many who came out under the old regulations are shocked that this time they are being forced out.\n\nPetty Officer 2nd Class Sam Rodriguez joined the Navy as a diesel mechanic, then served as a military prison guard. Rodriguez, who is nonbinary and uses the pronouns they and them, got married, had two children and studied at night for a master's degree. Last fall, the Navy selected them to commission as an officer and train as a clinical social worker.\n\nBut the military now sees them as unfit to serve, and they face mandatory discharge. But before the new policy was announced, they saw their identity as an asset to the Navy.\n\n\"Since I've been on both sides of gender, and both sides of enlisted and officer experience, I have a lot of lived experience that will help me relate to people,\" they said. \"I joined the Navy to be part of the greater good, and giving good health care to people who serve is part of that.\"\n\nRodriguez said it was difficult at times to fit in to a military that dresses and houses troops based strictly on two genders. Forced to check a box, they reluctantly picked \"male.\"\n\n\"It can feel like you are an invisible person,\" Rodriguez said. \"But I realize we all have to make sacrifices, and that's something I decided I was willing to do to keep serving.\"\n\nNow, they feel they are being punished for following regulations, and wonder if that sacrifice was for nothing.\n\nAs Rodriguez contemplated being forced out, they asked, \"What will I do for my family?\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"SAN DIEGO -- Sgt. 1st Class Julia Becraft circled up a dozen infantry soldiers at Fort Cavazos, Texas, and introduced herself as their new squad leader.

Just not in Gaza itself.\n\nBut Palestinians say the promise of new developments in foreign countries skirts the demand at the centre of their aspirations: the right to live with dignity and equal rights in their historic homeland.\n\n“My first reaction was disbelief. That a president would call to displace two million people from their own land,” said Leila Giries, a Palestinian who lives in California.\n\nFor Giries and other Palestinians, the call for expulsion invokes painful memories of dispossession and exile.\n\nGiries herself is a survivor of the events Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, which means “the catastrophe”.\n\nThe term refers to the forced expulsion of more than 750,000 Palestinians by Zionist paramilitaries during Israel’s founding in 1948. The residents of many Palestinian towns and villages were barred from ever returning, deemed “infiltrators” by the newly founded Israeli state.\n\nGiries keeps a bag her mother carried while fleeing their village of Ayn Karim framed on the wall of her California residence, along with a key to their home in historic Palestine that was demolished after their expulsion.\n\nThe items are symbols of both the pain of exile and her determination to maintain ties to her homeland.\n\n“I left Palestine when I was eight years old, but I cannot forget it. It’s where my parents and my grandparents are from. I am connected to the land,” Giries said.\n\n“When I see the photos of crowds of displaced people marching on the road in Gaza, it breaks my heart. It brings back memories, memories, memories.”\n\n‘Palestinians will not vanish and die’\n\nFollowing fierce backlash from Palestinians, rights groups and a coalition of leaders from countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, Trump eased his position by stating that he would only “suggest” the adoption of his plan.\n\nThe US president had previously insisted that he would “own” Gaza, stating that its place by the sea could transform it into an ideal location for high-end real estate.\n\nThis week, Trump even shared a bizarre AI-generated video on social media showing Gaza filled with skyscrapers and luxury resorts, with him and Netanyahu relaxing next to a swimming pool.\n\nNotably absent was any sign of the Palestinians who have called Gaza home for generations.\n\n“Only a fool would think it’s possible to cleanse Gaza of the Palestinians so you can build a real estate project,” says Michael Kardoush, who fled his home in Nazareth after it came under Israeli control in 1948. Palestinians inside Israeli territory lived under martial law with no rights until 1966.\n\n“The reality is that Palestinians will not vanish and die.”\n\nBut Israeli leaders and officials have continued to eagerly promote Trump’s vision, seeing an opportunity to advance a longstanding ambition to depopulate the strip.\n\nIn a statement last week, Netanyahu said Israel was “committed to US President Trump’s plan for the creation of a different Gaza”, which he previously lauded as “revolutionary”.\n\nBut Muhammad Shehada, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who grew up in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that Israeli and US efforts to force Palestinians off of their land have been a consistent feature of Gaza’s modern history.\n\n“When Israel took over Gaza in 1967, one of the first things it did was destroy refugee camps to try and get people to leave. They even offered money, foreign passports and shuttles to try and get people to do so,” he said.\n\nWhen such inducements would not work, he says that Israel tried more coercive methods, from deadly military raids to a years-long blockade that created dire living conditions in Gaza even before the most recent war.\n\n“They have tried every trick in the book,” said Shehada.\n\nBut he added that those efforts have rarely enjoyed success and have often faced firm opposition from Palestinians, who see attempts to move them out of the Strip as part of a larger effort to nullify their national claims.\n\nShehada pointed out that, in 1953, a plan to resettle 12,000 Palestinians from Gaza to the Egyptian Sinai was halted following a popular revolt in the Strip.\n\nAttachment to the land\n\nEven during Israel’s most recent 15-month military campaign in Gaza, unprecedented for its destructiveness and human toll, many Palestinians remained firmly attached to their sense of place in Gaza.\n\nArwa Shurrab, a 58-year-old woman who was born in Gaza but now lives in southern California, says that members of her family who continued living in the Strip refused to leave until they felt they had little choice.\n\n“I was trying to convince my sister to go to Egypt where it would be safer, but she said she would only leave if a building she was staying in was bombed,” said Shurrab.\n\nShe explained that her sister and her family were displaced numerous times during the war. They finally decided to leave when a tent where they had been staying was bombed. Fortunately, they were not inside at the time.\n\n“She is a paediatrician and wanted to stay in Gaza and help her people. For that, she has lost everything,” Shurrab added.\n\nEven though Israel’s bombing campaign was paused under a tenuous ceasefire last month, many Palestinians in Gaza remain in precarious circumstances. The military assault reduced many neighbourhoods to rubble.\n\nDuring the war, Israeli forces were accused of deliberately destroying homes, agricultural lands and infrastructure for medical care, water and electricity, in order to make it impossible for Palestinians to return home after the fighting had ended.\n\nBut many Gaza residents say that they remain determined to find a way forward.\n\n“Palestinians are very connected to the land. Everyone I know who left wants to go back. It is a question of if, not when,” said Shurrab.\n\n“Trump’s comments didn’t affect me at all. I don’t take it seriously because I know my family and I know the people of Gaza. They are not going to be uprooted from their land,” she added. “So Trump can say whatever he wants, but it does not make it so.”","summary":"Members of the Palestinian diaspora in the US say Trump’s proposal to depopulate Gaza is doomed to fail.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/27/nakba-survivors-see-echoes-of-the-past-in-trumps-calls-for-gaza-expulsion?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AA-20250223-37143574-37143532-DAILY_LIFE_IN_KHAN_YOUNIS_IN_THE_SOUTHERN_GAZA_STRIP-1740409548.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:39:01","author":"Apps Support,Brian Osgood","authors":["Apps Support","Brian Osgood"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.138},{"id":295102336,"title":"Department of Education launches ‘EndDEI’ portal for parents, students, teachers to report discrimination","text":"The U.S. Department of Education on Thursday launched a portal allowing parents to report what’s been going on in classrooms.\n\nParents can now go to EndDEI.gov to “describe in as much detail as possible the discriminatory practice taking place,” as well as sections to list the school district and zip code.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Education is committed to ensuring all students have access to meaningful learning free of divisive ideologies and indoctrination,” the website states.\n\nThe submission form provides an outlet for students, parents, teachers, and others to report “illegal discriminatory practices” in schools. ED will use the incident report to “identify potential areas for investigation.”\n\nNicole Neily, president of Parents Defending Education, told Fox News Digital that the portal is necessary considering the widespread push to report these kinds of incidents.\n\n“We’re very much in a ‘see something, say something’ moment in time — not only to root out the obvious practices and policies, but also the insidious proxies that have permeated education,” she said. “With approximately 13,500 school districts and 4,000 degree-granting institutions, there’s a lot of ground to cover — and many hands make light work!”\n\nThe portal comes after President Donald Trump’s crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) soon after he got into office, fulfilling a campaign promise. Trump on Jan. 22 signed an executive order terminating DEI discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting and spending.\n\nThe executive order directed every department and agency to end “private sector DEI discrimination,” including civil compliance investigations. Furthermore, the ED was ordered to issue guidance to ensure that any new measures and practices are aligned with the Supreme Court’s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which held that race-based affirmative action programs in college admissions violate the Constitution.\n\nMany proponents of DEI argue that the effort corrects historical injustices and systemic inequities.\n\n“For years, parents have been begging schools to focus on teaching their kids practical skills like reading, writing, and math, instead of pushing critical theory, rogue sex education and divisive ideologies — but their concerns have been brushed off, mocked, or shut down entirely,” said Tiffany Justice, co-founder of Moms for Liberty, an organization that ascended to prominence by highlighting educational content deemed inappropriate by parents, in a press release.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, school board meetings have often become contentious battles between parents and school board officials, sparking a debate about how much control parents have over their children’s education.\n\nParents lashed out at school administrators over sexually explicit and LGBTQ-related books being showcased in school libraries and used in the classroom.\n\nSome teachers took issue with mandates forcing them to use students’ pronouns that did not align with their biological sex, resulting in legal battles that swung in their favor.\n\nLawmakers from the local school board to state level passed legislation giving parents more transparency into their child’s education, curbing DEI efforts that affect community members, and implementing rigorous book review policies that address progressive curricula like critical race theory and gender theory being taught in classrooms.","summary":"'The U.S. Department of Education is committed to ensuring all students have access to meaningful learning free of divisive ideologies and indoctrination,' the website states.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/us-news/ed-launches-enddei-portal-for-parents-students-teachers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/99376704.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/vuJ1n6BE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:38:09","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":295102482,"title":"Kentucky reports its first case of measles amid ongoing efforts to control the disease in the US","text":"A confirmed case of measles has been reported in Kentucky, health authorities have announced, opening a new front in the US spread of the disease.\n\nThe Kentucky department for public health (KDPH) said that an adult who had recently traveled to another country had contracted the disease. The person had been at a Planet Fitness gym while infectious, potentially exposing others.\n\nThis is the first case of measles in the state since 2023. It comes as the US battles the spread of the highly contagious virus, which this week claimed the life of an unvaccinated child, marking the first US death from the disease since 2015.\n\nThere have been three outbreaks of measles so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The most serious of those is in west Texas, where the virus is spreading largely among the Mennonite community in which rates of vaccination are low.\n\nNine states in total have reported cases of measles. In addition to Kentucky and Texas, that includes Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island.\n\nSteven Stack, who heads the public health department in Kentucky, urged people to get vaccinated. He pointed out that rates of vaccinations among Kentucky kindergartners was only 90%, lower than the national average.\n\n“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses in the world. Vaccines are an essential tool to keep children and adults safe and healthy,” Stack said.\n\nThe growing challenge of measles comes as a notorious vaccine skeptic has just become the top US health official. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense and has aired debunked conspiracy theories that childhood vaccinations are linked to autism.\n\nKennedy made his first public appearance in the top health role on Wednesday at a cabinet meeting with Donald Trump in the White House. He said that the measles epidemic was being followed by the government “every day”, but then appeared to try to minimize the seriousness of the spread.\n\n“It’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA confirmed case of measles has been reported in Kentucky, health authorities&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kentucky reports its first case of measles amid ongoing efforts to control the disease in the US first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/kentucky-reports-its-first-case-of-measles-amid-ongoing-efforts-to-control-the-disease-in-the-us/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-27 23:37:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028}]}
