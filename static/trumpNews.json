Polling has shown that November's contest will likely look similar, with several surveys in the last few weeks finding this year's presidential candidates tied in the Badget State.According to a survey by Napolitan News released on Thursday, Harris is up by Trump by just one percentage point (50 percent to 49 percent) among 788 likely voters in Wisconsin. Given the poll's margin of error of 3.5 percent, however, the candidates are considered to be in a statistical tie.A separate survey from Rasmussen Reports and American Thinker, conducted between September 19 and 22, found the 2024 candidates tied at 49 percent, according to the responses of 1,071 likely voters in Wisconsin. As American Thinker managing editor Andrea Widburg noted in a report that accompanied the poll on Wednesday, the candidates are stuck neck-and-neck largely because of \"the four issues that concern Wisconsin voters: the economy, immigration, energy policy, and abortion.\"\"On the first two, a majority of voters believe that Trump is the stronger candidate; on the last two, a slight majority side with Harris on energy issues, while those who support Harris are also strongly pro-abortion,\" Widburg added.Polling released last week told a similar story in Wisconsin. In a survey from Emerson College and The Hill between September 15 and 18, Trump was up by just 1 percentage point (49 percent to 48 percent), according to the responses of 1,000 likely voters. In another survey from MaristPoll conducted that same week, Harris was up by 1 point (50 percent to 49 percent), according to a sample size of 1,194 voters.Averages compiled by RealClearPolling (RCP) show that Harris holds just a 0.7 percentage point lead in Wisconsin. The state's contest has remained incredibly close since Harris launched her campaign. According to RCP's records, the largest gap between the candidates was late last month, when Harris was leading Trump on average by 1.9 percentage points (49 percent to 47.1 percent) as of August 29.The New York Times polling tracker gives Harris a bit more of a gap with less than six weeks until Election Day, finding that the vice president is ahead by 2 percentage points on average in Wisconsin as of Thursday.Two major election forecasts also give Harris a higher chance of winning Wisconsin. Pollster Nate Silver predicts that the vice president has a 61 percent of securing the Badger State and its 10 electoral votes, while Trump was given a 39 percent chance as of Thursday. FiveThirtyEight's model gave Harris almost identical odds (62 percent chance to Trump's 38 percent chance).Newsweek reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns for comment on Thursday.","summary":"Recent polling has found Trump and Harris caught neck-and-neck in the battle for the Badger State.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-chances-beating-kamala-harris-wisconsin-poll-1960157","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2481861/trumps-chances-beating-harris-wisconsin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:55:09","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.602},{"id":257568474,"title":"USPS chief gets bipartisan blast as he tells swing-state voters to mail in ballots early","text":"LAS VEGAS — Voters in swing states such as Wisconsin and Georgia can trust their mail ballots will arrive at election offices on time, America’s top postal official insisted Thursday — but pols on both sides of the aisle weren’t buying it as they blasted him for service declines across the country. Testifying before the House Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, US Postal Service CEO and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said his 650,000-person workforce is on guard to make sure ballots move and folks can “absolutely” trust nothing will hinder their votes’ delivery. The House panel met to weigh the agency’s role in the 2024 elections, which has drawn substantial scrutiny from state election officials. Mail-in voting jumped 25% between 2016 and 2020, subcommittee Chair David Joyce (R-Ohio) said, and this year “we expect that voting by mail will be popular again.” DeJoy breezily brushed off concerns: “We’ve delivered in the heightened part of a pandemic, in the most sensationalized political time of elections.” The Brooklyn-born postal chief — who took the job in 2020, three months before that year’s balloting — said USPS is “fully ready to successfully deliver the nation’s mail-in ballots for voters who choose to use us to vote.” Despite those blandishments, House members pummeled DeJoy over his Delivering for America plan that shifts and consolidates mail processing from smaller outposts to urban centers to cut costs as first-class-mail volume has declined around 500% since 2000. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said the agency’s Badger State reorganization “broke” mail delivery there. “You blew the rocket ship up,” Pocan said, referring to a shift to Milwaukee for all Wisconsin mail processing. “I truly understand you’re focused on the cost savings. I just want you to be as focused on the delivery of the mail.” Joyce chided DeJoy over a 51% drop in on-time first-class-mail performance in Atlanta under the consolidation plan’s changes, which he said “erode the public confidence” in the agency. “It is imperative that the Postal Service get this right,” he said. Getting it right will be especially important in swing-state Nevada. Following the 2020 pandemic, the Silver State authorized postal-only balloting for general elections, which magnified the effect of mail-processing issues. The state sends every registered voter a mail-in ballot, but the practice has yet to catch on fully. In 2022, 51% of the slightly more than 1 million ballots cast were returned by mail; 27.7% were cast early in person, and 21% were cast in person on Election Day. Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar’s office did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.Over the summer, DeJoy halted a plan to process outgoing mail from Reno and other northern Nevada cities in Sacramento, Calif., roughly 132 miles away. Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), who represents the area, and Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) successfully lobbied USPS to keep outbound mail processing in Reno.The National Vote at Home Institute, a nonpartisan group that boosts the use of mailed-out paper ballots, rates Nevada one of the top postal-voting states. The agency gives priority handling to outgoing ballots sent to voters and will separate returned ballots for priority processing, but he urged voters to send in those ballots seven days before they’re due. DeJoy said using an Intelligent Mail barcode that would track each return piece step-by-step through the system would help. But neither USPS nor the main associations of state election officials could say how many of the nation’s 8,000 local election jurisdictions will implement the coding this year. Tammy Patrick, CEO of programs at the National Association of Election Administrators’ Election Center, told The Post California and Virginia, the latter something of a swing state, each mandate the special barcode’s use on postal ballots. Keep US Posted, a nonprofit group promoting postal reform, told The Post just-introduced legislation to rein in periodic postage hikes and hold the agency accountable by reducing its rate authority if it doesn’t meet performance goals would guarantee “effective and affordable mail service for the American public,” easing concerns about postal voting. Lawmakers and watchdogs aren’t the only ones criticizing the agency. The United States Postal Service has admitted that it is a poorly run mess that is experiencing mail loss and delays at a level never seen before,” former President Donald Trump said recently on Truth Social. So “how can we possibly be expected to allow or trust the U.S. Postal Service to run the 2024 Presidential Election? It is not possible for them to do so. HELP!”","summary":"LAS VEGAS — Voters in swing states such as Wisconsin and Georgia can trust their mail ballots will arrive at election offices on time, America&#8217;s top postal official insisted Thursday — but pols on both sides of the aisle weren&#8217;t buying it as they blasted him for service declines across the country.

So when the mayor of America's biggest metropolis was charged with taking illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals this week, the political shock waves were felt far beyond Manhattan. Democrat Eric Adams has been accused of five federal offences, including bribery and wire fraud. Prosecutors allege he abused his position by soliciting the campaign donations, and by accepting bribes from Turkish nationals in the form of luxury travel and accommodation. In exchange, he's accused of pressuring the city's fire department to allow the opening of a new Turkish consular building, without the need to pass a safety inspection. The mayor insists he's innocent of the charges and won't be stepping down from his position. He's also hit out at federal prosecutors, appearing to take a leaf out of former US president Donald Trump's playbook by suggesting he's being targeted for political reasons — in his case, for criticising the Biden administration over its immigration policies. \"I always knew that if I stood my ground for all of you, that I would be a target, and a target I became,\" he said in a video message. \"Despite our pleas, when the federal government did nothing as its broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief, I put the people of New York before party and politics.\" Adams fell out with President Joe Biden, a fellow Democrat, amid accusations the federal government had not provided New York with enough support to deal with an increase in the number of asylum seekers arriving in the city. The White House would not comment on the mayor's indictment, other than to insist the Department of Justice (DOJ) was not influenced by political factors. \"The president was clear, even when he was running in 2020, that he was going to make sure that DOJ is independent,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. \"DOJ is handling this case independently. I'm not going to go beyond that.\" New York is considered reliably safe for Democrats in the presidential race, meaning the mayor's legal woes are not expected to affect Vice-President Kamala Harris's chances of winning there. But the state could play an important role in deciding which party takes control of the House of Representatives after the election, and the ability of the new president to implement their legislative agenda. Several Democratic candidates vying for House seats are already calling on Adams to resign. But the state's Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, who has the power to sack him, has indicated she's still weighing her options. Trump, meanwhile, used the saga to try to further his own argument that he'd also been the target of political prosecutions. \"I wish him luck,\" he said of the mayor. Trouble for Trump in North Carolina? Trump is facing a more difficult political situation in North Carolina, where the Republican candidate for governor has become mired in scandal. Mark Robinson currently serves as lieutenant governor — the state's second highest elected official — and was endorsed by the former president in his bid for the top job. Trump had previously been full of praise for the 56-year-old, describing him as \"unbelievable\" and \"one of the great stars of the party\". But Robinson's campaign has been in crisis mode since CNN reported allegations that he'd made offensive and inflammatory comments on a pornography website's message board a decade prior, including one in which he allegedly referred to himself as a \"black Nazi\". Robinson has denied the claims, and the ABC has not independently verified them. Kamala Harris's team seized on the news though, releasing a new ad highlighting the former president's previous support for the lieutenant governor. And when Trump held a rally in North Carolina in the aftermath of the story being published, Robinson did not make an appearance or get a mention. Democrats haven't won the state in a presidential election since Barack Obama flipped it in 2008. But Trump claimed victory in North Carolina with only a very slim margin in 2020, and Kamala Harris's team is hopeful the vice-president could pick it up. The governor's race does not technically affect the presidential contest. Voters in North Carolina are free to choose candidates from different parties for each of the positions being decided. The risk for Trump is that Harris's effort to link him to yet more controversy succeeds in swaying people against him in what's expected to be a very tight race. In case you missed it: The little blue dot at the centre of a big fight Less than six weeks out from election day, the two major party candidates are focusing most of their time and money on the seven 'swing states' considered up for grabs by either side. The aforementioned North Carolina is one of them, along with Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. But a voting peculiarity has made the Midwestern state of Nebraska also one to watch. Most states have a 'winner takes all' approach under the electoral college system that decides the presidency. If a candidate receives the majority of ballots cast in Pennsylvania, for example, they pick up all of the state's 19 electoral college votes. Nebraska's process for allocating its five electoral college votes is more complicated. The candidate with the most support overall gets two votes, while the remaining three are awarded based on the results in each of its congressional districts. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes in 2020, but lost the district which takes in the more liberal-leaning city of Omaha to Biden. Depending on how all of the swing states end up falling, there's a scenario in which the so-called \"blue dot\" could get Harris to the magic number of 270 votes needed to enter the White House. Republicans have recently tried to change the voting rules in Nebraska to a winner takes all model, without success. It means the small blue dot in the middle of the country could be front and centre come November 5. Loading","summary":"Election day on November 5 is shaping up to be an extremely tight race.

According to a report by Politico, the federal charges stem from an Iranian operation that allegedly stole campaign communications. The defendants' names and specific criminal charges were not immediately available. Without citing sources, Politico said a grand jury had secretly approved the indictment on Thursday afternoon, local time. The Department of Justice is expected to announce the charges as soon as Friday. The department declined to comment. Trump's campaign said in August that some of its internal communications had been hacked. At the time, it blamed the Iranian government — a claim confirmed by the US intelligence community later that month. Trump, who is running for a second term in the White House, said on Wednesday that Iran may have been behind the recent assassination attempts against him. He suggested if he were president and another country threatened a US presidential candidate, it risked being \"blown to smithereens\". Iran responded by claiming accusations it had targeted former US officials were baseless. The former president made his remarks after intelligence officials briefed him a day earlier on \"real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him,\" his campaign said. \"Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, and law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference,\" the statement read. It comes as federal authorities continue to probe assassination attempts targeting Trump at one of his Florida golf courses in mid-September and at a Pennsylvania rally in July. There has been no public suggestion by law enforcement agencies of involvement by Iran or any other foreign power in either incident. Also on Thursday, Trump raised the idea of making a deal with Iran aimed at ending hostilities if he is elected president on November 5. \"I would do that,\" Trump said, but offered no details on the sort of detail he was discussing.

United Atlantic Ventures, managed by Trump Media co-founder Andrew Litinsky, who had appeared on Trump’s hit reality TV show “The Apprentice,” cut its 5.5% stake in Trump Media & Technology from over 7.5 million shares to just 100 shares, according to a filing late on Thursday. United Atlantic had been one of the company’s top three shareholders. Republican presidential candidate Trump owns about 57% of Trump Media. Shares of Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, have been volatile over the past five trading sessions following the end of insider trading restrictions related to the company’s March stock market debut. Shares of the company dipped about 1% on Thursday, ahead of the filing, leaving it with a stock market value of $2.8 billion. Trump Media’s value ballooned to nearly $10 billion following its Wall Street debut, lifted by retail traders who saw it as a speculative bet on Trump’s chances of securing a second four-year term as president. Since then, Trump Media shares have steadily lost ground, with share declines accelerating after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21. Trump, whose stake in Trump Media is worth roughly $1.6 billion, said on Sept. 13 that he did not plan to sell his shares, turning the focus to other major stakeholders who could cash out. A representative for Litinsky did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the stock reduction.

The stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, will extend government funding until December 20, The Guardian reported. It will also provide an additional $231m for the Secret Service \"for operations necessary to carry out protective operations, including the 2024 presidential campaign and national special security events,\" following the two recent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump. Biden's signing of the bill came one day after the House and Senate passed the legislation with sweeping bipartisan majorities in both chambers. \"The passage of this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by the end of this year,\" Biden said on Wednesday. \"My administration will work with Congress to ensure these bills deliver for America's national defence, veterans, seniors, children and working families, and address urgent needs for the American people, including communities recovering from disasters.\" The Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, had initially tried to pass a more right-wing proposal that combined a six-month stopgap funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. That effort failed last week, when 14 Republicans and all but two Democrats opposed Johnson's bill. The failure forced Johnson to take up a three-month spending bill that was narrow enough to win Democrats' support. The House passed that bill on Wednesday in a vote of 341 to 82, with all of the opposition to the legislation stemming from Republicans. \"Our legislative work before November has now been officially done, and today the House did the necessary thing,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. \"We took the initiative and passed a clean, narrow, three-month CR to prevent the Senate from jamming us with another bloated bill while continuing resolutions.\" Johnson nodded at the widespread opposition to the bill within his conference, as 82 Republicans voted against it amid complaints of wasteful government spending, The Guardian reported. \"While a continuing resolution is never ideal -- none of us like them; that's not a way to run a railroad -- it allows Congress to continue serving the American people through the election,\" Johnson said. Once the House passed the continuing resolution on Wednesday noon, the Senate moved immediately to take up the bill. The Upper Chamber passed the bill just two hours after the House did in a bipartisan vote of 78 to 18. The Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, thanked Johnson for his work to avoid a shutdown, but he lamented that it took Congress until the last minute to pass a funding package when it seemed evident for weeks that a narrow stopgap would be necessary. \"Tonight the American people can sleep easier knowing we have avoided an unnecessary government shutdown at the end of the month,\" Schumer said before the vote. \"It is a relief for the country that, once again, bipartisanship prevailed to stop another shutdown threat. It took much longer than it should have, but because House Republicans finally, finally chose to work with us in the end, Congress is getting the job done tonight.\" Schumer had previously blamed Donald Trump for the delay, as the former President had implored Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill unless it was tied to \"election security\" measures. The newly signed bill did not meet that demand, but Johnson insisted that Trump backed Republicans' efforts to keep the government funded. \"Former President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we're in,\" Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \"So we'll continue working closely together. I'm not defying President Trump. We're getting our job done, and I think he understands that.\" Both Chambers of Congress now stand adjourned for six weeks, meaning members will not return to Capitol Hill until after election day. Johnson's decision to rely on Democratic support to pass the funding package has raised questions about his future as Speaker, but he voiced confidence on Wednesday about his leadership and his party's prospects for expanding its narrow House majority. \"I would be a fool to project a certain number of seats, but let me just say I'm very optimistic,\" Johnson told reporters. \"I believe we're going to hold the House. And I intend to be the Speaker in the new Congress.\" (Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)","summary":"US President Joe Biden has signed a three-month government funding bill, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the November elections, media reported.","url":"https://nation.lk/online/biden-signs-government-funding-bill-to-avert-shutdown-before-election-278520.html","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/dogb6v8k_joe-biden_625x300_25_September_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:30:17","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"lk","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":257567466,"title":"Editorial: By Opting Out, Trump Has Left Himself Vulnerable","text":"It was a disastrous debate performance that forced President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, clearing the path for Vice-President Kamala Harris. His endorsement wasn’t enough for her to secure the Democratic nomination alone, but to her credit, she managed to get her candidacy formally approved by the party. This showed that the party was solidly behind her, marking her rise as a political leader in her own right. She could have been tied to the Biden administration’s failures and held equally responsible, just like her boss. This would have made Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump’s job easier, but politics rarely follows predictable lines. Small wonder that politics is often called the art of the possible. Trump wasn’t eager to debate Harris, knowing his loquaciousness wouldn’t substitute for sound arguments. He also feared her legal background would allow her to question him with clinical precision. When the first debate finally happened, Trump found himself in trouble as Harris gained the upper hand throughout, preventing him from effectively highlighting her party’s and government’s shortcomings. Few believed Trump would face her again after the thrashing he received. His decision to forgo further debates surprised no one. However, the nationally televised debates—watched by tens of millions worldwide—have long been a hallmark of presidential contests, giving voters and observers a chance to assess the contenders. By opting out, Trump has left himself vulnerable to mockery on social media. That said, presidential debates, however glamorous and hallowed they might have been, have never been the clincher. Trump still retains support from his party and those who believe the Democratic president squandered an opportunity to restore America to its former glory.

Swifties got the endorsement they wanted from the massively influential pop star, but Chappell Roan has repeatedly refused to cater to her fanbase, shining a spotlight on the intense expectations and demands of fame. Chappell Roan’s Endorsement Controversy, Explained Fans took offense after Roan told The Guardian that she would not be endorsing a political candidate, stating: “I have so many issues with our government in every way. There are so many things that I would want to change. So I don’t feel pressured to endorse someone. There’s problems on both sides. I encourage people to use your critical thinking skills, use your vote – vote small, vote for what’s going on in your city.” In the same interview, Roan made it clear that she supports the LGBTQ community, highlighting “trans rights” as the biggest change she wanted to see in the US this election year. “They cannot have cis people making decisions for trans people, period,” she said. Roan’s reasoning was fairly articulate, but the “both sides” quote went viral after being plucked out of the interview and posted across multiple pop culture accounts, devoid of context. The quote sparked fierce backlash from fans and LGBTQ activists terrified of living under another Trump presidency, with many labeling Roan as a “privileged” centrist, insulated by her newfound wealth and fame. Roan took to TikTok to explain her reasoning and repeated her full quote, to ensure the context wasn’t lost in the noise. Roan asked fans to use their \"critical thinking skills\" and stated her intent to be \"part of a generation that changes things for good.\" She concluded her video by clarifying that she would not be voting for Donald Trump, and simply wanted to question those in power. The video, however, seemed to intensify the backlash. Hence, Roan followed up with a second TikTok, seemingly frustrated that her point was being missed. In the video, Roan emphasized that she was not happy with many of the Democratic policies on the left concerning trans rights, Palestine and “every marginalized community in the world.” “There is no way I can stand behind some of the left’s completely transphobic and completely genocidal views,” she said. Roan went on to clarify, “This is not me playing both sides. This is me questioning both sides because this is what we have in front of us.” Roan concluded by telling her fans to vote for “who in your mind is the best option” and pleaded with her viewers not to “settle for what we have.” The backlash didn’t stop, but Roan’s clarification sparked a fierce debate about progressive values and the political weaponization of queer identity. Some commentators pointed out that Roan’s reasoning had been perfectly clear, and proposed that the best course of action would be to move on. Heated discourse over a political endorsement from a pop star highlights the shifting relations between fans and celebrities, with modern fandoms demanding not just relatability, but political action from their favorite stars. Chappell Roan Previously Pushed Back Against Fan’s Expectations Roan is no stranger to the concept of fans crossing boundaries; indeed, the singer has been refreshingly candid about the bitter realities of fame, opening up about the negative effect on her mental health and pushing back against the entitlement of obsessive fans. While many celebrities seek to kindle parasocial relationships with their fans and strengthen the illusion of intimacy, Roan has bluntly told her fanbase that she is a complete stranger to them; fans only know the persona, not the person. In a pair of TikToks that went viral in August, Roan told her most obsessive fans: “I don’t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous. I don’t care that it’s normal; I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, this career field that I’ve chosen. That does not make it okay. That does not make it normal.” Roan followed up by reminding her fans that they do not know her, even if they think they do. “It’s weird how people think that you know a person just ’cause you see them online or you listen to the art they make,” she said. “That’s f**king weird. I’m allowed to say no to creepy behavior, okay?” MORE FROM FORBES ForbesThe Blake Lively Backlash On TikTok, ExplainedBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesGuillermo Del Toro Strikes Back Against AI-Generated ArtBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesSydney Sweeney’s Reaction To AI-Generated Portrait Goes ViralBy Dani Di PlacidoForbesDisney’s ‘Inside Out 2’ Controversy, ExplainedBy Dani Di Placido Follow me on Twitter.

Korea to raise defense spending to 3 or 3.5% of GDP","text":"A former US national security advisor stressed the need Thursday for South Korea to increase its defense spending to 3 percent or 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), as Seoul and Washington are in negotiations over a defense cost-sharing deal. Robert O'Brien, who served as national security advisor for former President Donald Trump from 2019-2021, made the remarks, as South Korea and the United States are holding their eighth round of negotiations in Seoul this week to determine Seoul's share of the cost for the stationing of US Forces Korea. \"We need our allies to pitch in. The South Koreans are up to 2.5 percent of GDP in defense,\" O'Brien said during a forum on China's threat to American security hosted by the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute. \"Those numbers need to go to 3 percent or 3 and a half percent, like the United States, so (that) we can burden-share with our allies,\" he added. He praised Japan for increasing their defense spending \"dramatically\" during the administrations of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his predecessors, Yoshihide Suga and Shinzo Abe. \"I am sure the next (Japanese) prime minister will do the same,\" he said. His remarks came amid lingering concerns that should Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, return to the Oval Office, he could put pressure on South Korea and other allies to jack up their defense spending. Touching on China's growing nuclear arsenal and threats from North Korea and Iran, O'Brien said that the US needs to figure out how to \"increase\" its nuclear capability. \"Keep in mind (that) North Korea and Iran are spinning far more centrifuges than America has. I mean, to some extent, the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs are ahead of where we are,\" he said. \"Certainly, the Russians and Chinese are as well. So, we've got to get back in the nuclear game.\" Regarding Chinese threats, he said that China is \"racing towards nuclear parity with America.\" \"I think their goal is to have 1,500 strategic weapons pointed at us,\" he said. O'Brien also noted the importance of US-led groupings to address various challenges from China, including the AUKUS security partnership between the US, Britain and Australia and the Quad forum involving the US, India, Japan and Australia, as well as trilateral cooperation between South Korea, the US and Japan. \"Those alliances scare the Chinese because they see us operating together,\" he said. \"We can contain and we can push back against the Chinese when they drive wedges between us.\" He also gave a positive view of the Camp David summit -- the first standalone trilateral summit between South Korea, the US and Japan in August last year. \"I give the Biden administration credit for the Camp David meeting with President Yoon (Suk Yeol) and Prime Minister Kishida and President Biden,\" he said. But he claimed that the \"groundwork\" for that meeting was laid under the Trump administration, which he said helped keep Seoul and Tokyo together at a time of historical tensions between the two Asian allies.

Because I’m not sure I just want to do a brute,” Gleeson said. “He wanted something more. We tried to find layers in this guy.” CREATING MAYHEM Anyone who has worked with Phoenix knows that he likes to keep things fresh. That may mean something as small as changing the location of a prop or as big as throwing out choreography that you’ve been rehearsing for months at the last minute. “I think we both love mayhem and not just in movies but on the set,” Phillips said. “It had to feel like anything can happen.” With the crew 95 per cent the same as the first, everyone was ready to be flexible. Gaga, too, dove right in, suggesting that they sing live on camera. “It changed the whole making of the film,” Phillips said. “We were not only singing live, we were singing live differently every take.” THAT’S ENTERTAINMENT? Since Arthur killed Robert De Niro’s talk show host Murray Franklin on live television in the first film, he’s become a kind of icon and curiosity thanks in no small part to an oft referenced, but never seen, television movie that was made about him. Now, the trial is going to be televised as well. “Underneath it all, there’s this idea of corruption and how everything is corrupt in the system, from the prison system to the judicial system to the idea of entertainment, quite frankly,” Phillips said. “This idea that in the States at least, everything is entertainment. A court trial could be entertainment, and a presidential election can be entertainment. So, if that’s true, what is entertainment?” NO LONGER A COMPLETE WILD CARD It’s easier to be to the insurgent, not the incumbent, Phillips said. Although a Joker film is never going to fly completely under the radar, the spotlight is undoubtedly more intense this time around. “You do feel like you have a larger target on your back,” Phillips said. While much of the film was made on Warner Bros soundstages in Los Angeles, the production did go back to New York to film again on the Bronx staircase (which now come up on Google Maps as the Joker Stairs) and outside a Manhattan courthouse. The production staged a massive protest scene, with Gaga, almost concurrently with the media frenzy around the Donald Trump hush money trial as if there weren’t enough eyes on them already. Some are also handwringing about the sequel’s bigger budget and whether it can match the success of the first. But Phillips has learned to take it in stride. “There’s a different amount of pressure, but that just comes with making movies,” he said. “You can’t please everybody and you just kind of go for it.” Gleeson has an even sunnier outlook. “It has kind of arthouse movie integrity on a blockbuster scale. It’s great news for cinema, is the way I look on it,” Gleeson said. “If these event movies can continue to have depth and can be so conflicting like this one, is we needn’t worry about the future of cinema.” SO, IS IT A MUSICAL? One thing Phillips didn’t mean to do was ignite a discourse about what is and isn’t a musical. He’s just trying to manage expectations. “People go, ‘what do you mean it’s not a musical?’ And it is a musical. It has all the elements of a musical. But I guess what I mean by it is all the musicals I’ve seen leave me happy at the end for the most part, Umbrellas Of Cherbourg not being one of them. This has so much sadness in it that I just didn’t want to be misleading to people.”","summary":"But is Joker: Folie à Deux a musical? According to director Todd Phillips, \"it has all the elements of a musical\" but also \"has so much sadness in it that I just didn’t want to be misleading to people”.","url":"https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/joker-folie-deux-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-409296","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--rkhmFVUk--/c_crop,h_562,w_1000,x_0,y_83/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/film-joker_31561.jpg?itok=RFI3P5rB","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:19:32","author":"Cna Lifestyle","authors":["Cna Lifestyle"],"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.119},{"id":257567158,"title":"Biden, Zelensky discuss diplomatic, economic, military aspects of Kiev’s ‘plan’","text":"WASHINGTON, September 27. /TASS/. During talks with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, US leader Joe Biden discussed diplomatic, economic and military aspects of the Kiev government’s proposed peace plan, the White House press service said in a statement. \"President Biden outlined his decision to surge U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, and President Zelensky presented his plan to achieve victory over Russia. The two leaders discussed the diplomatic, economic, and military aspects of President Zelensky’s plan and tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps,\" the document says. \"On October 12, 2024, President Biden will host a leader-level meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Germany, where the two leaders will review progress on these consultations and coordinate with international partners on additional assistance for Ukraine. President Biden is determined to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win,\" it says. Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said he had prepared a conflict resolution plan that he intends to discuss with US President Joe Biden as some provisions depended on Washington’s decisions. He also plans to present it to the US presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Later, Sergey Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said the plan is based on the assumption that the Western countries will approve strikes deep into Russian territory. As Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out, Ukraine is unable to strike deep into Russian territory without Western assistance, as it needs intelligence from satellites and flight tasks to do so. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader also named the ‘victory plan,’ based on his ‘peace formula’ as a possible way of resolving the crisis. Moscow has repeatedly criticized it for being unrealistic, saying that the situation on the ground must be taken into account. Besides, Moscow voiced its support for the peace plan, proposed by China and Brazil, which Ukraine rejected as ‘unrealistic.’ Russian President Vladimir Putin set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine at a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials on June 14. His terms included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossia and abandoning plans to join NATO. In addition, Moscow believes that all Western sanctions must be lifted and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed. Putin noted that if Ukraine and the West turned down the initiative, the conditions might change in the future. Kiev rejected Russia’s peace plan.","summary":"The two leaders \"tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps,\" the White House press service said in a statement","url":"https://tass.com/world/1848475","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:19:00","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.012},{"id":257566956,"title":"Ex-'Apprentice' candidates dump nearly entire stake in owner of Trump's Truth Social platform","text":"A Florida firm owned by former contestants on “The Apprentice” has disposed of nearly all its 5.5% stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns former president Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.

Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov 5 presidential election, made the announcement on Thursday, just hours after Democratic President Joe Biden announced more than $8 billion in new military aid for the U.S. ally. Zelenskyy has long sought a meeting with Trump. The two men spoke by phone in July but have not met in person since Trump's term as president ended in 2021. During a press conference on Thursday, Trump repeated his claims that he could rapidly negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine if he defeats Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate in the race for the White House. \"President Zelenskyy has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45 in Trump Tower\" in New York, Trump said. Asked by a reporter if Ukraine might have to give up any of its territory to reach a peace deal with Moscow - a non-starter for Kyiv - Trump did not rule it out. \"We'll see what happens,\" he said. Shortly before Trump's comments, Harris pledged support for Ukraine and - in a veiled reference to Trump - said those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace with Russia were supporting \"proposals of surrender.\" Harris was speaking alongside Zelenskyy at the White House, a day after Trump assailed him for not making a deal with Russia that Trump said could have ended the war and shortly after the White House announcement of the new aid package. It was Harris' seventh meeting with Zelenskyy and the third this year. Earlier in the week, Trump looked poised to reject Zelenskyy's meeting request. The Ukrainian leader had said before departing for New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly that he hoped to present his \"victory plan\" to win the war with Russia to Harris, Trump and Biden. But he upset Trump's campaign after visiting a munitions factory over the weekend in the battleground state of Pennsylvania with that state's governor, Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and a Harris ally. Trump has stood by his criticisms of Zelenskyy on the campaign trail. He said on Monday that Zelenskyy wanted Harris to win the election, and on Wednesday he called the Eastern European nation \"dead\" and \"demolished.\" The U.S aid announced by Biden includes the first shipment of a precision-guided glide bomb called the Joint Standoff Weapon, with a range of up to 81 miles (130 km). The medium-range missile gives Ukraine a major upgrade to the weapons it is using to strike Russian forces, allowing the Ukrainians to do it at safer distances. The bulk of the new aid, $5.5 billion, is to be allocated before Monday's end of the U.S. fiscal year, when the funding authority is set to expire. Another $2.4 billion is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the administration to buy weapons for Ukraine from companies rather than pull them from U.S. stocks. Biden also said he would order the Pentagon to expand training of Ukrainian F-16 pilots, including by supporting the training of an additional 18 pilots next year. Zelenskyy thanked Biden and the U.S. Congress for the new military aid package, saying Ukraine would use it \"in the most efficient and transparent manner\". \"I am grateful to the United States for providing the items that are most critical to protecting our people,\" Zelenskyy said on X, mentioning a Patriot battery, drones and long-range missiles. © Thomson Reuters 2024.","summary":"Donald Trump said he would meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, having criticized him on the U.S. campaign trail and expressed doubts about Ukraine's ability to win…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/trump-to-meet-ukraine%27s-zelenskiy-after-harris-pledges-support","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/df/69/870e189317254563e2788e560b581dd257b8/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:10:39","author":"Gram Slattery,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Gram Slattery","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":257567318,"title":"Journalist banned from X after publishing ‘hacked’ J.D. Vance dossier","text":"Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has been suspended from the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) after publishing a dossier compiled by former President Donald Trump’s campaign during its vetting of his running mate, J.D. Vance. Klippenstein, who self-publishes on Substack after leaving The Intercept earlier this year, posted the document and shared a link with his X followers on Thursday, citing the public interest during an election season. The 271-page document was compiled in February and includes a section on “potential vulnerabilities,” which notes Vance’s past criticism of Trump. The dossier also included Vance’s home address and partial Social Security number. Other media outlets that received the document declined to publish it, citing concerns about its provenance and newsworthiness. “Ken Klippenstein was temporarily suspended for violating our rules on posting unredacted private personal information, specifically Sen. Vance’s physical addresses and the majority of his Social Security number,” an X spokesperson said in a statement. Klippenstein defended his decision to publish the document, stating that he stood by it on principle. He argued that he linked to a document containing information already available to the public. “This chilling effect on speech is exactly why we published the Vance Dossier in its entirety,” Klippenstein said in a message to “self-styled free speech warrior Elon Musk.“ He argued that legacy news media have been too cautious in publishing sensitive information, fearing backlash or being labeled as spreading “foreign malign influence.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk has defended the ban, calling the publication “one of the most egregious, evil doxxing actions we’ve ever seen.” “Presidential candidates are not speculatively in danger – there have already been two attempts on [Donald Trump’s] life,” he wrote, arguing that “the doxxing included detailed information on the addresses of their children.” In August, Trump’s election campaign team claimed that their internal emails and documents had been stolen by “foreign sources” allegedly attempting to “sow chaos” and influence the upcoming American presidential vote. At the time, Politico reported that it had begun receiving emails from an anonymous individual known only as ‘Robert,’ who provided documents from the Trump campaign, including dossiers on Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also being considered for the vice presidential nomination. ‘Robert’ reportedly contacted multiple media outlets, claiming to possess a “variety” of Trump’s “legal and court documents” as well as “internal campaign discussions.” Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung stated that the documents had been “obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States” and that these sources intended to “interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.”","summary":"Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has been suspended from X after publishing a dossier compiled by the Trump campaign \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604751-journalist-suspended-vance-dossier/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66f5f5ed2030272c386063fa.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-27 00:06:34","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.119},{"id":257566810,"title":"Biden Signs Government Funding Bill To Avert Shutdown Before Election","text":"US President Joe Biden has signed a three-month government funding bill, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the November elections, media reported.The stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, will extend government funding until December 20, The Guardian reported.It will also provide an additional $231m for the Secret Service \"for operations necessary to carry out protective operations, including the 2024 presidential campaign and national special security events,\" following the two recent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump.Biden's signing of the bill came one day after the House and Senate passed the legislation with sweeping bipartisan majorities in both chambers.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");\"The passage of this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by the end of this year,\" Biden said on Wednesday.\"My administration will work with Congress to ensure these bills deliver for America's national defence, veterans, seniors, children and working families, and address urgent needs for the American people, including communities recovering from disasters.\"The Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, had initially tried to pass a more right-wing proposal that combined a six-month stopgap funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote.That effort failed last week, when 14 Republicans and all but two Democrats opposed Johnson's bill. The failure forced Johnson to take up a three-month spending bill that was narrow enough to win Democrats' support. The House passed that bill on Wednesday in a vote of 341 to 82, with all of the opposition to the legislation stemming from Republicans.\"Our legislative work before November has now been officially done, and today the House did the necessary thing,\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.\"We took the initiative and passed a clean, narrow, three-month CR to prevent the Senate from jamming us with another bloated bill while continuing resolutions.\"Johnson nodded at the widespread opposition to the bill within his conference, as 82 Republicans voted against it amid complaints of wasteful government spending, The Guardian reported.\"While a continuing resolution is never ideal -- none of us like them; that's not a way to run a railroad -- it allows Congress to continue serving the American people through the election,\" Johnson said.Once the House passed the continuing resolution on Wednesday noon, the Senate moved immediately to take up the bill. The Upper Chamber passed the bill just two hours after the House did in a bipartisan vote of 78 to 18.The Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, thanked Johnson for his work to avoid a shutdown, but he lamented that it took Congress until the last minute to pass a funding package when it seemed evident for weeks that a narrow stopgap would be necessary.\"Tonight the American people can sleep easier knowing we have avoided an unnecessary government shutdown at the end of the month,\" Schumer said before the vote.\"It is a relief for the country that, once again, bipartisanship prevailed to stop another shutdown threat. It took much longer than it should have, but because House Republicans finally, finally chose to work with us in the end, Congress is getting the job done tonight.\"Schumer had previously blamed Donald Trump for the delay, as the former President had implored Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill unless it was tied to \"election security\" measures. The newly signed bill did not meet that demand, but Johnson insisted that Trump backed Republicans' efforts to keep the government funded.\"Former President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we're in,\" Johnson told reporters on Tuesday.\"So we'll continue working closely together. I'm not defying President Trump.

The meeting will be held at Trump Tower. (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images Key Facts The meeting will take place around 9:45 a.m. EDT, according to Trump, who told reporters he will be able to strike a deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky “quite quickly” to end the war in Ukraine, though he refused to provide details on what the compromise would look like. Trump and Zelensky’s relationship appears rocky ahead of the meeting, as the two have traded barbs recently that included a criticism from Zelensky, who recently told The New Yorker, “Trump doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows.” A reporter asked Trump about Zelensky’s comment, to which the former president joked that he should “immediately cancel” the upcoming meeting before insisting Zelensky knows he understands how to end the war. The meeting will be hosted just a few days after Trump expressed doubt about Ukraine’s chances of winning the war and called Zelensky “the greatest salesman on Earth,” referring to the tens of billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has provided Ukraine since 2022. Trump said the war between Ukraine and Russia “never would have happened” if he were president, repeating a claim he has made several times when asked about the subject.

Tangent Zelensky received the ire of Republicans who recently criticized him for visiting a Scranton, Pennsylvania, artillery manufacturing plant and claimed his visit was “a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats.” Key Background Trump and Zelensky's bumpy relationship may partially be rooted in the former president’s comments about ending the Ukraine-Russia war, as opposed to pledging his support for a Ukrainian victory, though Trump’s relationship with the Ukrainian president dates back years, with a controversial 2019 phone call between the two, in which Trump urged Zelensky to investigate then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden, serving as a focal point for a Democratic impeachment inquiry into Trump. The former president was later impeached by the House, before being acquitted in a Senate trial. Trump has not provided details about his plan to end the war, which has carried on for more than two years. Zelensky met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday following Biden’s pledge to provide an additional $8 billion in aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

But our organization, the Media Research Center, and others have shown that Google is the most effective weapon in the left’s arsenal — the one that gets its candidates across the finish line. In the last presidential election, Google swayed anywhere from six to eight million votes in favor of Joe Biden. MRC’s studies over a 12-month period consistently showed that Google completely buried Republican campaign websites in favor of their Democrat opponents. During the presidential primary contests, MRC conducted studies searching for the campaign websites for both Democrats and Republicans. Not surprisingly, when MRC searched for “democrat presidential campaign websites,” Biden’s campaign site was always the first or second search result. But the results were very different when searching for the Republican campaign websites. Shockingly, Google only produced a total of two sites: one for Democrat Marianne Williamson and another for Will Hurd, a little-known Congressman who never polled above 1%. Google would not produce the campaign websites for Donald Trump, Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy or the other eleven candidates. Because the world now knows Google’s methods and motivations, the search titan has changed its tactics. In our latest study, we show that Google is finally revealing Trump’s website, albeit, still lower than Harris’. But a user is now required to wade through a flood of news articles, almost all hostile to Trump, before ever reaching either candidate’s website. For example, Google highlighted a pro-Kamala Harris article in The Economist four search results above Trump’s website. Instead of addressing the policies of the two candidates, The Economist noted Trump’s “dismal record” of scandals and legal battles, while touting Harris’s young age. In another example, The Washington Post’s live update page included articles with headlines like “Trump’s sudden move to re-litigate sexual abuse claims goes off the rails.” Predictably, above the link to Harris’s website were puff pieces touting optimistic predictions of a presidential win that simultaneously hid her actual policy positions. Congressional Republicans and several state Attorneys General understand that Google is weaponized against Republicans and uses its corporate resources to help Democrats. It is not illegal for a corporation to use its resources to influence the outcome of an election. But it is against the law when a corporation does not disclose its efforts with the Federal Election Commission. Google is either illegally coordinating with the Harris campaign, or if its expenditures are independent, it is unlawfully failing to file its disclosure reports. Congress should find out which it is.

The Post reported that Vice President Kamala Harris will be the first presidential candidate in 40 years to not attend the Al Smith dinner (“Who’s running this place? Sure not Joe,” Miranda Devine,” Sept. 23). Devine says it is because Harris lacks competence at impromptu events. And as a practicing Catholic, I find her absence from the dinner and her general attitude toward the Catholic religion to both be completely offensive.Pope Francis recently encouraged Catholics to vote for the lesser of the two evils. Therefore, I will not be voting for Harris. I urge all Catholics to follow my lead. Rich LePetri Naples, Fla. The dinner is just a night of political jokes, as it has always been. Harris will need to learn to face the music — there will be worst confrontations than this if she’s elected. J.R. Cummings Manhattan Harris, who claims that she wants to be a president for all Americans, has chosen to skip this year’s historic Al Smith dinner. Perhaps it’s because her infamous “word salad” is not on the menu? Anne Marie Marsala Garden City Kudos to the Editorial Board for admonishing the Democratic presidential nominee for failing to attend a worthy cause such as the Al Smith dinner (“Why Harris Is Dissing Al Smith,” Sept. 23). Let’s face it — former President Donald Trump might have enjoyed an enviable array of Harris’ brilliant comments to mock. Trump’s potential “Kamala-logue” could cover falling out of a coconut tree, her love of school buses and Venn diagrams, along with her brilliant explanation of the passage of time. In case Harris loses the race, I thought that, while in Manhattan, she might have harnessed her mighty cackle (and truly explore what can be unburdened by what has been) to audition for a role as a late-night host at NBC or CBS. She’s a true comedian, after all. Michael P. Mulhall Moseley, Va. Regarding Piers Morgan’s article, “Oh, Kam on, you coward!” (Sept. 24): Trump is not a plagiarizer, but he should use Morgan’s suggestions for the Al Smith dinner word for word. Did Morgan ever hit the Kamala nail on the head. Maria Cutro Tenafly, NJ The Issue: First Lady Jill Biden running a Cabinet meeting while President Biden left for Delaware. Another day, another slap in the face to the American people from the patronizing Democrats (“Who’s the boss?” Sept. 21) President Biden began a Cabinet meeting, then absquatulated back home to Delaware as First Lady Jill Biden took over. This sounds like a skit from an old Marx Brothers movie — but it actually occurred. This abdication from responsibility is jaw-dropping and horrifying. Even as the curtain has been rolled back to reveal their pernicious ways, Democrats continue with their “citizens be damned” arrogance. Sometimes it seems that holding power is their only goal. Come November, the American voter must take it from them. James McCaffrey Yonkers Wake me up from this nightmare. Who put Jill in charge? I don’t remember her being on the ballot in 2020. The sooner the Biden family is sent back to Delaware, where Joe can be on permanent vacation, the better. If this was the Republican Party, we would never hear the end of it. The Dems’ hubris knows no bounds. And who knows how many other meetings Jill was running? Betsy Flor Putnam Valley Want to weigh in on today’s stories?

The professional, 34, is now starring on Ballando con le Stelle after leaving the UK version of the show amid a misconduct probe. It comes after his former partner actress Amanda Abbington made a series of bullying claims about him behind the scenes of the show last year. But now Italian Strictly's host Milly Carlucci has suggested the BBC's approval of Giovanni's inclusion in Ballando con le Stelle 'should tell us something' about the allegations. According to The Telegraph speaking at a press conference ahead of Saturday's launch show, Ms Carlucci said: 'We were in very close contact with the BBC to understand the extent of these accusations.

It hasn't come out. 'We have been monitoring the matter with the BBC and they have given us a complete green light in having Giovanni with us and that should also tell us something because the BBC seems to me to be a very serious company.' The publication went on to point out that they understand that all casting decisions for Ballando con le Stelle are a matter for the Italian programme, rather than the BBC. The BBC has been contacted for comment. Giovanni reportedly said he would 'rather not talk about' the ongoing probe when at the same press conference. Giovanni will be on the show from this Saturday onwards with his partner, the actress and TV host Bianca Guaccero. Giovanni shared a career update on Instagram on Monday after Strictly returned to the BBC following Amanda's claims he bullied her last year.

The outcome of the BBC's inquiry is understood to have been delayed as lawyers for both parties disagree on the findings. There is said to be internal frustration over how long it has taken, given the investigation was launched in April. Some at the BBC are furious that it had to take place at all, taking the view it has been 'a total waste of time and money'. Another senior BBC employee said of the row: 'There are no winners here.'

The PDF document is a 271-page opposition research file on former President Donald Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio. For more than two months, hackers who the U.S. says are tied to Iran have tried to persuade the American media to cover files they stole. No outlets took the bait. But on Thursday, reporter Ken Klippenstein, who self-publishes on Substack after he left The Intercept this year, published one of the files. “If the document had been hacked by some ‘anonymous’ like hacker group, the news media would be all over it. I’m just not a believer of the news media as an arm of the government, doing its work combating foreign influence. Nor should it be a gatekeeper of what the public should know,” he wrote. Publication of the document reflects how a shifting media ecosystem featuring more high-profile independent journalists on platforms like Substack can influence the ability of state-sponsored hackers to carry out election influence operations. In an interview, Klippenstein said: “It’s been a vibes election. They are so vague on policy. There’s so few specifics, and something like this can give you some sense of what the campaign thinks.” At least three major news outlets and two independent journalists previously received a document described as a JD Vance dossier but did not publish it, citing what they have described as a lack of newsworthy information in it. The dissemination of the Vance file appears to be a hack-and-leak operation akin to how Russian intelligence leaked files from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. Those emails got significant media attention at the time, a decision that prompted much media criticism. Politico, which says it began receiving unpublished Trump documents on July 22, was the first news outlet to report that it had received them. The Trump campaign acknowledged last month that it had been hacked and accused Iran, but it has not shared details, and it did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Research published by Google and Microsoft indicates the hack occurred in June. Three U.S. agencies have publicly attributed the hack and the subsequent distribution of the files to Iran. Iranian officials have denied involvement with the hack. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s vice president for strategic affairs, told NBC News on Tuesday that the country has “no interest in changing the results or affecting the results of this election” and that “the government and official agencies of Iran have not hacked anybody. People working for us haven’t, either.” The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has repeatedly said since July that Iran seeks to damage Trump’s candidacy. As president, Trump authorized the assassination of military leader Qassem Soleimani. Intelligence officials have also briefed Trump on what they say are ongoing Iranian attempts to assassinate him. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Reporters who have received the documents describe the same pattern: An AOL account emails them files, signed by a person using the name “Robert,” who is reluctant to speak to their identity or reasons for wanting the documents to receive coverage. NBC News was not part of the Robert persona’s direct outreach, but it has viewed its correspondence with a reporter at another publication. One of the emails from the Robert persona previously viewed by NBC News included three large PDF files, each corresponding to Trump’s three reported finalists for vice president. The Vance file appears to be the one Klippenstein hosts on his site. X, formerly known as Twitter, appears to have taken the strongest initial stance against Klippenstein following his Substack post, blocking accounts that share links to his post and suspending his account. Elon Musk, who owns the site, was a staunch critic of how Twitter’s previous leadership limited access to an “October surprise” story in the New York Post about scandalous material found on a laptop belonging to President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Former intelligence officials at the time cautioned that the laptop was consistent with the work of Russian intelligence, though no direct connection has been publicly substantiated. An X spokesperson told NBC News that Klippenstein “was temporarily suspended for violating our rules on posting unredacted private personal information” pertaining to Vance. Klippenstein wrote an additional post on Substack on Thursday defending his decision to post the file while acknowledging that it did appear to violate X’s rules. “Did I make a mistake in not redacting the ‘private’ information on J.D. Vance? If I wanted a Twitter account, apparently so. But on principle? I stand by it absolutely,” he said. Representatives for Substack did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAn American journalist who runs an independent newsletter published a document Thursday&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hacked Trump campaign document from Iran revealed by Ken Klippenstein on Substack first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/hacked-trump-campaign-document-from-iran-revealed-by-ken-klippenstein-on-substack/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Ken-Klippenstein-publishes-Irans-hacked-Trump-campaign.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:55:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":257566970,"title":"Aurora police arrest 23-year-old Tren de Aragua gang member","text":"The Aurora Police Department on Wednesday arrested 23-year-old Roiberth Daniel Mora-Marquez, a “documented Tren de Aragua gang member wanted on two outstanding warrants,” police said in a statement on social media. Mora-Marquez is the latest in a string of gang-related arrests out of Aurora in the last several weeks, when viral videos and right-wing social media influencers helped stir online rumors that Venezuelan gangs had taken over buildings in the city. Mora-Marquez is charged in Adams District Court with aggravated first-degree assault, second-degree kidnapping, third-degree assault and felony menacing, charges stemming from a dispute and assault over unpaid rent money on April 4, police said. Aurora police arrested Mora-Marquez on April 17 in connection with that investigation. He was released on a $20,000 bond for that case earlier this year. A warrant for Mora-Marquez’s arrest was later issued when he failed to appear in court, according to Aurora police. Mora-Marquez also was arrested on an active warrant out of Arapahoe District Court on charges of felony menacing, illegal discharge of a firearm, harassment and reckless endangerment, charges stemming from a June 28 nonfatal shooting in the 400 block of Nile Street, Aurora police said. Mora-Marquez is one of 10 gang members the Aurora Police Department released information about earlier this month. As of Thursday afternoon, Mora-Marquez was in custody at the Aurora Detention Center on a no-bond hold. With Mora-Marquez’s arrest, the Aurora Police Department says there are now seven members of the Tren de Aragua gang in custody. On Sept. 19, former President Donald Trump announced plans to visit Aurora and Springfield, Ohio, “in the next two weeks” during a campaign speech in Uniondale, New York, in which he implied that the two cities were dangerous. “You may never see me again, but that’s OK,” Trump said to the campaign crowd.","summary":"Seven members of the Tren de Aragua gang are now in police custody, Aurora police said.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2024/09/26/tren-de-aragua-gang-member-arrest-aurora-roiberth-daniel-mora-marquez/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screen-Shot-2024-01-20-at-4.51.07-PM.png?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:54:03","author":"Leigh Walden","authors":["Leigh Walden"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.093},{"id":257566294,"title":"Harris slams Ukraine 'surrender' policy with Trump confirming Zelensky meet","text":"Kamala Harris criticized her US election rival Donald Trump's \"surrender\" policy on Ukraine on Thursday, while the Republican said he would meet Ukraine's president despite a bitter row over the war with Russia.Volodymyr Zelensky presented a so-called \"victory\" plan to President Joe Biden and Vice President Harris at the White House, with Biden announcing a new military aid package worth nearly $8 billion for a struggling Kyiv.Standing with Zelensky at her side, Harris did not mention Trump by name but said there were \"some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory.\"\"These proposals are the same of those of (President Vladimir) Putin. And let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender,\" she said, referring to the Russian leader.During a separate meeting in the Oval Office with Zelensky, Biden pledged that \"Russia will not prevail\" in the war it launched in February 2022.\"Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,\" Biden said.Dressed in his trademark military-style outfit, Zelensky replied that \"we deeply appreciate that Ukraine and America have stood side by side.\" But Zelensky is navigating the choppy waters of a US presidential election on November 5 that could sink the staunch support that he has received from Washington in the past two-and-a-half years.'Make a deal'Trump, who has long been critical of the billions of dollars in US support for Ukraine, accused Zelensky on the eve of the visit of refusing to strike a deal with Moscow.But after the row had appeared to derail any meeting, Trump announced that he would hold talks with Zelensky at Trump Tower in New York on Friday.\"President Zelensky has asked to meet with me, and I will be meeting with him tomorrow morning at around 9:45,\" the Republican told reporters in New York. Trump also repeated his longstanding claim that he would swiftly cut a peace deal — which Kyiv fears would involve giving up land Moscow has already captured.\"I believe I will be able to make a deal between President Putin and President Zelensky and quite quickly,\" he said.He also suggested he was displeased with Zelensky's recent comments to The New Yorker magazine in which Ukraine's leader said he believed Trump \"doesn't really know how to stop the war.\"Republicans have also been livid after Zelensky visited an arms factory in Biden's hometown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, accusing the Ukrainian ambassador of organizing a partisan political event and calling for her to be sacked.'They beat Napoleon'Trump has echoed many of Putin's talking points, saying at a rally earlier this week that Ukraine could not win as Russia \"beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon, that's what they do.\"When Trump was president he also asked Zelensky for potentially damaging political material on Biden ahead of the 2020 election — which led to the first of the Republican's two impeachments.Biden seems to be doing whatever he can to Trump-proof support for Ukraine as it faces an increasingly difficult situation on the battlefield against Russia.He pledged nearly $8 billion in military aid on Thursday to \"win this war,\" including $5.5 billion to be authorized before it expires at the end of the US fiscal year on Monday.Biden, whose term ends in January, also called a summit of allies in Germany in October. The White House, however, played down Zelensky's hopes of getting permission to fire long-range Western-made missiles into Russian territory.\"I'm not expecting there to be any new announcements,\" Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.Zelensky earlier visited the US Congress and gave a defiant address at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.Zelensky's visit has prompted fresh nuclear saber-rattling from Moscow.Putin on Wednesday announced plans to broaden Moscow's rules on the use of its atomic weaponry in the event of a \"massive\" air attack. by Danny Kemp, AFP","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2024/09/26/harris-slams-ukraine-surrender-policy-with-trump-confirming-zelensky-meet","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2024-03/c92d3232-5700-4562-bbef-ff91bcbad07d/Rocket_explodes_near_Zelensky__Greek_PM_motorcade.webp?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:52:18","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":257567614,"title":"Ukraine war briefing: Trump to meet Zelenskyy, and refuses to say if Ukraine should cede territory to Russia","text":"In an apparent U-turn late on Thursday, Donald Trump told reporters that he would meet Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning. The move comes after Kamala Harris described the Trump campaign’s policy on ending Russia’s war as “proposals of surrender”. “These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,” she said. “Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.” Trump rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on”. When asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump was non-committal, saying: “Let’s get some peace … We need peace. We need to stop the death and destruction.” His running mate, JD Vance, had earlier suggested Russia could retain the Ukrainian land it has occupied and establish a demilitarised zone with a heavily fortified frontline to prevent another Russian invasion. Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian president asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.” The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications was a reminder of the tension that has been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy met Joe Biden at the White House for the formal presentation of the Ukraine president’s high-stakes proposal, which he has said can end the war with Russia with additional American aid. The White House issued a short statement after the meeting, saying that the “two leaders discussed the diplomatic, economic, and military aspects of President Zelenskyy’s plan and tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps”. Zelenskyy has kept the details of the plan secret, but US officials have said it includes additional American aid to prevent a Ukrainian rout on the battlefield and “provide the [Ukrainian] people with the assurance that their future is part of the west”. Biden announced more than $8bn in military assistance to Kyiv, calling it a “surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war”. The aid includes the provision of a medium-range “glide bomb” munition fired from fighter jets that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops and supply lines at safer distances. The package includes additional Patriot air defense battery and missiles, unmanned aerial systems, and measures to strengthen Ukraine’s defense industrial base, Biden said. The US will also expand training for additional F-16 fighter pilots, with an extra 18 pilots to be trained next year. But Biden was not expected to grant a key Ukrainian request that has been supported by the UK – permission to use arms such as long-range Atacms ballistic missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia – due to fears of escalating the conflict with Russia. Russian forces repeatedly shelled a settlement west of the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson on Thursday, killing one person and wounding another, the region’s governor said. Vyacheslav Prokudin, governor of Kherson region, still partly held by Russian forces, said on Telegram that the woman died when Russian forces hit the village of Tomyna Balka six times. Outside Ukraine’s second largest city of Kharkiv, a strike by Russian multiple rocket launchers triggered a fire engulfing at least six homes in the town of Slatyne, local official Vyacheslav Zadorenko said. Zadorenko said emergency services were tackling the blaze and trying to establish whether any residents were trapped under rubble. Kharkiv, located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks. Reuters could not verify the reports independently.","summary":"Former president to meet Ukrainian president at Trump Tower on Friday amid fierce criticism of his campaign’s plans to end Russia’s invasion.

But, it's now been claimed that in the future, any stars with a prescription for the jab could be allowed to continue their injections while living in the camp, casting doubt on whether they'll endure the show's famous eating trials. It's also been reported that the injection, which typically suppresses the appetite, could bring an end to stars' hunger causing tensions in the camp. According to The Sun, ITV medics are willing to administer the drug off-camera, and outside camp, to any celeb with a doctors' note or prescription. I'm A Celebrity's stars are reportedly set to be allowed the controversial Ozempic weight loss jabs, casting doubt on the show's eating trials (winner Sam Thompson is pictured) The injection has previously been used to treat diabetes, but has faced criticism in recent months after a string of celebs revealed they'd used it for weight loss This will not be a new rule for Ozempic, but is in keeping with ITV's rules on medicines, as it's stated that any celebrities taking part in the show must fully disclose their medical history. A source said: 'The drug is already controversial after being exploited by stars for weight loss rather than diabetes, but it's not for ITV to pass judgment. 'It will be no different with Ozempic. So long as celebs have a proper doctors' note, and the drug has been prescribed, they will be able to get their regular injection as normal. 'It won't just be lying around the camp. Ozempic pens have to be stored in the fridge so they will have to be safely stored under lock and key off-site. It's also reported that any stars taking Ozempic may need to taper their dosage to lower amounts over a period, as stopping the drug overnight can cause blood-sugar fluctuations or severe gastrointestinal symptoms. An ITV source told The Sun: 'As part of the well-established and robust casting process each celebrity has a full medical assessment to make sure they are fit to take part.' MailOnline has contacted a representative for ITV for comment. So far, names rumoured to be taking part in this year's I'm A Celeb include singer Tulisa, Olympian Max Whitlock, Coronation Street's Alan Halsall, boxer Tommy Fury and former Strictly star Oti Mabuse. Now, it's been claimed that any stars with a prescription for the jab could be allowed to continue their injections while living in the camp (hosts Ant and Dec are pictured) This has cast doubt on whether stars will endure the show's famous eating trials if they are using Ozempic jabs Celebrities have been turning to Ozempic in recent years to help shed the pounds. In March, reality star Scott Disick showed off his drastic weight loss after using Mounjaro, another weight loss drug, to get rid of his 'dad bod,' while Kelly Clarkson recently admitted to using a drug to slim down. Rebel Wilson lost 80lb in four years to reach her goal weight of 165lb (11st 8lb). She shed most of the excess in 2020, calling it her 'year of health,' and putting it down to healthy eating and exercise. However, while promoting her memoir, Rebel Rising, she admitted to using Ozempic briefly after she had lost weight, to help maintain her new shape. Sharon Osbourne has been open about using the weight loss drug Ozempic. However, the music manager said she has since struggled to put weight on after shedding the pounds using the drug. Speaking on Loose Women earlier this year, she said: 'I don't regret it. Everything with weight with me was, 'I want it now.' The injections that I was on worked, but it just seems that now I can't put anything on really.' Sharon added: 'I lost over 40lbs, If I could I would put back another 10. 'I'm just an ordinary person who got lucky and I didn't take advantage of that. I never want to forget I am blessed and been really lucky in my life.' However, other stars have shared the dangers of the drug, including model Lottie Moss who revealed she was hospitalised after overdosing on Ozempic. The model was violently ill, suffering a seizure and severe dehydration after taking the drug when she weighed around 60kg - just 9stone. Australian actress Rebel Wilson - pictured in 2018, left, and 2022 - shed 80lb in four years to reach her goal weight of 165lb (11st 8lb) and later admitted to using Ozempic However, other stars have shared the dangers of the drug, including model Lottie Moss who revealed she was hospitalised after overdosing on Ozempic She said she would rather 'die' than use Ozempic again, which is meant to treat the obese or diabetics and has suffered global shortages. Lottie recalled having the seizure, which was caused by severe dehydration, and said her face and hands clenching up was one of the 'scariest' experiences she has ever endured. She said there were, 'small things I wish I'd known before taking it' and revealed her weight plummeted to around 53kg in a few weeks. After being seen by medical professionals, Lottie learned the dosage of Ozempic she was injecting into her leg should be prescribed to someone weighing at least 100 kilos - nearly double her size. Lottie explained: 'A few months ago, I was not feeling happy about my weight, I had a friend, and she could get it for me. 'It was below board, from a doctor, but it wasn't like you go into a doctor's office and he prescribes it for you, takes your blood pressure, and takes tests, which is what you need when you go on something like Ozempic. 'At the end of the day it is a medication, it is dangerous and really meant for weight loss of people of a very large size. 'When I was taking it, the amount that I was taking was meant for people who are 100 kilos and over and I'm in the 50s range.' Lottie said she weighed approximately 60 kilos before she dropped to 57 following her first dose and was 53 kilos at her lowest, which is just over eight stone. The truth behind new diet drug craze - Hollywood is hooked on it, and social media is fanning demand for the latest weight-loss 'miracle' Over the summer I was lucky enough to be invited to a 60th birthday at which the after-dinner entertainment was a private performance by one of the UK's leading male pop stars. More eye-popping than the actual show, though, was how incredible said star looked. He was a mere shadow of his former self, prancing around the stage in a silver catsuit. His secret? Semaglutide, or Ozempic as it is branded, a new diet drug that everybody – but everybody, darling, including one of the world's most famous supermodels – is apparently taking. Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, it is used off-label (for a purpose other than that for which it was licensed) in both the US and the UK to treat obesity. In research conducted by its billionaire manufacturer, the Danish-based pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, patients lost an average of 17 per cent of their overall body weight over 68 weeks. This compares with five to nine per cent for 'oldschool' anti-obesity drugs such as Metformin. Only available in the UK on the NHS if you have type 2 diabetes, Ozempic can be obtained through a private doctor, and if you are willing to take it without medical supervision – not recommended by doctors (see panel) – you can get it online through various weight-loss programmes. It is sometimes taken in tablet form but more commonly as an injection. Originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, Semaglutide is used off-label. It has been branded as a new diet drug that everybody is apparently taking Predictably, Hollywood has been aware of Ozempic for a lot longer than us – Variety magazine recently quipped that the drug deserved its own thank-you speech at the Emmys, as so many stars on the podium had obviously been taking it. Elon Musk raved about its more powerful sister drug, Wegovy, on Twitter; Kim Kardashian, it is hotly rumoured, used semaglutide to lose 16lb in order to fit into Marilyn Monroe's dress for the Met Ball. On TikTok the hashtag #ozempic has had more than 285 million views. Thanks to the hype, there has been a surge in demand, causing shortages on both sides of the Atlantic, with a backlash against influencers and celebrities hogging supplies ahead of desperate diabetes sufferers. Predictably, Big Pharma has come up with an alternative – tirzepatide (brand name Mounjaro), manufactured by Eli Lilly – but it has yet to be approved by the US Food & Drug Administration for weight loss. Novo Nordisk has issued a statement to say its supplies will be replenished by the end of the year, but it hasn't quelled anxiety. At least two middle-aged male friends of mine who started using it in September are getting themselves in a twist about being caught short before the holidays. As one private London GP remarked to me: 'It's like the H RT panic last spring.' So what exactly is this drug? Semaglutide belongs to a class called GLP-1 agonists, which not only regulate blood sugar but, as was discovered about a decade ago, also mimic the gut hormones that regulate our appetites – the ones that tell the brain when we are hungry or full. There are, of course, side effects: acid reflux, nausea, exacerbation of IBS symptoms and fatigue (but much less so than in earlier GLP-1 agonists such as Saxenda), as well as pancreatitis, gallstones and, in very high doses, it has caused thyroid tumours in rats. Meanwhile, when you stop using it the effect wears off immediately and in some cases it won't work at all. 'I would describe semaglutide as an example of very smart science,' says leading consultant endocrinologist Dr Efthimia Karra from her private practice off London's Harley Street. 'But it is not a panacea for everyone. Around a fifth of users do not respond to it. This is because the human body favours weight gain, thus when you lose weight the body will do anything to revert to its highest BMI. The heavier you are the harder it is to lose weight. If a patient has made no progress in three months, I will take them off it.' Banker's wife Laura, a native New Yorker in her mid-50s who had hovered between decades, started using it in January. 'The Paleo diet, 5:2, CBT, NLP, bootcamp, diet delivery services – I've tried them all,' she says from the family home in Hampshire, 'and I've always yo-yoed right back. After my last annual checkup I seriously contemplated giving up. Then my doctor suggested semaglutide.' After only a month she noticed her clothes had become looser. From then on, the weight started dropping off. 'The strange thing was, I wasn't eating anything different. I just couldn't physically have seconds any more, and the idea of pudding after a full meal had lost its allure.' Three months on, she is two stone lighter ‒ though occasionally she suffers heartburn if she eats too late at night or drinks alcohol ‒ and when we spoke in autumn, she was looking forward to losing another stone by Christmas. 'There is a niggling voice that tells me it is both risky and lazy to take a drug to lose weight, and I worry that it will all pile on again if I stop taking it. But if it does, I will seriously consider taking it indefinitely.' Private London GP Dr Martin Galy has been prescribing semaglutide for about a year to clients who cannot lose the weight they gained in menopause. He has seen it have a transformational effect, too, on much younger women who suffer polycystic ovary syndrome. 'PCOS sufferers are difficult to treat, and you can imagine how body image plays a very important part when it comes to self-esteem.' But according to Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, it is not a magic bullet. Commenting on a study on semaglutide published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2021, he says, 'The challenge post-weight loss is to prevent a regain in weight,' he wrote. It may prove to be useful in the short term, but 'public health measures that encourage behavioural changes such as regular physical activity and moderating dietary energy intake are still needed'. That said, given our rising national obesity statistics and the escalation in accompanying health issues such as heart failure, cancer and obstructive sleep apnoea clogging up hospital beds, we're going to need something. Semaglutide may be the rich person's drug today, but might it be approved for more widespread use? Only time will tell.

Aides to the presidents of the United States and Ukraine, Joe Biden and Vladimir Zelensky, are currently discussing details of the Kiev government’s proposed plan to settle the Ukrainian conflict, White House National Security Council Strategic Communications Coordinator John Kirby has told reporters. \"Here [at the White House] he [Zelensky] had a chance to present the broad contours of his victory plan to President Biden and to our national security team, and the president directed our team to work with his team over the next couple of weeks to dig into it a little bit more. Both presidents are planning to meet in Germany, when we head over there on the 12th of October,\" he said. \"They'll meet to further flesh it out and see what we together can do to help President Zelensky really achieve this just and lasting peace that that he's trying to achieve.\" Earlier, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said he had prepared a conflict resolution plan that he intends to discuss with US President Joe Biden as some provisions depended on Washington’s decisions. He also plans to present it to the US presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Later, Sergey Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said the plan is based on the assumption that the Western countries will approve strikes deep into Russian territory. As Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out, Ukraine is unable to strike deep into Russian territory without Western assistance, as it needs intelligence from satellites and flight tasks to do so. At the same time, the Ukrainian leader also named the ‘victory plan,’ based on his ‘peace formula’ as a possible way of resolving the crisis. Moscow has repeatedly criticized it for being unrealistic, saying that the situation on the ground must be taken into account. Besides, Moscow voiced its support for the peace plan, proposed by China and Brazil, which Ukraine rejected as ‘unrealistic.’ Russian President Vladimir Putin set forth the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine at a meeting with senior Foreign Ministry officials on June 14. His terms included Ukraine withdrawing troops from Donbass and Novorossia and abandoning plans to join NATO. In addition, Moscow believes that all Western sanctions must be lifted and Ukraine’s non-bloc and non-nuclear status must be guaranteed. Putin noted that if Ukraine and the West turned down the initiative, the conditions might change in the future. Kiev rejected Russia’s peace plan.","summary":"\"Both presidents are planning to meet in Germany, when we head over there on the 12th of October,\" John Kirby said","url":"https://tass.com/world/1848469","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:42:29","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":0.048},{"id":257565450,"title":"Trump mocks Kamala Harris’ planned border visit in NYC presser: ‘Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago?’","text":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border — just her second as vice president — arguing she’s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis. Harris is expected to travel to Douglas, Ariz., on Friday and is planning to make a stop at the border to talk about increasing security. “Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago? She’s got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it,” the former president said Thursday during a press conference at Trump Tower. The Arizona stop will be the first time Harris has seen the border as the Democratic presidential nominee. She went to the border as vice president in 2021 amid pressure for her to see firsthand the processing centers. “She’s going there tomorrow, after almost four years, she’s going there tomorrow to try and show you what a great job she did,” Trump argued in his remarks. Harris has campaigned on supporting the killed bipartisan border bill that would have shut down the border if illegal border crossings topped 2,500 per week — but still would have allowed in about 1.8 million migrants per year. “Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote,” Harris said in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday. “He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.” The Harris-Biden administration revoked several of Trump’s policies like Remain in Mexico and halted the further building of the border wall when they took office in 2021. “You can’t justify she should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border,” Trump said. “He can do it with the signing of just a signature and a piece of paper to the border patrol. Instead, she’s going there to try and convince people that she wasn’t as bad as everybody knows she was.” Trump vowed to “terminate all sanctuary cities,” stop Catch and Release, “shut down all entries through the migrant phone app” and reinstate Remain in Mexico. He also said he would send federal law enforcement to “liberate” Aurora, Colo., which has experienced an uptick in migrants, crime and the gang Tren de Aragua.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris’ planned visit to the border — just her second as vice president — arguing she’s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis.

The massive civil fraud lawsuit was brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. Judge Arthur Engoron issued a summary judgment against Trump back in September 2023, finding that the former president overvalued his assets and lied about his net worth to obtain better interest rates for bank loans. Engoron’s final judgment found Trump liable for $364 million before interest in February. The amount the former president owes has grown to over $450 million in the months since. But some judges on New York’s First Appellate Division court echoed some of the arguments Trump’s lawyers have been repeating for months—indicating they might be persuaded to reduce the fine. “The immense penalty in this case is troubling,” Justice Peter Moulton asked New York Deputy Solicitor General Judith Vale, who argued on behalf of the government. “How do you tether the amount that was assessed by the [New York] Supreme Court to the harm that was caused here—where the parties left these transactions happy how things went down?” Vale insisted that the scheme gave the Trump Organization “enormously favorable interest rate savings” for years. “That is an enormous benefit they got from the misconduct, and it is not an excuse to say ‘well our fraud was really successful, so we should get some of the money.’” She also argued that the former president still engaged in a crime even if Deutsche Bank claimed it was unharmed. “If someone issues a false financial statement to a counterparty, the counterparty gets it and is not fooled, picks up the phone and calls the enforcement authorities—the crime has still been committed. Even though the counterparty didn’t rely on it at all.” Vale also pushed back on the idea that Trump’s bankers were completely happy with his company’s conduct. “Deutsche Bank did complain when they first found out about the alleged misstatements and omissions,” Vale said, and claimed that the bank later “exited the entire relationship with the Trumps.” The justices also grilled prosecutors on whether the attorney general even has the authority to prosecute business transactions between private parties. Attorney General James’ office relied on a reading of New York’s Executive Law 63(12), which instructs the AG to prosecute “repeated fraudulent or illegal acts or otherwise demonstrate persistent fraud or illegality in the carrying on, conducting or transaction of business.” But Justice David Friedman noted that the state’s other examples of using this law were all cases brought to protect consumers—including the collapse of Lehman Brothers. “Every case that you cite, whether it was damage to consumers, damage to the marketplace… you don’t have anything like that here.” “It hardly seems that that justifies bringing an action to protect Deutsche against President Trump,” Friedman said. “I mean, you’ve got two really sophisticated parties in which no one lost any money” Moulton seemed to agree with Friedman on this point, and wondered if the attorney general’s scope had widened too far. “Has 63(12 morphed into something that it was not meant to do?” Vale argued that the attorney general’s office has the obligation to go after fraud before it gets to the point of hurting consumers or the market. “A big point of these statutes… is for the Attorney General to go in quickly to stop the fraud and illegality before it gets to the point that counterparties are harmed, or it has those kinds of ripple effects in the market.”","summary":"John Lamparski/Getty ImagesA panel of judges on a New York appeals court expressed skepticism over the massive $450 million judgment levied against former President Donald Trump after he was found liable for civil fraud last year.\n\nThe massive civil fraud lawsuit was brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James.

Black SUVs zooming into Gracie Mansion. Big color charts and stern government lawyers standing with their hands clasped. “A multiyear scheme,” Williams intoned, “to buy favor with a single New York City politician on the rise: Eric Adams.” It’s all nice sound and fury, but is it as serious as Williams claims? At first glance, what the government of Turkey got as “favors” from Mayor Adams was small potatoes. Cutting red tape to open the Turkish consulate on time. A position on the transition team. And what did Adams get in return? Campaign donations. And first-class upgrades on Turkish Airlines. #Extralegroomgate. The latter is embarrassing but may not be illegal. The straw donor scheme is more serious, but Adams denies he knew anything about it. It is in the best interest of fairness — and the best interest of New York City — that Adams be allowed to present a defense while he continues to serve his term. The argument of the resignation crowd is that he is so distracted that he cannot possibly lead and that his administration is in chaos with multiple staff either quitting or fleeing for the exits. But the alternative is a recipe for similar chaos. The vultures already circling will lead Gotham to disaster, beginning with the man who would temporarily take over if Adams were to step down or be removed: Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. A defund-the-police radical, who prefers getting arrested at protests to actually providing solutions, could make the crime situation worse even in a short time. Then there would come a special election, likely in early 2025. Adams’ so-far declared election rivals are also a terrible collection of unserious progressive loudmouths or has-beens. Meanwhile, disgraced ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo smells blood in the water and is circling. Republicans? City Councilman Joe Borelli has said he’d run in a special, and maybe another sane option will come forward from somewhere — but Democrats’ edge in citywide enrollment is beyond fearsome. The decision to pursue Adams undoubtedly carries a strong whiff of politics: The investigation clearly went into high gear after the mayor infuriated the White House by going high-profile in his complaints about the border crisis’ impact on New York. And the Southern District’s full-court press on Adams officials — even raiding interim Police Commissioner Tom Donlon’s home the other week, just days after he’d taken the NYPD job, over documents he’d apparently held for nearly two decades — only adds to those suspicions. The reputation of prosecutors and trust in the justice system over the last few years, from the treatment of Hunter Biden and Donald Trump to partisan DAs and kidglove treatment of violent offenders, is frankly awful. We reserve judgment on whether Mayor Adams did wrong. The law is the law and a fair legal process will get to the truth. The coming days will reveal the strength of the criminal case against Adams and his ability to dismantle it. But there’s no need to rush things. Either way, New Yorkers will decide next year whether to keep him for a second term or go in a new direction. In the meanwhile, what they really want is for someone to continue the fight against crime, battle the tsunami of antisemitism in the city, deal with the migrant crisis, grapple with the soaring cost of living, tackle the housing crisis and improve the atrocious educational attainment of pupils in the system.","summary":"It is in the best interest of fairness — and the best interest of New York City — that Mayor Eric Adams be allowed to present a defense while he continues to serve his term.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/26/opinion/mayor-eric-adams-should-stay-and-offer-his-defense-to-new-yorkers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-we092ioeb-1727392360228.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727378045&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:29:38","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":257564932,"title":"Sir Keir Starmer to meet with Donald Trump to ‘establish a relationship’","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is to meet with Donald Trump later tonight. It is believed to be the first meeting between the current UK prime minister and former – and potentially future – US president. The pair are set to meet overnight UK time, which is the evening in New York, where Sir Keir is currently located while on a visit to the UN. David Lammy, the Labour foreign secretary, has met Mr Trump‘s vice presidential candidate, JD Vance. Speaking to journalists, Sir Keir reiterated he wanted to meet both Mr Trump and Kamala Harris ahead of the November vote. However, meeting the Democrat is hard due to the “usual diary challenges”. Sir Keir said: “It’ll be really to establish a relationship between the two of us. “I’m a great believer in personal relations on the international stage. “I think it really matters that you know who your counterpart is in any given country, and know them personally, get to know them face to face. “So it’s really along those lines. I won’t go into what we’ll actually discuss, obviously, but that’s the purpose of it, as you’d expect, ahead of the election.” Asked if a Trump presidency would leave Ukraine exposed, Sir Keir said the nature of the “special relationship” between the UK and US “always sits above whoever holds the particular office”. “The US people will decide who they want as their president, and we will work with whoever is president,” he added. “I’m not going to speculate on what any particular issues may be on the other side of the election.” Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Sir Keir was “very nice”. He said: “I actually think he’s very nice. He ran a great race, he did very well, it’s very early, he’s very popular.” Mr Trump went on to praise Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as well, saying: “I think Nigel is great, I’ve known him for a long time.” “He had a great election too, picked up a lot of seats, more seats than he was allowed to have actually. “They acknowledged that he won but for some reason you have a strange system over there, you might win them but you don’t get them.” This appears to be a misunderstanding of how the UK’s first past the post system for elections chooses MPs – Reform won fewer seats compared to its vote share because it came second in many seats.","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer is to meet with Donald Trump later tonight.

Harris is expected to travel to Douglas, Ariz., on Friday and is planning to make a stop at the border to talk about increasing security. “Why didn’t she fix it almost four years ago? She’s got no plans, got no talent, got no ability to do it,” the former president said Thursday during a press conference at Trump Tower. The Arizona stop will be the first time Harris has seen the border as the Democratic presidential nominee. She went to the border as vice president in 2021 amid pressure for her to see firsthand the processing centers. “She’s going there tomorrow, after almost four years, she’s going there tomorrow to try and show you what a great job she did,” Trump argued in his remarks. Harris has campaigned on supporting the killed bipartisan border bill that would have shut down the border if illegal border crossings topped 2,500 per week — but still would have allowed in about 1.8 million migrants per year. “Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on and told them to kill the bill, don’t put it up for a vote,” Harris said in an interview with MSNBC on Wednesday. “He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.” The Harris-Biden administration revoked several of Trump’s policies like Remain in Mexico and halted the further building of the border wall when they took office in 2021. “You can’t justify she should save her airfare. She should go back to the White House and tell the president to close the border,” Trump said. “He can do it with the signing of just a signature and a piece of paper to the border patrol. Instead, she’s going there to try and convince people that she wasn’t as bad as everybody knows she was.” Trump vowed to “terminate all sanctuary cities,” stop Catch and Release, “shut down all entries through the migrant phone app” and reinstate Remain in Mexico. He also said he would send federal law enforcement to “liberate” Aurora, Colo., which has experienced an uptick in migrants, crime and the gang Tren de Aragua.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump mocked Kamala Harris&#8217; planned visit to the border &#8212; just her second as vice president &#8212; arguing she&#8217;s had three years to solve the illegal migrant crisis.

The vice president said she would work to ensure Ukraine prevails in the war, now in its third year, and achieves a just peace. She then criticized former President Trump, her Republican rival in the Nov. 5 election, without naming him. Trump later said he would meet Zelenskiy on Friday morning at Trump Tower in New York. While Trump and Zelenskiy spoke by phone in July, they have not met in person since Trump’s presidential term ended in 2021. She said “there are some” in the United States who would force Ukraine to give up large parts of its territory and abandon its security relationships with other nations. “These proposals are the same as those of (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,” she said. Trump has said U.S. aid to Ukraine is a waste of money and has declined to say whether he wants Ukraine to win.

The meeting has the potential to be diplomatically awkward, not just because of Mr Trump’s bombastic style but also because Sir Keir has not been able to schedule a similar appointment with Democratic candidate and vice president Kamala Harris. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir told reporters: “I’ve said a number of times, I want to meet both candidates. “We’ve now got the opportunity to meet Trump, which is good. “Obviously, I still want to speak to Harris as well. “But you know, the usual diary challenges, but it’s good that this one now has been fixed. “It’ll be really to establish a relationship between the two of us. “I’m a great believer in personal relations on the international stage. “I think it really matters that you know who your counterpart is in any given country, and know them personally, get to know them face to face.” Foreign Secretary David Lammy – who called Mr Trump a “racist KKK and Nazi sympathiser” in 2017 and promised to protest on the streets if he visited the UK – was also attending the Trump Tower meeting.

The poll, conducted by the New York-based Marist College, found that Harris and Trump both have the support of 49% among likely voters in North Carolina. In Arizona and Georgia, Trump leads by just one percentage point, with 50% of potential voters in both states indicating they would support him, while 49% lean towards Harris. The survey was conducted between September 19 and September 24 and included 4,643 registered voters across all three states. All respondents indicated they planned to vote in November, and 91% expressed certainty about their choice. These three states offer a total of 43 electoral votes combined. Trump won North Carolina in both 2016 and 2020. He also defeated then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in Arizona and Georgia in 2016 but lost both states to President Joe Biden in 2020, marking the first time a Democratic nominee won Georgia since 1992. Trump actively disputed the Georgia election results, alleging that the election was rigged. These claims were refuted by various state officials, including Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Another poll conducted in August by the Siena College Research Institute showed that Harris had a significant lead over Trump in three other swing states: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. The vice president was expected to outpace her rival by 50% to 46% across all three states, according to the poll’s data. However, in 2020, the final gap between Biden and Trump turned out to be much smaller than earlier survey predictions. Nationwide polling results published by the New York Times on Thursday also suggested that Harris is beating Trump by three points. The paper noted, however, that the former president could “easily prevail” if he gains ground in several key states, including Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, where Harris’ lead is within two percentage points.","summary":"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are separated by one percent in Georgia and Arizona and are tied in North Carolina, according to a poll \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604749-trump-harris-tied-swing-states/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66f5d1dc2030272aae3471cd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:11:03","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.569},{"id":257564698,"title":"Trump criticizes Harris over planned border visit","text":"Trump criticizes Harris over planned border visit Former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris should \"save her airfare\" ahead of her planned visit to the southern border Friday.

The brief, submitted over the Trump team’s objections, is aimed at defending a revised and stripped-down indictment that prosecutors filed last month to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that conferred broad immunity on former presidents. Prosecutors said earlier this month that they intended to present a “detailed factual proffer,” including grand jury transcripts and multiple exhibits, to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in hopes of persuading her that the allegations in the indictment should not be dismissed and should remain part of the case. A spokesman for the Smith team, Peter Carr, confirmed that prosecutors had met their 5 p.m. deadline for filing a brief. Though the brief is not currently accessible to the public, prosecutors have said they intend to file a redacted version that could be made available later, raising the prospect that previously unseen allegations from the case could be made public in the final weeks before the November election. The Trump team has vigorously objected to the filing, calling it unnecessary and saying it could lead to the airing of unflattering details in the “sensitive” pre-election time period. “The Court does not need 180 pages of ‘great assistance’ from the Special Counsel’s Office to develop the record necessary to address President Trump’s Presidential immunity defense,” Trump’s lawyers wrote, calling it “tantamount to a premature and improper Special Counsel report.” The brief is the opening salvo in a restructured criminal case following the Supreme Court’s opinion in July that said former presidents are presumptively immune for official acts they take in office but are not immune for their private acts. In their new indictment, Smith’s team ditched certain allegations related to Trump’s interactions with the Justice Department but left the bulk of the case intact, arguing that the remaining acts — including Trump’s hectoring of his vice president, Mike Pence, to refuse to certify the counting of electoral votes — do not deserve immunity protections. Chutkan is now responsible for deciding which acts left in the indictment, including allegations that Trump participated in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states he lost, are official acts and therefore immune from prosecution or private acts. She has acknowledged that her decisions are likely to be subject to additional appeals to the Supreme Court.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Special counsel Jack Smith on Thursday filed, under seal, a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Prosecutors file confidential document outlining accusations against Trump in election interference lawsuit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/prosecutors-file-confidential-document-outlining-accusations-against-trump-in-election-interference-lawsuit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1727391894_rewrite-this-title-Prosecutors-file-sealed-brief-detailing-allegations-against.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:06:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.534},{"id":257565610,"title":"MAGA Means Never Having to Say You’re Sorry","text":"Back in 1999—the good old days—a Canadian band that called itself Great Big Sea released a wonderful song titled “Consequence Free.” It was a gentle poke at social conformity, guilt, and, yes, perhaps even what was then called political correctness. “Wouldn’t it be great,” the song goes, “if no one ever got offended? Wouldn’t it be great to say what’s really on your mind?” And then in a soaring plea: “I wanna be—consequence free!” But the group wasn’t trying to be rude: It was looking for only “a little bit of anarchy, but not the hurting kind.” I loved the song (and still do), not least because I always had something of a burr in my saddle about the language policing of late-20th-century political correctness. (I was also pushing 40 at the time and something of a loudmouth myself.) But I knew that I and these charming Canadian fellows were only engaging in wistful thinking about not being too hard on yourself. We were not daydreaming about how great it would be to fire off racial epithets or chest-thump about being Nazis. How quaint that seems now. Today, public figures say things that would have resulted in their disgracing and shunning 25 years ago, all while demanding to be relieved of consequences. Donald Trump, of course, is the poster boy for this juvenile insistence on a life without judgment or criticism. He has made a political career out of “telling it like it is,” which for Trump means saying things that are incendiary (and often untrue) and then pretending to be shocked that anyone could take offense at his guileless candor. Trump has gotten away with this cowardly schtick for years, and he has built a following among Americans who take his hideous pronouncements as permission to be their worst selves. People now delight in shocking others the way toddlers who have learned their first swear words enjoy seeing the horror of adults around them. This, as the Never Trump conservative writer Rick Wilson once put it, is “performative assholery,” and it is everywhere. Consider GOP Representative Clay Higgins. If you are fortunate enough not to be acquainted with his political history, Higgins was a captain in a parish sheriff’s department in Louisiana who was forced to resign in 2016 after he referred to Black criminal suspects as “animals,” among other things, along with other unprofessional behavior. Higgins might have been too racist for a Deep South police department, but not for the voters of Lousiania’s Third Congressional District, which includes Lake Charles and Lafayette, where he was first elected to the House in 2016. This week, Higgins got on the Trump campaign’s bandwagon of hatred directed at Haitians. After a nonprofit organization filed private-citizen criminal charges against Trump and his running mate, Senator J. D. Vance, for various offenses related to their lies about the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, Higgins fired off this post on X: After enough of an uproar, Higgins deleted the post—and then doubled down on it anyway. “It’s all true,” Higgins told CNN yesterday. “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want.” Although Higgins is an odious racist, he is also clever: He knows that in the modern Republican Party, tribal loyalty means that political consequences for almost anything are rare. Not only will he remain in the good graces of his constituents, he even had the feckless House leader, Speaker Mike Johnson, covering for him. Higgins, according to Johnson, “prayed about it, and he regretted it, and he pulled the post down.” This is laugh-out-loud nonsense, and both Higgins and Johnson know it. The goal was to offend, to stir controversy, to rile up the MAGA faithful—and to get away with it. The whole episode was the very essence of the consequence-free GOP. Which brings us to the Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. Robinson apparently frequented some of the ickier parts of the internet, where he referred to himself as a “black NAZI!” and indulged in online behavior that need not be recounted here; in general, they were things one would not normally associate with a party that prides itself on family values and Christian morality. Even before these revelations—which prompted all of his senior staff to announce their resignations—he was already running an offensive mess of a campaign. (“Some folks need killing,” he said this past June—while standing in a church.) Unlike Higgins, Robinson will almost certainly pay the price of an electoral loss. But amazingly, not only has he refused to withdraw from the race—which at least would have been an act of mercy to his party—but he won’t step down from his post as the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, either. After all, why should he? He’s the victim here, you see: He has denied the accusations and is even threatening to sue CNN for publishing these terrible things. (And yet, for some reason, when supporters offered to connect him with tech specialists to help investigate how all the stuff that seems to point to him ended up on the internet, he reportedly refused their assistance.) Now, it’s true that the GOP does not have a monopoly on denial and huffy self-righteousness. Yesterday, New York City Mayor Eric Adams was hit with a barrel of federal charges and his reaction was positively Trumpian: “I always knew that if I stood my ground for New Yorkers that I would be a target,” he said, “and a target I became.” If he took favors and bribes—and he’s not admitting that he did—it was obviously for the people of Gotham. Republicans, too, sometimes end up in court—Trump, after all, has been indicted in multiple jurisdictions and convicted in one so far—but for the MAGA base, it is almost a badge of honor when a Republican is charged with crimes. Trump and others have argued that the current Justice Department is merely a Democratic political weapon, but that’s an odd charge against a DOJ that has sought accountability not just from Adams but from disgraced (and convicted) former Senator Bob Menendez and many other Democrats, including President Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Adams is already facing calls from within his own party to resign. The GOP, meanwhile, so far can’t bring itself even to censure Higgins or to call on Robinson to step down from his office. Higgins and Robinson, of course, do not belong in a courtroom: Being an offensive jerk is not a crime. But their behavior does raise the question of what, exactly, it takes to be ostracized by the Republican Party and its voters. When does so much racism, misogyny, and xenophobia finally become so toxic that Republicans join with other decent people in rejecting such behavior? Right now, the limit for this kind of ghastliness does not seem to exist. And that is a tragedy for what’s left of the GOP—as well as for the civic health of the world’s greatest democracy.

(I got fixated on how a line from the movie showed up in another of my favorite films, Grosse Pointe Blank, but that’s not important, even if it was nice to see one great movie echo another.) It has become almost a cliché to say that Network predicted the era of cable news, but the parallels are unnerving. If you haven’t seen it, or if you haven’t seen it in a long time, steel yourself to sit through it again. (I say that because it is really hard to watch in places, especially when William Holden calmly recites the tawdry reality of his character’s seamy May-December romance with Faye Dunaway’s icy executive, a role for which she won an Oscar.) The final product of the fictional The Howard Beale Show showed how an evening news broadcast degenerated into a circus, with an unhinged old man ranting at the audience while they clapped for segments such as “Sybil the Soothsayer,” “Vox Populi,” and “Miss Mata Hari and Her Skeletons in the Closet.” I was shocked at how eerily it predicted our present era despite being made almost 50 years ago—a good two decades before Fox News went on the air. — Tom Stephanie Bai contributed to this newsletter.

Yet, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have kept very quiet on who they're rooting for, despite encouraging Americans to vote in a recent Archewell Foundation statement. Now, a leading royal expert has expressed their puzzlement over this silence, reports OK! Former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond admitted: \"I don't know why they won't publicly back Kamala Harris. I only wish they would. They are trying to use their platform for good causes and in the view of any sane person it would surely be an excellent cause to try and persuade people that Trump is a danger to the civilised world.\" But Jennie went on to suggest their royal ties might be holding them back, saying: \"I suppose it is still controversial for a member of the Royal Family, even a non-working and estranged one, to meddle in politics. Also American people might consider it extremely presumptuous of a British Prince to try to influence a US election.\" READ MORE: Prince Harry 'ruined bond with Kate Middleton after snide remarks broke huge rule' READ MORE: Meghan Markle's email rule speaks volumes on how she really treats staff The Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a statement last week, urging people to vote in the election, without backing either candidate. The statement said: \"Voting is not just a right; it's a fundamental way to influence the fate of our communities. At The Archewell Foundation, we recognise that civic engagement, no matter one's political party, is at the heart of a more just and equitable world. By participating in initiatives like this, we aim to amplify the message that every voice matters. Together, let's make sure every eligible voter is informed and empowered to participate in shaping America's future.\" Their move has been criticised by some, with PR expert Renae Smith of publicity firm The Atticism, telling the Express that she believes the couple have \"worked hard to drive home their position as independent global figures, so this statement falls in line with the brand they've been working to build - eg that they do what they want, without any thought towards royal guidelines or customs\". Jennie voiced her opinion that the Sussexes should take a stand and endorse a political candidate, despite potential backlash and Donald Trump's previous harsh words for Prince Harry. She pointed out: \"There is the small matter of Trump wreaking vengeance on Harry given that he has been highly critical of the Prince,\" and recalled his biting remark: \"'I wouldn't protect Harry. He betrayed the Queen. He would be on his own if it was down to me.'\" She went on to say that she also thought Meghan should still speak up, saying: \"But I can't see any good reason for Meghan to stay silent about her allegiance. She has made her views about Trump extremely clear in the past. Perhaps they just don't want all the grief that would inevitably come from them endorsing a candidate.\" Jennie also suggested that their PR statement was perhaps a \"compromise\", as she explained: \"I don't think anyone is in any doubt about their views on American politics... so I suppose their guarded statement about the election could be seen as a mature and responsible compromise, simply encouraging people to use their vote.

The stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution or CR, will extend government funding until December 20, The Guardian reported. It will also provide an additional $231m for the Secret Service “for operations necessary to carry out protective operations, including the 2024 presidential campaign and national special security events,” following the two recent assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump. Biden’s signing of the bill came one day after the House and Senate passed the legislation with sweeping bipartisan majorities in both chambers. “The passage of this bill gives Congress more time to pass full-year funding bills by the end of this year,” Biden said on Wednesday. “My administration will work with Congress to ensure these bills deliver for America’s national defence, veterans, seniors, children and working families, and address urgent needs for the American people, including communities recovering from disasters.” The Republican House Speaker, Mike Johnson, had initially tried to pass a more right-wing proposal that combined a six-month stopgap funding measure with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, a controversial proposal that would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. That effort failed last week, when 14 Republicans and all but two Democrats opposed Johnson’s bill. The failure forced Johnson to take up a three-month spending bill that was narrow enough to win Democrats’ support. The House passed that bill on Wednesday in a vote of 341 to 82, with all of the opposition to the legislation stemming from Republicans. “Our legislative work before November has now been officially done, and today the House did the necessary thing,” Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. “We took the initiative and passed a clean, narrow, three-month CR to prevent the Senate from jamming us with another bloated bill while continuing resolutions.” Johnson nodded at the widespread opposition to the bill within his conference, as 82 Republicans voted against it amid complaints of wasteful government spending, The Guardian reported. “While a continuing resolution is never ideal — none of us like them; that’s not a way to run a railroad — it allows Congress to continue serving the American people through the election,” Johnson said. Once the House passed the continuing resolution on Wednesday noon, the Senate moved immediately to take up the bill. The Upper Chamber passed the bill just two hours after the House did in a bipartisan vote of 78 to 18. The Democratic Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, thanked Johnson for his work to avoid a shutdown, but he lamented that it took Congress until the last minute to pass a funding package when it seemed evident for weeks that a narrow stopgap would be necessary. “Tonight the American people can sleep easier knowing we have avoided an unnecessary government shutdown at the end of the month,” Schumer said before the vote. “It is a relief for the country that, once again, bipartisanship prevailed to stop another shutdown threat. It took much longer than it should have, but because House Republicans finally, finally chose to work with us in the end, Congress is getting the job done tonight.” Schumer had previously blamed Donald Trump for the delay, as the former President had implored Republican lawmakers to reject any funding bill unless it was tied to “election security” measures. The newly signed bill did not meet that demand, but Johnson insisted that Trump backed Republicans’ efforts to keep the government funded. “Former President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we’re in,” Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. “So we’ll continue working closely together. I’m not defying President Trump. We’re getting our job done, and I think he understands that.” Both Chambers of Congress now stand adjourned for six weeks, meaning members will not return to Capitol Hill until after election day. Johnson’s decision to rely on Democratic support to pass the funding package has raised questions about his future as Speaker, but he voiced confidence on Wednesday about his leadership and his party’s prospects for expanding its narrow House majority. “I would be a fool to project a certain number of seats, but let me just say I’m very optimistic,” Johnson told reporters. “I believe we’re going to hold the House. And I intend to be the Speaker in the new Congress.” –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 27 (IANS) US President Joe Biden has signed a three-month government funding bill, averting an imminent shutdown and delaying a fuller conversation about government spending until after the&#8230; Continue reading Biden signs temporary funding bill to avert US government shutdown before election\n\n\nThe post Biden signs temporary funding bill to avert US government shutdown before election first appeared on Australia India News.","url":"https://indianews.com.au/biden-signs-temporary-funding-bill-to-avert-us-government-shutdown-before-election/","image":"https://iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202409273231343.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-26 23:04:18","author":"India News Newsdesk","authors":["India News Newsdesk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":257563942,"title":"Criminal charges coming in alleged Iranian hack of Trump campaign emails: Sources","text":"Federal law enforcement officials plan to announce criminal charges Friday in connection with the alleged Iranian hack of emails from members of former President Donald Trump's campaign, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.
