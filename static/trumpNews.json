The claim comes in the wake of the Games in Paris where Khelif – and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-Ting – both won Olympic gold in boxing while being subjected to huge global scrutiny over eligibility due to their gender. Now, Bulgarian-Nigerian women’s boxer Joana Nwamerue has labelled Khelif a ‘man’ and explained how during a sparring session in February, she witnessed the Olympic champion’s ‘male power and male techniques’. ‘[Khelif] has some kind of internal issues. But he is a man. I will stay [by] my words until he/she does a test to prove to the world that he/she is a woman. But we all know that won’t happen,’ Nwamerue told Reduxx. ‘I think we played 3-4 sparring sessions. I have a record of everything. I can confirm that this is a man to me. Male power. Men’s techniques, everything,’ she added. Nwamerue claimed she was told that Khelif has been ‘biologically altered’ by living in the mountain ranges of Algeria by her coaching team. Nwamerue added: ‘[Khelif’s] teammates came to me and told me ‘Imane is not a man. ‘She is a woman and just lives high in the mountains with her relatives and parents and so there may be a change in her testosterone or chromosomes and the like.’ Khelif was born female and is not transgender. She was banned last year after The International Boxing Association (IBA) carried out medical tests which said she had high levels of testosterone in her system. She had previously competed without issues and was disqualified by the sport’s governing body only after she defeated Russian boxer Azalia Amineva in the 2023 tournament. The IBA is controlled by Umar Kremlev, who is Russian and brought in the state-owned energy supplier Gazprom as its primary sponsor and moved much of the governing body’s operations to Russia. Her coach, Georges Cazorla, has confirmed that the tests identified ‘a problem with hormones’ and ‘with chromosomes’, suggesting that she may have the XY gender chromosomes typical of a man. ‘This poor young girl was devastated, devastated to suddenly discover that she might not be a girl,’ he told French magazine Le Point. The debate throughout the Games around Khelif’s participation was not lost on the athlete herself. She was moved to tears after winning her quarterfinal match and hit back at her critics once she had the gold medal around her neck. ‘For eight years, this has been my dream, and I’m now the Olympic champion and gold medalist,’ Khelif said Friday. ‘That also gives my success a special taste because of those attacks. We are in the Olympics to perform as athletes, and I hope that we will not see any similar attacks in future Olympics. ‘I am fully qualified to take part in this competition. I’m a woman like any other woman. I was born as a woman, I live as a woman, and I am qualified.’ Khelif was given a heroes welcome in Algeria on Monday as she returned home from France with her gold medal. She was met at the Houari Boumediene Airport in Algiers by hundreds of fans to celebrate the success. Over the weekend, though, Khelif was taunted by Donald Trump as he gave a speech at a rally in Montana. ‘Who wants men to participate in women’s sports? I would like to congratulate the young woman who has evolved from a man to a woman. He… She won gold,’ Trump said. ‘What about the woman, the beautiful woman, from Italy? She went in there and had no idea what was going on. She’s a very good boxer – but only against other women.’ He was referring to Angela Carini, who quit 46 seconds into her fight with Khelif last week after being struck on the nose. She was in tears and said she had never been hit so hard before. Trump acted out the punch and then said: ‘He did this. She immediately, wow, nobody has ever hit me that hard. ‘Then he does it again and she immediately gives up.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA former training opponent of Olympic gold medal boxer Imane Khelif has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Boxer who challenged Imane Khelif asserts that the gender dispute boxer is perceived as &#8216;a male&#8217; &#8211; and exposes curious allegations made by the Algerian team that she had been &#8216;physically changed&#8217;. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/boxer-who-challenged-imane-khelif-asserts-that-the-gender-dispute-boxer-is-perceived-as-a-male-and-exposes-curious-allegations-made-by-the-algerian-team-that-she-had-been-physically-changed/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Fighter-who-faced-Imane-Khelif-claims-gender.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:42:15","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":253976940,"title":"Congress Divided on Options as Budget Deadline Nears","text":"As the Senate adjourned for its summer recess, members of Congress were divided on a plan to fund the federal government beyond Sept. 30 to avoid a shutdown. Both chambers of Congress must pass appropriations bills to fund the federal government after Sept. 30, when the 2025 fiscal year begins. Since March 23, when Congress completed the process for 2024 nearly six months late, the appropriations committees of the Senate and House of Representatives have separately drafted 12 spending bills funding different parts of the federal government—none of which have been passed by both chambers. Congress remains divided on the contents of these bills and, similarly, divided on the terms of a “continuing resolution” to avert a shutdown and give itself more time to act. “The whole appropriations process is broken,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a Senate Appropriations Committee member, told The Epoch Times. Sen. LaPhonza Butler (D-Calif.) said the Senate is behind on doing its work. “This fiscal year closes in two months. ... I’m not happy that we’re not on time,” she said. When Congress reconvenes on Sept. 9, it will be in session for just 12 days, during which time both houses must either pass the same versions of all 12 bills or a temporary “continuing resolution” to fund the government. One Senate bill, funding the Department of Homeland Security, was not marked up at all, owing to disagreements over funding for border security as well as for the Secret Service after the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on July 13. The Secret Service, by law, is responsible for Trump’s protection and has faced bipartisan criticism since the incident. “It’s just a complicated bill. We need some more time to finish the biggest issue: the Secret Service investment,” said Murphy, who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. “It takes a little while to figure out the border funding, which we still have got some work to do ... but the Secret Service piece was the biggest unfinished piece.” Many senators have called for greater funding for the Secret Service after the incident so it has more resources to secure protectees. “[They’re] filled with poison pills,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. Internal division within the House Republican conference led to one remaining bill, funding the Legislative Branch, being defeated on the floor after several Republicans voted against it. It also prevented the other six remaining bills from being considered for fear of being defeated. The House canceled its business after July 25, which has been widely attributed to the division on appropriations. “[There are] garbage amendments and things that are just funding a bunch of crazy stuff. That’s out of the context of what the original bill was supposed to be about,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), after voting against the Legislative Branch bill, told The Epoch Times. Back on the Senate side, some are confident the 12 bills can receive a floor vote in the 12 days before Sept. 30, despite the narrow timeline. “We'll have all those done before the end of the fiscal year,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.Va.). “Regular order has to be proceeded and followed here,” Manchin said, referring to the standard process of both houses passing 12 bills before the deadline. The last time Congress met that deadline was fiscal year 1997. In the House, Republicans and Democrats are divided on whether to use that cap or a higher threshold of $1.68 trillion. The higher cap includes alleged “side deals” in 2023 between Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and President Joe Biden during the FRA negotiations. No evidence of these deals exists—they are not mentioned in the text of the FRA—though House Democrats insist they were made and are binding. “We are not going to accept a dime less than the $1.681 [trillion] number that we all agreed upon,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told The Epoch Times on July 12. “The Republicans in the House right now are marking up appropriations bill[s] at $1.606 [trillion]. That means they are cutting $75 billion from their own agreement.” Jeffries claims that the lower $1.61 trillion cap would “adversely impact the health, the safety, and the economic well-being of the American people; hurt children, hurt seniors, hurt veterans, and hurt many others. It’s unacceptable.” House Republicans have dismissed the alleged side deals. By contrast, the Senate has a bipartisan agreement—to break the FRA caps and spend more money for both defense and nondefense purposes. “We have a good bipartisan agreement in the Senate which does go above last year’s [deal], to some extent, on both defense and nondefense. It’s something I would be supportive of,” Schumer told The Epoch Times. House Republicans, who have championed “fiscal responsibility,” are likely to oppose violating the FRA caps. It precludes an easy conferencing process. “The Senate needs to get a grip. We’re going to have to cut spending, and the bills that we’ve passed have been reasonable,” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wy.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Epoch Times. “I think we need to take a hard line on that.” CRs maintain funding for the government at levels set for the previous fiscal year and have typically lasted for several weeks. However, the CR’s possible time limit is causing divisions in Congress. Historically, Republicans have opposed CRs in favor of regular appropriations bills, but many now say they want a CR that runs into 2025—in the hope that they take control of the Senate and the White House. Such an outcome would position them to make more conservative changes to appropriations bills. “I'd rather [the CR] go clear into March in hopes that former President Trump wins the election and then has a chance to put his fingerprints on legislation,” Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy.) told The Epoch Times. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) seconded this, saying it would “probably be a good idea.” “I would at least pass a continuing resolution with the SAVE Act and go jam that down the Democrats’ throats,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), the policy chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, told The Epoch Times. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said he would also like to include the SAVE Act. “My preference would be a CR with save with the SAVE Act,” Lummis said. “That would be my first choice.” Other Republicans do not agree. “I would like a clean CR. That’s always the best way to go,” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told the Epoch Times. Democrats are unlikely to agree to the SAVE Act’s inclusion. Multiple congressional Democrats declined to tell The Epoch Times how long they wanted the CR to last. Frustration with the appropriations process has grown during the 118th Congress due to divisions between the Republican-led House and the Democratic-led Senate on issues in the process. Members complain that the current process make it impossible to complete the bills on time. “This is the new normal: that we all accept a continuing resolution and [unfinished] appropriations bills at the end of the year. We’ve got to fix this process at some point,” Murphy said. “It’s really, increasingly impossible for us to get this work done.” Johnson’s office did not respond to a request for comment before publication.","summary":"Legislators have no agreement on the content of spending bills, the total amount to be spent, or the terms of a continuing resolution to avert a shutdown.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/article/congress-divided-on-options-as-budget-deadline-nears-5698614","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/12/id5704533-Congress-Budget-Deadlines-5-2-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:41:50","author":"Arjun Singh","authors":["Arjun Singh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":253977154,"title":"We must fix the system which let a knifeman take three lives and leave so much hurt","text":"Lessons must be learned after mistakes left triple killer Valdo Calocane roaming the streets of Nottingham.

That began with a very unexpected return to social media giant X on Monday morning and will culminate with an interview with Elon Musk. The former president, having seen the presidential race reset due to Democratic Party elites shoving Joe Biden aside and coronating Kamala Harris, is hoping to retake the initiative. Part of that is going around the insanely biased national press that has been hyperventilating over Harris since she became the presumptive nominee. Sure, she’s one of the worst politicians in history, with a long record of failure, but have you considered she’s “brat” and once worked at McDonald’s? That’s been about the extent of the press coverage she’s received as an army of “journalists” have sought to “reintroduce” her to the public for the umpteenth time by profusely singing her praises. They’ve taken a decidedly different tact with Trump, though. On CNN, Axios reporter Sara Fischer complained that the former president might (gasp!) “say whatever he wants.” Axios’ @sarafischer: “@elonmusk will let Donald Trump speak all of the falsehoods & misinformation that he wants. I mean, he’s not a journalist … Does he want to be fact checking all the information? So I think it‘s just a platform for Trump to come out say whatever he wants.” pic.twitter.com/13w1MVzzGD— Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) August 12, 2024 FISCHER: Well, for one, I think it’s going to be a very light-hearted conversation. Because Elon Musk has come out and endorsed Donald Trump, I expect this a bromance type of an interview where they’re supporting each other. I think Elon Musk will let Donald Trump speak all the falsehoods and misinformation that he wants. I mean, he’s not a journalist, it’s not his job nor necessarily does he want to be fact-checking all the information. I think it’s just a platform for Donald Trump to say whatever he wants. But the thing to remember, Kasie, is that like, the interview audience here is what Donald Trump needs. You see JD Vance going on Face the Nation, Sunday Shows, traditional media because he needs to get his name out there. Donald Trump’s going the opposite route, he’s talking to streamers and podcasters. He’s going on X. He wants to rally up that sort of fringe online base. That’s what Donald Trump is doing here tonight. Woah, woah, woah. Donald Trump may “say whatever he wants?” What does he think this is? The United States of America? That entire exchange is just mind-numbing. Here we have supposed journalists fretting that someone might dare to exercise their right to free speech without the press overlords being consulted. I mean, Musk might not live “fact-check” Trump with incredibly obtuse and unfair characterizations. Oh, my heavens! Meanwhile, Kamala Harris has done zero interviews since successfully committing a coup against the sitting president and becoming the Democrat nominee without winning a single vote. Is CNN mad about the disrespect she’s showing them? Are they as worried about her taking no questions as they are about Trump taking questions from someone who doesn’t hate his guts? Of course, they aren’t. The self-righteousness of the press is nauseating. They truly believe they should be able to control the flow of information. Luckily, that’s not how it works anymore. Candidates for office can and will go around them to speak directly to the people. That’s far more interesting than seeing Dana Bash or Kasie Hunt gnash their teeth at statements they find politically inconvenient. Mainstream press interviews have their place, but they are no longer the pinnacle and are certainly no longer the only option.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump is in the midst of a strategy shift as the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN Extremely Upset About Donald Trump&#8217;s Conversation With Elon Musk first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/cnn-extremely-upset-about-donald-trumps-conversation-with-elon-musk/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-CNN-Gets-Supremely-Triggered-Over-Donald-Trump039s.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:34:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":253976948,"title":"Elon Musk claims 'massive DDoS attack' on X during Donald Trump interview","text":"Elon Musk claims a \"massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack\" on his social media platform X is affecting his interview with former president Donald Trump.

Funky hold music playing.” On Monday morning, Trump posted to X for the first time since Aug. 24, 2023, when he shared a picture of his mugshot after he was processed and released from an Atlanta jail in the aftermath of a state indictment over allegations he attempted to overturn Georgia’s 2020 election results. The 2 1/2-minute video post touted his first administration’s legacy before featuring media reports on Trump’s federal indictments and the FBI’s search at his Mar-a-Lago resort in August 2022. “They’re not coming after me. They’re coming after you, and I just happen to be standing in their way, and I will never be moving,” Trump is heard saying in the ad. “On Nov. 5, 2024, justice will be done.

Reporters, photographers and video journalists representing The Associated Press and other news organizations who either traveled with Vice President Harris or were on the airport tarmac documented the crowd size last Wednesday as she arrived on Air Force Two. Harris' campaign also denied the photo in question was manipulated and posted about it on social media. Fifteen thousand people attended the Detroit airport rally, Harris' campaign said. Harris and Walz spoke from inside a hangar where people were packed in. The crowd also spilled out onto the tarmac. The Wayne County Airport Authority, which oversees the airport, referred questions about the size of the crowd to Harris' campaign. Thousands of people have been showing up at her campaign rallies. By the Harris campaign’s count, 12,000 people turned out for rallies in Philadelphia and Eau Claire, Wisconsin, last week, followed by 15,000 in Glendale, Arizona. In Las Vegas on Saturday, more than 12,000 people were inside a university arena when law enforcement halted admission because people were getting ill waiting outside in the extreme 109-degree heat. About 4,000 people were waiting in line when the doors were closed. An Associated Press reporter who covered the Harris events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada, witnessed the throngs of people in attendance. Trump pushed his false claims in back-to-back posts on his social media site on Sunday. “Has anyone noticed that Kamala CHEATED at the airport? There was nobody at the plane, and she ‘A.I.’d’ it, and showed a massive 'crowd' of so-called followers, BUT THEY DIDN’T EXIST!.” he wrote. He included a post from another individual who made similar allegations about photo manipulation. A minute later Trump posted, “Look, we caught her with a fake ‘crowd.’ There was nobody there!\" He included a photo of the crowd that was partly shaded and partly exposed to the sun. Harris' campaign confirmed on Monday that the photo being questioned was taken by a staff member and was not in any way modified using AI. Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley, professor who focuses on digital forensics and misinformation, analyzed the photo using two models trained to detect patterns of generative AI and found no evidence of manipulation. The models were developed by GetReal Labs, a company Farid co-founded. Farid, responding Monday in an email, said he compared several versions of the photo and the only alteration he detected was some simple change to brightness or contrast, and perhaps sharpening. He said many other images and videos from the event last Wednesday show the same basic scene. Trump started pushing false theories about the Harris campaign photo a few days after he held a news conference at his Florida estate on Thursday and was asked about the crowds at his Democratic rival's rallies. Trump said no one draws crowds as big as he does. “I’ve spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,\" Trump claimed at the news conference, his first since Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee. He went on to falsely compare the crowd at his speech in front of the White House on Jan. 6, 2021, to the crowd at Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech on Aug. 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial. But King drew far more people. Approximately 250,000 people attended the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, at which King gave his speech, according to the National Park Service. The Associated Press reported in 2021 that there were at least 10,000 people at Trump’s address. Some of Trump’s top advisers and supporters have been urging the former president to focus his criticisms on Harris’ policies and talk more about the border and the economy. “Stop questioning the size of her crowds,” was the advice former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., offered during a Fox News appearance on Monday. The Harris campaign needled Trump on a variety of issues in an email Monday titled “9 Days Since Trump's Last Swing State Event.” The note included a bullet point that said, “he's very mad about crowd sizes, claiming it's all fake and AI-generated. (Maybe if he campaigned he'd get crowds too?)” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ron DeSantis to announce his now-scrapped presidential candidacy. The two were supposed to begin chatting at 8 pm on Spaces, as part of the site formally known as Twitter. However when the conversation was supposed to start, numerous users reported errors or said they could not get into the conversation. “Lmfao all of Spaces entirely broken,” one user posted. “Disastrous showing for Musk and frankly over the top second hand embarrassment for Trump.” “Elon is screwing trump with his crap spaces,” posted another. “Spaces never works when it matters.”“I am having issues connecting to the X Spaces with Trump and Elon Musk,” wrote a third. “I guess I am not the only one. The #WarRoom on #Rumble is also having issues.” In May 2023, DeSantis agreed to publicly launch his campaign with a webcast on X, the first 30 minutes of which treated listeners to an audio pastiche of feedback, garbled speech, and dropped connections. The audience dropped from an estimated 600,000 at the beginning, to 40,000 listeners, eventually making its way back up to around 100,000 people in total.

In an apparent attempt to ensure the setup doesn’t buckle similarly on Monday night, Musk earlier in the day posted on X, “Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight & tomorrow in advance of the conversation with @realDonaldTrump.” At 8:16 p.m. local time, the webcast had still not started.

One of former President Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign offices was burglarized over the weekend and police are looking for the suspect, authorities said Monday. The break-in took place on Sunday about 9 p.m. at Trump’s campaign office in Ashburn, Va., prompting deputies with the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office to respond to the scene, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Video surveillance footage captured the burglary suspect – a white adult male, wearing dark clothing, a dark baseball cap and a backpack – as he entered the office. “It is rare to have the office of any political campaign or party broken into,” said Loudoun County Sheriff Mike Chapman. “We are determined to identify the suspect, investigate why it happened, and determine what may have been taken as well as what may have been left behind,” he added. About 30 miles west of Washington, DC, the Trump campaign-leased office also serves as the headquarters of the Virginia 10th District Republican Committee – where Republican Mike Clancy is competing against Democrat Suhas Subramanyam in the congressional race for Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s (D-Va.) House seat. Wexton announced last year that she would not seek re-election after being diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder. While deputies are still investigating why the suspect broke into the office, the incident raised eyebrows for its rarity – and its eery similarity to the Watergate scandal. Former President Richard Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign had directed a break-in of the Democratic National Committee’s then-headquarters in Washington, DC’s Watergate Office Building. It comes after the Trump campaign on Saturday accused Iran of hacking into its website after Politico reported that it had received anonymous emails that included internal documents related to the vetting of Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) – who was tapped as Trump’s running mate last month. The Trump campaign did not respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Video surveillance footage captured the burglary suspect –  a white adult male, wearing dark clothing, a dark baseball cap and a backpack – as he entered the office.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/12/us-news/virginia-police-looking-for-suspect-who-burglarized-trump-campaign-office/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/republican-presidential-nominee-former-president-87694544.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uPo1sPwM-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:19:42","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.47},{"id":253976844,"title":"Trump and his allies once cheered hacked materials. No longer, now that they say he’s a target","text":"Donald Trump was once a cheerleader of publicizing hacked materials. “Russia, if you’re listening,” Trump said during a press conference in his 2016 presidential run, when Hillary Clinton’s deleted personal emails were a hot topic, “I hope you are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,” he said back then. That changed when Trump’s latest presidential campaign declared this weekend it had been hacked by Iran. “Any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of America’s enemies and doing exactly what they want,” Steven Cheung, the campaign’s communications director, said in a statement on Saturday announcing that the campaign had been hacked. The campaign has not responded to questions about why its view on hacking changed, including a query on Monday from The Associated Press. But its new position is a striking change from 2016, when Trump heartily embraced the Russian hacking of his opponent Clinton’s aides and the Democratic National Committee. The current hack, so far, is murky. On Friday, Microsoft issued a report stating that Iranian hackers tried to penetrate the account of an official with one of the presidential campaigns, but did not disclose additional details. On Saturday, the Trump campaign announced it had been hacked, though it also did not identify the individual whose account was breached. It did so after Politico said it had been contacted by an unknown source peddling what was represented to be internal documents from the campaign. Iran has denied being involved in any hack. The U.S. government has not confirmed that any breach has occurred. On Monday, the FBI said in a statement it was investigating the matter. In 2016, intelligence officials said Russian hackers obtained thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the personal account of Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. The initial batches came out in the summer, as Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination. That was when Trump encouraged Russia to find his rival’s personal emails. He later argued he was joking. The hacked material was released through third parties, including the online site Wikileaks, which began to publish daily tranches of Democratic documents in October, just after a videotape of Trump bragging about how he’d sexually assaulted women was disclosed. Trump routinely touted the Democratic leaks at his campaign rallies, including declaring at one: “I love Wikileaks.” The leaked documents received ample news coverage, and Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book “Cyberwar” on the 2016 hacking, said she found that coverage was what won the election for Trump. “2016 was not an instance of which journalists should be proud,” Jamieson said in an interview Monday, adding that the greatest question is how news organizations apply their standards to whatever material finds itself in the public domain. “That Trump is saying what is electorally convenient is not a surprise,” Jamieson said. “This is not a person for whom inconsistency is a concern.” Nick Merrill was a spokesman for Clinton’s 2016 campaign and pushed back against publication of the hacked documents at the time. On Monday, he noted the Trump campaign was in a similar role this time. “In addition to the characteristic hypocrisy, they just spent three weeks trying to explain they’re not weird,” Merrill said via text. “And I’d imagine that sharing their internal correspondence is going to help dispel that notion.” Asked if that meant he now thought hacked materials should be published, Merrill replied: “A precedent has been set here. I’m not passing judgment on it.”","summary":"Donald Trump has changed his position on whether a presidential campaign's hacked materials should be published.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/12/trump-and-his-allies-once-cheered-hacked-materials-no-longer-now-that-they-say-hes-a-target/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Election_2024_Trump_63183_7731aa-1723508522.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:19:15","author":"Nicholas Riccardi,NICHOLAS RICCARDI - Associated Press","authors":["Nicholas Riccardi","NICHOLAS RICCARDI - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.239},{"id":253976852,"title":"Former Colorado clerk Tina Peters, hero to election deniers, convicted in election computer breach","text":"DENVER — Former Colorado clerk Tina Peters, a hero to election deniers, was found guilty by a jury on most charges Monday in a breach of her county’s election computer system. Peters was accused of using someone else’s security badge to give an expert affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell access to the Mesa County election system. Prosecutors said she was seeking fame and became “fixated” on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results. The case marked the first prosecution of a local election official over a suspected security breach amid the conspiracy theories that swirled around the 2020 election. It heightened concerns over potential insider threats, in which rogue election workers sympathetic to partisan lies could use their access and knowledge to launch an attack from within. Peters was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. She was found not guilty of identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and one count of criminal impersonation. The verdict came hours after prosecutors urged jurors to convict Peters, saying she deceived government employees so she could work with outsiders affiliated with Lindell, one of the nation’s most prominent election conspiracy theorists. In closing trial arguments, prosecutor Janet Drake argued that the former clerk allowed a man posing as a county employee to take images of the election system’s hard drive before and after a software upgrade in May 2021. Drake said Peters observed the update so she could become the “hero” and appear at Lindell’s symposium on the 2020 presidential election a few months later. Lindell is a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Donald Trump. “The defendant was a fox guarding the henhouse. It was her job to protect the election equipment, and she turned on it and used her power for her own advantage,” said Drake, a lawyer from the Colorado Attorney General’s Office. Drake has been working for the district attorney in Mesa County, a largely Republican county near the Utah border, to prosecute the case. Before jurors had begun deliberating Monday, the defense told them that Peters had not committed any crimes and only wanted to preserve election records after the county would not allow her to have one of its technology experts present at the software update. Defense lawyer John Case said Peters had to preserve records to access the voting system to find out things like whether anyone from “China or Canada” had accessed the machine while ballots were being counted. “And thank God she did. Otherwise we really wouldn’t know what happened,” he said. Peters allowed a former surfer affiliated with Lindell, Conan Hayes, to observe the software update and make copies of the hard drive using the security badge of a local man, Gerald Wood, who Peters said worked for her. But while prosecutors say Peters committed identity theft by taking Wood’s security badge and giving it to Hayes to conceal his identity, the defense says Wood was in on the scheme so Peters did not commit a crime by doing that. Wood denied that when he testified during the trial. Political activist Sherronna Bishop, who helped introduce Peters to people working with Lindell, testified that Wood knew his identity would be used based on a Signal chat between her, Wood and Peters. No agreement was spelled out in the chat. The day after the first image of the hard drive was taken, Bishop testified that she posted a voice recording in the chat. The content of that recording was not included in screenshots of the chat introduced by the defense. The person identified as Wood responded to that unknown message by saying “I was glad to help out. I do hope the effort proved fruitful,” according to the screenshots. Prosecutor Robert Shapiro told jurors that Bishop was not credible.","summary":"Peters was accused of using someone else’s security badge to give an expert affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell access to the Mesa County election system.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/12/former-colorado-clerk-tina-peters-hero-to-election-deniers-convicted-in-election-computer-breach/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Election_Security-Colorado_Clerk_59246_6411cf-1723508543.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:16:29","author":"Colleen Slevin,COLLEEN SLEVIN - Associated Press","authors":["Colleen Slevin","COLLEEN SLEVIN - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.622},{"id":253976334,"title":"Live: Glitches Hit Start Of Elon Musk's Interview With Donald Trump","text":"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is interviewing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network today.

Musk, one of the Democrats' fiercest critics, endorsed Trump last month just minutes after the Republican narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a rally.","summary":"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is interviewing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network today.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/elon-musk-interviews-donald-trump-on-x-6323844","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/oite1dg8_elon-musktrump-reuters_625x300_12_August_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:16:00","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":253976252,"title":"Is Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal About to Dump Trump?","text":"Rupert Murdoch is not happy with Donald Trump. Murdoch has not said this in interviews, but—as is his wont—through the front pages and editorial columns of the newspapers he owns. While neither the Wall Street Journal nor New York Post has yet to fully jettison their support of Trump, they have effectively channeled Murdoch's discontent at how Trump is running his campaign against Kamala Harris through august, high-minded sermonizing in the WSJ and screaming front-page headlines in the Post. “The Trump of the past few weeks has looked and sounded more or less exactly like the Trump of nine years ago,” Journal editor-at-large Gerard Baker wrote in a column on Monday. “This is the problem. It is this Mr. Trump who lost the presidency in 2020. It is this Mr. Trump who lost the House in 2018 and the Senate in the Georgia runoff election in January 2021.” The Post’s editorial board also had an aggressive editorial grace the front page of Monday’s issue that framed Harris as a progressive masking herself as a centrist. “KAMA KAMELEON” adorned the front page, backed by a split image of Harris in dueling colors. When combined, the pieces seemingly represent Murdoch’s frustration with how the Trump campaign has floundered recent weeks, from its pick of Sen. JD Vance as his running mate against his wishes to Trump’s continued belligerent complaints to his inability to land on a clear message to combat against her ascendant campaign. As Trump has spent weeks defining Harris’ presidential candidacy through racist attacks and baseless crowd conspiracies, it has been left to the two newspapers to vocalize what Murdoch and his editors see as the policy and personality contrasts between the two that the billionaire media mogul would dearly love Trump to major on beyond his relentless, vicious, mad-sounding attacks. If Fox News has, for now at least, stayed fully signed up to the Trump train, the two leading Murdoch newspaper titles in the U.S. are sounding their own passenger alarms. “Trump Meets Half the Moment in His RNC Speech,” read the headline on a Journal editorial board piece hours after the speech. Since then, The Journal’s editorial board has published almost daily pieces on various policy positions of Harris’, almost crafting talking point memos for the GOP to seize on. One on Sunday attacked her reversal on single-payer healthcare, while a Thursday editorial questioned her bona fides as a potential commander-in-chief. Others have also targeted her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “Donald Trump often shoots from the hip on these subjects, and his favorable comments about dictators are witless,” read Thursday’s Harris piece. “But his first-term record, especially on Iran and the Middle East, is far stronger than the Biden-Harris performance. Americans shouldn’t have to read tea leaves to figure out if Ms. Harris would keep the country safe in a treacherous world.” (The Daily Beast has reached out to the Journal and New York Post for comment.) Its continued commentary on the election reflects how Murdoch has operated his papers and exercised his political muscle in the past, both in the U.S. and abroad. Murdoch is infamous for calling his editors almost daily, and when he vehemently opposed Trump’s pick of Vance last month, he reportedly dispatched Post columnists and executives to meet with Trump and urge him to consider someone else. But Trump stood firm, and Vance got the job. Murdoch’s U.K. tabloid The Sun was also notorious for making or breaking British elections, gleefully admitting in a front-page headline it aided in the 1992 election of the Conservative Party. (Murdoch later claimed he found the headline “tasteless.”) It’s also credited with the election of Labour leader Tony Blair in 1997 after a 20-year streak of supporting the Tories, endorsing him through his 2005 election before reverting to its conservative roots. The paper eventually, and surprisingly, returned to the Labour Party and endorsed Keir Starmer in last month’s election, which he won. The conservative-leaning Journal editorial board has never appeared eager to anoint Trump, with its November 2022 editorial titled “Trump Is the Republican Party’s Biggest Loser,” following Republicans’ razor-thin midterm wins that cycle, serving as a prime example of its frustration toward his temperament. Yet the paper has still oscillated between defending (and advising) Trump and attacking President Joe Biden. It’s a reflection of Murdoch’s own views on the former president, a man he regarded in emails revealed by the Fox-Dominion case as going “increasingly mad” over his 2020 election loss and who Murdoch predicted would become “irrelevant” following the 2020 election. The Fox-Dominion case only ever arose because Murdoch’s TV mouthpiece, Fox News, regurgitated the former president’s claims of a stolen election, costing the network $787 million. Author Michael Wolff reported in his book last year, The Fall: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty, that Murdoch even and often wished Trump were dead. “Trump’s death became a Murdoch theme: ‘We would all be better off …?’ ‘This would all be solved if …’ ‘How could he still be alive, how could he?’ ‘Have you seen him? Have you seen what he looks like? What he eats?’” according to the book. Still, the two appeared to have mended their post-election hostilities. Trump told podcast hosts Clay Travis and Buck Sexton that he and Murdoch speak “a lot,” and Murdoch made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention last month. “He’s 100 percent sharp—he’s as sharp as a tack,” Trump told the hosts. Murdoch likely hopes Trump means those words, if the advice his Journal editorial board has offered Trump and Republicans is any indication: “The former President will have to make a case on policy, rather than personal insults, and that isn’t his strength,” read a July 24 editorial. “The economic and security fundamentals still favor Mr. Trump, but this is now a competitive race.” Whether Trump heeds it, however, is another matter. On Saturday, new New York Times polls showed Harris leading Trump in multiple swing states. On Saturday, Trump called Harris a “RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.” If Trump carries on like this, who knows—Murdoch may feel, as the campaign enters its dying days, to do what he did in Britain, and turn his back on the leading right-wing candidate and support Harris. That stated support written in either or both outlets—one totemic for the business community, the other for New York—would not only represent an emphatic rejection of Trump by two communities whose approval Trump so desires, it would be from a mogul whose audiences he has courted so ferociously and effectively. Perhaps Trump—in his pick of Vance, despite Murdoch’s antipathy—has made his own calculations about what he does and does not need from Murdoch. Certainly Murdoch’s influence in British politics, while still undoubtedly strong, has waned in recent years as people source their media from less-traditional sources. Regardless, this presidential election is not just the battle of Harris and Trump, but a reckoning for two powerful men who find themselves yoked together—the best of frenemies.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/GettyRupert Murdoch is not happy with Donald Trump.

Eight-time Oscar-nominee, near EGOT inductee, and Hillbilly Elegy star Glenn Close has taken a subtle but sharp shot at vice presidential candidate and Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance on social media. In an Instagram post Sunday, Close posted a smiling picture with her striking gray Abyssinian cat with the caption, \"Eve would have left a bleeding mouse head in the bed of anyone who criticized any kind of lady with a CAT!\" The comment leaves little room for interpretation beyond being a direct response to Vance's widely condemned 2021 remarks on Tucker Carlson Tonight that \"we're effectively run in this country, via the Democrats, via the corporate oligarchs, by a bunch of childless cat ladies, who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made.\" Those remarks were made in the lead-up to Vance's successful 2022 bid for an Ohio U.S. Senate seat. If they were controversial then, they've become nuclear since resurfacing in the wake of former President Donald Trump tapping Vance as his VP pick. A multitude of stars have condemned Vance's comments, from Jennifer Aniston (\"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States\") to Whoopi Goldberg (\"How dare you. Women? You heard how he thinks of you\"). Close's comment, though veiled, hits a little harder than the average Hollywood star's. Close starred in Netflix's 2020 adaptation of Vance's memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, playing his grandmother, Bonnie \"Mamaw\" Vance. She received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for the role, which included a complete physical transformation and Appalachian accent. (Entertainment Weekly has reached out to representatives for Close for further comment regarding her Instagram post.) Of the film's core cast and crew, only director Ron Howard has spoken directly about Vance since his political ascent, expressing \"surprise\" in a 2022 Variety interview that Vance had embraced Trump. \"He struck me as a very moderate center-right kind of guy,\" Howard said, adding that he recalled Vance saying he \"didn’t care for Trump\" when the film was in production between 2017 and 2018. In her Instagram post, Close didn't outright criticize Vance, and left her connection to the politician unsaid. But her position on his views is unmistakably clear. Hillbilly Elegy surged in viewership more than 1,100% on Netflix after Trump selected Vance as his running mate. Harper Collins, the publisher of Vance's memoir, told the AP the company was \"printing hundreds of thousands of copies to fill the demand\" caused by the announcement. Close is known for being remarkably candid on Instagram for a star of her stature. Time will tell if this is as far as the Fatal Attraction star goes in her criticism of Vance, or if it's just a warning shot.","summary":"The eight-time Oscar nominee posted a not-so-subtle diss on Instagram directed toward &#34;anyone who criticized any kind of lady with a CAT!&#34;","url":"https://ew.com/hillbilly-elegy-star-glenn-close-takes-subtle-jab-jd-vance-8694275","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/FCzhNTdv964Oi3za382HdtDA5iE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/glenn-close-Hillbilly-Elegy-jd-vance-081224-0d3bce9a61c8492289c143c73150caf5.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/zl7NCsI9-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-13 00:03:15","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.091},{"id":253976126,"title":"Trump’s ‘interview of the century’ with Elon Musk: LIVE UPDATES","text":"Former US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk sat down for a free-flowing interview on Musk’s X platform on Monday.

The former president said on Saturday that Microsoft had informed his campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. Trump said Iran was “only able to get publicly available information”. “We can confirm the FBI is investigating the matter,” the FBI said in a statement on Monday, but it did not name Trump or Iran. The Iranian government has denied that it hacked the Trump campaign. The FBI is also investigating an alleged hack targeting advisers to the campaign of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The FBI began the investigation in June, when Mr Biden was still running for president, suspecting that Iran was behind the attempts to steal data from two US presidential campaigns, the newspaper said, citing sources. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The participants in “America in One Room: The Youth Vote,” an event organized by Stanford political scientists and other sponsors, included Kendall Rene Martin, who will be 18 in November, a Democrat from California; Tyler Kunkowski, 18, a Republican from Florida; Emily Criswell, 18, who leans left, from rural Tennessee; and Steven Dilts, 19, who also leans left, from Alaska. After the four-day event, a poll of these first-time voters released on Monday found that in those four days they moved closer together on contentious issues, developed more respect of differing views and became more committed voters after the days of dialogue. The gathering was a so-called deliberative poll where the participants were randomly selected to produce a representative sample of young voters from the entire nation. The purpose was to discuss the issues, hear from policy experts and foster a better conversation on American politics. There have been past “America in One Room” studies of the general electorate, but this was the first to specifically examine first-time young voters. “We are doing democracy here, and it’s actually working,” said Henry Elkus, founder and CEO of Helena, one of the gathering’s other organizers and partners. “I don’t see any ad-hominem attacks. I don’t see division in the way it’s shown on our TV screen. And I don’t see a representation of politics that the media.” “I see actual working democracy,” Elkus added. “And this is the generation that will define that.” The gathering took place one week after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and in the midst of President Joe Biden’s departure from the 2024 race. But the aim was to discuss the issues, not the candidates. “When the candidate goes away, you have to confront the issue,” Elkus said. ‘I agree with that’: Moving closer on contentious issues The first-time voters spent one weekend discussing issues like the environment, the economy and health care in small breakout groups. They heard from policy experts from across the ideological spectrum, toured the monuments in the nation’s capital and even attended a Major League Baseball game. And the young voters moved closer together on several contentious issues — both from the right and left — according to results from the poll conducted before and after the gathering. On climate and energy, for example, the share of first-time voters who believed the United States should achieve energy independence grew, from 62% before the gathering to 76% afterward. The share of participants who opposed eliminating the sale of new gas- and diesel-powered automobiles by 2035 increased, from 45% before to 59% afterward. And the portion of young voters who opposed drilling in the Artic wilderness increased, from 72% before to 76% afterward. “Living in the Arctic wilderness, I am very against this,” said Steven, the young voter from Alaska, during one of the breakout sessions on the environment. Tyler, the Republican from Florida, said he believed in climate change but voiced skepticism about the feasibility of international accords like the Paris climate agreement. He added that he would support drilling in the Arctic only in case of a national emergency like a war. “I agree with that,” Steven replied. At the end of the discussion, Steven remarked, “I am surprised everyone in this room agrees this is an issue,” referring to the broader topic of combatting climate change. “It is harder to insult somebody to their face because we want to be liked. Humans are inherently good,” concluded Elkus, one of the organizers. “Online discourse, comments sections — it allows us to be inhuman.” “This is a human process. Democracy requires human interaction. And that’s what we’re doing here,” he said. ‘I see that point’: Young voters gain more respect for differing views The polling results also showed these young voters gaining more respect for differing viewpoints, with the share of participants saying their opponents had good reasons for their positions growing from 64% before the event to 71% afterward. During a breakout discussion on whether to increase the minimum wage, Tyler argued that a college-educated bank worker shouldn’t earn the same wage as an employee at McDonald’s. Emily, from rural Tennessee, disagreed: “This is not an attack on you,” she said. “Not everybody can go to college.” Tyler countered that a college degree is an investment for future higher wages. “I see that point,” Emily replied. “But you don’t have to go to college to be successful.” “The people who came to ‘America in One Room’ were very well-versed in politics and all had a lot of knowledge of what they spoke about, so I valued and respected every single one of their opinions,” Tyler said in a follow-up interview with NBC News. “To my surprise, there wasn’t a moment of hostility, despite tense discussions,” said Kendall, the Democrat from California. “Being in that environment gave me so much hope for the future of our country and inspired me to educate myself even more.” ‘I left with an even stronger passion to vote’ The before-and-after poll of the assembled young voters also showed a stronger satisfaction with American democracy. Before the gathering, 29% said they were somewhat or very satisfied with the way in which democracy is working in the United States. That doubled to 58% after the event. And the researchers behind the “America in One Room” deliberations also found the participants became more committed to voting, compared with a control group of young voters who didn’t attend the gathering in D.C. “I left with an even stronger passion to vote and speak up about current and social issues,” said Kendall of California. “They came from all over the country — red states, blue states, urban and rural,” said James Fishkin, the Stanford political scientist who pioneered these deliberative “America in One Room” experiments. “Yet their divisions are not intractable,” he added. “And instead of triggering each other, they listened respectfully and saw the merits of what was said by those they most strongly disagreed with.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — In the heat of the 2024 campaign season, more than&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Young Voters Emphasize Civility over Divisiveness first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/young-voters-emphasize-civility-over-divisiveness/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Young-voters-focus-on-being-polite-rather.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:36:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.13},{"id":253975242,"title":"Republican campaign arm cancels more than $700,000 in ads for Ohio Senate race","text":"The National Republican Senatorial Committee canceled its fall cable ad reservations totaling more than $700,000 in the Ohio Senate race. According to AdImpact, NRSC canceled its full cable reservation in one of the most competitive races in the country in which ads were set to run between Aug. 31 and Election Day. The ads were to benefit GOP candidate Bernie Moreno and hurt incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). The campaign committee had already been relying on support from allied super PACs that will continue to pour money into the race. The Senate Leadership Fund, the committee’s largest allied super PAC and its affiliated subsidiaries have rolled out millions in ad buys in battleground states across the country. “These dollars can be spent more efficiently via hybrid advertisements, which get the candidate rate. NRSC is relying on SLF and other outside groups to carry the super PAC message in Ohio and Montana,” said a source familiar with the NRSC strategy. The Senate campaign arm emphasized Ohio is still a top pickup opportunity. “Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s historical unpopularity in Ohio means advertising dollars can be spent more efficiently as hybrid ads,” they wrote in a post on X. “Ohio remains a top pickup opportunity for Senate Republicans and NRSC will continue to invest accordingly.” NRSC had already taken a similar approach in Montana, where outside PACs had already booked airtime. In Pennsylvania, the Keystone Renewal PAC had booked millions of ads for GOP candidate Dave McCormick and another super PAC is prepared to spend on behalf of Republican Larry Hogan in Maryland. The Ohio race has become 2024’s first non-presidential race to exceed $300 million in spending, and it’s also one of the most expensive races that the political ad tracking firm has seen. Before NRSC pulled their advertising spending, Ohio was the only state in which Republicans had been outspending Democrats on campaign ads, where they were slated to spend $158.4 million compared to $152 million from Democrats. However, now Democrats have spent more in future advertising slated in the state, with $86.2 million in future ads compared to Republicans’ $83.3 million. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Brown (D-OH) is polling better than his Republican challenger while former President Donald Trump has a much larger lead in the same state. In an average of polling, Brown is outpacing Moreno by five points. The majority of the ad cash is coming in from outside groups such as the Democratic Duty and Honor group, which invested $28.7 million and represents 51% of Democratic spending, while the Republican group One Nation spent $27.6 million, which represents 82% of Republican spending. Meanwhile, the Brown campaign has spent $27.6 million, compared to Moreno’s $875,000.","summary":"The National Republican Senatorial Committee canceled its fall cable ad reservations totaling more than $700,000 in the Ohio Senate race.

Earlier this year, in February, when asked by @WeStand4USA, \"Ann Coulter has been right about Trump in the past. I'd love to hear what he needs to do, in her opinion to help us take America back,\" Coulter did not hesitate to respond with a grim suggestion — “Maybe he could die?” The stark comment was a far cry from the enthusiastic support Coulter showed Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign. At that time, Coulter was among the loudest voices in conservative media backing Trump, even penning the 2016 book In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome! to endorse him. Her support was rooted in Trump’s hardline immigration policies, particularly his promises to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and to deport undocumented immigrants. However, as Trump’s presidency progressed, Coulter’s enthusiasm waned. She became increasingly disillusioned, particularly over what she perceived as Trump’s failure to deliver on his immigration promises. The wall, which was supposed to be a fundamental piece of his presidency, remained incomplete, and his administration’s policies on issues like the DREAM Act left her feeling betrayed. By 2018, Coulter had publicly turned against Trump, declaring herself a 'former Trumper.' Coulter’s disdain for Trump has only intensified since then. She has consistently criticized him for what she sees as his weak stance on immigration, calling him the 'biggest wimp ever to serve.' Additionally, she described him as a 'gigantic baby' who 'can barely speak English.' She further argued, “The only reason he crushed in 2016 is because of immigration – the wall, deport illegal immigrants, the [Muslim] travel ban,” The Independent reported. Interestingly, Coulter’s shift in loyalty has not led her to fully endorse another candidate in the GOP primaries. She has praised Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for his conservative policies. However, DeSantis, once Trump’s rival has since dropped out of the race. Coulter, meanwhile, has continued to target Trump. She exclaimed, “Trump won’t close the border. He’ll push for amnesty, allow anchor babies and sanctuary cities to continue, ban bump stocks, propose taking guns away without due process, and hire half of Goldman Sachs…The presidential election is worthless. Concentrate on the House and Senate.” However, to everyone's surprise, yet again, she recently assured she would vote for him. On Sunday, Coulter explained, \"If he loses he will be running again in four years, and then he will have lost four successive elections for us. Truthfully, I really like his choice of JD Vance, which I recommended back in May,” she continued. “Can’t trust Trump as far as I can throw him, but I do trust JD Vance to care about the left behind people,” as reported by The Hill. Talking about her book, she once claimed that Trump had gone ahead from what the book talked about. She remarked, “I wish Republican politicians would read it. I gave a copy to some of my favorite Republicans. I do think the 2016 Trump campaign...it was one of the greatest campaigns in world history– in part because it really changed the Republican Party to a party I preferred.”","summary":"Coulter said, “He’ll push for amnesty, allow anchor babies and sanctuary cities to continue, ban bump stocks, propose taking guns away...”","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/why-ann-coulter-said-the-best-thing-donald-trump-could-do-for-america-was-to-die","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/710277/uploads/fa0d4c30-5878-11ef-b478-4d0c8f1ef6de_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:30:01","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":253975226,"title":"Top Republicans Urge Trump to Cease Campaign Strategy as Kamala Gains Momentum: ‘Causing Frustration’","text":"Several top Republicans sounded the alarm on Donald Trump’s campaign strategy – including one who said his ‘head is exploding’ – as Kamala Harris continues to take momentum. Former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said that Trump has to focus on Harris’ record rather than the number of people attending her rallies. McCarthy told Fox News: ‘It’s going to be a race, and you’ve got to make this race not on personalities. Stop questioning the size of her crowds and start questioning her position when it comes to what did she do as attorney general on crime!’ He called Harris ‘a perfect person to run against’ and ‘made a wrong pick when it came to VP’ and as long as Trump can focus on that, he will be back in the race. The ex-California Congressman wasn’t alone, however, as Trump’s former advisor Peter Navarro had a similar critique of the race the former president has run since Joe Biden dropped out. ‘He needs votes, and the current rally formula is simply not sufficiently focused on the very stark policy differences — policy differences — between him and Kamala Harris that will swing voters in key battleground states, he told Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast. Navarro, who spent time in prison for his role in the January 6 insurrection, said that instead, Trump attacks Harris ‘personally’ and says her ‘support among swing voters rises, particularly among women’ when he does. ‘It’s just a fact of life, right now’. Frank Luntz, dubbed ‘the Nostradamus of pollsters’, continued a media tour that has had him pulling the fire alarm over Trump’s campaign this past week. Luntz – who has said that Harris is now favored to win – repeated his message from over the weekend that Trump has lost message discipline. He claimed that the campaign needs to be about issues and not attributes. ‘If it’s about attributes, Harris is much more likely to be successful because, quite frankly, people like her more than they like him. It’s something that if he’s watching this right now, his head is exploding and that’s part of the problem,’ he told CNN. Luntz added: ‘He has lost touch with the people that he needs and she is in perfect touch’. Trump was the red-hot favorite last month when he triumphantly appeared at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee after being shot in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. But after Harris took over from Biden, the liberal media has gone full-swing behind her campaign and she has seized momentum. The latest polling average from Real Clear Politics shows that Harris has a half-point lead over Trump. In the betting averages that lead is higher at 5.8 percentage points. In one recent example, Harris was more trusted on the economy than Trump – marking a big shift in voter sentiment following Biden’s decision to drop out. The survey, for the Financial Times and the Ross School of Business, found that Harris had a 1-point advantage. It is the first time a Democrat presidential candidate has led Trump on the economy since the poll started tracking voter sentiment on the issue almost a year ago. Another poll by New York Times / Siena College last week found that Harris has moved ahead in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Among likely voters in each state, 50 percent said they would likely vote for Harris while 46 for Trump. Donors are worried about Trump’s recent strategy, according to The New York Times. At an August 2 dinner in The Hamptons, Trump’s big backers hoped he would ‘signal that he was recalibrating after a series of damaging mistakes.’ But he discussed his ‘stop the steal’ claims about the election being rigged in 2020 which advisers have reportedly told him to drop. The former president last night risked sparking further concern by falsely claiming that his Democratic opponent had doctored an image of the crowd at her rally last week in Detroit. Republican sources told Axios over the weekend that the former president is ‘struggling to get past his anger.’ The Trump campaign has considered many options to boost the president’s efforts, including the return of iconic campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, with the backing of both Melania and Lara Trump. The 2024 Trump campaign has suffered from a triple blow of vice presidential nominee JD Vance’s poor reception from the public, Harris’ ‘honeymoon period’ as she jumps into the race and a similar effect on her choice of running mate Tim Walz. Now, what had appeared to be a coronation of Trump for a return to the White House over Biden has turned into a neck-and-neck race, with Harris beginning to take a lead in the polls. However, the ‘honeymoon phase’ of both Harris’ campaign and Walz’s announcement appears to be ending with claims of ‘stolen valor’ over the Minnesota governor’s military service. Biden himself finally admitted Sunday that he dropped out of the race because the polling between himself and Trump was so dire that it threatened to wipe out Democrats up and down the ticket.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSeveral top Republicans sounded the alarm on Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign strategy &#8211;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Top Republicans Urge Trump to Cease Campaign Strategy as Kamala Gains Momentum: &#8216;Causing Frustration&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/top-republicans-urge-trump-to-cease-campaign-strategy-as-kamala-gains-momentum-causing-frustration/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/12/23/88458297-13736981-Former_Speaker_of_the_House_Kevin_McCarthy_said_that_Trump_has_t-m-7_1723502597278.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:29:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.371},{"id":253975302,"title":"Harris Is Now the Betting Favorite To Win 2024 Election","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is now the favorite to win the 2024 presidential election, according to several online betting markets. Bet365, an online sports book based in the UK, announced on Monday that Harris had pulled ahead of former President Donald Trump for the first time since President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign. According to the company, Trump’s lead began slipping after his controversial interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in July, where he openly questioned Harris’ racial identity. Bet365 put Harris’ odds at 11-8 before the conference, but she has since reduced that difference to just 4-5. “Having been a comfortable favourite a few weeks ago when Joe Biden looked increasingly unsuitable for office, the Trump campaign now seems to be spiraling,” Bet365 wrote in a press release chronicling the development. Trump’s odds of winning remain even, the company added. Harris has also enjoyed a widening lead in many of the major online predictive markets. As of Monday evening, Harris was ahead of Trump by five points on Polymarket. The company, which bills itself as the largest prediction market in the world, saw a record number of bets placed on the 2024 election over the course of July, Bloomberg reported. More than $577 million has been staked on the 2024 election, as of August 12. In June, Trump had a comfortable lead over his Democratic rival, then President Biden, on the Polymarket book. His lead peaked at a 72% chance of winning the election on July 16—in the middle of the Republican National Convention and only three days after the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania. Harris’ lead was even higher on the New Zealand-based PredictIt, which gave her a 59% chance compared to a 44% chance for Trump. These odds were posted before Trump’s primetime interview with Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk on Monday night. It is unclear if this highly anticipated interview will affect the betting markets in any way.","summary":"Montinique Monroe/Getty ImagesVice President Kamala Harris is now the favorite to win the 2024 presidential election, according to several online betting markets.\n\nBet365, an online sports book based in the UK, announced on Monday that Harris had pulled ahead of former President Donald Trump for the first time since President Joe Biden suspended his reelection campaign.\n\nAccording to the company, Trump’s lead began slipping after his controversial interview at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in July, where he openly questioned Harris’ racial identity.

County records reviewed by the Associated Press (AP) found that the defendant was a Republican when he registered to vote from his Lighthouse Point residence.In February 2020, investigators say that Pulley maintained his home address in both Montgomery and Broward Counties and filled out an application to vote in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, by using false information about his residency, previous address and Social Security number.Pulley is accused of applying for a mail ballot in Philadelphia County in October 2020 ahead of the general election, where President Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump. The defendant also reportedly applied and submitted an absentee ballot in Broward County that same election cycle and voted in person in Montgomery County on or about Election Day on November 3, 2020. Court documents say that Pulley voted for president and vice president on all three occasions.Investigators claim that Pulley also cast a vote during the 2022 midterm election in all three counties, which included voting twice for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania that year.The charges against the defendant carry a maximum possible prison sentence of five years, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Eastern Pennsylvania. Possible punishment could also include up to three years of supervised release, a $10,000 to $250,000 fine and a $100 special assessment.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nancy Potts and Mark Dubnoff are prosecuting the case.

Key Background The Trump campaign did not provide any evidence that Iran was behind the attack, but cited a report from Microsoft released last Friday that said Iranian hackers “sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign.” Iran’s mission to the United Nations denied being involved in the hack to the Associated Press, and the U.S. has not publicly accused Iran of hacking Trump’s campaign. However, Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, warned in July that “Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts, seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions.” Microsoft’s report last week seemed to have similar findings, saying it had seen “the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors” over the past several months.

The investigation includes attempted hacks targeting three Biden-Harris campaign staffers, as well as Roger Stone, a former adviser to former President Donald Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Washington Post first reported that attempted hacks of Biden-Harris staffers and Stone were part of the FBI investigation. A Harris campaign official told NBC News that it did not appear to be a victim. “Our campaign vigilantly monitors and protects against cyber threats, and we are not aware of any security breaches of our systems,” the official said. It is not clear whether the targeting of the Biden staffers was successful, the source said. Stone told the Post he had been informed by authorities his email had been compromised. Politico, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported over the weekend that they had received seemingly authentic files stolen from the Trump campaign. A Trump campaign spokesperson said Saturday that it had been hacked in June. NBC News has not received any of the purported files. The FBI has not released any other information or characterized what hack, if any, happened. The Trump campaign has claimed that the files were part of an Iranian hacking operation that Microsoft announced Friday, citing the report as evidence. Microsoft has declined to comment, citing its policy of not sharing customer details without permission. The company does share such details if a customer formally asks it to do so, a spokesperson told NBC News. The Trump campaign did not respond to an email asking it to clarify whether it had authorized Microsoft or any federal agency to speak publicly about the hack. Iran’s representative to the United Nations has denied that the country was behind the hack. Cybersecurity and election security experts have consistently warned that foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections could include such “hack and leak” attacks, in which private systems are compromised to steal and later leak sensitive information. Hack-and-leak attacks have hit many elections around the world, most notably the U.S. election in 2016, when hackers working for Russian military intelligence stole emails and other files from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary for America organizations and methodically leaked them in the final months of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Security experts with the U.S. government and private organizations have warned that Russia, China and Iran appear to be making efforts to sway the 2024 U.S. election, with Iran seeking to undermine Trump, the Republican nominee. The recent Microsoft report found that the hackers had broken into the email account of a former senior adviser to a presidential campaign and then used that account to send a phishing email to another high-ranking adviser on that campaign, and it said it recently alerted the campaign. Microsoft didn’t say whether the phishing email was successful or what campaign was targeted. As of late Monday afternoon, little else was known about the purported hack, including the extent to which the Trump campaign was willing to work with the FBI. Chris Krebs, chief intelligence and public policy officer at the cybersecurity company SentinelOne, said Trump and his aides may be reluctant to fully cooperate with federal investigators, given Trump’s “relationship with federal law enforcement.” “There may not be a desire to collaborate all that much,” said Krebs, who was director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Trump administration and was fired by Trump after he declared the 2020 election was the most secure in history. A decision not to cooperate fully with federal authorities could hamper and slow an investigation into the purported hack, Krebs said. “That, unfortunately, can impede — from a national security perspective — our understanding of the event and what’s happening,” he said. The claim from the Trump campaign adds to what had already been a deeply antagonistic relationship between Iran and the former president. While president, Trump authorized a 2020 drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani, a key Iranian military leader. Last month, Biden administration officials said they had reason to believe Iran had planned to attempt to assassinate Trump. Iran’s representative to the U.N. also denied that allegation. Tehran has vowed to avenge the general’s death, and several former senior officials who worked in the Trump administration have government-funded security teams protecting them around-the-clock. Former U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts have said that the best response to hacks and disinformation efforts is transparency, providing accurate information quickly and exposing attempts to mislead the public. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, called on federal authorities to release any relevant information without delay. “The Intelligence Community should move with great alacrity to declassify and disclose any appropriate information it has concerning the potential foreign nature of this interference. Transparency is still our best deterrent against foreign influence operations,” Schiff said in a social media post. Schiff said U.S. intelligence agencies responded too slowly to the Russian election interference operation in 2016. The Democratic lawmaker added that any foreign attempt to interfere in the U.S. election should be condemned, no matter which party is targeted. The apparent hack of Trump campaign files echoes the 2016 Russian campaign against Hillary Clinton, but so far seems notably less elaborate in distributing the hacked files. The Russian operation involved an elaborate scheme, involving a fake hacktivist persona, named Guccifer_2 after a real Romanian hacker. The fake Guccifer had an active Wordpress account and a Twitter handle that they used to share the documents. The Russian effort also gave files to WikiLeaks, which published them. It separately hosted Democrats’ files on a website it created called DCLeaks, which had a corresponding Facebook page. There is no apparent similar distribution system for the hacked Trump files, at least so far. If the hackers do work for Iran, that seems to show a lack of foresight on their part, said Simin Kargar, a senior nonresident fellow studying Middle Eastern influence operations at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “They’re kind of incompetent. If they really wanted to make a good hack-and-leak operation, they could have done much better,” she said. “This is very much in line with Iranian actors.”","summary":"The FBI said Monday afternoon that it is investigating efforts to hack both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/fbi-says-s-investigating-trump-campaign-claim-hacked-files-rcna166197","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240812-trump-rally-wc-1437-948880.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-12 23:10:38","author":"Ken Dilanian,Kevin Collier","authors":["Ken Dilanian","Kevin Collier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":253976626,"title":"Trump’s Big Lie About Harris’s Crowds","text":"When Donald Trump says something ludicrous and unhinged, it is often difficult to tell if he is acting out of feral political calculation or narcissistic injury.

His argument, such as it was, was based on a conspiracy theory floating around febrile corners of the internet that purported to find evidence of Harris’s deception in her plane’s reflection. “Same thing is happening with her fake ‘crowds’ at her speeches,” Trump added. “This is the way the Democrats win Elections, by CHEATING — And they’re even worse at the Ballot Box. She should be disqualified because the creation of a fake image is ELECTION INTERFERENCE.” One way to read this post is that Trump is delusional. He can’t cope with Harris besting him on the metric he’s long valued the most — the size of his audience — and so is denying reality and having a tantrum. But however disordered Trump’s mind might be, I suspect there’s also a sort of strategy at work here.
