Our top headlines and themes for the day. Global markets rejoice after a 90-day tariff pause and take stock.Why bond markets and not stock markets can destroy fortunes and bring down governments. TCS net profits are down as revenue touches 2.5 trillion rupees. Global commodity prices including metals are crashing and Microsoft is pulling out of data centres.A Bond Debacle We Did Not Expect On Thursday, stock futures fell following a big rally on Wall Street. On Wednesday, we spread to other markets in Asia. That's on Thursday morning thanks to President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on some of those reciprocal tariffs.On Thursday, Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures were down 400 points as were S&P Futures and Nasdaq Futures at about a percentage. On Wednesday, Wall Street exploded with the S&P 500 rising more than 9% for its third largest gain in a single day since World War II according to CNBC. The markets rocketed after Trump announced those temporary drops in tariff rates for most countries to 10% for 90 days and I'll come back to that.Canada and Mexico will not be subjected to an additional 10% duty. However, the European Union also announced a similar 90-day pause on U.S. goods. Donald Trump said that he thought people were jumping a little bit out of line and they were getting yippy and a little bit afraid.Now just to wrap up the tariff trauma, the universal 10% levy continues on all countries except China and so does the 25% rate on all aluminium, steel and cars entering the United States. So the trade war between China and the U.S. of course now deepens as Trump imposed a 125% tariff on Chinese goods and China has retaliated with 84% tariffs. Trump says or said that he thinks the U.S. and China will end up making a very good deal. On the other hand, markets and businesses think a little differently. Mohammed El-Erian, Alliance's chief economic advisor, told CNBC on Wednesday that I think you need certainty. I think the 90 days that's a good period but quickly people are going to start asking what happens next.Others echoed a similar sentiment saying that there was potential for more turmoil ahead. Market volatility could remain elevated despite the 90-day pause on tariffs for non-retaliating countries, a chief economist at LPL Financial told CNBC and he also said that hard data from the early part of the year suggests that the economy is slowing irrespective of trade policies.TCS Profits Are DownBack home, India's largest IT services company, TCS, or Tata Consultancy Services, reported a 1.7% decline in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 31st, 2025. That's about 10 days ago at 12,224 crores year-on-year. For the same period last year, TCS declared a net profit of 12,434 crores.So very little difference. Consolidated revenue for the same quarter was up to about 65,500 crores. That's up about 5%.So TCS is the first major result out yesterday, which gives you some flavour of the Q4 and full year results season, at least for IT companies. And more on what we could expect is coming up. For TCS, regional performance varied significantly with the United States showing a 1.5% decline. The UK business also saw a drop at about 4%. The European Union saw a steeper decline at 6.4%. The Indian market interestingly grew and quite robustly almost 8.2% during the quarter at obviously or most likely lower numbers. The Asia-Pacific region, however, was down too at about 4.2% according to numbers compiled by Business Standard. So for the full year, and this gives you a sense of size, that's for 2024-2025, TCS reported a net profit of 48,500 crores, which is about roughly 6% up compared to 45,900 crores in the previous year. Total income for the year stood at about 259,000 crores, that's 2.59 trillion rupees, which is also up about 6% compared to about 2.45 trillion rupees in the previous financial year. And that obviously gives you a sense on how large India's largest IT firm is.Bond Blues Now back to Wall Street.

Fewer people buying bonds means the interest rate on them rises, making government borrowing more expensive. \n\n“Ahead of Trump’s announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official,” the NBC report stated.\n\n“Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. \n\n“The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.” \n\nThe report said that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - who has been seen as more moderate and keen for Mr Trump to do deals with countries - and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick - who is more pro-tariff - teamed up.\n\nThe pair presented a “united front” to the President, asking him to end the tariff trauma. \n\nMr Trump himself referred to the bond market when he spoke about the pause.\n\n“The bond market is very tricky … people were getting a little queasy,” he said on Wednesday.\n\nIn the end, Mr Trump looked to have been persuaded to step back by a combination of his officials, Republicans he trusted and even TV commentators.\n\nNonetheless, the White House has insisted Mr Trump’s backflip was not in panic.\n\nMr Bessent said it was planned all along, while press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was merely the “art of the deal”.","summary":"Close advisers to Donald Trump were in meltdown mode prior to him pausing the highest tariffs as one particular market went haywire.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/near-panic-real-reason-donald-trump-reportedly-hit-tariff-pause-button/news-story/bc271684ae69268385e2675d96670f80?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b237931ad1f317090cdd524f2f571de4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 01:01:04","author":"Benedict Brook","authors":["Benedict Brook"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":309913366,"title":"‘Stupid people’: Trump’s backflip defended","text":"Umm. What did Donald Trump actually achieve here?\n\nThat is the question which really must be asked as we assess whether Mr Trump’s triple corkscrew backflip on his tariff regime (7.85 out of 10, high marks for difficulty, a few points off for the embarrassing belly flop with accompanying “womp womp” sound effect) is a product of heretofore disguised strategic genius or just a whopping oopsie.\n\nSo. I present to you the sequence of events.\n\nMr Trump unilaterally imposed severe tariffs on pretty much the entire world. Which is to say he enacted one of the steepest tax hikes, in all of history, on American importers.\n\nHe tried to convince everyone the money would be paid by foreigners, because he either doesn’t understand how his own central economic policy works, on a disturbingly fundamental level, or does understand and merely hopes to avoid admitting it. Both of these explanations are fairly unsettling.\n\nThe stock market tanked – how could it not? – as did public support for Mr Trump’s handling of the American economy.\n\nAnd now he has reduced the tariffs (except on China) to a baseline of 10 per cent, spurring the stock market to recover most, but not yet all, of what had been lost.\n\nSo the answer, when we ask what Mr Trump managed to achieve with this crazy brave, or possibly just crazy, tariff gambit is: a catastrophically steep fall in the stock market, followed by a bounce back which still leaves it in the red.\n\nAnd that’s about it. He secured no substantive concessions from other countries. All those pesky trade deficits he was complaining about, and using to justify the tariffs, remain as wide as they were a week ago. Trust in the US government as an economic actor has plummeted. Business and consumer confidence are both down. And all that juicy revenue Mr Trump claimed would flow from the tariffs is delayed by at least 90 days.\n\nShould I put that more bluntly? He imposed the tariffs because other countries had trade surpluses with the US (even though he also put them on countries like Australia, which has a trade deficit with America. But what can I say? That was the stated logic. It’s not my fault if it’s obviously incoherent). And he just ditched those same tariffs, without those other nations doing anything to mollify him.\n\nWhat was the point of it all, then? Why give the entire global economy a panic attack if you’re just going to reverse course 24 hours later, having accomplished bugger all? It reeks of a guy who realised stocks were diving, punched the abort button, and is now desperate to save face.\n\nAt this juncture, having endured a decade of sycophants insisting Mr Trump is playing 8D chess, incomprehensible for mere mortals, when he actually appears to be trying to “play” a Nintendo Switch with the remote control from a 1980s TV and the digital dexterity of a six-year-old, you do wonder what level of screw-up would finally be too egregious to defend.\n\n“I’m just loving the reaction of stupid people,” said conservative broadcaster Sean Hannity today, for instance. He’s one of a great many examples.\n\n“All of these people that have been trying to create in other people’s minds that Donald Trump does not know what he’s doing.”\n\nSorry, who are the “stupid” people here?\n\nThe ones criticising an ostensibly conservative president, frequently described as the heir of Reagan, for being a bipolar protectionist, changing his mind on matters of importance every other week based on, as far as we can discern, vibes?\n\nOr the ones who keep doing the most shameless 180s on economic views they’ve otherwise held for decades because they need to align with their chosen politician? Because supporting your team, and being a good obedient little fanboy, is more important than having anything resembling an actual principle?\n\nFor God’s sake. If Joe Biden had announced these tariff policies, a fair few of these folks would have called him a communist. If he’d then backflipped, they would have called him a senile idiot who had no idea what he was doing.\n\nYes, they would have. You know, dear readers, that some of you would have. Do direct your complaints about “Trump Derangement Syndrome” to the appropriate email address, but also, feel free to explain why you have one standard for Trump and another for everyone else.\n\nIt speaks to the sheer blatancy of this particular blunder that even some of Mr Trump’s habitual defenders have broken ranks. Not all. But some. Here is an assessment from Charles Gasparino, of Fox Business.\n\n“I want to tell you right now that Donald Trump outsmarted the world. Trust me, I’m an American. I support my president. But that’s not really what happened here,” he said.\n\n“Make no mistake about it, you cannot divorce this decision right here from what happened last night, which was, you know – people focus on the stock market all the time. It’s the bond market, and the sort of lending markets that’s the plumbing of the economy.\n\n“And those markets were imploding last night. And that’s why we have a 90-day freeze.”\n\nThat is, if anything, charitable. Other close Trump allies have issued statements which, how to put this, suggest they have no idea what the heck he’s doing.\n\n“I still don’t know exactly what his total strategy is,” Republican Senator Ron Johnson, very much a Trump stan, said today.\n\n“At some point in time, I think the markets will stabilise. Again, I don’t know what the endgame is here yet.”\n\nI’m really not sure there is an “endgame”. Rather we seem to be at the mercy of a guy who’s governed by whatever gives him a burst of dopamine in the next five minutes.\n\n“I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,” he said this week.\n\n“They are. They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything. I’ll do anything, sir!’”\n\nYeah, OK. To longtime observers of Mr Trump’s anecdotes it has been obvious, for some time, that any story involving another person obsequiously calling him “sir” is made up. It is one of his little tics. A tell. If the person calling him “sir” also has tears in his eyes – this is the case pretty frequently – then hooooo boy, we have a proper fable on our hands. If he is “begging like a dog” for something, that’s full-on mythological.\n\nSo there’s that. But let’s go deeper here. What do those quotes above tell us about him?\n\nChuck them on the pile, nay, mountain of evidence that he’s ultimately fuelled by narcissism. Oh the prime minister of Belgium is on the phone, and sucking up to Donald Trump? Well, you know what, we like Belgium now. That is the governing principle of current-day American diplomacy.\n\nThat so many people now thrive on vicarious narcissism. That they assume anything in service to Donald Trump’s ego is also, inherently, a good development, regardless of its effect in the real world. That’s the weird part.\n\nIt doesn’t even matter, particularly, whether he has achieved something. Or whether he’s just claiming to have achieved something, absent any supporting evidence. The praise flows just as freely either way.\n\nWhat actually happened here? The school bully demanded lunch money from every other child in the cafeteria.\n\nSome replied by saying, “Hey, please don’t take my lunch money!” which I’m sure made Mr Trump feel like a powerful boy. But nobody actually gave him any real money. And now he’s declaring victory anyway, and bragging about what a successful bully he is.\n\nBecause he .... managed to get some world leaders on the phone, and on top of that, they were at least somewhat deferential towards him. Congratulations, my guy! That’s something literally any American president can do, with almost any world leader who doesn’t run a murderous dictatorship, at any time.\n\nWhat’s next, here? Are we going to see Tiger Woods brag about sinking a putt, on a flat green, from two feet? Is Elon going to clap back at his teen cyberbullies by saying his DOGE staff laugh at all his jokes?\n\nSo after all that preamble let’s cut the crap. Trump folded. He thought his big tariff plan would be a roaring success, but when he announced it, the markets shat themselves. And he caved. And he got nothing in return. And there are now a bunch of folks telling you he’s a genius. Art of the deal and all that.\n\nWe have heard some attempts, in these past few hours, to argue that Mr Trump was laying a cunning trap for China.\n\nBecause he ... hiked America’s tariffs on China, and then China retaliated, and then he hiked them again. Which is something he could have done without up-ending America’s relationship with the entire world, and without tanking the stock market.\n\nEven the dimmer Bond villains would have considered that an unnecessarily convoluted plan.\n\nSay I want pizza for dinner. Too lazy to cook tonight. I could just say to my dear wife: “Hey, let’s have pizza for dinner.” Or ....... I guess I could go to 79 different supermarkets, and blow money in all of them on ingredients I have no intention of using?\n\nAnd then chuck those ingredients in the dumpster? And say: “Ha! You fool! I was going to order pizza all along!”\n\nLook it’s not a perfect metaphor, but I’m trying to get at the sheer pointlessness of what Trump has done. If the master plan, the whole time, was just to throw bigger tariffs on China, then 99 per cent of this saga has been entirely superfluous.\n\nYou don’t need to announce and then rescind tariffs on an uninhabited Antarctic island to put bigger tariffs on China. You can just put the bigger tariffs on China.\n\nDon’t insult your own intelligence by believing this nonsense. The guy has realised that he screwed up, and he has backed down, and he is pretending otherwise because to admit fault would be to admit that he’s fallible. And we can’t have that, can we?\n\nTwitter: @SamClench","summary":"There is one, sole question we should all be asking after Donald Trump’s humungous backflip on his global tariff policy.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/stupid-people-donald-trumps-defenders-stick-with-him-after-huge-backflip-on-tariffs/news-story/0a2ee17df34d82e3e7409fba031dc1c4?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3c4cf2bc71e283aa13d79464e4add41f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 01:01:04","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.577},{"id":309913188,"title":"Grey's Anatomy star Eric Dane makes heartbreaking health revelation after calling off Rebecca Gayheart divorce","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Apr 11th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNYC Hudson River helicopter crash victims are identified as tech boss, his wife and three children\n\nNew details in Val Kilmer's cause of death revealed days after Top Gun icon's passing aged 65\n\nWeezer bassist issues bizarre statement hours after 'attempted murderer' wife was shot by cops\n\nHow Selena Gomez really felt about Hailey Bieber's 'decade-long pursuit' of Justin according to insiders - as they make shocking claims about the model's tactics to 'snare' the singer and say Selena 'was on to her game'\n\nI lost 50kg WITHOUT Ozempic and finally silenced the food noise.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAMEER SURI FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:24 BST, 11 April 2025 |Updated:01:57 BST, 11 April 2025 \n\nGrey's Anatomy star Eric Dane has heartbreakingly revealed that he has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nALS, which is known in some countries as motor neurone disease, is a rare and incurable degenerative condition that impairs the nervous system over time and causes the muscles to increasingly suffer from paralysis.\nAbout half of ALS patients have a life expectancy of three years after the initial onset of symptoms, though some can survive for decades. \n'I have been diagnosed with ALS,' Eric, 52, said in a statement to People. 'I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter.'\nThe bombshell news comes a month after Eric and his wife Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he shares two teenage daughters, called off their divorce.\n'I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of Euphoria next week,' said Eric, a longstanding star of the HBO series. 'I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.'\n\nGrey's Anatomy star Eric Dane has heartbreakingly revealed that he has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); pictured last May\nALS has been colloquially known in America as Lou Gehrig's disease ever since it claimed the life of the legendary baseball player in 1941 when he was just 37. \nThe cause of the illness is a process called neurodegeneration, in which motor neurones - specialist nerve cells in the brain and spine - begin to malfunction.\n\n Grey's Anatomy star Eric Dane and Rebecca Gayheart mysteriously call off divorce in shock move \nMost people with ALS only start exhibiting symptoms in their 60s, though in very rare cases the condition can develop in people as young as teenagers.\nThe early symptoms can be weakness in one limb that then spreads to a different one, or difficulty swallowing, or slurred speech, per Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nOver time, patients can start falling down, suffering from fatigue, losing motor skills, laughing or crying uncontrollably or feeling their muscles twitch and cramp.\nWhen the condition advances even further, someone with ALS can experience paralysis and have difficulty with swallowing or breathing.\nA month ago, it emerged that Eric and Rebecca had performed a stunning U-turn and called off their divorce, seven years into the process.\nRebecca filed to dissolve their marriage of 14 years in 2018, but the pair stayed notably amicable as they raised their daughters Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13. \n\nEric is pictured in a group shot for Grey's Anatomy with his co-stars (from left) Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey and Sandra Oh \n\nRebecca filed to dissolve their marriage of 14 years in 2018, but the pair have stayed notably amicable as they raise their daughters Billie, 14, and Georgia, 13; all pictured 2016 \nThey dragged their feet on finalizing the split for so long that Rebecca was repeatedly warned her case might be dismissed altogether.\nThe duo were seen shopping together with their children during the COVID-19 lockdowns, raising further questions about the state of their relationship.\nEric, 52, has been seen on more than one date with a 27-year-old actress in recent months, while Rebecca, 53, was out with a 77-year-old mogul in February. \nHowever in an unexplained development, Rebecca filed to dismiss her divorce from Eric on March 5, according to court documents obtained by TMZ. \nRebecca and Eric were given 'final notice' in January that their divorce might be tossed if they neglected to advance the process, according to In Touch Weekly.\nEric was spotted that month strolling arm in arm with an actress called Priya Jain, 27, igniting speculation he had moved on to a new romance.\nPriya and Eric first set off a round of relationship rumors this past November when they were glimpsed out on a sushi date in West Hollywood. \nMeanwhile, Rebecca was seen last week attending Chanel's pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills with restaurant tycoon Peter Morton, 77, a co-founder of Hard Rock Café and the son of the namesake of Morton's Steakhouse.\nRebecca and Eric tied the knot in 2004, two years before he landed his fan favorite role as Dr. Mark Sloan aka 'McSteamy' on Grey's Anatomy.\nThey stayed together through the scandal that erupted five years into their marriage when a home video leaked of them frolicking naked with an ex-beauty queen.\nRebecca stood by Eric through various personal problems, including his rehab stay in 2011 to wean himself off the pain medication he had begun taking for an injury.\nSix years later in 2017, Eric entered treatment for depression, resulting in a filming pause on his action drama series The Last Ship. \nThe following year, Rebecca filed for divorce on grounds of irreconcilable differences, and the pair agreed on joint custody of their daughters with Eric paying alimony.\nRebecca, who acted infrequently after having children, said a few months after her divorce filing that she wanted to start working again.\n'I think that as a female you need to be able to always take care of of yourself and never depend on a man,' she told Us Weekly. 'I’m going back to work and I think it’s partly because I want my daughters to see me work.'\nShe explained that she and Eric were 'doing our best' to co-parent their children, acknowledging: 'It isn’t easy. But we are trying and we are committed.'\nBy June 2019 Rebecca was informed that her divorce case was in danger of being thrown out, Entertainment Tonight reported citing court documents.\n'If you fail to take the appropriate steps in your case, the court may dismiss your case for delay in prosecution,' she was told in what was her third warning.\nIt then emerged on New Year's Day 2020 that their divorce was still pending and they had not scheduled any hearings, according to The Blast.\nThe last step they took in their divorce before Rebecca filed to throw it out this week was reportedly an exchange of preliminary financial information in 2019. \nHBOEuphoriaGeorgiaEric Dane\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGrey's Anatomy star Eric Dane makes heartbreaking health revelation after calling off Rebecca Gayheart divorce\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy JOANNA CRAWLEY \n Published:01:00 BST, 11 April 2025 |Updated:01:54 BST, 11 April 2025 \n\nThe cast of The White Lotus have called the seven month shoot in the heat of Thailand 'intense', 'claustophobic' and a 'Truman Show social experiment.\nMike White flew his cast to the Four Seasons Resort on Koh Samui, where they both stayed and filmed the third season.\nAnd whilst the setting was intense, thanks in part to the stifling Thai temperatures, the blurred boundaries between work and play meant the friendships formed during filming also took on an unusual closeness. \nJason Isaacs who plays troubled family patriarch Tim Ratliff, has summed up the shoot as 'a cross between summer camp and Lord of the Flies but in a gilded cage'.\nAimee Lou Wood, who plays the tragic fan favourite Chelsea, meanwhile has described how the cast 'wrap and walk five steps to your room. You're living where you're filming. It is the Truman Show.'\nAnd there is one intense friendship circle at the centre of the cast bond. \n\nThe cast of The White Lotus have called the seven month shoot in the heat of Thailand 'intense', 'claustophobic' and a 'Truman Show social experiment with intense friendships formed - pictured Walton Goggins, Aimee Lou Wood and Leslie Bibb on set \n\nWalton and Sam Rockwell, who guest starred as Frank, ave been close friends for 15 years after meeting on the set of 2011 movie Cowboys and Aliens\nWalton Goggins, who stars as doomed Rick, his onscreen lover Aimee Lou, Leslie Bibb, who plays Kate and Sam Rockwell who guest starred as Frank have a tangled web of friendship.\nWalton and Sam have been close friends for 15 years after meeting on the set of 2011 movie Cowboys and Aliens.\nDespite Sam's partner of 18 years Leslie starring in White Lotus, it was his pal not his girlfriend who made sure Sam signed up for his scene-stealing role on the show.\nLeslie has admitted that whilst she tried to persuade her boyfriend, who was juggling filming another project in South Africa at the time, to say yes to Mike White Walton was the one who ultimately convinced him.\n'I think [it was] Walton really, because they're very good friends, wanted to have that experience with him,' she told InStyle.\nBut Walton called that experience of working with his best friend both a 'positive and a negative' admitting he had 'anxiety' about living up to his 'hero'. \n'He has been one of my best and dearest friends over the last 15 years of my life. So that is both a positive and a negative in the sense that we haven't worked together since then,' Walton mused to Vanity Fair. \n'Further complicating this collaboration is that Sam is my hero. He's really one of the guys in my generation that I look up to, and he knows that. So coming into this experience, there was a certain amount of anxiety, meaning I didn't want to let my friend down.'\n\nMike White flew his cast to the Four Seasons Resort on Koh Samui, where they both stayed and filmed the third season\n\nDespite Sam's partner of 18 years Leslie starring in White Lotus, it was his pal not his girlfriend who made sure Sam signed up for his scene-stealing role on the show\n\nBefore his friend Sam got to set, Walton leaned on his close bond with Sam's partner Leslie, who he has regularly referred to as his 'sister' in interviews\n\nAfter cementing her bond with Walton, Leslie then drew Aimee Lou Wood into the circle\nIn the end the two relalised that the relationship between their characters Rick and Frank mirrored a lot of their own feelings for one another.\n\n Has Walton Goggins BLOCKED Aimee Lou Wood on Instagram? \n'We talked a lot right before he got there about what that relationship symbolizes, where they fit into each other's lives. And the very first day on the set, there was a comfort and a level of listening and respect and genuine love and affection for each other that permeates their entire friendship.'\nBefore his friend Sam got to set, Walton leaned on his close bond with Sam's girlfriend Leslie, who he has regularly referred to as his 'sister' in interviews.\nLeslie seemed to provide Walton with a safe, known haven, as has admitted he gave himself the challenge of isolating himself on set, in part because of his method style of working. \nSpeaking on The White Lotus companion podcast, the actor explained how 'showing up to work every day with 18 people and a green room that's full of chairs of 18 people that are in a much different place emotionally than I am at the beginning of the story was very difficult… More often than not, my chair is separate.'\n\nThe two actress' revealed their closeness on set led to them sharing rooms, throwing parties together and holidaying in Tokyo during a break from filming\n\nAimee has confessed that she, Leslie and Walton dubbed themselves the 'Scorpio three' on set, thanks to their shared star signs\n'I sit on my own. I do my own thing… But I just couldn't, I couldn't be around them. They didn't understand why I was there. This guy is isolated… And that wasn't any fun, you know, to separate yourself from a group in that way. That was really, really challenging.' \nAfter cementing her bond with Walton, Leslie then drew Aimee Lou Wood into the circle, with the two actress' revealing their closeness on set led to them sharing rooms, throwing parties together and holidaying in Tokyo during a break from filming.\nAimee has even confessed that she, Leslie and Walton dubbed themselves the 'Scorpio three' on set, thanks to their shared star signs.\n'We had a group called Jackson Browne, because we used to just sit and listen to Jackson Browne, drink cocktails and eat fries,' she spilled. \nLeslie shared equally glowing words about the trio's friendship, gushing to Elle that 'Aimee Lou has become so kindred with me, and Walton is like family. I can’t see anything happen to them.'\n\nWhilst Walton, Aimee Lou, Leslie and Sam have all gushed about their tight bond during filming, some of those friendships have fragmented since the shoot wrapped\nBut whilst Walton, Aimee Lou, Leslie and Sam have all gushed about their tight bond during filming, some of those friendships have fragmented since the shoot wrapped.\nThis week fans speculated that Walton has blocked Aimee Lou on Instagram, amid rumours of a huge feud. \nAimee Lou, who boasts 2.6m Instagram followers, has been passionately sharing behind the scenes photos and reposts from her co-stars throughout the third season, with Walton also sharing his own set memories. \nAnd in their posts they have both enthusiastically tagged their co-stars - every one but each other. \nThey are both still following all the other cast members from the show. \nSeveral online gossip sites have posted blind items purported to be about the pair which has fuelled speculation of a falling out. \nNow, Reddit, TikTok, and X are full of threads dedicated to theories about why the pair may have had a behind-the-scenes falling-out.\nOne user shared on Reddit: 'I feel like no one is talking about the falling out of them?\n\nThis week fans speculated that Walton has blocked Aimee Lou on Instagram, amid rumours of a huge feud\n'They unfollowed each other on Insta a couple weeks ago, Walton posts White Lotus stuff and tags everyone in the photos except Aimee Lou Wood, posts a whole tribute to White Lotus and still doesn't tag her, posts tons of pictures of her on his story in a commemorative tribute to the show. What happened?'\nAnother X user wrote in amazement: 'Aimee Lou Wood follows 5,160 people on instagram and none of them are Walton Goggins…\nOn X, one viewer weighed in on an album of behind-the-scenes photos Walton had posted to Instagram.\n'Walton Goggins not tagging Aimee but tagging everyone else… WHAT HAPPENED,' they wrote.\nParticularly perplexing to some fans was how Walton had apparently posted a sweet — and extensive — set of photos of himself and Aimee to his Instagram Stories, set to the soundtrack of a famous break up song. \n'Obsessed with Walton Goggins posting an 18 slide instagram story of photos of him and Aimee Lou Wood set to Silver Springs by Fleetwood Mac….' one X user wrote in astonishment.\nWhite LotusAimee Lou WoodThailand\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe tangled friendships on The White Lotus set which was dubbed 'a Lord Of The Flies summer camp' as rumours swirl over Aimee Lou Wood and Walton Goggins' feud\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The aircraft crashed into the water upside down.\n\nAll six on board—believed to be a family of five from Spain and a pilot—died after the crash. Four were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others were whisked to hospitals but died shortly after.\n\n“Terrible helicopter crash in the Hudson River,” Trump wrote. “Looks like six people, the pilot, two adults, and three children, are no longer with us.” \n\nTrump wrote that the “footage of the accident is horrendous” and added, “God bless the families and friends of the victims.”\n\nThe crash is just the latest in a spate of aviation disasters and near-misses that has rocked the United States in recent months. In January, a medical transport plane crashed into a suburban Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven.\n\nDays later, a U.S. army helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet, killing all 67 people on board both aircraft.\n\n“Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and his talented staff are on it,” Trump assured. “Announcements as to exactly what took place, and how, will be made shortly!”\n\nDuffy later provided an update on the crash. \n\n“Here’s what we know: The tour helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area established in New York which means no air traffic control services were being provided when the helicopter crashed,” Duffy wrote. “Several minutes prior to entering the Special Flight Rules Area, Air Traffic Control from LaGuardia airport was providing support. The FAA will have investigators on site tonight and we are also launching a Safety Review Team later tonight.”\n\nDuffy added: “We pray for the victims and their families.”\n\nIn a separate incident on Thursday, a passenger jet carrying multiple members of Congress was struck by another plane on the runway, clipping its wing.

Spain defends a world with open doors. A world in which trade unites our people and makes them more prosperous,\" Sánchez said in Vietnam.Among the products that Spain buys from China are machinery, textiles and consumer goods. In recent years, the import of automobiles and motorcycles has also gained importance.Spanish companies primarily export chemicals, minerals and industrial components. China has established itself as the leading Asian market for Spanish sales and more than 14,500 Spanish companies maintain trade relations with the country.But the bilateral investment figures are more balanced, albeit still modest.In 2023, China allocated €131 million to projects in Spain, while Spanish investment in China reached €91 million.Although the volumes are still small, both economies maintain a growing interest in strengthening ties in strategic sectors such as technology, energy, and logistics.China comes to Sánchez's defenceWhen asked about the US Treasury Secretary's criticism of Sánchez's visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian responded firmly: \"If we talk about 'cutting each other's throats,' it is precisely the United States that, by abusing tariffs to threaten and blackmail the entire world, is trying to squeeze the necks of other countries, forcing them to yield to its policy of intimidation.\"During a press conference on Thursday, Lin also said that trade between Spain and China is important for both sides, with bilateral trade between the two countries exceeding €44 billion in 2024, while Spanish exports to China increased by 4.3% last year, according to Beijing’s figures.In the face of criticism from Washington, Spain’s socialist government has defended the overtures to China.Agriculture Minister Luis Planas insisted that Spain has excellent trade relations with China, which \"we clearly want not only to continue, but to expand.\"","summary":"Washington has criticised Spain's outreach to China with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying cosying up to Beijing is like 'cutting your own throat.'","url":"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/04/11/spains-pedro-sanchez-aims-for-closer-trade-ties-with-china-amid-us-tariffs-uncertainty","image":"https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/18/81/44/1440x810_cmsv2_eb0c441e-264f-5ec2-8242-fa54c826a386-9188144.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:51:14","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"fr","sentiment":0.017},{"id":309913508,"title":"A New Security Pact for the Panama Canal gets Locked In","text":"The United States and Panama have officially signed a new defense and security pact aimed at reinforcing control over the Panama Canal, a move that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claims is critical to pushing back against China’s growing grip in the region. In a press release posted Wednesday night on X, the Panama Canal Authority confirmed that Panama’s Minister for Canal Affairs and Hegseth signed a joint declaration that reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty and outlines new military cooperation. The deal “reaffirms respect for, and the recognition of, Panamanian sovereignty over the interoceanic waterway,” the Canal Authority stated. \n\nIt also upholds both nations’ commitment to the Neutrality Treaty and the legal framework that governs canal operations, including Panama’s Constitution, the treaty itself, and the Canal’s Organic Law. But the declaration goes beyond words. It lays out plans for a cost-sharing model to cover services provided to U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels, with the goal of keeping it “cost-neutral.” “Efforts will be made to develop a mechanism which will allow compensation for services provided to warships and auxiliary vessels, seeking a cost-neutral basis,” the statement reads. “This mechanism will be evaluated jointly with the Ministry of Security of Panama.” \n\nAccording to Hegseth, a broader framework is also in the works, one that would guarantee U.S. warships “first and free” passage through the Panama Canal. Hegseth announced Wednesday that U.S. and Panamanian officials had already signed a memorandum of understanding, and that a final document is on the way to formally secure toll-free priority for American naval vessels. The Canal Authority, meanwhile, emphasized that this agreement is just the start. “The declaration constitutes a first step in establishing this model, which will be developed in later stages.” \n\nWhile the U.S. builds up its military coordination, the Panama Canal Authority confirmed that collaboration already includes “engineering, security, and cyber-security,” key focus areas for both governments as they push back against foreign interference. The move comes just as the U.S. prepares to deploy the USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, to the region in a show of presence and partnership. Earlier this week, Hegseth visited U.S. troops, met with Panamanian officials, and toured the canal. He warned sharply that China’s reach in the Western Hemisphere is already too big, and still growing. \n\n“Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain,” Hegseth said. “They operate military facilities and ground stations that extend their reach into space. They exploit natural resources and land to fuel China’s global military ambitions. China’s factory fishing fleets are stealing food from our nations and from our people.” Hegseth stressed that war is not the objective. “Together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China’s threats in this hemisphere,” he said. \n\nHe also made clear that the U.S. is taking steps to counter Chinese-controlled infrastructure in Panama. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” \n\nPanama’s President Jose Raul Mulino (C) looks on as Panama’s Security Minister Frank Abrego (L) and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth get ready to sign a bilateral agreement, in Panama City on April 9, 2025. \n\nHegseth was blunt: “The United States will not allow China to threaten the canal’s operation.” He added, “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades.” Despite the growing military and political coordination, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino has publicly denied that China controls the canal. “I completely reject that statement,” Mulino said, pushing back on earlier claims from the U.S. State Department that a deal had already been reached guaranteeing toll-free passage for U.S. warships. The Canal Authority added that it has “not made any adjustments” to its fee structure.","summary":"Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino shakes hands with US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the signing of a bilateral agreement in Panama City on April 9, 2025. \n\n\nThe post A New Security Pact for the Panama Canal gets Locked In appeared first on Newsroom Panama.","url":"https://newsroompanama.com/2025/04/10/a-new-security-pact-for-the-panama-canal-gets-locked-in/","image":"https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mulino-and-Hegseth.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:42:23","author":"Newsroom Panama","authors":["Newsroom Panama"],"language":"en","source_country":"pa","sentiment":0.089},{"id":309912050,"title":"Judge allows Trump to proceed with mandatory registry for undocumented immigrants","text":"Washington — A federal judge on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a requirement that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation, in a move that could have far-reaching repercussions for immigrants across the country.\n\nJudge Trevor Neil McFadden — a Trump appointee — sided with the administration, which had argued that officials were simply enforcing a requirement that already existed for everyone who is in the country but isn’t an American citizen. McFadden’s ruling didn’t go into the substance of those arguments but rested largely on the technical issue of whether the groups pushing to stop the requirement had standing to pursue their claims. He ruled they didn’t.\n\nThe requirement goes into effect Friday.\n\nImmediately after the ruling, Department of Homeland Security officials emphasized in a news release that the deadline to register for those who’ve already been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday and that going forward, the registration requirement would be enforced to the fullest.\n\n“President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,” Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement. “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.”\n\nWhile questions remain about how the registration requirement will function, its impact is potentially far-reaching. The Trump administration — which has worked to make good on campaign promises of mass deportations — has said between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people could be affected.\n\nOne of the groups that sued, the National Immigration Law Center, called the Thursday ruling “disappointing” in a statement.\n\n“This disappointing ruling unfortunately means that, for now, Trump’s scheme to force people into an impossible choice moves forward. As we weigh next steps in our case, we urge affected community members to consult with an immigration attorney to better understand the consequences of registering or not,” said Nicholas Espíritu, deputy legal director at National Immigration Law Center.\n\nHomeland Security officials announced Feb. 25 that it was mandating that all people in the United States illegally register with the federal government, and said those who didn’t self-report could face fines or prosecution. Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines.\n\nRegistration will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older without legal status. People registering have to provide their fingerprints and address, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they registered.\n\nThe registration process also applies to Canadians who are in the U.S. for more than 30 days, including so-called snowbirds who spend winter months in places like Florida.\n\nFederal immigration law has long required that people who aren’t American citizens and live in the U.S., including those here illegally, register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of World War II. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n\nBut the requirement that people illegally in the U.S. register has been enforced only in rare circumstances. In fact, advocates opposing the government say it hasn’t been universally used since it was first introduced in the mid-1940s.\n\nIt was used in a limited way after Sept. 11, 2001, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required that noncitizen males 16 and older from 25 countries — all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim — register with the U.S. government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the registration requirement has always existed and that officials are simply enforcing it for everyone.\n\nThe groups that sued say the government should have gone through the more lengthy public notification process before bringing about the change, and that it’s enforcing this simply to facilitate President Donald Trump’s aim of carrying out mass deportations.\n\nThey argue that the registry puts people who work, contribute to the economy and have deep family ties in America into a deep bind: Do they come forward, register and essentially give up their location to a government intent on carrying out mass deportations, or do they stay in the shadows and risk being charged with the crime of not registering?\n\nThe government has already asked people subject to the registration requirement to create an account on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website.","summary":"Failure to register will be considered a crime.","url":"https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2025/04/judge-allows-trump-to-proceed-with-mandatory-registry-for-undocumented-immigrants.html","image":"https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/v2/CGRK2IKKXFBN7AF63NYTQQJ6KE.jpg?auth=53f848b16856e84ffb760258246639d6044f81fb629b92dc442acc5cad74662d&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:40:01","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":309912498,"title":"Judge sides with Trump: anyone in US illegally must register with fed government","text":"The Trump administration was handed another win on Thursday after a federal judge ruled that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation.

NOEM SENDS MESSAGE TO THOSE CONSIDERING ENTERING US ILLEGALLY: ‘DON’T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Thursday that the deadline to register for anyone who has been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday, adding that the registration requirement will be enforced to the fullest. \"President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now.

DHS SECRETARY NOEM APPEARS TO ACCUSE ‘CORRUPT’ FBI OF LEAKING LA ICE RAIDS The secretary said DHS will enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in 1952 and created several tools to track illegal aliens and compel them to voluntarily leave the U.S. DHS said the tools include criminal penalties for migrants who choose not to leave the U.S., fail to register with the federal government and get fingerprinted, and fail to notify the federal government of changes to their address. Illegal immigrants who fail to depart the U.S. will be charged with a crime resulting in a \"significant penalty,\" DHS said. NOEM ENDS BIDEN-ERA USE OF CONTROVERSIAL APP TO ALLOW MIGRANTS TO BOARD FLIGHTS, EXCEPT TO SELF-DEPORT But migrants who fail to register with the federal government could be fined, imprisoned or both. Registration is mandatory for anyone 14 and older without legal status. Anyone registering will be required to provide their fingerprints and address. Canadians are also required to go through the registration process if they have been in the U.S. for more than 30 days – this includes \"snowbirds,\" who spend winter months in warmer areas like Florida. While it has long been required for people who live in the U.S. and are not American citizens, the requirement has only been enforced in rare circumstances.

at Middle East Energy 2025","text":"DUBAI: Renewable energy solutions were front and centre for a small group of Pakistani exhibitors who were among 1,600 global companies present at Middle East Energy (MME) 2025, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre, where clean mobility and smart technologies were on display.\n\nEnergy experts from Pakistan believe renewable and sustainable solutions are the way forward.\n\n“This is the need of the time,” said Babar Shahzad, director of Shahzad Pumps, adding that in many countries, especially in Africa, the energy crisis is at a peak.\n\nThat’s where Shahzad Pumps’ solar-powered, submersible pumps come in.\n\n“They use solar power or we can use battery backup,” he said, talking to Business Recorder at the 49th Middle East Energy exhibition, held from April 7 to 9. “The special thing in these pumps is that they do not need any converter or any inverter in between these pumps and solar panels.”\n\nThe move to solar panels was inevitable, Shahzad noted, especially with steep and frequent price increases in common energy sources: electricity and gasoline.\n\n“That’s why they are switching towards renewable energy,” he said, talking about his clients in Pakistan, Africa, Middle East, and Iran.\n\nShahzad Pumps, which has a head office in Faisalabad, has stayed competitive for almost five decades by adapting and changing with the times.\n\n“If we don’t make new technological advancement, don’t introduce new technological items to our local market and to the international market, we could not survive,” he noted.\n\nTrade events like MME provide crucial learning opportunities that help companies advance their research and development.\n\nCreating an impact\n\n“The exposure that this exhibition provides is not just about creating sales,” said Ali Shahzad, Manager Business Development, Fast Cables. “It’s about creating a bigger impact.”\n\nCompanies that mean business pay attention to what their clients tell them, he said.\n\n“You are willing to understand the pain points of the audience,” said Ali Shahzad.\n\nFast Cables, as the name indicates, mainly produces power cables, but has recently stepped into the realm of LED lighting after seeing a gap in the local market.\n\n“There was no local player who could provide good value for money in this particular sector, so we decided to venture into it,” said Ali Shahzad.\n\n“We come up with the solution where we give the same specifications, or the same experience as any mega brand would give you, but at a considerably low price,” he added.\n\nThe product was initially launched in Pakistan, where a favourable response encouraged Fast Cables to take their LED products to countries abroad.\n\nBesides client pain points, exposure to a large industry gathering like Dubai’s MME also highlights the gaps companies can face locally.\n\nInternational competition\n\nA closer look at their competition tells Jawad Khalid, Manager Business Development - Export, PEL, exactly what obstacles at home puts his company in a disadvantageous position.\n\n“We see that other governments provide a lot of rebates on export,” he noted. “Their [business] procedure is very

We cannot really bring in dollars without scrutiny.”\n\nDespite all that, much like Fast Cables, PEL is also focusing on expanding its global reach.\n\n“Previously, we were exporting our transformers to the African market and the Middle Eastern market, but now we have also entered the US market,” said Khalid. “We are now frequently exporting our transformers to the US.”\n\nHowever, international trade turbulence due to tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump has instilled hesitation in some customers, he said.\n\n“Right now, to be really honest, some of our orders have been put on hold,” noted Khalid. “Unfortunately, like all other companies and all other countries, we are getting hit by that tariff.”\n\nLike the rest of the world, he said, PEL is also curious to see how global trade will evolve in the coming days.\n\n“The duties that are being implemented on China, that’s not a problem, because they are much higher than what has been implemented on Pakistan,” said Khalid.\n\nBut some competitors, like Turkey are at a slight advantage despite also facing tariffs.\n\n“Turkey only has a tariff of 10 per cent now, so it will put us at a very disadvantageous position when compared to Turkey,” noted Khalid.\n\nHowever, PEL, an already well-known Pakistani brand, continues to increase its competitiveness by achieving more international manufacturing standardizations.\n\n“Previously, we were manufacturing transformers on IEC standards, but the USA required IEEE standards,” said Khalid. “Now we are manufacturing as per IEEE standard. In addition to that, there is a requirement of UL (Underwriters Laboratories) certification in the US market, so now we are in the process of getting ourselves approved for that as well.”\n\nAnother well-known Pakistani brand, Osaka Batteries, a division of ACM Group of Industries, is also working to strengthen its grip in the renewable energy field by producing lead acid and graphene EV batteries for motor bikes.\n\nE-bikes may not be as much in demand in Pakistan right now, but the UAE is a ripe market, due to the various delivery companies operating in the country.\n\nOsaka was a good fit for this year’s MEE, which also debuted The Battery Show Middle East and The Battery Show Conference, held under the patronage of the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure at World Trade Centre in Dubai.\n\nOsaka is furthering its sustainability ambitions by venturing into recycling lead in Pakistan while also trying to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Pakistan.\n\nSupported by the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, more than 150 energy leaders and experts at MME explored transformative sector innovations, global energy market dynamics, and how AI is helping enable a sustainable, affordable energy future.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2025","summary":"DUBAI: Renewable energy solutions were front and centre for a small group of Pakistani exhibitors who were among 1,600 global companies present at Middle East Energy (MME) 2025, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre, where clean mobility and smart technologies were on display.\n\n\nEnergy experts from Pakistan believe renewable and sustainable solutions are the way forward.\n\n\n“This is the need of the time,” said Babar Shahzad, director of Shahzad Pumps, adding that in many countries, especially in Africa, the energy crisis is at a peak.\n\n\nThat’s where Shahzad Pumps’ solar-powered, submersible pumps come in.\n\n\n“They use solar power or we can use battery backup,” he said, talking to Business Recorder at the 49th Middle East Energy exhibition, held from April 7 to 9. “The special thing in these pumps is that they do not need any converter or any inverter in between these pumps and solar panels.”\n\n\nThe move to solar panels was inevitable, Shahzad noted, especially with steep and frequent price increases in common ene","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40356973/renewable-energy-top-of-mind-for-pakistani-exhibitors-at-middle-east-energy-2025","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/04/110152193af36cd.jpg?r=015407","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:38:35","author":"Mehreen Shahid","authors":["Mehreen Shahid"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.018},{"id":309913182,"title":"Britain is backing plans for a Nuremberg-style trial of Vladimir Putin amid calls for Russians to be prosecuted over crimes during invasion of Ukraine","text":"Britain is set to back prosecuting Vladimir Putin for war crimes in a move modelled on the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the Second World War. \n\nIt is understood the UK will join most European nations to back proposals at the Council of Europe to put Russians on trial for 'crimes of aggression' during the invasion of Ukraine. \n\nAn ad hoc military tribunal would be set up to prosecute Russian generals and leaders for war crimes, according to plans Britain will back at a meeting of the European human rights organisation next month. \n\nSir Keir Starmer's long-time friend and fellow lawyer Philippe Sands, along with others in the profession, has said it should be set up specifically for handling crimes of aggression. \n\nThese are defined by the United Nations as 'invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state on the territory of another state, or any military occupation'. \n\nThe UK and some other Western countries have said that under these terms, the political decision to invade should also be scrutinised, as well as war crimes committed in Ukraine after the war began in February 2022, the Telegraph reports. \n\nBut it risks creating friction between Sir Keir and President Donald Trump. \n\nThe US confirmed last month it had withdrawn from and suspended funds to the body in charge of the proposal, called the International Centre for the Prosecution of the Crime of Aggression - which Joe Biden's administration had supported. \n\nThe 'crime of aggression' cannot be examined by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague - and the ICC is not recognised by Russia or the US. \n\nSuggestions that a new court should deal with crimes of aggression, then, were first raised in 2022. \n\nThey were backed by both Ukraine's government and then-US president Joe Biden's administration - and American lawyers and funds were sent to help establish it. \n\nBut Trump, trying to be more conciliatory towards Russia, withdrew this involvement after his inauguration in January. \n\nThe President has refused to describe Russia's actions as an invasion and hopes to broker peace between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nHe also refused to sign a statement from the G7 nations calling Russia the 'aggressor' and has previously dubbed Zelensky a 'dictator'. \n\nIt comes after a video emerged in January of a Russian soldier calling on his comrades to film as at least six Ukrainian prisoners of war were cold-bloodedly shot dead. \n\nKyiv launched a criminal investigation at the time and reported the barbaric mass killing to the UN and Red Cross.\n\nThe savage Russian soldiers in the occupied Donetsk region filmed themselves committing the illegal battlefield massacre.\n\nUkrainian human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets, who also sent details to the UN and Red Cross, said at the time: 'The Russian army has never been famous for its dignified treatment of prisoners of war, and here it once again demonstrates its helplessness and criminality.' \n\nHe added: 'The lack of responsibility has turned the crime into a systematic one. We cannot turn a blind eye to this.\n\n'Ukraine needs justice and responsibility for those who commit crimes and do not adhere to any norms.'\n\nA UN study found in March last year that Russia was continuing to commit serious rights violations and war crimes in Ukraine, including 'systematic' torture and rape.\n\nThe high-level Commission of Inquiry (COI) on the rights situation in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion, said that it had found fresh evidence of widespread abuses.\n\nIt also voiced concern about the continued use of explosive weapons in civilian areas, confirming 'a pattern of disregard by Russian armed forces for possible harm to civilians'.\n\n'The evidence shows that Russian authorities have committed violation of international human rights and international humanitarian law and corresponding war crimes,' COI chief Erik Mose said at the time. \n\n'Further investigations are required to determine whether some of the situations identified may constitute crimes against humanity,' he added.","summary":"It is understood the UK will join most European nations to back proposals at the Council of Europe to put Russians on trial for 'crimes of aggression' during the invasion of Ukraine.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14597453/Britain-backing-plans-Nuremberg-style-trial-Vladimir-Putin-amid-calls-Russians-prosecuted-crimes-invasion-Ukraine.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/11/01/97157021-0-image-m-36_1744331309618.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/05/4734385533960763233/1024x576_MP4_4734385533960763233.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:38:19","author":"Editor,Sophie Carlin","authors":["Editor","Sophie Carlin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.086},{"id":309911848,"title":"Strains Surface as Speaker Mike Johnson Attempts to Reintegrate Rep. Elise Stefanik","text":"WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she was given private assurances that she would not only rejoin the House GOP leadership team, but also reclaim her coveted spot on the House Intelligence Committee, according to two Republican sources with knowledge of the deliberations. \n\nTwo weeks later, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is still scrambling to figure out how to deliver on the promise to place her back on the committee, even after the move was announced publicly Wednesday. \n\nThe conundrum for Johnson is that he has to either remove a Republican who currently sits on the high-profile Intelligence Committee, which could cause strife among existing members, or be forced to change House rules to add a member. House rules dictate that the committee may be made up of no more than 25 members with a maximum of 14 from one party, which is how many Republicans are currently on the panel.\n\nAdding a member would increase the size of the committee, which some members have already complained is too bloated. It could also force Johnson to allow House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to add another Democrat. \n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Johnson’s office said the speaker and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., are committed to finding a solution to accommodate Stefanik in the coming weeks.\n\n“The Speaker will be working with Chairman Crawford and HPSCI members to get Rep. Stefanik reintegrated into the Intelligence Committee in the coming weeks,” a spokesman for Johnson said. “They both look forward to having her expertise back on the committee.”\n\nStefanik’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe awkward situation has created tension between Johnson and Stefanik, on the influential panel and within the broader GOP conference. Adding to the drama, three senior House Republicans say Stefanik strong-armed Johnson into publicly announcing her new leadership arrangement ahead of a key budget vote in the House for which her support was sorely needed.\n\nJohnson has yet to signal his intentions to the Intelligence Committee members, leaving several worried whether their spots could be on the chopping block.\n\nIn private conversations hashing out Stefanik’s new arrangement, a source familiar with the discussion said, Johnson floated several Republicans whom he could ask to step down. They include Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, who is the most junior Republican on the panel; Rep. Claudia Tenney, who, like Stefanik, is from New York; and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, who chairs the powerful Financial Services Committee. Johnson appointed Fallon and Tenney to the panel on Jan. 16. \n\nBut despite Johnson’s initial suggestions, no decisions have been made, and no members have been approached about whether they’d be willing to forfeit their spots, according to multiple GOP sources. \n\n“I think it’s a fluid process,” said a House Republican who is familiar with the discussions on the panel. “I think they’re trying to see if they bump somebody off to make room for her or whether they add two more — add a Democrat and a Republican.”\n\nThe lawmaker opposed adding more members, saying the Intelligence Committee had already been “expanded twice in the last two years.”\n\nJohnson needs to tread carefully, as his past picks for the Intelligence Committee, which provides oversight of the National Intelligence Director’s Office and the CIA, have landed him in hot water with some members of the conference. \n\nJohnson upset moderates in the last Congress when he passed over more pragmatic members, like Stephanie Bice, R-Okla.; Zach Nunn, R-Iowa; and Laurel Lee, R-Fla., and instead named two controversial firebrands to the panel, Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. And Johnson this year booted the panel’s former chairman, Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who wasn’t well-liked in Trump’s orbit.\n\nStefanik’s role collides with key budget vote\n\nThe consternation over how to accommodate Stefanik is just one example of the disruption Trump caused by pulling her nomination. And it’s a situation she may be using to her advantage, asserting her close relationship with Trump and the fact that her vote is crucial for Republicans in the narrowly divided House.\n\nOn Wednesday, House leaders were preparing to take a procedural step toward adopting a budget resolution to advance Trump’s legislative agenda. At that point, Johnson had yet to announce Stefanik’s new role, even though there were behind-the-scenes talks. \n\nStefanik, who hadn’t voted in the House since Trump withdrew her nomination on March 27, made the White House aware of the situation as officials were calling to whip budget votes, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Under pressure from Stefanik, Johnson decided to greenlight a public announcement about her new arrangement, the sources said.\n\nStefanik then showed up to the Capitol for the key procedural vote, but she withheld her vote until the very last second, making her decisive in putting the measure over the finish line. Whether it was intentional or not, the maneuver was an unmistakable reminder to Stefanik’s colleagues that they need her vote, which is why Trump asked her to stay in Congress.\n\nMoments after the vote, Stefanik — who gave up her post as House GOP conference chair when she was nominated for the ambassadorship — publicly announced her new role: chair of the House Republican leadership, a post that will come with additional staff and resources. Stefanik also announced she will return to her positions on the Intelligence, Education and Workforce, and Armed Services committees. Stefanik and Johnson then issued a joint release about the news 2½ hours later.\n\nSome top Republicans, including other members on Johnson’s leadership team, said they were caught off guard by the announcement. Stefanik’s allies, however, note that Trump made it clear that he wants her to have a plum landing spot as quickly as possible and argue she has been nothing but the ultimate team player throughout the entire saga.\n\nThere’s still a question of what kind of leadership role, if any, Stefanik would assume on the Intelligence Committee. In the last Congress, she had been one of its most senior members. Had she not been tapped for the U.N. post, she would have been in contention to lead the panel after Johnson ousted Turner. Johnson named Crawford as the new chairman and made Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., the vice chair. \n\nBut Stefanik would have more seniority on the panel than Kelly, “which would make her vice chair, technically,” said the House lawmaker familiar with the deliberations about the panel. And subcommittee gavels have been awarded already for the 119th Congress, the person said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump withdrew Rep.

The Dallas-based company has named the pups Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi, and have touted their future aspirations to bring back versions, not exact replicas, of other long-extinct animals like the dodo and the mammoth. \n\nTheir efforts did not go unnoticed by Burgum, who cited the claimed revival of the species that went extinct over 10,000 years ago as proof that “it has been innovation — not regulation — that has spawned American greatness.”\n\n“The Department of the Interior is excited about the potential of ‘de-extinction’ technology and how it may serve broader purposes beyond the recovery of lost species, including strengthening biodiversity protection efforts and helping endangered or at-risk species,” Burgum wrote in an X post Monday. \n\n“The Endangered Species List has become like the Hotel California: once a species enters, they never leave … This is because the status quo is focused on regulation more than innovation,” he continued. “It’s time to fundamentally change how we think about species conservation. Going forward, we must celebrate removals from the endangered list - not additions. The only thing we’d like to see go extinct is the need for an endangered species list to exist. \n\n“We need to continue improving recovery efforts to make that a reality, and the marvel of ‘de-extinction’ technology can help forge a future where populations are never at risk,” he added. \n\nThe secretary parroted similar talking points during a town hall Wednesday where he reiterated, “If we’re going to be in anguish about losing a species, now we have an opportunity to bring them back. I mean, pick your favorite species and call up Colossal.”\n\n“Instead of raising money to get animals on the endangered species list, let’s figure out a way to get them off and this is one tool,” he continued. \n\nColossal’s CEO Ben Lamm told The Washington Post in a report published Thursday that Burgum had already met up with the company’s leaders in March to discuss “de-extinction.”\n\n“It’s really important to have a seat at the table regardless of your political views,” Lamm told The Post. “Is it really the right thing just to put your head in the sand and ignore the rest of the world?”\n\nAlongside spearheading a tariff turnover this week, President Donald Trump has also taken aim at a handful of environmental policies and regulations he deems a hindrance to energy production. \n\nIn one executive order signed Tuesday, Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement of State laws” pertaining to climate change to pave way for “American energy dominance” instead. \n\n“Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security,” the executive order read. \n\n“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” it continued. “They should not stand.”\n\nIn another executive order Wednesday, Trump ordered agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, Energy Department, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and several subdivisions within the Department of the Interior (which fall under Burgum) like the Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to “sunset” regulations pertaining to energy production. \n\n“By rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress, we can stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans,” Trump wrote in the order, describing the United States’ energy landscape as “perpetually trapped in the 1970s.” \n\nJulie Meachen, a Des Moines University paleontologist who helped uncover the dire wolf genome but was not involved in Colossal’s project to birth the three pups, told The Post she worries that the Trump administration will hinge on de-extinction “as a carte blanche to delist all the endangered species.” \n\n“This technology does not replace protections for endangered species,” Meachen told the publication.","summary":"Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants to forgo endangered species protections—and is hinging its argument on a wild vision of the future straight out of a science fiction novel. \n\nThis week, a biotechnology company claimed to have brought back the long-extinct dire wolf using new gene editing technology, and the breakthrough has Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum thinking outside of the box. \n\nWhy protect endangered species, he argued, when you can use “innovation” to simply bring them back from the brink of death instead? \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-administration-cites-dire-wolf-revival-as-reason-to-forgo-endangered-species-list/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/5D5CMRFCGBD4HENW4CBAOQV26I.jpg?smart=true&auth=697e84d07749fcbfd3c5346b9b9676afd12469d4d1db6abfb04db8f86c93ecfe&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:24:06","author":"Yasmeen Hamadeh","authors":["Yasmeen Hamadeh"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":309908408,"title":"Supreme Court tells Trump administration to facilitate return of Salvadoran man deported in error","text":"The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Thursday a judge's order requiring President Donald Trump's administration to facilitate the return to the United States of a Salvadoran man who the government has acknowledged was deported in error to El Salvador.\n\nThe Justice Department had asked the court to throw out an April 4 order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis requiring the administration to \"facilitate and effectuate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The judge had issued the order in response to a lawsuit filed by Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was living in Maryland and has had a work permit since 2019, and his family challenging the legality of his deportation.\n\nThe court, in an unsigned decision, said that the judge's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"\n\nHowever, the court said that the additional requirement to \"effectuate\" his return was unclear and may exceed the judge's authority. The justices directed Xinis to clarify the directive \"with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\"\n\nThe administration, meanwhile, \"should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,\" the court directed.\n\nAbrego Garcia was stopped and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on March 12 and questioned about alleged gang affiliation. He was deported on March 15 on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n\nJustice Department lawyers in a Supreme Court brief had argued that the judge's order, by requiring the Trump administration to \"effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return, had impermissibly encroached on presidential authority on foreign relations in violation of the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers between its judicial and executive branches.\n\n\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Trump administration deported on March 15 more than 200 people to El Salvador, where they are being detained in the country's massive anti-terrorism prison under a deal in which the United States is paying President Nayib Bukele's government $6 million.\n\nThe Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices on Thursday issued a statement agreeing with the court's decision, but said they would have denied the administration's request outright.\n\n\"To this day, the government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia's warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his confinement in a Salvadoran prison. Nor could it,\" liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the statement.\n\nSotomayor added that the administration had requested \"an order from this court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia is married to an American citizen with whom he is raising a U.S. citizen child in addition to his wife's two children from a prior relationship. He had never been charged with or convicted of any crime, according to Abrego Garcia's lawyers, who have denied the Justice Department's allegation that he is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.\n\nThe Justice Department in a Supreme Court filing on April 7 stated that while Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador through \"administrative error,\" his actual removal from the United States \"was not error.\" The error, department lawyers wrote, was in removing him specifically to El Salvador despite the deportation protection order.\n\nAbrego Garcia received a 2019 judgment in the United States granting him protection from removal to El Salvador after an immigration judge determined he would face persecution from gangs in his home country if returned.\n\nJustice Department lawyers said that Abrego Garcia, as an alleged member of MS-13, is no longer eligible for that protection after Trump's administration designated MS-13 a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nXinis, in her ruling, found that the 2019 order prohibiting Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was still in place. She found that his removal ran afoul of federal immigration law and likely violated procedural protections guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nAbrego Garcia's detention \"appears wholly lawless,\" Xinis stated in her written decision, adding that \"there were no legal grounds whatsoever for his arrest, detention or removal.\"\n\nThe Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 7 rejected the administration's request to freeze the judge's order.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a judge's order for Trump's administration to rehire thousands of fired employees. On Monday, it let Trump pursue deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members using a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime, but with certain limits. The court on April 4 let Trump's administration proceed with millions of dollars of cuts to teacher training grants - part of his crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Thursday a judge's order requiring President Donald Trump's administration to facilitate the return to the United States of a Salvadoran man who…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/us-supreme-court-tells-trump-administration-to-facilitate-return-of-salvadoran-man-deported-in-error","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/c7/ec/6edbb9885d8373d80468b8133999d453a70d/tag:reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:24:04","author":"Japan Today Editor,John Kruzel","authors":["Japan Today Editor","John Kruzel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.529},{"id":309912054,"title":"Here's how Trump's tariffs on China could impact US families","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- President Donald Trump raised tariffs on goods coming from China to 125%.

But in Canada, he’s taken on a far more sinister role: that of a comic book supervillain.\nFueled by Trump's aggressive rhetoric and policies, Canadian discontent has found a symbol of resistance in an old but timely hero—Captain Canuck.\nCaptain Canuck Returns as Canada’s Defender\nCaptain Canuck, a superhero first introduced in the 1970s, has returned to the spotlight. Dressed in a red-and-white costume adorned with the maple leaf, he stands as a patriotic guardian of Canadian sovereignty.\nOriginally created by Richard Comely, the character is portrayed as a government agent with enhanced strength. His alter ego, Tom Evans, is a Mountie who gains his powers through an alien encounter.\n\"All of a sudden Canadians are looking to Captain Canuck as a symbol. And it's basically, to them, Captain Canuck symbolizes independence,\" Comely explained.\nUS President Donald Trump’s annexation threats and tariffs have breathed new life into a superhero from the 1970s — Captain Canuck, a Mountie with superhuman strength who defends Canada's sovereignty https://t.co/isx9L3RLfL pic.twitter.com/SSU7Ei89r3\n— Reuters (@Reuters) April 9, 2025\nThe comic's revival comes as Canadians grapple with Trump’s provocative remarks—such as calling Prime Minister Trudeau a “Governor” and suggesting the annexation of Canada.\nTrump and Musk: A Comic Book Duo of Villainy\nTrump’s depiction as a villain didn’t stop at verbal jabs or economic sanctions. In the comic universe, he’s joined by none other than Elon Musk—presented as his loyal sidekick.\nTrump’s claims about Canada becoming the “51st state” and his introduction of harsh tariffs only deepened the divide between the two nations. Canadians protested with slogans like “Canada Not For Sale!” and distanced themselves from their once-close neighbor.\nElon Musk also came under fire, with Canadians accusing him of meddling in international affairs and backing far-right movements. This fueled his transformation into a comic book henchman, portrayed being tossed out alongside Trump by Captain Canuck.\nThe visual of Captain Canuck physically confronting Trump and Musk resonated widely, turning the comic into a bestseller across Canada.\nAn Icon Reborn in Modern Times\nCaptain Canuck’s revival isn’t just nostalgia—it taps into a deeper desire for a distinct Canadian identity.\n\"I think there was an undercurrent, so to speak, in Canada in the '70s... we had our own culture and be proud of the fact that we were Canadians,\" said Comely.\nSince his 1975 debut, Captain Canuck has appeared in millions of copies, now expanded through a licensing deal with Chapterhouse Comics. The hero’s return also includes an animated web series and a wide range of merchandise.\nFor the 50th anniversary edition, the comic features a cover of Captain Canuck confronting Trump directly. Comely noted, \"We feel like, okay, we've got to stand in opposition to these proposals.\"\nCaptain Canuck has seen multiple revivals, but this latest wave may be his most powerful yet.\n\"So in a sense, we have Mr. Trump to thank for a bit of resurgence,\" Comely admitted with a touch of irony.\n(With Inputs from Retuers)\nALSO READ: Russia, US Swap Prisoners In Move To Strengthen Bilateral Relations","summary":"Donald Trump has worn many hats—businessman, reality TV star, and U.S. President.

Pucker, a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, argues that former President Donald Trump’s new tariff strategy may do little to dent fast fashion’s momentum—but could end up devastating the already fragile progress being made in sustainable fashion.Pucker, a former COO at Timberland and longtime advocate for business sustainability, outlines how the fashion industry—already struggling with shrinking budgets for ESG initiatives—is now bracing for further setbacks as companies scramble to respond to Trump’s sweeping import duties. While some hopeful voices have suggested that the higher prices might finally curb consumer overconsumption, Pucker counters that the reality is more grim.“Tariffs will further constrain resources and challenge commitments aimed at sustainability,” Pucker writes, emphasizing that the deeper economic pressure is likely to accelerate cutbacks to already understaffed and underfunded sustainability programs. Sustainability on the chopping blockWhile Trump's surprise announcement of a 90-day pause on the steepest new tariffs helped calm markets briefly, a 10% base import fee and a massive 125% duty on goods from China remain in effect. For fashion companies dependent on Asian manufacturing, this spells a squeeze on margins—and likely, a race to the bottom in supply chain ethics.Pucker warns that history is repeating itself. Much like the post-pandemic “green reset” that never truly materialized, the tariff shock may offer temporary hope for slower consumption and secondhand market gains. But if previous disruption is any guide, fashion’s profit-first model will trump sustainability ambitions once again. From retreat to regressionThe article notes that sustainability momentum in fashion was already fading even before the tariffs. Major brands, despite lofty pledges like those in The Fashion Pact, are falling behind on emissions goals. Many have trimmed or eliminated sustainability teams entirely. When Nike restructured last year, it laid off many of its top sustainability executives.Now, as tariff-driven financial pressures mount, Pucker believes brands will likely retreat even further—cutting programs, squeezing suppliers, and leaving sustainability professionals burned out and unsupported.“In the end,” Pucker concludes, “until the structure and rules of the system change, fashion’s sustainability teams and results will continue to suffer.”","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/11/trumps-tariffs-wont-kill-fast-fashionbut-sustainable-fashion-might-not-survive","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-04-11/5880ohmd/00036Y67EK.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:18:11","author":"Anna Price,TDT","authors":["Anna Price","TDT"],"language":"en","source_country":"ph","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":309910418,"title":"Elon Musk's xAI is polluting air in Memphis, using more gas turbines than permitted, advocacy group says","text":"Elon Musk's xAI, the artificial intelligence startup trying to take on OpenAI, is facing scrutiny in Memphis, Tennessee, for alleged environmental violations at its data center.\n\nIn a letter sent to the Shelby County Health Department on April 9, the Southern Environment Law Center said aerial imagery and other data showed that xAI has installed \"a whopping 35 gas turbines,\" at its facility, sometimes referred to as the Colossus. The company only applied for permits for 15 turbines to power the data center temporarily, the letter said. \n\nMusk founded xAI in 2023 and has made the company the centerpiece of his AI ambitions as he engages in a high-profile business and legal battle with OpenAI, which he co-founded in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. Its flagship Grok chatbot is designed to take on ChatGPT. \n\nIn late March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired his social network X, formerly known as Twitter, in an all-stock transaction that valued xAI at $80 billion.\n\nLast year, the xAI team began training its AI models at the Memphis data center using 100,000 Nvidia H100 processors. The long-term plan for xAI is to use power from the local utility, Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, according to its permit applications.\n\nHowever, the turbines have an estimated power-generating capacity of 421 megawatts, which compares to the capacity of an entire TVA power plant, the SELC said. The company hasn't said when it would plan to shut off the turbines and switch power sources.\n\nSELC said in its letter that xAI is operating the higher number of turbines \"unlawfully without any air permit\" and that the local community had already been \"profoundly overburdened with industrial pollution.\"\n\n\"Worse yet, manufacturer-supplied emissions data for these turbines shows that xAI emits between 1,200 and 2,000 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) per year, making the facility likely the largest industrial emitter of NOx in Memphis,\" the letter said.\n\nExposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides, which are precursors to ozone formation, have been associated with higher risk of death from respiratory disease.\n\nMusk, who's also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is spending much of his time these days in Washington, D.C., as a central figure in President Donald Trump's second administration. Musk's primary role is overseeing an expansive effort to slash government spending and eliminate regulations, including those that potentially inhibit his businesses. \n\nSpaceX and Tesla have a history of running afoul of federal and state environmental regulations.\n\nThe SELC said it's likely that xAI has \"violated the Clean Air Act and Shelby County's rigorous preconstruction permitting requirements for major sources of air pollution.\" \n\nAmanda Garcia, an attorney with SELC, told CNBC in an email that, \"The Shelby County Health Department is the local entity charged with implementing the relevant air permitting requirements, and has the authority to hold xAI accountable under existing law.\"\n\nAt a Shelby County commissioners public hearing on Wednesday, residents expressed alarm at xAI's use of the natural gas-burning turbines, and the health problems that can follow without strong mitigation efforts.\n\nEaster May Knox, a resident who lives near the xAI facility, said her family has struggled with chronic respiratory problems. She said she wants to be able to wake up early in the morning and open the windows in her house.\n\n\"But when I open up that window, I smell everything but the right thing and the right thing is the clean air,\" she said. \"Elon Musk has all the money. He's a millionaire, billionaire, whatever kind of -aire he is. But we need clean air!\"\n\nOther residents and officials in attendance complained that Brent Mayo, a senior manager at xAI, didn't show up to hear their concerns after they reached out to him directly. Mayo is responsible for building out xAI's technical infrastructure, including in Southwest Memphis.\n\nRepresentatives for the Shelby County Health Department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nWATCH: xAI and X's future are intertwined","summary":"Elon Musk's AI startup xAI has installed 35 gas turbines to run its Memphis data center, though it only applied for permits to run 15, an advocacy group says.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/elon-musks-xai-accused-polluting-air-in-memphis-selc-says-in-letter.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107271046-1689253889759-gettyimages-1529571780-arriens-elonmusk230713_npTNn.jpeg?v=1744329014","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2025/M03D31/7000371258/1743424953-39148898691-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:17:19","author":"Lora Kolodny","authors":["Lora Kolodny"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":309907120,"title":"Nikkei drops 5% after Wall Street hit by tariff fears","text":"Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell sharply in early trading Friday, dropping 5.0% amid renewed investor concerns over U.S. tariffs that rattled Wall Street overnight.The decline followed a dramatic 9.1 percent surge on Thursday, when markets rallied after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on many planned tariffs.

Trump administration says it got map wrong","text":"The U.S. Forest Service will not log in designated wilderness areas like the Boundary Waters, federal officials clarified, days after issuing an emergency order intended to boost logging on national forest land throughout the country.\n\nThe order, issued last week, declared an emergency on some 113 million acres of national forest land, citing wildfire risk or damage by insects and diseases, and called for an increase in timber production on those lands to reduce wildfire risk.\n\nWide swaths of several wilderness areas, like the Boundary Waters, were included in that acreage total, and a map accompanying the order made no distinction between wilderness areas, where logging is banned, and non-wilderness national forest land, where logging is allowed but regulated. Locally, that caused concern that the order would lead to logging within the BWCAW.\n\nBut a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson said in an email to the Duluth News Tribune this week that logging wasn’t planned in designated wilderness areas. Instead, the spokesperson said other actions, like prescribed burns, would be used in those areas instead. The Forest Service oversees the Superior National Forest and BWCAW and is part of the USDA.\n\nThe 1964 Wilderness Act significantly limited logging in the Boundary Waters, and the 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act banned it.\n\n“The clumsy map that they put out shows how poorly planned this whole order was,” said Kevin Proescholdt, conservation director for Wilderness Watch. “Because the map showed logging would occur in all kinds of wilderness areas across the national forest system, not just the Boundary Waters. And I think, for me, it’s indicative just a slap-dash way in which the Trump administration is approaching this.”\n\nThe order was made in USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins’ April 3 memorandum titled “Increasing Timber Production and Designating an Emergency Situation on National Forest System Lands,” which itself was a response to President Donald Trump’s March 1 executive order “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production,” which urged the reversal of “onerous” and “heavy-handed” regulations and policies that Trump said “prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers.”\n\nRollins’ memo does not mention wilderness areas or prescribed burns, but in addition to authorizing the “removal” and “salvage” of trees, it promotes the more general “removal of hazardous trees” and promotes proposals that “reduce” fuels like vegetation.\n\nEven if logging remains outside the BWCAW, it could still cause disruptions, like noise, in the wilderness, Proescholdt said. He added that additional large-scale prescribed burns within the wilderness could bring activities like chainsaws to cut firelines and the landing of helicopters, which are illegal under the Wilderness Act except in emergencies.\n\nThe order encourages “expedited compliance” with the Endangered Species Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and Clean Water Act, citing authority from emergency provisions in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. A news release said it seeks to “increase timber outputs, simplify permitting, remove National Environmental Policy Act processes, reduce implementation and contracting burdens, and to work directly with states, local government, and forest product producers to ensure that the Forest Service delivers a reliable and consistent supply of timber.”\n\n“It’s in part to make up for the expected loss of wood products from Canada because of Trump’s stupid tariff war,” Proescholdt said. “But the essence of the order is that it’s trying to accelerate logging in the national forest and seeking to bypass or skirt around the environmental regulations that have been in place for decades.”\n\nThe Department of Commerce planned to increase import taxes on Canadian softwood lumber from 14% to more than 34%, Bloomberg reported Monday.\n\nActing Associate Chief of the Forest Service Chris French instructed regional foresters and deputy chiefs throughout the agency in an April 3 letter to boost timber volumes by 25% over the next four to five years.\n\n“Today, we enter a new era marked by pressing issues like a growing demand for domestic lumber and wildfire resilience. … To address these challenges, we need to increase our active forest management to improve both the prosperity of rural America and the health of our forests,” French wrote.","summary":"The U.S. Forest Service will not log in designated wilderness areas like the Boundary Waters, federal officials clarified, days after issuing an emergency order intended to boost logging on national forest land throughout the country.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SAMEER SURI and DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:01:07 BST, 11 April 2025 |Updated:01:13 BST, 11 April 2025 \n\nKanye West has issued a cryptic apology, weeks after publicly questioning the mental capacity of Jay-Z and Beyoncé's seven-year-old twins Sir and Rumi.\nThe original shocking comments about the children came amid a string of outbursts on X, in which West also took aim at his ex-wife Kim Kardashian.\nShortly thereafter, it was reported Beyoncé and Jay-Z were considering taking legal action against West over the 'vulgar and offensive' posts.\nWest then flew to Tokyo, where sources told TMZ he instantly became calmer, and he has since released a song seemingly confirming his wife Bianca Censori has left him. \nThis week, West posted to X telling Jay-Z he was 'sorry,' though he did not clarify whether he was specifically apologizing for his remarks about the twins.\n'I’m sorry Jay Z,' wrote West. 'I be feeling bad about my tweet but I still feel I gave my life to this industry and thought so many people were my family but when I needed family on some real s*** none of these rap n****s had my back.'\nDailyMail.com has contacted representatives for Jay-Z and Beyoncé for comment.\n\nKanye West has issued a cryptic apology, weeks after publicly questioning the mental capacity of Jay-Z and Beyoncé's twins Sir and Rumi; West pictured at this year's Grammys\nNot even one hour after his apology tweet, West switched course and posted: 'Do Beyoncé ever let Jay get p***y I mean like at least a couple times.'\nThe posts come about three weeks after a source told Page Six that Jay-Z and Beyoncé were 'discussing how they want to handle' West's tweets about their children, 'whether that be privately and/or in a legal matter.' \n\nEXCLUSIVE Taylor Swift's bombshell legal action against Kanye after shocking sex smear about star and two A-list men... as insiders say Travis wants to confront West 'man to man' \nThe insider also stressed that the superstar and Roc Nation founder, 55, 'will absolutely not stand for' how West 'has spoken about their children.'\nThey are said to have found the language he used 'vulgar and offensive' and do not currently have 'plans on publicly addressing Kanye’s X posts about their children.'\nAlthough West removed the original post, he clarified that he didn't taken it down to be 'a good person.'\n'I need everyone to know that I took the post about Jay Z and Beyoncé’s family down … because there was a possibility of my Twitter being cancelled [sic],' he wrote on X. \nA source also told the outlet that West's ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, is 'appalled' by the post and that he 'would use that kind of language about anybody, let alone when it comes to children.'\n'Kim has had enough and she’s done trying to be reasonable with Kanye when it comes to communication,' the insider added. \n\nWest posted to X telling Jay-Z he was 'sorry,' though he did not specify whether he was apologizing for his remarks about the twins - and he then lobbed a lewd query about Beyoncé\n\nLate last month it was reported Beyoncé and Jay-Z were considering taking legal action against West over the 'vulgar and offensive' posts; the couple are pictured in December\nThey went on to note that the reality star felt 'no matter what feud Kanye has going on with Jay and Beyoncé, kids are off limits' and his tweet was 'shocking and offensive.'\nThough Blue Ivy has been in the limelight ever since her birth in 2012, Beyoncé and Jay Z have notably been more reluctant to share as much about their twins with the world. \nIn fact, the twins have never joined either parent together at awards shows or red carpet events since they were born in June 2017. \nIt has long been believed that this is due to the music super couple's desire to help their children protect their privacy. \nDuring a rare candid chat about motherhood in 2024, Beyoncé admitted to GQ Magazine that she manages her schedule around her children so she is always with them. \n\nA source told Page Six that the couple are 'discussing how they want to handle this situation, whether that be privately and/or in a legal matter' (West seen in 2019)\n'My kids come with me everywhere I go. They come to my office after school, and they are in the studio with me,' she explained. 'They are in dance rehearsals. It's natural that they would learn my choreography.'\nShe also emphasizes her desire to keep their lives as normal as it could be considering their global fame.\nThe singer explained: 'One thing I've worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn't turned into a brand. It's very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art.\nMeanwhile, they have made blink-and-you-miss-it appearances in some of their mother's advertising campaigns for her clothing brand, Ivy Park.\n\nThe insider also stressed to Page Six that the superstar and Roc Nation founder, 55, 'will absolutely not stand for' how West 'has spoken about their children' (Jay-Z pictured with his daughters Blue Ivy, 13, and Rumi, 7)\nThe most recent images and clips of Sir seen by the public appeared in his mother's tour movie, Renaissance.\nHis sister, Rumi, most recently, joined her dad and older sister, Blue Ivy, at the Super Bowl LIX in February 2025 \nIn recent years, Beyoncé's parents Tina and Mathew Tina Knowles have shared insight into the twins' personality.\nTheir comments have highlighted the fact that Sir's absence from public events is simply due to the fact he is 'laid back and chill' and seemingly not interested in large public outings.\nIn 2020, Mathew gushed about his grandkids and said: 'Blue Ivy is just so incredible and reminds me of Beyoncé so much.\n'Sir, he just wants his world to himself. [His twin sister], Rumi, reminds me of [my daughter] Solange [Knowles].'\nMeanwhile, in 2019, Tina explained: 'The girl is really just going to rule the world, and the boy is kind of laid back and chills like the dad. [Blue] is the Queen B. The second Queen B.'\n\nThey are said to have found the language he used 'vulgar and offensive' and do not currently have 'plans on publicly addressing Kanye’s X posts about their children' (Beyoncé pictured with the twins)\nIn another chat with E! News, Tina stated: 'Sir is very quiet. He does all of the numbers stuff, so he's not into fashion as much.'\nShe also revealed that he is 'very, very smart' while Rumi 'is amazing — an amazing artist, painter, and creator. How could they be anything else, growing up in that environment? All we talk about is creativity and fashion.'\nJay-Z himself gave similar insight into the personalities of his children to Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller on the Rap Radar podcast in 2017.\n'Rumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter. Sir was like, man, came out the gate,' he boasted. 'He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir.'\n\nThough Blue Ivy has been in the limelight ever since her birth in 2012, Beyoncé and Jay Z have notable been more reluctant to share as much about their twins with the world\n\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z have never said that their twins suffer from any disabilities or medical conditions, apart from 'terrible allergies'\n'I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.'\nTo date, fans have only been given brief looks at the twins together in Beyoncé's documentaries, Homecoming and Making The Gift.\nBeyoncé and Jay-Z have never said that their twins suffer from any disabilities or medical conditions, apart from 'terrible allergies.'\nDuring her pregnancy with Rumi and Sir, she did, however, experience toxemia (also known as preeclampsia) and had to be on bed rest before, ultimately undergoing an emergency C-section.\n\nDuring her pregnancy with Rumi and Sir, she did, however, experience toxemia (also known as preeclampsia) and had to be on bed rest before, ultimately undergoing an emergency C-section\n'My body went through more than I knew it could. I was 218 pounds the day I gave birth. I had an extremely difficult pregnancy,' she revealed in her Netflix documentary, Homecoming. \nIn a personal essay for Vogue, published in 2018, the mom-of-three recalled being 'swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month.'\nAfter giving birth, her twins spent weeks in the NICU.\n'I was in survival mode and did not grasp it all until months later,' she wrote. 'After the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily, and in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery.'\nShe continued: 'I needed time to heal, to recover. During my recovery, I gave myself self-love and self-care, and I embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be.'\nKanye WestJay-ZKim Kardashian\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKanye West apologizes to Jay-Z after shock tweets about his twins only to then ask lewd question about Beyoncé\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Our focus remains on our dual mandate for price stability and full employment,’’ Ms Bullock said.\n\n“There are a lot of moving parts. We are bringing all this together to form an objective assessment of what it means for the outlook for domestic activity and inflation here at home.\n\n“Inevitably, there will be a period of uncertainty and adjustment as countries respond to the ongoing tariff announcements by the United States administration,’’ she said.\n\nMs Bullock said it was going to “take some time to see how all of this plays out and the added unpredictability means we need to be patient as we work through how all of this could affect demand and supply globally.”\n\n“Financial market and economic volatility can be expected as this process unfolds. But there are two points I want to make on this. First, we’re not currently seeing the same degree of impact as previous market events like in 2008 for example,’’ she said.\n\n“And second, the Australian financial system is strong and well placed to absorb shocks from abroad.”\n\nAs the fallout from the US President’s new trade war engulfs stock markets worldwide, there were fresh predictions this week of a US recession and rapid interest rate cuts.\n\nBut Mr Trump then announced a 90-day pause on his announced tariffs.\n\n“’Unpredictable’ is the word,” Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP, told news.com.au.\n\n“By the same token, I’m not surprised. Donald Trump is just so unpredictable that these things are par for the course.”\n\n“I think everyone went into hyper drive a little,” Dr Oliver said. “That was probably a bit far.\n\n“This development pulls back a little bit on those expectations, but I think we’re still going to get at least 25 basis points in May, and there’s maybe a 50 per cent chance we’ll get 50 basis points.\n\nData from comparison service Canstar shows a standard rate cut next month would slash $76 per month off the repayments on a $500,000 mortgage.\n\nIf it was super-sized, that figure would leap to $151 per month, providing some good breathing room for stretched household budgets.\n\nFour rate cuts in next 12 months\n\nDespite fears of a US recession, the economic fallout could have a silver lining for Aussie homeowners slashing up to $400 a month from the average mortgage over the next year.\n\nThe ANZ is now forecasting four 0.25 per cent interest rate cuts that could save homeowners with a $600,000 loan around $76 to $156 per month depending on loan size.\n\nA variable rate borrower with a $500,000 home loan could see their monthly repayments drop by around $76, while a borrower with a $1 million loan could see a reduction of $153.\n\nFor families with a larger $1 million loan size the savings could be worth $9000 a year.\n\nANZ chief economist Richard Yetsenga said he was not ruling out a 50 basis point cut – a double rate cut – in May.\n\n“We now expect the RBA to ease in May, July and August – 25 basis points at each meeting,’’ he said.\n\n“This would see the cash rate at 3.35 per cent in August. We do not rule out a 50bp cut in May if sentiment sours and the global growth outlook deteriorates sufficiently.\n\n“The tariffs are disproportionately stiffer for Asia. The impact on mainland China’s economy will be limited. Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam will be more vulnerable. US tariffs can significantly disrupt India’s exports.\n\n“We expect Asian currencies to bear the brunt of the adjustment to the announced tariffs.”\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 25 basis points in February, saving Australian homeowners with variable interest rate mortgages around $100 to $150 per month, potentially amounting to $1200 or more annually.\n\nNext RBA meeting could deliver a rate cut\n\nIn a stunning prediction, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the dive in the value of the Australian dollar – currently about 60 cents for $US1 – hinted at “around four interest rate cuts in Australia this calendar year”.\n\nAnd he’s predicted there could be a double rate cut as early as next month.\n\n“The next Reserve Bank interest rate cut in May might be as big as 50 basis points,” he said.\n\n“Forecasting is difficult enough in more stable times, but especially so in uncertain times.\n\n“Clearly a series of decisions are still to be taken around the world when it comes to how countries may or may not retaliate to the decisions taken and announced by President Donald Trump in the last week or so.\n\n“So, there is an element of uncertainty around the modelling and there’s an element of uncertainty on the economic impacts more broadly.”\n\nReleasing Treasury’s third updated forecasts on the impacts of the tariffs, he warned now was not the time to change the government.\n\n“Australia is better placed and better prepared than our peers,” he said. “This would be the worst time to risk a change of government, to a Coalition government, which would make wages lower, taxes higher, and who has secret cuts to pay for nuclear reactors.”\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said he wanted to assure people that in a world of volatility and uncertainty, Australia is better placed and better prepared than our peers.\n\n“Everyone with a super fund, everyone with shares, I think probably every Australian, is seeing what’s happening on global share markets and in our own share market with a degree of trepidation about all of this uncertainty,” he said.\n\n“So yes, we are concerned, and we’ll continue to engage. I’m concerned about the impact in Asia. If you look at the impact of some of the tariffs on Asia, some of them were quite high.”","summary":"The Reserve Bank of Australia has poured cold water over a major hope for homeowners in the coming

huge price war with rivals threatens Britain’s biggest retailer","text":"TESCO is flexing its muscles as a huge price war with rivals threatens Britain’s biggest retailer.\n\nThe supermarket — which yesterday toasted its highest market share in almost a decade — earmarked £400million for cuts to its groceries.\n\nThat sent a clear message to ASDA and other competitors that they will not be eating its lunch.\n\nThe move spells cheaper food for shoppers — despite warnings about inflation creeping back up.\n\nTesco took action after Asda — hit by a four-year collapse in sales — said it had a “substantial war chest” to fund a revival.\n\nAsda’s chairman Allan Leighton last month spearheaded a fightback — declaring the grocer would sacrifice its profits to slash prices and win back customers.\n\nThe move wiped £1billion off Tesco’s share price as investors realised its days of easy wins over rivals might be over.\n\nIn response, Tesco yesterday warned investors it would have to sacrifice some profits to adjust to the “more competitive market”.\n\nChief executive Ken Murphy said: “Competitors are clearly looking to defend the shares we’ve been taking.”\n\nAnd he suggested Tesco is largely cushioned from tariffs as the bulk of its supply comes from the UK.\n\nBut the chain warned this year’s adjusted profits could be as low as £2.7billion compared to £3.1billion reported for the year ended in February.\n\nIts sales rose by 3.5 per cent to £63.6billion during that period.\n\nBut Tesco finance chief Imran Nawaz said the company does not want to “constrain ourselves or not have the firepower to be as flexible as we need”.\n\nThe profit warning knocked its share price by almost five per cent to 318.7p.\n\nThe share price of rival Sainsbury's was knocked down by 3.56 per cent because investors fear it will find it harder to protect profits while punching against Tesco and a stronger Asda.\n\nAnalyst Clive Black of Shore Capital quipped that Tesco is “getting the knuckle duster out”.\n\nHe explained: “It’s basically saying take us on and we’ll win.”\n\nAn industry source said Asda would struggle to go head-to-head with Tesco because its private equity ownership is more financially constrained.\n\nTesco said that it plans to strip out another £500million in costs as it faces a barrage of challenges this year — including a £235million hit from increased National Insurance contributions.\n\nVersace deal is in the bag\n\nPRADA has struck a £1.1billion takeover of Versace in a deal that will bring together two of Italy’s biggest luxury powerhouses.\n\nMiuccia Prada, 75, continues to control the fashion house started by her grandfather, while Donatella Versace, 69, has stepped down from the business founded by her brother Gianni after 30 years.\n\nPrada is understood to have negotiated a £155million discount on the deal due to the impact on share prices of Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n\nVersace’s iconic designs have included the safety pin dress Elizabeth Hurley wore to the Four Weddings and a Funeral premiere in 1994 and the green palm outfit Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammys in 2000.\n\nWayve to go on AI in Nissans\n\nA BRITISH self-driving car start-up has signed a deal with Nissan to plug its tech into the Japanese car maker’s vehicles.\n\nWayve, founded in a garage by Cambridge University graduate Alex Kendall, has already developed AI algorithms for cars to drive by themselves.\n\nIts tech analyses real-life driving scenarios and controls a car’s steering wheel, throttle, indicators and brakes.\n\nThe AI system allows cars to “learn” while driving so they can react to situations in a “human-like manner”.\n\nNissan said the system is being developed for mass production by 2027 — but will require the tech to be used under “driver supervision”.\n\nThe firm said it was confident the tech will be successful in replicating “a careful and competent human driver”.\n\nWayve is already considered a rare British tech success story after raising $1billion last year from titans Microsoft, NVIDIA and Softbank.\n\nRETAILERS suffered a disappointing March as footfall fell by 5.4 per cent due to the late timing of Easter, the British Retail Consortium said.\n\nBut Mother’s Day provided a boost, driving a 13.4 per cent lift in high street footfall, compared to the year before.","summary":"","url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/34411183/tesco-price-cuts-asda-supermarket-war-business/","image":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shop-front-supermarket-chain-tesco-660699101.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11

The administration sent the planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, alleging that those on board were members of the violent gang Tren de Aragua (without providing any proof of their affiliation or providing them due process hearings beforehand). Lawyers for the administration argued that it had the right to deport the immigrants without due process under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\nHowever, just before Boasberg's deadline approached, Chief Justice John Roberts paused the deadline, and the Court allowed Trump to continue using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants without first providing them their day in court. The controversial 18th century legislation has only been used three times in U.S. history, with the last time being World War II, when former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt interned thousands of Japanese Americans without due process.\n\nAbrego Garcia was specifically protected by a 2019 court order preventing him from being sent to El Salvador, as he faced significant risk of persecution by the regime. The administration maintained that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, though it has yet to provide any evidence of its claim.\n\nClick here to read Politico's full report, and click here to read the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Invitation to corruption': Schiff reveals how Trump admin bends rules for 'personal benefit","summary":"In a decision handed down without any dissent, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is now ordering President Donald Trump's administration to immediately \"facilitate\" the return of a man it admitted was mistakenly included on a deportation flight to El Salvador.\n\nPolitico reported Thursday evening that despite its 6-3 conservative supermajority, SCOTUS is ordering that Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia be brought back to the United States.

The world's largest oil exporter enjoys bargain-basement fuel prices with a litre of petrol costing just 2.33 riyals ($0.62).Cheap fuel and prolonged periods of extreme heat in the vast desert country means big oil-consuming cars reign supreme.Saudi economist Mohammed Al-Qahtani welcomed Tesla's move, but urged more efforts by Musk's firm.\"We do not want a showroom; we want a factory,\" he said. \"We want to be part of the production process, not just consumption.\"A lack of charging infrastructure and the country's vast size mean that many Saudi drivers will view EVs as suitable for shorter trips, rather than as replacements for conventional vehicles.About 950 kilometres (590 miles) separate the capital from second city Jeddah — more than the maximum range of most electric car batteries.According to data platform Statista, before Tesla's arrival Saudi Arabia had just 101 charging stations, compared with 261 in the much smaller neighbouring United Arab Emirates.Although the Saudi EV market remains small, it tripled last year to nearly 800 cars, according to business news outlet Al-Iqtisadiyah.Authorities are seeking to diversify the economy, which relies heavily on oil, aiming to install 5,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2030.Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, now controls 60 percent of luxury electric vehicle company Lucid.It has also secured a deal with South Korea's Hyundai to establish a plant in the kingdom for electric and petrol-powered cars.Saudi EV brand CEER, launched in 2022, plans to start production in 2025.A vehicle from Lucid, which opened a factory in Jeddah in 2023 after a billion-dollar Saudi investment, costs $92,000.Last May, Chinese company BYD opened a showroom in Riyadh, selling more affordable electric cars.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/04/11/tesla-opens-first-showroom-in-saudi-arabia","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-01-05/4b8y8f40/TESLA-Cybertruck.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:04:48","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"ph","sentiment":0.132},{"id":309909160,"title":"Gold hits new record as traders seek safety from Trump tariffs anxiety","text":"Gold rose to a fresh record high as worries about the impact of tariffs on the global economy continued pushing investors to seek safety in the precious metal even after easing US inflation data.\n\nBullion advanced as much as 3 per cent to $US3175.07 an ounce, surpassing a previous peak reached earlier in the month.\n\nUnderlying US inflation cooled broadly in March, indicating some relief for consumers prior to widespread tariffs that risk contributing to price pressures.\n\nUS equities fell after the biggest buying in years while bonds rebounded after the print.

Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.\n\nRisks and uncertainty remained after US President Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause on higher tariffs that hit dozens of trade partners. On Thursday, Mr Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports are now at least 145 per cent, which includes both a 125 per cent rate that covers “reciprocal” duties as well as levies imposed on China for retaliating against US import taxes, according to a White House memo.\n\nThe latest development fuelled scepticism that trade talks will be wrapped up in a timely manner, despite the White House Economic Council director Kevin Hassett saying the US is “well advanced” in its discussions with economic partners.\n\nFinancial markets have been gripped with the Trump administration’s constant back-and-forth tariff plan, trying to find direction and certainty.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DAILYMAIL REPORTER \n Published:01:03 BST, 11 April 2025 |Updated:01:04 BST, 11 April 2025 \n\nOn November 12, 2021, Britney Spears celebrated 'the best day ever' when a judge called an end to her controversial conservatorship, as fans wept for joy outside the courtroom and her father Jamie's reputation appeared in ruins as the villian who had controlled every element of her life for 14 years. \nJamie spears insisted his control of Britney's finances, career and personal liberties was to protect her wellbeing, yet his daughter, now 43, claimed it was 'abusive' and likened her situation to being a 'sex trafficking victim'.\nAfter detailing how she was made to work against her will, forced into taking birth control and had no control over seeing her sons or friends, fans launched a #FreeBritney campaign, and rejoiced in their idol's eventual emancipation. \nHowever, more than three years on, some are now beginning to question whether they were too quick to celebrate, following erratic social media posts where she's danced with knives, claimed she burned down her bathroom and ranted about 'fake friends'. \n'I'm thinking her dad was correct in his guardian role, yikes,' one wrote on X, while another added: 'Well, everyone pushed her dad out of the conservatorship and pushed #FreeBritney and this is why her dad was controlling things. Be careful what you wish for.'\nJamie Spears, who is now living in a trailer and in poor health, remains estranged from his daughter, but last year he made a telling statement saying that his 'work as conservator has ultimately been vindicated', a viewpoint fans seem to be coming around to. \n\nMore than three years on from her conversatorship ending, some fans are now beginning to question whether it was really the best thing for Britney Spears (pictured this month)\n\nFor years fans championed the #FreeBritney campaign and openly wept openly outside the courtroom it was terminated (pictured: #FreeBritney rally in 2021) \n\nFor 14 long years Britney's finances, career and personal liberties were controlled by her father Jamie Spears who placed her under a conservatorship in 2008 (pictured in 2015) \n\nOn Wednesday, the star had a worrying meltdown as she slammed her 'fake friends' for criticizing her looks \n'Letting a documentary create public pressure to undo her conservatorship was a huge mistake. Turns out it was wrong to Free Britney,' others added in the wake of rambling videos where she's affected a British accent and spoken 'like a little child'. \nThe star had a worrying meltdown on Wednesday when she took aim at 'fake friends' for criticizing her looks, after sparking fan concern with a rambling video showing off her chipped nails. \nInsisting that she feels 'beautiful', she accused 'fake' people who claim to be her 'best friend' of jealousy, saying that she 'feels so sorry' for those who write 'incredibly sad comments' about her appearance. \n'I thought my hair was beautiful and I do have a cold and it has affected my voice,' she said as she explained why she was talking with a slight British accent.\nThe Toxic singer also bizarrely claimed that she would not be able to travel past the southern border for a few months, adding: 'I have been held back from going to Mexico for four months and since flying and travelling is the main thing for my health and well-being, I do have a small virus,' she continued.\n'They will do anything to keep me from living my life and in my highest manner,' she wrote. 'I feel sorry for people like that. Hopefully we can all be kind to one another.'\n\nThe noughties icon's most recent social media posts have left fans concerned for her wellbeing\n\n The truth about lonely Britney Spears' doomed romance with 'deadbeat' ex felon \nLast month, she sparked concern by claiming she had 'burned down' her bathroom and performing dance moves dangerously close to her open fire.\nAmid the unusual videos, Britney's romance with 'deadbeat' ex-felon boyfriend Paul Soliz fizzled out for a second time around Valentine's Day, according to a source who spoke with TMZ.\nThe former pair previously split in July 2024, before briefly reconciling in February this year.\nBack in May of last year, Spears notably sparked mental health concerns when she was pictured barefoot outside of the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood following an alleged fight with Paul.\nPaul and Britney first connected in 2023 when he began working at her home in a housekeeping and maintenance capacity and over time, things became more serious and the singer was introduced to his children. \nBut when the pair split for the second time, a source told TMZ the singer had 'realized her former maintenance worker-turned-boyfriend was only using her for the luxurious lifestyle.'\n\nA couple of days earlier, she sparked fan concern with a reel of herself showcasing her chipped nails and messy beach waves\n\nAmid the unusual videos, Britney's romance with 'deadbeat' ex-felon boyfriend Paul Soliz fizzled out for a second time (R) Soliz pictured in 2023\n\nBritney also sparked worry last month when she declared that she had 'burned down' her bathroom in a Instagram post \n\n'I burned my bathroom down today, ran like a maniac back to the house because there was a pie in the oven and I’m honestly tired of making sense of things these days!' she wrote \nNow single and at war with her family, it's unclear who the star has to rely on. \nHer father Jamie has insisted he still loves his daughter, but their relationship has never been repaired. \nAt the ended of 2023, he had his right leg amputated above the knee after he was struck down by a bacterial infection that landed him in hospital and nearly cost him his life.\nIn 2024, the pair finally reached a settlement over lingering issues concerning the end of the conservatorship and Britney was ordered to pay her father's $2 million legal bills.\nClearly unhappy with the outcome that saw her fail to hold her father accountable for the 'hurt' she alleges he inflicted on her over the years, Britney took to Instagram in the aftermath of the settlement, saying: 'My family hurt me! There has been no justice and probably never will be!'\nHowever, Jamie seemingly took it as a sign that his actions had been justified. \nIn a statement, his lawyer said: He has only ever wanted what is best for Britney, whom he loves very much. Jamie’s work as conservator has ultimately been vindicated and the world knows how hard he worked to protect her.'\nSo where did it all go wrong for Britney?\nHaving regained control of her social media in 2021, eyebrows were raised when Britney immediately began stripping off for nude selfies and filming herself dancing with a vacant expression.\n\nBritney was initially entered into the conservatorship on February 1, 2008 after she refused to relinquish custody of her sons to ex Kevin Federline and she was committed to the psych ward (pictured January 2008 at a hearing regarding visitation rights for her sons) \n\nHaving regained control of her social media in 2021, eyebrows were raised when Britney immediately began stripping off for nude selfies\n\nHer sons Sean Preston, 19, and Jayden James, 18, were said to be 'embarrassed' by her behaviour and admitted they were were in no rush to meet up with their mother \nHer sons Sean Preston, 19, and Jayden James, 18, were said to be 'embarrassed' by her behaviour and in a tell-all interview alongside their father they soon declared that despite a conservatorship no longer dictating when they could see her, they were were in no rush to meet up. \nJayden admitted 'it will take a lot of time and effort' to repair their relationship, explaining: 'I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better I really want to see her again.'\nBritney responded in fiery fashion that day with a freewheeling Instagram tirade in which she goaded Jayden to 'learn to pick up a book and read one before you resort to even thinking about my intellect sweetheart !!!'\nIt was clear tensions were frayed between the trio when her sons did not attend her wedding to Sam Asghari, 29, earlier in the year.\nThat union had also raised eyebrows among her inner circle.\nSam began dating Britney in October 2016 after he was cast as her love interest in the music video for Slumber Party. In October 2021, amid her legal battle to end her conservatorship, they announced their engagement.\n\nIt was clear tensions were frayed between the trio when her sons did not attend her wedding to Sam Asghari, 29, earlier in the year \n\nIn October 2023 fans called the police out again after Britney shared an Instagram video of herself dancing with knives that she later claimed were 'fake'\nHollywood star Octavia Spencer was quick to warn Britney in the comments that she should 'sign a prenup', yet later apologised for her remarks and insisted she had intended to 'make the couple laugh not cause pain.'\nFive months after Britney's conservatorship came to an end - in which she had been made to wear an IUD contraceptive device - Britney announced she was pregnant with the couple's first child.\nShe shared the joyous news in April 2022 but a month later she wrote on Instagram that she had sadly lost the 'miracle baby' which they both longed for. She said that they would keep on trying for a child.\nTwo months later, the couple were married at her home in Thousand Oaks.\nIt was certainly a fairytale spectacle, with the bride arriving in a carriage drawn by white horses and their hooves painted gold.\nShe told Vogue magazine at the time: 'We really wanted to make this a small and beautiful moment with family and friends.'\n\nSam began dating Britney in 2016 after he was cast as her love interest in her music video. In 2021, amid her legal battle to end her conservatorship, they announced their engagement (pictured 2019) \n\nHer immediate family (including her parents, sister, and brother) were not invited, however, and her two sons did not attend. \nTheir father Kevin's attorney told People that both sons were 'happy for their mum' and 'hopeful that Sam and Britney are starting a great future together.'\nAt the wedding itself there were signs that this wasn't a conventional union.\nThe first dance, traditionally a bride and groom only affair, was instead Britney plus Madonna and Selena Gomez dancing to the bride's hit Toxic.\nIt seemed to set the scene for marital life, with the couple splitting just a year later and citing 'irreconcilable differences'.\nBritney, thankfully, had taken on Octavia's advice and signed a pre-nup, yet is said to be paying around $10,000 per month for him to live in a high-rise apartment in Los Angeles. Their divorce is yet to be finalised.\n\nWhile she found herself facing heartbreak and loss, Britney's newfound conservatorship freedom did allow her to revive her much-loved music career (campaigners pictured) \n\nWhile she found herself facing heartbreak and loss, Britney's newfound conservatorship freedom did allow her to revive her much-loved music career.\nShe teamed up with Elton John to release Hold Me Closer - her first song in six years - and a remix of Elton's classic Tiny Dancer.\nFans went wild for the track, sending it straight to No. 1 in 35 countries, while Elton expressed its hopes that the success would 'restore Britney's confidence', noting she'd been left 'broken' by her conservatorship.\nHowever the eccentric dancing videos, pointed digs at family members and nude selfies continued, ultimately prompting the police to perform a welfare check on the singer.\nIn January 2023, fans urged law enforcement to check on the star as a result of her erratic social media behaviour, which saw her days earlier claim she had changed her name to River Red\nFans were concerned the singer - who had recently addressed a seeming 'manic' episode in a restaurant with husband Sam - was in danger after deleting her Instagram for for the seventh time in less than a year.\nDeputies from Ventura Co. Sheriff's Office were then sent out to her home home and determined 'there was no reason to believe she was in danger'.\nIn response, Britney took to Twitter to lament her lack of privacy and complained that she felt like she was being 'gaslit' and 'bullied.'\nAlthough she stressed that police never 'entered' her house and stayed at her gate, she said the situation went 'a little too far.'\nIn contrast with her usual bubbly Instagram posts, Britney's Twitter statement was unusually sober and reserved.\n'As everyone knows the police were called to my home based on some prank phone calls,' she began. 'I love and adore my fans this time things went a little too far and my privacy was invaded.\nShe clarified that, 'The police never entered my home,' and they apparently left shortly after arriving at her gate after finding 'no issue.'\nBut the run-in with law enforcement over the 'prank phone calls' still left her feeling accosted.\n\nIn another Instagram post last month, Britney admitted she feels 'vulnerable and exposed' as her 'body looks bigger'\n\nWhat is a conservatorship? \n\nA conservatorship is a legal concept whereby a probate court appoints a person to manage an incapacitated person or minor's financial and personal affairs.\nIt is often a relative. The terminology and details vary state-by-state, but the general principals are all similar.\nThe conservator's duties include overseeing finances, medical care and living arrangements.\nIn Britney's case, the conservators also oversee visitation arrangements with her two teenage sons, who are under the full custody of her ex-husband, Kevin Federline. \nIt is most frequently used for someone who is severely mentally incapacitated, or suffering from dementia.\nYet in the 13 years of Britney's conservatorship, she has released four albums - two of them going platinum; appeared as a judge on both The X Factor and American Idol; and had a four-year residency in Las Vegas that reportedly grossed close to $138 million.\nThe specific details of Britney's case have not been revealed. Unless a judge says otherwise, they still retain rights to make certain decisions, according to the California handbook.\nThey can control salaries they earn, spend an allowance, retain legal representation, vote in elections, get married, draft their own wills, make medical decisions for themselves and ask a judge to terminate conservatorships or replace their guardians.\n'All conservatees have the right to be treated with understanding and respect and to have their wishes considered. \n'They have all basic human rights, as well, and the right to be well cared for by you,' the California handbook says.\nBritney says that she has not had these rights. It is unclear whether this is a violation of her case, or as agreed.\nThere are two types of conservators: a conservator of the person, who looks after meals, housekeeping, transport, housing and recreation, and a conservator of the estate who manages finances and protects assets. \nSometimes one person can play both roles.\nThe conservator of the estate must file periodic activities reports by the first year after their appointment and every two years following, until the relationship is terminated.\nThe estate managers have to disclose asset values, gains and losses, and show receipts for all expenditures of conservatorship funds. \nThey are also prohibited from borrowing money from the conservatee or lending out their cash. Many countries have similar systems.\nIn the U.K. it is called a deputyship. In Britain, however, the court will appoint an independent conservator, rather than a family member.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe continued: 'This felt like I was being gaslit and bullied once the incident made it to the news and being portrayed once again in a poor and unfair light by the media.\n'During this time in my life, I truly hope the public and my fans who I care so much about can respect my privacy moving forward. All the love, B.'\nHowever, in October that same year, fans called the police out again after Britney shared an Instagram video of herself dancing with knives that she later claimed were 'fake.'\nShe later hit out at law enforcement, sharing on Instagram: 'Is it a joke in the news again with welfare checks??? Come on America … we cooler than that, right???\n'The officers came to my home and said they would not leave until they spoke to me as people do 4 minute performances with them,' she penned, and adamantly added, 'I am getting an apology.\n'I've been bullied in my home for so long now…ITS ENOUGH! Don't talk about it, come on, let's DO!!!'\nBritney then wrote, 'As my mom does the silent treatment when paps ask questions about her own daughter as if I'm in the wrong…nope it's an old game.'\nIn conclusion, she further slammed authorities showing up at her home and typed, 'People need to be responsible for their actions! It's about power for cops.'\nThe following month, Britney was able to have her say as she released The Woman in Me, an explosive memoir about her life in the spotlight and her troubles hidden in the shadows.\nIt included accounts of the conservatorship that for years granted her father control of much of her life and her revelation that she had an abortion while dating Justin Timberlake more than 20 years ago.\nShe shared a statement on Instagram in which she explained that she had no intentions to 'offend anyone' in regards to her memoir, adding she has 'moved on and it's a beautiful clean slate from here !!!'\nLast year, it emerged she had settled the lingering issues in the court conservatorship controlled by her father.\nBritney's lawyer said in a statement: 'Although the conservatorship was terminated in November, 2021, her wish for freedom is now truly complete.\n'As she desired, her freedom now includes that she will no longer need to attend or be involved with court or entangled with legal proceedings in this matter.\n'It has been our honor and privilege to represent, protect, and defend Britney Spears.'\nJamie's attorney, Alex Weingarten, said the settlement was confidential at the insistence of her lawyer.\nHe shared: 'Jamie has nothing to hide and would be happy to disclose everything about every aspect of the conservatorship so that the public knows the actual truth.\n'Jamie loves his daughter very much and has always done everything he can to protect her.'\nFollowing the settlement, TMZ reported that friends of the singer branded her 'completely disfunctional' and claim she is in a worse mental and financial situation than she was when she was under conservatorship.\nThe insiders claimed that Britney is suffering from 'shocking and radical mood swings' and has become increasingly isolated.\nOne source told the site that those who have remained close to the star believe she was doing better while under conservatorship.\n'She had lots of freedom in the conservatorship and the restrictions were there to protect her. She's not protected anymore,' claimed the insider.\nThe star was also alleged to be in danger of blowing her $60million fortune after splashing out over a million dollars for each of her monthly trips to French Polynesia and Hawaii.\nShe has reportedly spent thousands on private jets and five star resorts for regular holidays, with an insider claiming: 'She cannot afford this... she is in danger of going broke'.\nA noted Hollywood psychiatrist then claimed the best plan of action for Britney's wellbeing would be to place her under a new conservatorship.\nDr. Charles Sophy appeared on TMZ Live on Monday after the reports and revealed that he wasn't shocked to see the news at all.\n'No, it doesn't surprise me at all because the conservatorship was there for a reason, and even though, like you said, it might not have been with the right person, the actual process needs to be in place,' he said.\n'When you have a mental illness of this degree, you need that kind of structure, supervision, and most importantly, to take your medication.'\nIn 2019, there were reports that Britney was being held against her will in the conservatorship - that was allegedly supposed to end in 2009 after just one year - because the singer was refusing to take her medication.\n\nTIMELINE OF BRITNEY'S COMPLEX CONSERVATORSHIP AND HOW IT BEGAN\n\nBritney with her father, brother and mother in 2006.

She's slowly unraveling and it was in place and she wasn't unraveling. She might not have been happy, but she was stable... She needs medication. She's out of control.'\nInstagramBritney SpearsJamie Spears\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nToxic legacy of #FreeBritney: Star's increasingly erratic social media posts raise a troubling question - was her father's 'abusive' conservatorship right all along?\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Elon does DOGE, and the twain doesn’t meet,” Navarro told CNN. “That’s a tempest in a teapot and it’s in my rearview mirror and it’s in here. We’re fine.”\n\nThe tariff guru appears to have bigger things to worry about, anyway. \n\nSources told Politico that Navarro has been relegated to the sidelines of Trump’s trade team, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was placed at the helm and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick got the role of “bad cop.”\n\nNational Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett earlier revealed that only Bessent and Lutnick were in the room when Trump made the final call to pause his tariffs.\n\nPressed by CNN’s Hunt about where he was when the president made the big decision, Navarro said “you don’t have to be in the room.”\n\nNavarro claimed that multiple officials—including him, Bessent, Lutnick, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Vice President JD Vance—advised Trump during his decision-making process.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who’s in the room,” he said. “The boss calls it. Whatever. That’s not the point. The point is that this team is the best team in history. We provide them the appropriate set of advice.” \n\nAsked about the reported shifts in the trade team, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Politico that “Bessent, Lutnick, Greer, Navarro, and Hassett have all been part of the team and continue to be.” \n\nA White House official also told the outlet that Navarro remains “very much involved on trade and manufacturing.”\n\nA former administration official told Politico that Navarro didn’t lose clout since he never had any formal authority in the first place.\n\n“Navarro can’t be sidelined from negotiations because Navarro was never leading negotiations,” the official reportedly said. “He’s not a Cabinet member, so he doesn’t have legal authority over trade measures. His role is simply to advise the president.”","summary":"Getty ImagesPeter Navarro repeatedly insisted on Thursday that all is well between him and Elon Musk—no, really.\n\n“Elon and I are fine.

Crockett claims Americans can't afford a home or groceries due to Trump's immigration policies","text":"Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, blamed Americans’ continued struggles to afford food and housing on President Donald Trump’s border policies. Inflation was one of the key issues that dogged then-President Biden’s presidency, particularly since his partisan American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 compounded the problem. When Trump won the election, many ascribed his victory to not only confidence that he would reduce inflation, but that he would solve America’s immigration crisis, which has been his flagship issue since he first ran for office. CBS News host Major Garrett spoke to Crockett about this key issue, noting that there is a consistent, though slim, majority of Americans who back Trump up on immigration. \"Are you getting something wrong in interpreting where the public on that issue actually is?\" he asked. CHICAGO DEMOCRAT URGES OFFICIALS TO REMOVE SANCTUARY CITY STATUS AS RESIDENTS SUFFER: 'WE ARE NOT HAPPY' Crockett denied being wrong, arguing instead that the American people simply need to be better informed. She said the reason Americans can't afford things today is because of Trump's \"failed\" immigration policies. \"One thing I can tell you, is that if you sit down and you say, ‘Are you okay with your grocery prices? Are you okay with the fact that housing prices are going up?’ and you start to connect how important it is for us to have immigrants that are contributing to our country in this way, then, people may start to shift,\" Crockett said. The congresswoman claimed she had just spoken with a group in her office who told her \"we need to do more on immigration, because they don’t have the workers that they need, and they are in the construction realm.\" \"So I am telling you, this is a failed thing, but we have to do better to connect the dots and let people know the reason you can’t afford a home is because of these failed immigration policies,\" she claimed. \"The reason you are not going to be able to afford your food is because of these failed immigration policies. And the same can go for hospitality industries where we have so many of those in the hospitality industry that are saying they do not have the workers that they need right now.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday said that the consumer price index (CPI) — a broad measure of how much everyday goods like gasoline, groceries and rent cost — decreased 0.1% in March compared with last month, while it was up 2.4% on an annual basis.

A snap election is set for June 3.\nLee, who lost the presidency to Yoon by the narrowest margin in South Korean history in 2022, now enjoys a commanding lead in the polls. A Gallup Korea poll released this week showed him with 34 per cent support – nearly four times that of his nearest rival.\nHe stepped down as leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) on Wednesday to focus fully on his campaign.\n\nWith South Korea grappling with a political vacuum, rising regional tensions and growing economic uncertainty, Lee’s potential return is drawing fresh international attention. His focus on national interest and diplomatic balance has positioned him as a clear alternative to Yoon’s hardline, values-driven foreign policy.\n“It is important to maintain close ties with our ally, the United States, and to strengthen trilateral cooperation with Japan,” Lee said in the video announcing his candidacy.\n“But the guiding principle must be our national interest. We will cooperate where cooperation is needed and compete where competition is necessary while managing any frictions appropriately.”\nBalanced diplomacy\nThe message, aimed at both domestic and foreign audiences, aligns with what his foreign policy advisers say would be his approach if elected: repairing strained ties with China and Russia while preserving key security partnerships with Washington and Tokyo.\nLawmaker Wi Sung-lac, a former ambassador to Russia and senior figure in the DPK, said Lee would maintain overall policy continuity, with continued trilateral cooperation with the US and Japan forming the foundation of South Korea’s diplomacy.\n“Ties with China and Russia became unnecessarily strained under Yoon,” Wi told This Week in Asia. “Lee will maintain policy continuity while seeking to stabilise those relationships.”\nWi said Lee was also likely to pursue dialogue with North Korea in an effort to reduce tensions – though he acknowledged that would be a major challenge, given that inter-Korean relations are at their lowest point in decades amid Pyongyang’s expanding nuclear and missile arsenal.\nWi is one of Lee’s key foreign policy advisers, alongside Cho Byung-jae, a chair professor at Kyungnam University and former head of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy.\n“No matter who wins the election, South Korea cannot afford drastic changes in its US-centred diplomacy due to its geopolitical realities,” Cho said.\n\nUnder Yoon’s predecessor, liberal president Moon Jae-in, Seoul sought to deepen strategic ties with China, despite lingering tensions over South Korea’s 2017 deployment of the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system – a move that Beijing strongly opposed. In response, China enacted economic retaliation measures against South Korea.\nYoon sharply criticised Moon’s approach as “spineless diplomacy” and instead pushed for tighter alignment with the US and Japan, framing his foreign policy around “universal values” such as liberal democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\nIn doing so, he frequently provoked Beijing – a move seen as an effort to rally his conservative base. He once referred to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus”, and more recently accused China of interfering in South Korean elections, a claim he used to help justify his declaration of martial law.\n“When the next president is sworn in, both China and South Korea will likely seek to stabilise ties and move toward a strategic cooperative partnership,” said Cho.\nHe added that the coming Apec summit in Seoul this November could provide a venue for dialogue between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, amid rising trade tensions between the two powers.\nOn domestic issues, Lee has also emphasised pragmatic policies.\n“The most important issue for all of us is how to make a living,” Lee said during his announcement speech, invoking the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous adage – “It doesn’t matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice” – to emphasise his focus on practical, results-driven policies over ideological labels.\n“Whether a policy is red or blue – whatever its ideological origin – doesn’t matter. What matters is whether it’s useful and necessary. That should be the ultimate standard,” he said.\nBlaming “economic polarisation” for worsening social divisions, Lee also pledged to revive economic growth through major government investments in research and development and workforce training.\n\nComeback amid controversy\nDespite his loss to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, Lee was able to lead the DPK to a sweeping victory in last year’s parliamentary elections and currently enjoys strong support among liberal voters.\nLee had become the target of what his party called “politically motivated investigations” by prosecutors under Yoon, a former prosecutor general.\nLee was recently acquitted on appeal of a conviction for making false statements during his 2022 presidential campaign – a ruling that had briefly threatened to derail his political future. However, he still faces multiple ongoing trials, including bribery and corruption charges linked to a major land development scandal from his time as mayor of Seongnam.\n“South Korea has an unfortunate history of presidents who broke the law and were removed from power and/or imprisoned after leaving office,” Leif-Eric Easley said, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\nStill, Easley said it was unlikely that any of his legal cases would prevent him from winning the top office because “the judicial branch doesn’t want to be seen as deciding the presidential election”.\n“There is a general consensus that South Korea’s political crisis should end with a vote by the people,” he added.\nLee Jan-han, a political-science professor at Incheon National University, predicted Lee would emerge victorious in the coming race, noting Moon easily beat his rival Hong Joon-pyo in the 2017 snap presidential election held after then conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached.\nThe Gallup poll that showed Lee leading the race found that his top conservative contender, 73-year-old former labour minister Kim Moon-soo, had the support of just 9 per cent of voters.\nYoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) has yet to settle on a candidate and plans to hold a primary in May.\nWhen South Gyeongsang Governor Lee Cheol-woo, one of the PPP’s candidates, visited Yoon on Wednesday, the ousted president told him to win and protect the country’s “free democracy”.\n\n“President Yoon seemed very heartbroken, believing the Constitutional Court’s ruling had been overturned at the last moment [in favour of upholding his impeachment]. I’m worried because, unlike usual, he didn’t even have a single drink due to health reasons,” the governor said.\nBorn into poverty in rural North Gyeongsang, Lee Jae-myung worked in factories as a teenager before earning a law degree and building a career as a human rights lawyer focused on labour rights.\nHis assertive rhetoric and progressive welfare initiatives earned him national prominence as mayor of Seongnam and later governor of Gyeonggi Province.\nBut his confrontational style has also drawn sharp criticism from political opponents, who see him as an aggressive and reckless populist.\nAdditional reporting by Reuters","summary":"Lee has pledged to take a pragmatic approach to foreign policy and the economy in sharp contrast with impeached president Yoon Suk-yeol.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3305998/who-south-koreas-presidential-front-runner-lee-jae-myung","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/04/10/fed972db-18f0-4d9a-8365-5d05a6b8f3fd_529d1db4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:00:17","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.26},{"id":309911298,"title":"Luxury cars go full throttle into stagnation street","text":"Mumbai: Luxury car sales in India grew at the slowest pace in at least three years in the just-ended fiscal as economic uncertainties and stock market volatility weighed on consumer sentiment.

Tepid sales are forcing manufacturers to offer deep discounts on slow-moving models, some of which were produced in 2024, according to dealers.Sales at the local unit of German luxury carmaker Audi fell 14% in FY25 to an estimated 5,993 units from 7,027 units in the previous year. A spokesperson for Audi India could not be reached for a comment.“Purchase in the luxury segment is sentiment-driven. So, any impact on the capital markets does impact buying and may lead to postponement or deferment of purchases,” Santosh Iyer, managing director, Mercedes-Benz India, told ET. Frequent price hikes due to currency fluctuation also hit demand, said Iyer.Luxury car market leader Mercedes-Benz, for instance, raised prices of a few car lines twice in FY25 — in January and March — and is preparing for a third round of price increase soon, said Iyer. Since its peak on September 27, the benchmark Nifty has dropped 14.4%, while the Nifty Mid-cap 150 and Small-cap 250 indices slumped 18.3% and 22%, respectively, in the same period, led by foreign institutional selling and worries about the economic fallout of US President Donald Trump’s retaliatory tariffs.Mercedes-Benz, which saw its sales advance 4% to a record 18,928 cars in FY25, expects the industry to report flat to negative sales in the new fiscal year.Reflecting continued uncertainties and weak buyer sentiment, the company’s March quarter sales fell 12% to 4,775 vehicles. The decline was due to lower demand for entry-level models and marks the sharpest drop for Mercedes-Benz India in a decade, noted Iyer. “The stock market and real estateprices are one of the key drivers for the luxury car segment. Both have seen a lot of uncertainty in the last one year,” said Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Mobility. Additionally, a funding winter facing startups and rising debt levels have also impacted demand adversely, he said. BMW India, the second-largest in the segment, recorded a modest 3% rise in FY25 sales at 15,810 vehicles.JLR sold a record 6,183 vehicles, clocking a 40% increase, the company said in a statement on Thursday. The growth was led by Defender followed by locally manufactured Range Rover and Range Rover Sport sport-utility vehicles. Mercedes-Benz’s record numbers last fiscal came despite a 28% decline in sales of its entry-level luxury cars. However, sales of its top-end models, priced above `Rs 1 crore, surged 34%.“The last fiscal was almost flat for the overall luxury car market… the first quarter has been a bit more flattish. We expect the (flattish) trend to continue. At best the market will see a moderate growth of 2 -3% is what our projection for the balance of the year as well,” Iyer said","summary":"Luxury car sales in India experienced a significant slowdown in FY25, growing at just 3.31% to 51,500 units, a record high but a sharp contrast to previous years' double-digit growth. Economic uncertainties, stock market volatility, and frequent price hikes dampened consumer sentiment.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/luxury-cars-go-full-throttle-into-stagnation-street/articleshow/120174635.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120174629,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-129382,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:00:00","author":"Shally Mohile","authors":["Shally Mohile"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":309907876,"title":"Tensions arise over Speaker Mike Johnson's efforts to bring Rep. Elise Stefanik back into the fold","text":"WASHINGTON — When President Donald Trump withdrew Rep. Elise Stefanik’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, she was given private assurances that she would not only rejoin the House GOP leadership team, but also reclaim her coveted spot on the House Intelligence Committee, according to two Republican sources with knowledge of the deliberations. Two weeks later, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is still scrambling to figure out how to deliver on the promise to place her back on the committee, even after the move was announced publicly Wednesday. The conundrum for Johnson is that he has to either remove a Republican who currently sits on the high-profile Intelligence Committee, which could cause strife among existing members, or be forced to change House rules to add a member. House rules dictate that the committee may be made up of no more than 25 members with a maximum of 14 from one party, which is how many Republicans are currently on the panel. Adding a member would increase the size of the committee, which some members have already complained is too bloated. It could also force Johnson to allow House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to add another Democrat. In a statement to NBC News, Johnson’s office said the speaker and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., are committed to finding a solution to accommodate Stefanik in the coming weeks. “The Speaker will be working with Chairman Crawford and HPSCI members to get Rep. Stefanik reintegrated into the Intelligence Committee in the coming weeks,” a spokesman for Johnson said. “They both look forward to having her expertise back on the committee.” Stefanik’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. The awkward situation has created tension between Johnson and Stefanik, on the influential panel and within the broader GOP conference. Adding to the drama, three senior House Republicans say Stefanik strong-armed Johnson into publicly announcing her new leadership arrangement ahead of a key budget vote in the House for which her support was sorely needed. Johnson has yet to signal his intentions to the Intelligence Committee members, leaving several worried whether their spots could be on the chopping block. In private conversations hashing out Stefanik’s new arrangement, a source familiar with the discussion said, Johnson floated several Republicans whom he could ask to step down. They include Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas, who is the most junior Republican on the panel; Rep. Claudia Tenney, who, like Stefanik, is from New York; and Rep. French Hill of Arkansas, who chairs the powerful Financial Services Committee. Johnson appointed Fallon and Tenney to the panel on Jan. 16. But despite Johnson’s initial suggestions, no decisions have been made, and no members have been approached about whether they’d be willing to forfeit their spots, according to multiple GOP sources. “I think it’s a fluid process,” said a House Republican who is familiar with the discussions on the panel. “I think they’re trying to see if they bump somebody off to make room for her or whether they add two more — add a Democrat and a Republican.” The lawmaker opposed adding more members, saying the Intelligence Committee had already been “expanded twice in the last two years.” Johnson needs to tread carefully, as his past picks for the Intelligence Committee, which provides oversight of the National Intelligence Director’s Office and the CIA, have landed him in hot water with some members of the conference. Johnson upset moderates in the last Congress when he passed over more pragmatic members, like Stephanie Bice, R-Okla.; Zach Nunn, R-Iowa; and Laurel Lee, R-Fla., and instead named two controversial firebrands to the panel, Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. And Johnson this year booted the panel’s former chairman, Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who wasn’t well-liked in Trump’s orbit. Stefanik's role collides with key budget vote The consternation over how to accommodate Stefanik is just one example of the disruption Trump caused by pulling her nomination. And it’s a situation she may be using to her advantage, asserting her close relationship with Trump and the fact that her vote is crucial for Republicans in the narrowly divided House. On Wednesday, House leaders were preparing to take a procedural step toward adopting a budget resolution to advance Trump’s legislative agenda. At that point, Johnson had yet to announce Stefanik’s new role, even though there were behind-the-scenes talks. Stefanik, who hadn’t voted in the House since Trump withdrew her nomination on March 27, made the White House aware of the situation as officials were calling to whip budget votes, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Under pressure from Stefanik, Johnson decided to greenlight a public announcement about her new arrangement, the sources said. Stefanik then showed up to the Capitol for the key procedural vote, but she withheld her vote until the very last second, making her decisive in putting the measure over the finish line. Whether it was intentional or not, the maneuver was an unmistakable reminder to Stefanik’s colleagues that they need her vote, which is why Trump asked her to stay in Congress. Moments after the vote, Stefanik — who gave up her post as House GOP conference chair when she was nominated for the ambassadorship — publicly announced her new role: chair of the House Republican leadership, a post that will come with additional staff and resources. Stefanik also announced she will return to her positions on the Intelligence, Education and Workforce, and Armed Services committees. Stefanik and Johnson then issued a joint release about the news 2½ hours later. Some top Republicans, including other members on Johnson’s leadership team, said they were caught off guard by the announcement. Stefanik’s allies, however, note that Trump made it clear that he wants her to have a plum landing spot as quickly as possible and argue she has been nothing but the ultimate team player throughout the entire saga. There’s still a question of what kind of leadership role, if any, Stefanik would assume on the Intelligence Committee. In the last Congress, she had been one of its most senior members. Had she not been tapped for the U.N. post, she would have been in contention to lead the panel after Johnson ousted Turner. Johnson named Crawford as the new chairman and made Rep. Trent Kelly, R-Miss., the vice chair. But Stefanik would have more seniority on the panel than Kelly, “which would make her vice chair, technically,” said the House lawmaker familiar with the deliberations about the panel. And subcommittee gavels have been awarded already for the 119th Congress, the person said.","summary":"After Trump pulled Stefanik’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Johnson faces a conundrum on how to place her on a key committee.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tensions-arise-speaker-mike-johnson-elise-stefanik-house-republicans-rcna200647","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250410-elise-stefanik-ew-1230p-4afdf0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 23:59:25","author":"Melanie Zanona,Ryan Nobles,Scott Wong","authors":["Melanie Zanona","Ryan Nobles","Scott Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.031}]}
