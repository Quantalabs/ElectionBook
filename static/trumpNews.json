Email tips@dailymail.com By Chloe Louise For Mailonline Published:00:53 BST, 26 August 2024 |Updated:01:07 BST, 26 August 2024 e-mail View comments Nick Knowles is understood to be in the red just 12-months after launching a new business with his fiancée Katie Dadzie. The couple have branched into the competitive lingerie and sex toy trade, but the company they set up a year ago is believed to be losing money, reports the Sun. Figures show their company, Boa Boa - for which they are listed as company directors and have a 50 percent share - is £15,203 in the red after its first year of trading. As well as sexy lingerie, the brand also flogs sex toys including vibrators and lubricants. Their website, which has assets of £34,000 but still have bills to pay, says its undies 'can make us feel sexy, confident, and playful . . . and we want to help you feel that way!' Nick Knowles has reportedly started a business venture as him and his fiancée Katie Dadzie has started selling sexy lingerie But while the DIY SOS star, 61, and Katie, 34, (pictured) appear happy with their latest side they are believed to be losing money according to the Sun. Katie has turned heads by modelling its lingerie as her fans have continuously showered her with adoration and support. After sharing a candid clip of her relaxing on a bed in one of the company's two-pieces, her followers flocked to her comment box. It comes after Nick proved he was a man on a mission as headed to the gym amid his bid to slim down for Strictly Come Dancing. He was revealed to be part of the lineup this month and recently informed fans that he'd already lost a stone while trying to get fit for the show. His weight loss adds to the 2.5 stone he lost earlier in the year when he shed his lockdown pounds. He spoke out about his weight loss on This Morning in June, when Ben Shephard said he didn't expect Nick to be so agile while rock climbing. Laughing, Nick replied: 'No, I am 61 and you will have noticed, the newspapers, they pointed out, I put on a lot of weight during lockdown. 'I have lost about two and a half stone of it, I have got another stone to go.' It is said that figures show their company, Boa Boa, are £15,203 in the red after the first year of trading. The duo are co-directors of the firm and both reportedly have a 50 percent share Katie has turned heads by modelling its lingerie as her fans have continuously showered her with adoration and support Revealing the reason he signed up to Strictly, Nick said: 'I danced in Rio last year doing an Argentine Tango and I thought this is great. My elder sister was a ballroom dancer so I am the least talented person in the family.

Nick is a television presenter, writer and musician. He is best known for his presenting roles on the BBC, including game shows Who Dares Wins, Break the Safe and 5-Star Family Reunion. While Nick is being kept busy working out and training for Strictly he has also become a landlord after putting his idyllic Cotswold cottage up for rent for £1,600 a month. The presenter moved back into the property around 2017 after giving up 80 percent of his belongings for a simpler life. But Nick has made the decision to put his home on the rental market as he marks the next step in his relationship with Katie after their engagement last year. The semi detached property features an open plan kitchen/ living area complete with a log burner. Nick's love for gardening is clear to see as raised sleepers filled with flowers flank the front driveway while he has his own kitchen garden in the back. The garden overlooks stunning views of the Cotswolds countryside. Over the years, Nick has shared insights into his Cotswolds life on Instagram. Back in 2020, he reflected on giving up his London home to move out to the countryside. He wrote: 'In the Cotswolds deep mid winter. 'I chose to leave London, my home most of my life, almost three years ago - on days like today I feel blessed to have made that choice. I'm aware I'm very lucky to live here. 'So many people say they would love to live elsewhere abroad in the winter but I love the winters, the log fires and the hot chocolate with marshmallows... and I'm still joyful as a child every time it snows'. Nick was recently seen stopping off at a garden centre with Katie. The couple filled the car with plants, with the presenter seemingly keen to get to work on her garden. The presenter previously spoke about why he decided to downsize and get rid of most of his belongings.

Nick's love for gardening is clear to see as raised sleepers in the back He said on This Morning: 'I decided to change my life because I woke up one morning and went looking for my watch. 'I was living in a big house on my own and I went into a room I hadn't been into for a year and I thought 'well that's ridiculous'.' 'I chucked away 80% of my belongings and moved to a tiny little cottage in the countryside, because I've got a little boy and I wanted to make real memories.' He then went onto recall fond memories from his childhood, saying that he remembers the sentimental moments with his family rather than the size of the home he grew up in. 'My real memories when I was little were things like picking pea-pods in the back garden with my uncle and my dad and going for walks in the woods, it didn't actually have anything to do with the size of my house.' Nick has four children - three sons and a daughter. His youngest son Freddie was born in 2014 during his marriage to Jessica Rose Moor.

The Democratic gathering, which featured speeches from party heavyweights including Harris, President Joe Biden, and former President Barack Obama, drew in millions of viewers across traditional broadcast networks and cable news channels.Newsweek contacted both the Harris and Trump campaign via email for comment on Sunday.The opening night of the DNC set the tone with an impressive 20 million viewers, surpassing both the 2020 DNC opener (19.7 million) and this year's RNC kickoff (18.1 million). Day two of the convention saw viewership climb to nearly 20.8 million, with a notable spike to 21.9 million during Barack Obama's prime-time address. The convention's third day maintained steady viewership with 20.2 million tuning in, again outpacing the RNC's corresponding night, which attracted 18 million viewers.The final night of the DNC saw a significant surge in viewership, with 26.2 million Americans watching as Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. The audience peaked at 28.9 million during Harris' acceptance speech, surpassing the RNC's final night viewership of 25.4 million and its peak of 28.4 million during Trump's address.Demographics played a significant role in the viewership patterns. The DNC attracted a considerable older audience, with 15.3 million viewers aged 55 and above tuning in. The 35-54 age bracket accounted for 3.5 million viewers, while the 18-34 demographic drew in 851,000 viewers.Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as White House director of strategic communications under Trump's administration, commented on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, \"I know Donald Trump was not happy about that. It's a big deal. I think it speaks to that six in 10 Americans who didn't want the Biden-Trump rematch. Now, there's someone new, there's someone energizing. There's someone who would be historic if she wins.\"The DNC averaged 21.8 million viewers across all four nights, outshining the RNC's average of just over 19 million viewers. This success has brought a wave of momentum to the Democratic Party, which was once slightly trailing Trump while President Joe Biden was still atop the ticket.Griffin also praised the DNC for being \"a well-orchestrated convention that was a mixture of different kinds of policies, a mix of national security, having speakers from all over the country.\" She added, \"I think it held viewers' attention. But 75 days [until Election Day] is a long time. Donald Trump is a master at reclaiming the spotlight and getting eyeballs back on him.\"The convention's strong performance comes at a crucial time for the Democrats. Before Biden stepped aside as the Democratic presidential nominee on July 21, polling found that a majority of Americans didn't want a rematch between Trump and Biden. A January poll by Reuters revealed that around 67 percent of respondents were \"tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new.\"Harris' historic nomination as the first Black and Asian American woman to lead a major party ticket has energized the Democratic base. The convention featured a diverse array of speakers, from Hollywood stars like Mindy Kaling to notable leaders like former President Barack Obama and ex-first lady Michelle Obama.Trump reacted to Harris' speech live over his Truth Social account, repeatedly criticizing the vice president on her promised border policies. In one post, he wrote, \"Why didn't she do something about the things of which she complains?\" He also called Fox News immediately after Harris' speech, telling the network, \"She could have done it 3 1/2 years ago. She could do it tonight by leaving the auditorium and going to Washington, D.C. and closing the border.\"As the 2024 presidential race intensifies, both campaigns are likely to continue employing unconventional tactics to capture public attention and enthusiasm.

The database of 700-plus AI risks finds more attributed to AI systems (51%) than humans (34%), and were more likely to be seem after AI was deployed (65%) rather than during its development (10%). However, even the most thorough AI frameworks overlook approximately 30% of the risks identified across the factors surfaced in the database. The most frequently addressed risk domains include the following: “AI system safety, failures, and limitations” 76% of documents “Socioeconomic and environmental harms” 73% “Discrimination and toxicity” 71% Additional risks cited in the MIT database include “privacy and security” (68%); and “Malicious actors and misuse” (68%). In contrast, “human-computer interaction” (41%) and “misinformation” (44%) were of somewhat less concern. These benchmarked risks will help develop a greater understanding the risks versus rewards of this new force entering the business landscape. However, the challenge is understanding exactly when the threshold in which rewards surpass risks is crossed. Industry experts and leaders say we’re not yet at that point.

John Gotti III Results: Winner And Reaction Apple iPhone 16 Release Date: New Report Hones In On Precise Date It ‘Ends Now’—Donald Trump Reveals Surprise Assault On ‘Crooked’ Wall Street \"Introducing new technology is always a major challenge in any organization, and AI is pretty complex,” W. Raghupathi, professor at Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business, told Forbes. “The scale, complexity and difficulty in implementation and deployment, the upgrades, support, etc are technology-related issues. Further, privacy, security, trust, user and client acceptance are key challenges. Justifying the cost — and we do not have good measurement models — is a major challenge.\" Adding to this challenge is the almost blinding speed at which AI is being adopted — before any known and unforeseen risks are surfaced. “We need to act fast and think even faster, answering questions about how best to showcase the value AI can add to the enterprise — and whether it’s worth the risk,” said Jay Jamison, president of product and technology at LogicGate. “There are a wide range of AI solutions that may be able to improve efficiency, but how should they be measured against factors like regulatory guidelines, security risks, and additional governance needs?” It’s likely even too soon to tell whether the rewards of AI are outweighing the risks, Raghupathi states. \"There is a lag between deployment of applications and their impact on the business. Specific applications like low-level automation find success but high-level applications that support strategy are yet to translate into tangible benefits.\" It’s going to take time — perhaps years — “to assess the impact and benefits of complex applications versus simple applications automating specific routine and repetitive tasks,” Raghupathi points out. “Measuring the benefit is new and we do not have benchmarks or quantitative models.\" AI may be seeing most of the industry hype right now, but, inevitably, the hype will die down as newer generations of technology and approaches generate the excitement. As the hype around AI recedes — if not pushback — companies will be taking a second, and third, look at its risks versus rewards. “As the technology becomes more powerful, AI will demand more and more energy – and costs will inevitably go up,” Jamison pointed out. “Right now, AI is both highly valuable and relatively inexpensive, allowing a wide range of organizations to enjoy its benefits. But that won’t be the case forever. Eventually, the bill will come due.” Stronger AI governance is needed to develop a more telling risk assessment. “Organizations must consider how and why they plan to use AI and identify the potential risks that stem from its use,” said Jamison. “You can’t afford to turn a blind eye – it’s critical to have a plan in place that addresses how these AI solutions can be used both safely and effectively.” Follow me on Twitter.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real time, falsely insisted that, “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance says Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vance claims Trump will reject bill proposing federal abortion prohibition first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/vance-claims-trump-will-reject-bill-proposing-federal-abortion-prohibition/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724630275_rewrite-this-title-Trump-would-veto-legislation-establishing-a-federal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:58:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":254906738,"title":"Drone attack kills at least 21 civilians in northern Mali, Tuareg-led group says","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Toronto police release new photo of man wanted for murder in deaths of two relatives Toronto police have released a new photo of a 33-year-old man they are seeking in connection with the deaths of his two female relatives.

He contended that Harris, like Clinton, won her nomination “by anointment,” and predicted that the Democratic Party will anoint one of their candidates again should Harris lose to former President Donald Trump this November. “Now I’m not saying she’s going to lose, but I would have never let that happen if I’m selling a business,” O’Leary said on Fox News’s Fox and Friends Saturday. “I tell my managers, ‘Never bring me one offer, bring me a process, show me there’s no other bid out there that I want, then I’ll make a decision if I’m selling.’ I was amazed they didn’t do that here, because Newsom made reference to it, there may have been other candidates, or she could’ve emerged much stronger. But they didn’t do that. That may prove to be a huge mistake.” Regarding who will win the 2024 election, O’Leary said Harris’s chances are currently “50-50.” O’Leary was also asked how Trump’s campaign could keep the 2024 election focused on policies, prompting the Shark Tank co-host to focus on the swing states. He contended voters in swing states care about policy “more than anything else,” and that these voters are “the people that are going to decide,” and the candidates would be wise to focus their attention on these voters. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Earlier this month, O’Leary argued that Harris must “distance herself” from President Joe Biden and Bidenomics, a term the president touted as his administration’s work on the economy. O’Leary described Bidenomics as “radioactive waste” for voters. He also stressed the need for Harris to clarify her policies and demonstrate her ability to do so without a teleprompter, as “that’s going to be where the tire hits the road.” Polling data indicate Trump has 49% support among likely voters, a small lead over Harris, who is at 46%. The former president’s lead has narrowed slightly from the week prior when Harris was trailing Trump by 4%.","summary":"Shark Tank star and international businessman Kevin O’Leary predicted a loss by Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 could create a ripple effect in the Democratic Party.

Lionel McGloin, who runs the ‘no cap on god’ YouTube page, spent the week in Chicago and talked to some of the big stars of the DNC and spoofed the ‘brat’ theme of many Kamala Harris supporters. His best answers came from some of the average attendees, including one who said ‘yes queen’ to ideas as wild as free abortions, gender-affirming care for minors and higher tax brackets for rich white men. However, to show the groupthink of liberals, he got New York Congressman Jerry Nadler to agree to something similar in the same video. ‘If we have a Democratic Congress, we certainly will,’ Nadler told McGloin. One male attendee explained to McGloin why Harris appeals to liberals. ‘She’s brat,’ he said, referencing the Charli XCX album that has become a meme among the left. ‘Brat is like, you’re a party girl but you go out really late at night and you fall asleep with your makeup on,’ the man said. But by far, the funniest answers came from some of the progressive attendees, including one who couldn’t decide between living in a democracy or legalizing abortion. ‘I feel like that’s almost not possible to answer, I couldn’t pick one or the other,’ she said, before leaning toward abortion access over democracy. He later asks one woman a series of ‘yes queen’ or no queen’ questions about whether she’d want free abortions, gender-affirming care for migrants, banned standardized testing and higher taxes for rich white men. Another young woman dished on the secret of working in Democrat politics in Washington is that Republican men are more attractive the left-leaning ones, but the GOP men ‘are evil’. McGloin also spoke to both Kellyanne Conway and her daughter Claudia, who revealed she was going against her ex-Trump advisor mother to endorse Harris. The host at one point got Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey to consider legalizing cocaine. Overall, the progressives seemed to have fallen in line with what California Governor Gavin Newsom joked was a ’30-minute primary’ to support Harris unconditionally. They’ve also fallen in line on the ‘brat’ meme in support of Harris, a key organ in the fight against Donald Trump among Gen Z. More than 41 million Gen Z voters will be eligible to cast ballots in the 2024 election across the country including more than eight million young voters who are newly eligible to vote since the 2022 midterms. It’s the first presidential election playing out on TikTok and with more online influencers and streaming options than ever before, so the campaigns are utilizing many avenues to reach the next generation where they are. It’s an extremely diverse generation. Nearly half of Gen Z youths are people of color. One in five identifies as LGBTQ+. Not only are they more diverse, they participate. As Democrats and Republicans work on engaging young people, an exclusive new poll for DailyMail.com shows Harris is seeing a surge in support when it comes to voters ages 18 to 29 compared to when President Biden topped the Democratic ticket. It found 48 percent of young voters now back Harris while just 32 percent back Trump. 9 percent support independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. When the same polling was conducted in July, Harris had 37 percent support and Trump had 26 percent support, the poll conducted by J.L. Partners found. With that, the campaigns are taking multiple approaches to reaching the key group of voters. As President Biden exited the presidential race and Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket, TikTok and other social media platforms have been a huge asset in the first few weeks of her campaign. It was as if the internet was taken over by supporters using coconut emojis and palm trees as older voters had to ask their kids and younger colleagues what it means to be ‘brat’ following pop star Charlie XCX’s endorsement on X ‘Kamala IS brat.’ The @KamalaHQ account now has more than 3.4 million followers with its following doubling overnight on from Sunday, July 21 to Monday, July 22 after Biden’s exit, according to the campaign. Its number of followers has grown to more than eight times what it was when it was @BidenHQ, making the @KamalaHQ TikTok the most followed Harris social media asset of her entire campaign. With its rebranding, @KamalaHQ has pulled in more total views on TikTok than Donald Trump’s account with more than 462 million video views and 66 million likes. The campaign is using a mix of viral moments and trends in an effort to break through to voters across platforms in a fragmented media environment. Behind the humor and memes, the campaign said it is focused on forcing a visual contrast between Harris and Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA prankster infiltrated the Democrat National Convention and coaxed some shocking answers&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A prankster reveals the disturbing behaviors of a group during a funny video, featuring a brainwashed girl giving absurd responses. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/a-prankster-reveals-the-disturbing-behaviors-of-a-group-during-a-funny-video-featuring-a-brainwashed-girl-giving-absurd-responses/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-DNC-cult-exposed-by-prankster-in-hilarious.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:48:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":254906586,"title":"Honeymoon cash: Harris team reports $540M haul","text":"In the just-more-than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris stepped into the political limelight her campaign for the White House has raised an historic $540 million. According to the Harris Walz campaign, that sizable amount is “a record for any campaign in history.” “Not only are our volunteers doing the work, but this week we saw unprecedented grassroots donations. Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark. Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day,” the campaign said in a Sunday morning memo. According to the Harris camp, a third of the donations made to the campaign are from first-time political donors, most of whom are women. “Almost one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds of which were women — both of which are poised to be deciding constituencies in November,” the campaign said. “Teachers and nurses also continue to be among the most common donor occupations.” The campaign used the convention, they say, to launch a massive organizing effort. Volunteers agreed to staff more than 200,000 shifts in the coming weeks aimed at mobilizing voters, they said, and that’s after volunteers completed 10,000 shifts in the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention and contacted more than one million voters. “On Thursday and Friday alone, volunteers signed up for 90,000 shifts, motivated by the extraordinary excitement around the Vice President’s speech. We head into September with a virtual army of volunteers ready to do the hard work of talking to their neighbors, friends and colleagues. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s battleground infrastructure remains incredibly sparse,” the campaign wrote. Trump has proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump’s campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. Trump is scheduled to address the National Guard Association of the United States’ at their 146th General Conference and Exhibition in Detroit, Michigan on Monday, and he’s set to give remarks in Grand Rapids on Tuesday. Trump will stop in Potterville, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin, on Thursday. Trump has a rally schedule for Friday in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. According to Trump’s MAGA 2024 campaign pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Travis Tunis, the enthusiasm suddenly seen behind Harris’s campaign is nothing more than the “honeymoon” period following her ascension to the top of the ticket. The “Harris honeymoon,” they say, will eventually fade. “We’ve certainly had a front row seat to the ‘honeymoon.’ In fact, the Media decided to extend the honeymoon for over 4 weeks now,” they said in a statement. “But even after all the fawning coverage of Harris and negative coverage of President Trump, we find this race fundamentally tied.” As of Sunday there were 72 days left until the November 5 general election. According to polling averages maintained by RealClearPolitics and 538, Harris leads Trump by 1.5% and 3.6%, respectively.","summary":"“We’ve certainly had a front row seat to the 'honeymoon.'

The sibling's fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the iconic Britpop band. In recent years, Liam, 51, has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform Oasis, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. But as Liam closed his set at Reading Festival he teased that an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts.

They know this reunion will go down in music history'. MailOnline have contacted Noel and Liam's reps for comment. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour. After Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday night, Liam, 51, performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' A source said: 'Noel and Liam are never going to be the best of friends but they want to bring Oasis back for the fans' (pictured 1999) Before adding: 'He spoke to Liam on the phone and they are on the same page. They know this reunion will go down in music history' (pictured 2003) During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday night, Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen. It then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. Liam has been touring the UK this summer on his Definitely Maybe tour to celebrate the 30 years since its release in 1994. Noel has been notably absent from the concerts, but during a show in Cardiff Liam made a point of dedicating Half The World Away to his 'little brother', saying he is 'still playing hard to get'.

I’m on the road this Monday on a little solo trip, but I’ll still be writing my Wordle and Mini Crossword guides. Buckle up, let’s do this thing! The NYT Mini is a smaller, quicker, more digestible, bite-sized version of the larger and more challenging NYT Crossword, and unlike its larger sibling, it’s free-to-play without a subscription to The New York Times. You can play it on the web or the app, though you’ll need the app to tackle the archive. One good tactic with crossword puzzles is to try to get as many ACROSS as possible first and then you’ll find a lot of the DOWN are already done—or vice versa if the ones ACROSS are trickier. While some of today’s words are pretty simple, some might have you stumped. You’ll find the answers below. Spoilers ahead, obviously. Skip ahead for the image of today’s solved puzzle.

But Kolb was stunned by what he saw when Walz left the military and entered politics. Walz retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for U.S. Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. Then during the campaign, Walz overstated the rank he held at the point he left the service. “That is not the behavior I would expect out of a senior noncommissioned officer,” Kolb said in an interview. Those two sides of Walz’s service have been in the spotlight now that the Minnesota governor is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Supporters have lauded Walz’s 24 years of service in the National Guard, where he rose through the enlisted ranks and received an honorable discharge. “What I know about Tim Walz is he did his job diligently,” said retired Minnesota National Guard Brig. Gen. Jeff Bertrang. “He was in charge of troops under him, and he made sure they were taken care of.” Republicans have seized on criticism by Guard veterans as a major line of attack on Walz and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Some of that criticism, like Kolb’s, is measured. Others offer harsher appraisals. It’s far from clear whether Republicans can turn Walz’s military record into a liability. His decades of service stand in contrast with former U.S. president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that Trump suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, was a Marine Corps corporal, including six months as a military journalist in Iraq. After four years, he left the military for college and later a career in venture capital and as a best-selling author. Vance has led the criticism of Walz. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories For many Democrats, the GOP salvos are an eerie reprise of the tactics used to sully their 2004 presidential candidate, John Kerry, by questioning his leadership as a swift boat commander in Vietnam, even though Kerry was a decorated combat veteran and his Republican opponent, resident George W. Bush, did not fight in the war. But the criticism stems not so much from Walz’s service record but from how he has characterized his time in uniform and how he ended his tenure. An Associated Press review of Walz’s statements as a congressional candidate, congressman and governor shows that Walz has toggled between being precise and careless about key details. Walz’s supporters reject the criticism as politically motivated and say it denigrates the sacrifices he and other troops have made. The Harris campaign provided a letter signed by hundreds of veterans and military family members that said Vance’s broadsides against Walz are not surprising given reports that Trump expressed disdain for those who served. Trump has denied the claim. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as vice president of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” the campaign said. In a speech this past week at the Democratic National Convention, Walz said he “proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years.” He made no reference to his rank or the circumstances of his retirement, framing his service as part of a larger urge to “contribute” to the nation. Distinction with a difference “I’m a retired command sergeant major,” Walz said in 2006 as he campaigned to unseat the six-term Republican incumbent in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. But that statement was not true. Walz served briefly as a command sergeant major, but that was not the rank he held at retirement. It is not clear whether Walz repeated the exact claim after he won the House race, but he did not object when colleagues put the honorific before his name during House debates to underscore his gravitas on military matters. That distinction -– serving as a command sergeant major, but not retiring in that position -– may seem minor to civilians. But to those in uniform, it is not. Rank is revered in the army. Known as an E-9 in military parlance, a command sergeant major is the pinnacle of achievement in the army’s enlisted corps. Command sergeants major are the backbone of a unit, acting as mentors and disciplinarians to the enlisted troops and trusted advisers to their commanding officers. Sergeants major often stay in their units for long stretches, providing a deep well of institutional knowledge. Commissioned officers typically move on to new posts every few years. “There’s a reason why there’s so much angst about this among military members that maybe is lost on the rest of the population,” Kolb said. “The rank of command sergeant major, that E-9 rank, is sacred. It’s rare.” Walz was command sergeant major of the Minnesota Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery for less than a year, according to the Guard’s personnel office. His rank was reduced for benefit purposes to master sergeant, a step below, when he left the Guard because Walz had not completed all the coursework necessary to hold the rank in retirement. Facing questions about Walz’s record, the Harris campaign replaced the phrase “a retired command sergeant major” from Walz’s online biography with wording that says he served as one. But Walz’s official biography on the Minnesota governor’s website is still misleading. That biography places “retired from” a Guard battalion after the phrase “Command Sergeant Major Walz.” “He’s a retired master sergeant,” Kolb said. “And that’s what he should say.” The campaign also acknowledged that Walz misspoke in a 2018 video posted on social media that recorded him saying “weapons of war that I carried in war.” Vance seized on the comment to accuse Walz of lying about being in a combat zone when he never was. Walz and other Guard troops were sent to Italy in 2003 to provide base security in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Pentagon’s name for the war in Afghanistan. Questions about Walz mischaracterizing his personal story have not been limited to military service. He is also facing scrutiny for how he has described his family’s struggle with infertility. He has implied that he and his wife used in vitro fertilization to conceive, drawing a connection between their experience and efforts to limit the procedure. But they actually used intrauterine insemination treatments, a different process that has attracted less controversy. Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokesperson, defended Walz’s comments and denied that he had been misleading. She said Walz “talks how normal people talk” and was using ”commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” Leaving the Guard By military standards, Walz’s 24 years of service is substantial. He could have retired almost three years earlier. But it is the circumstances surrounding the retirement and how it overlapped with his political ambitions that have drawn scrutiny. In January 2005, Walz attended a boot camp of sorts in Minnesota for people interested in careers in progressive politics. Walz, a teacher and avid pheasant hunter with blue-collar roots, stood out as a candidate who might win in the state’s strongly Republican 1st Congressional District. Minnesota Democratic party officials had already begun to take notice of Walz. Mike Erlandson, the party’s state chair at the time, recalled the enthusiasm one of his aides brimmed with after meeting with Walz in Mankato, a town about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis where Walz taught high school geography. “He came barging into my office at the state party, saying, ’Mike, this guy Tim is the real deal,’ and was very excited about Tim Walz and the prospect of him running for Congress,” Erlandson said. By February, Walz announced that he was considering a run for Congress. But thousands of miles away, the war in Iraq had entered its third year and hopes for a speedy U.S. withdrawal were evaporating. In mid-March, Walz’s battalion was notified of a possible deployment to Iraq. In a campaign news release, Walz said he would stay in the congressional race “whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.” He had a responsibility, the release said, to ready his battalion for war “but also to serve if called on.” Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp Less than two months later, on May 16, 2005, Walz retired from the National Guard. His departure was not unusual. More than 730 senior enlisted soldiers with 24 years of service retired in 2005 when the U.S. was heavily engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Defense Department statistics. But Doug Julin, a Minnesota Guard command sergeant major senior to Walz, told CNN on Aug. 8 that Walz had assured him just weeks before that Walz would be going forward with the battalion. Julin, who did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press, said he was surprised to learn Walz left the Guard without first discussing the decision with him. This photo provided by Thomas Behrends, a retired Minnesota Guard command sergeant major, shows him in Iraq in 2006-2007. (Courtesy Thomas Behrends via AP) Kolb picked Tom Behrends, who has emerged as Walz's most biting critic, to replace Walz as the 1st Battalion’s command sergeant major. The unit received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in mid-July 2005 and a few months later headed to Mississippi for training. The unit shipped to Iraq in March 2006 where it would spend the next 16 months. Later that year, Walz, unopposed in the Democratic primary, would pull off an upset, beating Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Questions about Walz’s military record had percolated during that campaign. A letter to the editor in the Mankato Free Press newspaper from a person identified as Maj. Walter Gates said information about Walz’s military career strongly suggested that Walz had fought in Iraq or Afghanistan. To which country did Walz “deploy downrange”? Gates asked. Walz responded by saying the letter appeared to be an attempt to “slander my good name.” Walz wrote, incorrectly, that he retired as a command sergeant major, but accurately specified that he served on three NATO training missions and in Italy. Walz was equally clear about his wartime service in a 2009 interview with the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project. Gates did not respond to multiple messages from the AP so it is unclear what information he was referring to. Walz, in the early 2005 campaign news release, did not mention Italy when he said he deployed for eight months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, phrasing that could imply he served in Afghanistan. A 2006 congressional campaign ad described Walz as a soldier who had served for two decades and was “ready when they attacked.” Joe Eustice, who took over for Behrends as the 1st Battalion’s top enlisted soldier, said Walz was entitled to leave the Guard when he did. “When you’ve given 24 years of your life, you get to decide, and your reasoning can be whatever you want it to be,” said Eustice, who retired in 2014. But he is troubled by Walz’s statements after he left the Guard. “He should answer to the fact that he said he carried a weapon in war and explain why he’s been saying he’s a retired sergeant major,” Eustice said. “Those two things are not true, and he should know better.” A longtime foe Almost two decades have passed since Behrends hurriedly took Walz’s place as the 1st Battalion's senior enlisted soldier. Yet time has not eased Behrends' anger at his predecessor. As Walz’s political career flourished, Kolb advised Behrends to let go of the resentment. But Behrends could not. Not when he read and heard Walz inaccurately referred to as a retired command sergeant major – and Walz failed to set the record straight. After yet another local newspaper elevated Walz’s retirement rank, Behrends wrote to the then-congressman. “It saddens me that after your long career in the National Guard, that you did not fulfill the conditions of your promotion to command sergeant major,\" he told Walz. \"I would hope that you haven’t been using the rank for political gain, but that is how it appears.” Behrends said he did not get a reply. When Walz ran for governor two years later, Behrends went public with much stronger criticism. A self-described “down-home country boy,” Behrends did not like Walz personally. They are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Behrends is a conservative who donated US$250 to Trump's 2020 presidential campaign and supported Walz's Republican opponents in Minnesota. While they were both still in uniform, Behrends grew weary of what he said were Walz’s frequent monologues that at times veered into hot-button issues like abortion. “It was like listening to a long-winded preacher,” he said. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Shortly before votes were cast in Minnesota's gubernatorial election, Behrends hung a large yellow banner from a grain bin on his farm that read, “Walz Is A Traitor.” Behrends and a fellow retired command sergeant major, Paul Herr, paid to publish a letter in a Minnesota newspaper claiming that Walz had for years “embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances” about his military career. In an interview, Behrends said his personal distaste for Walz and his liberal politics played no role in his decision to openly denigrate the vice presidential nominee. Behrends said he would have done the same to a friend if he believed that friend had stepped out of line. Mattise reported from Nashville, Tenn., Daniel from New York and Karnowski from Minneapolis.

While it’s too soon to officially call it, travel experts and agencies (including the Transportation Security Administration) expect summer 2024 will finish as the busiest summer travel season on record.

Traveling during shoulder season means less crowded beaches, easier-to-snag restaurant reservations, and, in many places, the weather is still fantastic.

While lots of fall travelers are seeking out beaches, many are interested in vacations to Japan, with Kyoto, Tokyo, and Osaka all cracking the top 10 list.

(Photo by Rui Vieira - PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images In my years of experience in large businesses as well as small ones, I have seen only a few great business leaders. I’m often asked what separates the best from the ordinary, I really struggle with the skills required. I don’t believe the myth that anyone can be a great leader by acquiring the right skills, but I do believe that many people have leadership attributes that can be developed. I found some excellent direction on identifying and honing these attributes in a new book, “The Five Talents That Really Matter,” by Barry Conchie and Sarah Dalton. These authors are key partners in Conchie Associates, a leading firm in business consulting, team building, and succession planning. In addition, they provide research and a set of tools for talent assessment. I will paraphrase and summarize here the five key attributes that they and I look for and develop for extraordinary leadership potential in yourself and key members of your team: 1. Setting direction for today’s complex business issues. You need to be able to see the future to guide your organization and articulate the purpose and values which will motivate team members to stay fully engaged. All the while reigning in the tendency to drive quickly to action and implementation without weighing the contingencies and risks. 2. Building energy by demonstrating a burning work ethic. Use your strong internal drive, bolstered by self-confidence, self-assurance, self-efficacy, and high expectations to motivate team members to perform beyond their normal capabilities. You must never be satisfied with your or their achievements, and always look to raise the bar even higher. 3. Exerting pressure to drive change and improvement. Fight complacency and deploy an array of different persuasive techniques and processes to effect the changes you want. Be willing to stand your ground, while balancing these techniques with sensitivity in interactions with others to exert real influence. Be assertive without being aggressive. MORE FOR YOU Floyd Mayweather Jr. Vs. John Gotti III Results: Winner And Reaction Apple iPhone 16 Release Date: New Report Hones In On Precise Date It ‘Ends Now’—Donald Trump Reveals Surprise Assault On ‘Crooked’ Wall Street 4. Increasing connectivity and prioritizing people concerns. Establish effective followship through purposeful behavior, while demonstrating care and concern for those you lead. Invest in your people, care about them, and genuinely want them to succeed. Connect with others on an individual level and take an active role in their career growth. 5. Controlling traffic by establishing protocols and guardrails. Be sure to show and practice agility and flexibility, especially when circumstances change. Focus on defining and building the most appropriate structural framework to ensure an effective execution of your strategic direction. Always translate commitments to logical, manageable steps. In most cases, I find that the selection process for future great leaders is the place to start for transforming your organization. If the focus for new hires today is primarily resume skills and experience, make sure you add interview questions based on the attributes above to uncover a candidate’s innate talents. For inside candidates, look at performance history along these lines. A key component missing from most selection processes I see today is feedback to every leadership candidate. Although a candidate might not be the best match for a particular role at this particular time, they need to know why and how they may be well suited for a different position in the future. Don’t let future leaders slip away due to no feedback or mentoring. A focus on diversity is another key element of the process. I see more and more evidence that diverse teams and associated leadership are critical to high-performing organizations today, and remaining competitive in this era of global competition and markets. Above all, you must strive to be the model of the leadership you desire, by demonstrating the right attributes, independent of the professional role or title you have today in your business. In my experience, this is a mindset that will lead both you and your company to success, despite all the challenges. Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

[+] solar energy and bees. Nestled outside Charlottesville, his business blends regenerative practices with innovative social impact. Thistlerock seeks to highlight the potential for small businesses to drive change. Jen Fariello With climate change's uncertain influence on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, recent polls show it ranked lower than other issues for many Americans, regardless of party. Despite this, one Virginian entrepreneur is forging ahead with a commitment to sustainability, determined to make a lasting impact on the planet, irrespective of the election outcome. ******** “This is the first net-zero mead in the country—powered entirely by the sun and the bees,” proudly declares John Kluge Jr., co-founder of Thistlerock Mead Company (“Thistlerock”), as he offers a taste from his converted stable car-turned-market stall at the weekly Saturday morning farmers’ market in Charlottesville, Virginia.* Intrigued, a group of curious onlookers strolls over, with one exclaiming, “Is that mead? That’s so cool.” Nestled just outside Charlottesville, Thistlerock opened its doors a few months ago. In a cozy 190-year-old tavern that once was a guest house, Kluge, his wife Christine Mahoney—a UVA public policy professor—and his co-founder, Doug Suchan, are on a mission: to show that small businesses can thrive by embracing regenerative sustainability principles, using their mead and unique social impact business model to prove what’s possible. Thistlerock shares its land with Mahoney's Wayflowering business, which practices regenerative agriculture—a sustainable farming approach focusing on improving soil health, increasing biodiversity, and enhancing the ecosystem. Wayflowering grows a wide variety of flowers, creating a thriving habitat for around 2.5 million bees. These bees pollinate the flowers and produce the honey for Thistlerock's mead. Kluge also likes to experiment, sourcing honey from places as far away as Tanzania to create unique meads. The property is also powered by on-site solar energy. However, Kluge recognizes that a significant portion of his business's carbon footprint comes from \"scope three emissions,\" which his customers generate. Thistlerock’s website outlines various strategies to address these emissions. Still, Kluge believes the most impactful change happens by directly influencing customer behavior through public education and the tours they offer. MORE FOR YOU Floyd Mayweather Jr. Vs. John Gotti III Results: Winner And Reaction Apple iPhone 16 Release Date: New Report Hones In On Precise Date It ‘Ends Now’—Donald Trump Reveals Surprise Assault On ‘Crooked’ Wall Street ******** At the Thistlerock tavern, a patron asks, “What is mead?” Kluge’s staff eagerly explains that it’s one of the world’s most natural alcoholic beverages. The conversation quickly shifts to the importance of protecting bees, whose populations were in decline but are now thriving as the fastest-growing type of livestock in the U.S. “One in three foods we eat are pollinated,” Kluge says. “We used to have poor soil here, but after restoring it and planting diverse flowers and plants, the bee ecosystem has flourished.” Kluge’s calm, measured explanations offer a comforting contrast to the world’s anxieties. He acknowledges challenges honestly, noting, for example, that the sunflowers on his property are only half their usual size due to below-average rainfall. “They’ll get there,” he says optimistically. “It will just take longer.” Kluge also addresses practical hurdles, such as scaling distribution sustainably. Currently, he delivers mead in his electric Rivian, but expanding the business while adhering to Thistlerock’s sustainability principles will require finding more efficient solutions. Ultimately, however, Kluge explain that Thistlerock’s mission is to send customers off with a cheerful glass of mead while emphasizing that every action, no matter how small, can make a difference. Katharine Hayhoe, author of Saving Us, agrees that discussing actionable solutions can motivate others. Indeed, speaking with entrepreneurs like Kluge inspires a sense of possibility and encourages others to act. Such inspiration is crucial, especially for small business owners, 40% of whom feel unsure about how to begin implementing a sustainability strategy. As a case in point, Kluge points to Nc’nean, the world’s first net-zero whisky distillery, as the source of his inspiration. Inspiring small business owners to embrace social impact is crucial. Nigar Arpadarai, UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP29, points out that small and medium-sized enterprises make up 90% of businesses globally and account for 50% of commercial and industrial energy consumption. ******** Kluge isn’t just focused on environmental impact, however. He’s also committed to broader social change, offering his employees the chance to own equity in the business and sourcing products from women-, veteran-, and BIPOC-owned businesses. “We’re all about ESG here,” Kluge says with a cheerful smile as more curious passersby stop to take a look. While ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles are contentious in many circles, Kluge isn’t the only business owner trying for B Corps certification. In 2023, the number of companies in the U.S. and Canada earning B Corp certification jumped to 2,385, up about 16% from the previous year's 2,057. Kumar Vijayendra, a speaker on small business transformation, notes that more small businesses are integrating sustainability principles to boost efficiency, cut costs, and enhance their brand. In the UK, a survey of 1,000 small companies also found that 76% believe having an environmental strategy is good for business. Among those with environmentally solid targets, nearly all (98%) reported benefits like a better brand image, attracting eco-conscious customers, increased productivity, and stronger employee loyalty. Over a third also saw revenue growth, including from savings. Kluge sees the same potential at Thistlerock. The solar panels installed on his meadery will generate more power than those on his house but cost just a third of the price, thanks to generous government subsidies. “This is a no-brainer for any small business owner,” he says, emphasizing the financial and environmental benefits. Skeptics might argue that small ventures like Thistlerock are just a fad with minimal impact on the fight against climate change, which requires global emissions to be halved by 2030 to avoid catastrophe. Although revenue from mead is expected to double in the next decade to a greater than $1 billion industry, this is still a tiny fraction of the global economy. With only about 500 meaderies in the U.S., compared to nearly 12,000 vineyards and 15,000 breweries, the collective impact of all meaderies adopting sustainable practices would still be relatively minor. But what if the entire alcoholic beverage industry went green? According to a 2020 study by Manchester University, the industry emits about 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases annually—comparable to the emissions of around 276 million cars and roughly three times that of Australia (based on 2024 projections). Adopting sustainable practices like Thistlerock’s could drastically reduce these emissions, proving that small actions, when adopted industry-wide, can lead to significant change. The question remains: how can small social impact enterprises like Thistlerock drive broader, systemic change across the industry? One way is through leading by example. For instance, EU and US regulations now require larger companies to have science-based climate targets. This momentum was partly sparked by the many thousands of voluntary corporate targets set in preceding years, even if some involved greenwashing or low-quality goals. This process created what’s known as the “ambition loop,” where voluntary business actions inspire ambitious policies, which then promote further business innovation and investment. The Race to Zero campaign describes it as a cycle of continuous improvement between businesses and regulators. Another strategy is forming industry associations that advocate for regulations and policies encouraging businesses to cut their environmental footprint. Kluge is exploring this for sustainable meaderies, and similar efforts are underway in other sectors like sustainable fashion, aiming to level the playing field for social impact entrepreneurs against less sustainable competitors. María Mendiluce, CEO of the We Mean Business Coalition, emphasizes that government support and incentives from partners like financial institutions and major corporations can empower small businesses to implement more extensive environmental actions. ******** Virginia, known as hollow ground to history buffs, was once the birthplace of America's founding fathers and a key site in the Civil War. Today, however, the outskirts of Charlottesville are home to a quiet but emerging revolution in sustainable and regenerative agriculture. If scaled, these social impact entrepreneurs could steer America—and perhaps the world—toward a more sustainable future, regardless of this year’s election outcome. As Kluge closes the tavern for the evening, he reflects on the future of social impact enterprises like his amid the present political climate. “We’re small,” he admits to himself while serving a glass of mead, “but I hope every visitor who comes through here leaves with a deeper understanding of nature and our individual ability to make a difference. Using honey from Tanzania and other far-off places, we connect our guests to parts of the world they might never visit. In this way, we’ve made the world a little smaller and brought a piece of another land right here for people to experience. There is power in that.” *DISCLAIMER: The author visited Thistlerock Mead Company in early August 2024, where he participated in a talk and spent several days interviewing and observing their sustainability methods.

The soon-to-be vice president hugged his son Beau. He spoke about how his own parents had endowed him with a sense of grit and tenacity. “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up,” he recalled his father, Joe, saying. Biden then repeated the lesson taught to him by his mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, who was seated in the audience: “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” In 2024, Biden was not forced to reconcile a failure of his presidency. He compiled a list of significant accomplishments that will be felt for years. But he chose to give up his campaign under pressure from Democratic leaders, in a remarkable concession to the passage of time, when allies in his party and a clear majority of United States (US) adults concluded the 81-year-old should not seek re-election. After Biden’s decision to leave the presidential race, his party not only forgave him, its leaders praised him. So Joseph Robinette Biden Jr went to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week both revered and resigned. Biden had consolidated his party’s support and did not have a serious competitor. But that support crumbled after a disastrous debate in June when his frailties were on unsparing public display, reinforcing his greatest liability – that at his age he might no longer be up for the job. In Chicago, Biden decided to get back up and show the difference between stepping aside and quitting. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is now in the spotlight as the nominee. For the president, it’s the latest in a life marked by the cycles of loss and recovery. “He has had wonderful things happen to him and he has had terrible things happen to him,” said Ted Kaufman, his friend, former aide and appointed successor in the Senate from Delaware. Biden arrived at the White House with a hope that a focus on the public good could help heal the partisan malice that emerged with the ascent of former President Donald Trump, now again the Republican nominee. No one denied the ego necessary to pursue the White House. But those interviewed stressed that Biden sees his legacy more as a leader who could demonstrate during a cynical era that government was a force for good. “It’s less about him,” said assistant to the president and the White House staff secretary Stefanie Feldman. “He wants people to understand that the federal government is delivering results.” Biden deployed his decades in the Senate to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. He signed into law far-reaching investments in advanced technologies and brokered a debt deal with Republicans to avoid a catastrophic default. Biden last week stressed that he was reducing prices on 10 of Medicare’s costliest prescription drugs. He also helped to restore the faith of longtime allies that the US could be an unflinching partner, and led the effort to provide much needed backing for its allies. He dealt with a pandemic, inflation, immigration challenges, a broken supply chain and a troubled withdrawal from Afghanistan. “The experience he brought to the job – there’s no question – gave him the ability to achieve things that no one thought he could achieve,” said Anita Dunn, who worked as a senior adviser. “It’s not just experience though. It’s relationships. It’s understanding how Congress works and how members of Congress can be brought along to get things done.” But Americans consistently saw not the accrued wisdom, but the stiff-legged, shuffling steps and the verbal struggles. Born too early to qualify as a Baby Boomer, the arc of Biden’s political career has been full of remarkable successes and staggering defeats. He was elected to the Senate from Delaware at 29, only to lose his wife and daughter in a car crash. He found a new partner in Jill and sought the presidency in the 1988 cycle, only to withdraw after reports of plagiarism. Then he dealt with serious health issues, surviving two brain aneurysms. His 2008 presidential campaign was a washout, but he became President Barack Obama’s trusted number two. Then Beau died of brain cancer and his other son, Hunter, succumbed to drug addiction. Against long odds, Biden won the Democratic nomination in 2020 and then beat Trump, only to have his party want someone else to run against his predecessor this year. Aides have recalled Biden being told years before that China’s economic growth would be a positive because it would lower prices for consumers, even if it meant that more manufacturing would move overseas. “If it helps the consumer and hurts the worker, we have a problem,” Biden told them at the time. Biden was so focused on middle-class jobs that he found his presidency, ironically, defined by the public’s desire for lower prices. Inflation was a symptom of global disruptions caused by the pandemic and war, as well as government spending meant to stabilise the economy for workers that helped spur a historic burst of hiring. The tough logic is that Biden anchored his presidency with an eye toward what America could be like a decade from now.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/bidens-journey/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PAGE-22-A_26082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:02:38","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.173},{"id":254907182,"title":"Democrats Have a Problem With Religion. One Man Is Helping Fix It.","text":"The Republican National Convention last month was teeming with God talk. Much of it was what we have come to expect from a party that cloaks itself in faith, even while worshipping its standard-bearer as a false idol. Tim Scott, speaking on the first night of the convention, described the attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life like so: “Our God still saves. He still delivers, and He still sets free. Because on Saturday, the devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle. But an American lion got back up on his feet, and he roared.” U.S. Senate candidate Leora Levy offered a Jewish prayer for Trump, yet as she deployed Jewish language, a wall of screens behind her projected images of American flags flying next to Christian crosses and churches. The awkward marriage between the RNC’s performance of what’s known as civil religion—a 1960s notion that fuses a symbolic and emotional commitment to the nation-state that mirrors traditional religious devotion—tends to increasingly reflect a sectarian, white, Christian worldview that holds itself out as secular. On Monday night at the DNC, Sen. Raphael Warnock, senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, embraced faith from the political left in a way that was dramatically different. Warnock called out Trump for weaponizing religious symbols and speech in ways that violate core religious values and leveled blame at certain churches for a willingness to endorse Trumpism at all costs. Warnock is hardly the first Democrat to refuse to cede the language of religious faith to the GOP and to root progressive values in faith values. But these efforts still seem unfamiliar on the left. I spoke to Ilyse Hogue, a senior fellow at New America, the author of The Lie That Binds—a history of the religious right’s authoritarian crusade against abortion—and the first person to, in 2016, tell her own story of elective abortion for the stage at the DNC, about what a robust progressive embrace of a thick civic religion could look like. Our conversation, which took place over email, has been edited and condensed for clarity. Dahlia Lithwick: You have long said that it is a tactical mistake to simply allow the GOP to occupy the faith field for decades. How is it that this came about, and why is any effort to root progressive values in religion seen as inherently divisive and counterproductive? Ilyse Hogue: The 1980 election was a defining moment for the role of religion in party politics. Through the ’70s, Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority teamed up with Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum to wrest power from the more dominant Rockefeller Republicans who had advanced a socially liberal, fiscally conservative framework for the GOP. This new “religious right” coalition was joined in common cause to reverse the significant advancements of the Civil Rights, gay rights, and women’s rights movements of the ’60s and ’70s. Their cynical ploy was to use the candidacy of Ronald Reagan—a divorced actor cum politician—as a stalking horse to advance their radical vision for a white patriarchy to retain hegemonic power in America. When Reagan’s long-shot bid successfully ousted the overtly devout incumbent Jimmy Carter, it sent both sides reeling. That equation—embedding a racist and misogynistic view of social order in a religious ideology—is recognizable as the playbook followed by Falwell’s descendants and disciples in the 2016 election of Donald Trump. The subsequent political reorganization was predictable, even if ultimately limited. Liberals across the spectrum became wary of religious doctrine as a potential tool to be weaponized and faith as specifically fraught when applied to a vision of a more pluralistic union. In searching for a counterargument to the new right’s religious fundamentalism, Democrats sought to strike a balance: Recognize that many embrace religion, while neutralizing the potential risk of it to fracture their coalition. This required a delicate dance of preaching individual tolerance with an orthodox adherence to the constitutional commitment to separate church and state. I file all this under “well-intentioned and legally expedient,” but it was too antiseptic to satiate a growing need for collective frameworks to make sense and seek purpose in an increasingly complicated world. The right’s flattened narrative was often cruel but always clear. The GOP easily framed all Dems as godless, waging war on the religious. While many responded defensively—and in fact the party and coalition does include many religious people—these were individual declarations of faith that failed to meet the need for a collective investment in a new vision. Democrats fell short of a road map to a more perfect union and relied on a chaotic hodgepodge of issues, bills, and elections, which are piecemeal at best in a country where so many people, and indeed so many liberals, seek greater purpose. More importantly, we ceded the idea that effective politics are a vehicle for connecting people to one another in service of actualizing a higher ideal of our lives and our surroundings. Warnock told the Atlanta Voice that he was attempting to recapture the moral seriousness of Martin Luther King Jr., who was so comfortable connecting liberal political goals to faith values. I think progressives tend to forget how much religion animated the civil rights battles of the past two centuries. What would reembracing that language look like? I see it a little differently. Broadly speaking, I think there is a high awareness among progressives of the role of faith in the traditional Civil Rights Movement. I just think it’s viewed as a discrete outlier that fails to scale when applied to the diversity of a multifaith coalition. The right’s effective instrumentalization of religion as a tool to dominate and oppress has embedded an unease among liberal political activists about the intermingling of both. And the sheer number of religions, and belief systems—not to mention the doctrinal rejection of both—housed under the big tent makes organizing exponentially more complicated for Democrats than for their GOP counterpart, with its handful of more homogenous religious factions. The mental gymnastics of attempting to unify so many constituencies while engaging in transactional politics is exhausting. Once you add in the authoritarian right’s often-successful attempts to wedge the Democratic coalition by pitting factions against one another, the impulse to forfeit rather than contest the faith ground is understandable even if ill-advised. And then there’s the practical matter that some of these religious doctrines are actually in tension with one another. Look at the issue of the day. While some progressive Christian denominations acknowledge legal abortion as a human right, others maintain that it is a sin. Jewish theology has a different take on when life begins. Afraid of inflaming differences, the party took this powerful issue off the table entirely for a long time, instead opting to affirm the legal right in as few words as possible. Unlocking the now-undisputed power of this issue required accepting those internal theological differences as innate to democracy and then, instead of letting them divide, asserting the higher-order value that was universal, the value of freedom. To build durable movements for pluralistic democracy, we first need to distinguish between “religion,” which is defined by distinctions and differences, and “faith, ” which is a universal component of the human experience. Simply being alive requires faith to make sense of a chaotic and often cruel world. Faith acknowledges common value in connecting disparate communities and cultures. Faith sustains individuals who often reflect on a life that struggles to measure up by individual metrics. Faith addresses primal needs for meaning and spiritual sustenance that transcend any specific religion or belief system. Warnock’s speech on Monday night stepped into that breach. When he acknowledged his 2020 victory as an advancement for Black Georgians and in the next breath honored the victory of his friend and colleague Sen. Jon Ossoff as a first for Jewish Georgians, he bound our fates and our joys in one. He modeled that we can be proud of our distinctions while celebrating our universal humanity. He showed a refusal to yield an inch to the divide-and-conquer tactics of the right. Ultimately, he took two separate and individual elections—pivotal, yes, but elections nonetheless—and recast them as interconnected and significant milestones made possible by the collective action of a broad movement of people willing to have faith that they could advance “the best in the American covenant.” People don’t want a thank-you for voting, but they do want that vote to amount to more than the sum of its parts. With that line, Warnock made visible the people who were investing in something larger than him. We need more of that. One of the sections so many of us found most arresting in Warnock’s speech was his conclusion, which also sounded a key of deep spirituality: “I need my neighbor’s children to be OK so that my children will be OK. I need all of my neighbors’ children to be OK. Poor inner-city children in Atlanta and poor children of Appalachia. I need the poor children of Israel and the poor children of Gaza. I need Israelis and Palestinians. I need those in the Congo, those in Haiti, those in Ukraine. I need American children on both sides of the track to be OK because we are all God’s children.” I think this passage was so resonant because it breathed life into the liberal belief system underlying so many of our principles and policies. And we too often take for granted that voters can see that notion for themselves. The GOP vision is a clear version of Christian doctrine that pits individuals against each other in a zero-sum race for survival. Every day on earth is Daniel in the lions’ den, where the winner takes all and success is a mark of God’s approval no matter how it’s achieved. Being on edge and ready to strike is not a cruelty but a necessity in this worldview. The view that God has graced America with the cunning Donald Trump is the walking manifestation of this vision. The fact that Donald Trump has achieved wealth and power through coercion and corruption is a testament to the fact that God graced him with the cunning necessary to win in a brutal world. Any transgressions against God’s other commandments can be dispensed with through pantomimed atonement and performative prayer. It’s a worldview as neat as it is twisted. That passage was Warnock’s way of modeling that to win, we need to offer more than competing policy platforms. We need to model a compelling and clear belief system that sharply contrasts the right. One that illuminates the understanding of our interdependence as an asset and makes the application of universal rights, freedoms, and opportunities more than a feel-good aspiration or tagline. It’s a mission that binds us in our collective destiny. Working for that transcends politics and becomes a spiritual act. All of this requires faith that this nation of ours can be healed. A faith that Warnock acknowledged has been profoundly shaken. But Democrats and liberals should take heed that restoring faith in our nation requires a willingness for the party and the movements that undergird it to invest in a framework that respects our individual identities and ladders up to our common humanity. Then our votes will be the kind of prayer the reverend speaks of, one “for the world we desire for ourselves and our children.”","summary":"Raphael Warnock teaches Democrats how to wield religion in politics.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/raphael-warnock-teaches-democrats-religion-in-politics.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/645d3b19-6a7d-46f8-a55d-4126f16f0acb.jpeg?crop=4996%2C3331%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:00:00","author":"Dahlia Lithwick","authors":["Dahlia Lithwick"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.091},{"id":254905342,"title":"Willa Fitzgerald On Idea Of Roscoe Returning To Ritchson’s ‘Reacher’","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Willa Fitzgerald and Alan Ritchson in \"Reacher.\" Prime Video/Shane Mahood Willa Fitzgerald—Officer Roscoe Conklin in Reacher Season 1—likes the idea of reuniting with Alan Ritchson in future seasons of the hit series.

(Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images) Getty Images The NBA is loaded with talent across the board, especially in the Western Conference. But even then, the Oklahoma City Thunder project to be the top team in the conference in terms of regular season wins this season. This is largely due to having a roster that was dramatically improved during the offseason, along with the expectation for significant internal growth of the existing young players on the team. Oklahoma City’s roster has every aspect of what a championship team needs. There’s superstar talent at the helm with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leading the way. He’s surrounded by Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams, which creates a fully capable trio of headliner stars. The roster is extremely deep, with more than a dozen players who can slot in and contribute to winning on any given night. Both sides of the ball are among the best in the league, with a roster that features elite defenders — both on the interior and the perimeter — along with three-level scoring threats on the offensive end. And now that this team has a playoff run under its belt, OKC will be even more experienced in the upcoming postseason. Simply put, this might be the most well-rounded roster the Thunder has ever put together. Oklahoma City has a real shot at once again earning the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, plus could even have the best regular season record in the NBA assuming injuries can be avoided. As dynamic as the current Thunder roster is, what’s more impressive is the fact that GM Sam Presti has everything he could ever need to continue improving it both this season and even much longer term. Not only is Oklahoma City already a contender, but the franchise has arguably the deepest stash of future draft capital in the entire league. While those picks could be used to continue drafting young pieces every summer to build sustained success for the next decade — which will certainly be part of the team’s strategy — they can also be leveraged to trade for win-now talent. Interestingly enough, the Thunder added two significant pieces this offseason to improve the roster with Alex Caruso and Isaiah Hartenstein, but neither required draft capital as one was a player-for-player swap and the other was a free agent signing. But future moves of that caliber will likely request first-round picks. Luckily for the Thunder, that won’t be a problem. MORE FOR YOU Floyd Mayweather Jr. Vs.

But during the upcoming 2024-25 campaign ahead of the trade deadline — and even longer-term in future seasons — the Thunder has many levers that can be pulled to improve even more. Whether that need comes due to an injury or because a glaring weakness on the roster arises, Presti will have the opportunity to do nearly anything he wants to. This is a unique scenario in the NBA, as generally teams are either built to win now or have the assets to look towards the future. In the case of the Oklahoma City Thunder, both of these scenarios are playing out concurrently. Follow me on Twitter.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v.

But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left.

The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters.

Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real time, falsely insisted that, “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v.

Ron Johnson accused the FBI and Secret Service of stonewalling a Senate probe of last month’s assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Johnson (R-Wis.), who is part of a bipartisan Senate investigation into the attempt on Trump’s life, argued that the bureau and Secret Service have complicated the probe by giving them redacted documents, often on the day of key interviews. “All I can really tell you is the Secret Service, FBI are basically dragging their feet. They’re stonewalling us,” Johnson vented on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” “We’re not getting squat, from my standpoint, from the Secret Service or the FBI. We have requested all their 302s, their transcriptions of their interviews with hundreds of individuals. They’re not turning those over to us as well.” A bevy of organizations is probing how Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was able to crawl up onto a rooftop on July 13 and fire off eight shots, including one that clipped and drew blood from Trump’s right ear. The shooting killed firefighter Corey Comperatore, 50, and left two other rally attendees — David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74 — severely wounded. Crooks was killed by law enforcement. “If you want to design an investigation to raise suspicions and drive conspiracy theories, this is exactly how you do that investigation,” Johnson added. “It was just jaw-dropping that they released the body for cremation before anybody’s seen any autopsy or toxicology reports.” “It’s just driving suspicion and conspiracy theories.” Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chair Gary Peters (D-Mich.) is helming an inquiry into the assassination attempt in the upper chamber. Johnson was previously chair of that committee. Additionally, there are investigations from the newly minted bipartisan House task force and the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General. The Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny over the security failings that preceded the attack. The fateful rally in Butler, Pennsylvania marked the closest a gunman had come to killing a sitting or former US president since the 1981 attempt against former President Ronald Reagan. Kimberly Cheatle stepped down as Secret Service director last month amid a wave of political pressure. At least five officials at the protective agency also were moved to administrative duty — meaning that they can’t be involved in operational planning — over the debacle, ABC News reported. The Post contacted both the FBI and Secret Service for comment. “They’re the only ones that are going to have access to this information until they decide what information to give us and when to give it to us. They’re in total control,” Johnson further groused. The FBI said any suggestion the bureau was “interfering” with the congressional probe of the assassination was “inaccurate and unfounded.” “We have followed normal procedures in the handling of the crime scene and evidence. The FBI continues its painstaking work on the investigation to develop as complete a picture as possible of what led to the shooting, and we remain committed to maximum transparency as we continue to share information with Congress,” a bureau spokesperson told The Post when asked about Johnson’s remarks. As for Johnson’s complaints about Crooks’ body being released for cremation, the spokesperson argued that was, “in keeping with normal procedures.” The Senate is currently on recess but slated to return next month.","summary":"Sen.

But Kolb was stunned by what he saw when Walz left the military and entered politics. Walz retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. Then during the campaign, Walz overstated the rank he held at the point he left the service. “That is not the behavior I would expect out of a senior noncommissioned officer,” Kolb said in an interview. Those two sides of Walz’s service have been in the spotlight now that the Minnesota governor is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Supporters have lauded Walz’s 24 years of service in the National Guard, where he rose through the enlisted ranks and received an honorable discharge. “What I know about Tim Walz is he did his job diligently,” said retired Minnesota National Guard Brig. Gen. Jeff Bertrang. “He was in charge of troops under him, and he made sure they were taken care of.” Republicans have seized on criticism by Guard veterans as a major line of attack on Walz and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Some of that criticism, like Kolb’s, is measured. Others offer harsher appraisals. It’s far from clear whether Republicans can turn Walz’s military record into a liability. His decades of service stand in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that Trump suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, was a Marine Corps corporal, including six months as a military journalist in Iraq. After four years, he left the military for college and later a career in venture capital and as a best-selling author. Vance has led the criticism of Walz. For many Democrats, the GOP salvos are an eerie reprise of the tactics used to sully their 2004 presidential candidate, John Kerry, by questioning his leadership as a swift boat commander in Vietnam, even though Kerry was a decorated combat veteran and his Republican opponent, President George W. Bush, did not fight in the war. But the criticism stems not so much from Walz’s service record but from how he has characterized his time in uniform and how he ended his tenure. An Associated Press review of Walz’s statements as a congressional candidate, congressman and governor shows that Walz has toggled between being precise and careless about key details. Walz’s supporters reject the criticism as politically motivated and say it denigrates the sacrifices he and other troops have made. The Harris campaign provided a letter signed by hundreds of veterans and military family members that said Vance’s broadsides against Walz are not surprising given reports that Trump expressed disdain for those who served. Trump has denied the claim. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform — and as vice president of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” the campaign said. In a speech this past week at the Democratic National Convention, Walz said he “proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years.” He made no reference to his rank or the circumstances of his retirement, framing his service as part of a larger urge to “contribute” to the nation. Distinction with a difference “I’m a retired command sergeant major,” Walz said in 2006 as he campaigned to unseat the six-term Republican incumbent in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. But that statement was not true. Walz served briefly as a command sergeant major, but that was not the rank he held at retirement. It is not clear whether Walz repeated the exact claim after he won the House race, but he did not object when colleagues put the honorific before his name during House debates to underscore his gravitas on military matters. That distinction -– serving as a command sergeant major, but not retiring in that position -– may seem minor to civilians. But to those in uniform, it is not. Rank is revered in the Army. Known as an E-9 in military parlance, a command sergeant major is the pinnacle of achievement in the Army’s enlisted corps. Command sergeant majors are the backbone of a unit, acting as mentors and disciplinarians to the enlisted troops and trusted advisers to their commanding officers. Sergeant majors often stay in their units for long stretches, providing a deep well of institutional knowledge. Commissioned officers typically move on to new posts every few years. “There’s a reason why there’s so much angst about this among military members that maybe is lost on the rest of the population,” Kolb said. “The rank of command sergeant major, that E-9 rank, is sacred. It’s rare.” Walz was command sergeant major of the Minnesota Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery for less than a year, according to the Guard’s personnel office. His rank was reduced for benefit purposes to master sergeant, a step below, when he left the Guard because Walz had not completed all the coursework necessary to hold the rank in retirement. Facing questions about Walz’s record, the Harris campaign replaced the phrase “a retired command sergeant major” from Walz’s online biography with wording that says he served as one. But Walz’s official biography on the Minnesota governor’s website is still misleading. That biography places “retired from” a Guard battalion after the phrase “Command Sergeant Major Walz.” “He’s a retired master sergeant,” Kolb said. “And that’s what he should say.” The campaign also acknowledged that Walz misspoke in a 2018 video posted on social media that recorded him saying “weapons of war that I carried in war.” Vance seized on the comment to accuse Walz of lying about being in a combat zone when he never was. Walz and other Guard troops were sent to Italy in 2003 to provide base security in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Pentagon’s name for the war in Afghanistan. Questions about Walz mischaracterizing his personal story have not been limited to military service. He is also facing scrutiny for how he has described his family’s struggle with infertility. He has implied that he and his wife used in vitro fertilization to conceive, drawing a connection between their experience and efforts to limit the procedure. But they actually used intrauterine insemination treatments, a different process that has attracted less controversy. Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokesperson, defended Walz’s comments and denied that he had been misleading. She said Walz “talks how normal people talk” and was using “commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” Leaving the Guard By military standards, Walz’s 24 years of service is substantial. He could have retired almost three years earlier. But it is the circumstances surrounding the retirement and how it overlapped with his political ambitions that have drawn scrutiny. In January 2005, Walz attended a boot camp of sorts in Minnesota for people interested in careers in progressive politics. Walz, a teacher and avid pheasant hunter with blue-collar roots, stood out as a candidate who might win in the state’s strongly Republican 1st Congressional District. Minnesota Democratic party officials had already begun to take notice of Walz. Mike Erlandson, the party’s state chair at the time, recalled the enthusiasm one of his aides brimmed with after meeting with Walz in Mankato, a town about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis where Walz taught high school geography. “He came barging into my office at the state party, saying, ‘Mike, this guy Tim is the real deal,’ and was very excited about Tim Walz and the prospect of him running for Congress,” Erlandson said. By February, Walz announced that he was considering a run for Congress. But thousands of miles away, the war in Iraq had entered its third year and hopes for a speedy U.S. withdrawal were evaporating. In mid-March, Walz’s battalion was notified of a possible deployment to Iraq. In a campaign news release, Walz said he would stay in the congressional race “whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.” He had a responsibility, the release said, to ready his battalion for war “but also to serve if called on.” Less than two months later, on May 16, 2005, Walz retired from the National Guard. His departure was not unusual. More than 730 senior enlisted soldiers with 24 years of service retired in 2005 when the U.S. was heavily engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Defense Department statistics. But Doug Julin, a Minnesota Guard command sergeant major senior to Walz, told CNN on Aug. 8 that Walz had assured him just weeks before that Walz would be going forward with the battalion. Julin, who did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press, said he was surprised to learn Walz left the Guard without first discussing the decision with him. Kolb picked Tom Behrends, who has emerged as Walz’s most biting critic, to replace Walz as the 1st Battalion’s command sergeant major. The unit received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in mid-July 2005 and a few months later headed to Mississippi for training. The unit shipped to Iraq in March 2006 where it would spend the next 16 months. Later that year, Walz, unopposed in the Democratic primary, would pull off an upset, beating Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Questions about Walz’s military record had percolated during that campaign. A letter to the editor in the Mankato Free Press newspaper from a person identified as Maj. Walter Gates said information about Walz’s military career strongly suggested that Walz had fought in Iraq or Afghanistan. To which country did Walz “deploy downrange”? Gates asked. Walz responded by saying the letter appeared to be an attempt to “slander my good name.” Walz wrote, incorrectly, that he retired as a command sergeant major, but accurately specified that he served on three NATO training missions and in Italy. Walz was equally clear about his wartime service in a 2009 interview with the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project. Gates did not respond to multiple messages from the AP so it is unclear what information he was referring to. Walz, in the early 2005 campaign news release, did not mention Italy when he said he deployed for eight months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, phrasing that could imply he served in Afghanistan. A 2006 congressional campaign ad described Walz as a soldier who had served for two decades and was “ready when they attacked.” Joe Eustice, who took over for Behrends as the 1st Battalion’s top enlisted soldier, said Walz was entitled to leave the Guard when he did. “When you’ve given 24 years of your life, you get to decide, and your reasoning can be whatever you want it to be,” said Eustice, who retired in 2014. But he is troubled by Walz’s statements after he left the Guard. “He should answer to the fact that he said he carried a weapon in war and explain why he’s been saying he’s a retired sergeant major,” Eustice said. “Those two things are not true, and he should know better.” A longtime foe Almost two decades have passed since Behrends hurriedly took Walz’s place as the 1st Battalion’s senior enlisted soldier. Yet time has not eased Behrends anger at his predecessor. As Walz’s political career flourished, Kolb advised Behrends to let go of the resentment. But Behrends could not. Not when he read and heard Walz inaccurately referred to as a retired command sergeant major – and Walz failed to set the record straight. After yet another local newspaper elevated Walz’s retirement rank, Behrends wrote to the then-congressman. “It saddens me that after your long career in the National Guard, that you did not fulfill the conditions of your promotion to command sergeant major,” he told Walz. “I would hope that you haven’t been using the rank for political gain, but that is how it appears.” Behrends said he did not get a reply. When Walz ran for governor two years later, Behrends went public with much stronger criticism. A self-described “down-home country boy,” Behrends did not like Walz personally. They are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Behrends is a conservative who donated $250 to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign and supported Walz’s Republican opponents in Minnesota. While they were both still in uniform, Behrends grew weary of what he said were Walz’s frequent monologues that at times veered into hot-button issues like abortion. “It was like listening to a long-winded preacher,” he said. In an interview, Behrends said his personal distaste for Walz and his liberal politics played no role in his decision to openly denigrate the vice presidential nominee. Behrends said he would have done the same to a friend if he believed that friend had stepped out of line.

Among the RNC’s efforts that have been successful is the recent Supreme Court decision on Thursday, which reinstated an Arizona law requiring people registering to vote to provide documentary proof of citizenship. “This is a huge win,” Trump said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. “Look, when a federal election is underway, you can only have American citizens voting in that election. Should go without saying, but there are some states that try to push back on that. We took it to the Supreme Court because Democrats in the state of Arizona were attempting to let people register to vote without ID. We said, ‘You need to be able to determine whether or not these are U.S. citizens before they register to vote.’ The Supreme Court agreed with that, and the great news is that it sets precedent across the country so other states can take this and utilize it as well.” Trump also detailed a lawsuit the RNC is filing in Michigan, which is related to the hiring of poll workers in Wayne County. Of the 700 trained Republican poll workers who applied to work, only 50 were hired compared to the 2,300 Democratic poll workers who were hired. The RNC co-chairwoman then issued a warning to anyone “who is attempting to cheat in our elections,” saying that the RNC will “track you down and will prosecute you to the full extent of the law.” “We’re watching everything, we’re filing lawsuits when necessary, and we’re making sure we have people everywhere votes are being cast and counted to have eyes on everything,” Trump said.

She added that her father-in-law, former President Donald Trump, had an actual plan when he became president, whereas the other side has not provided any concrete plans for the future. Last week, Lara Trump deemed Harris’s campaign “completely phony” and rejected the idea that Harris as president would be any better than Biden’s presidency.","summary":"Republican National Committee co-Chairwoman Lara Trump praised the Supreme Court’s recent decision on voter registration in Arizona, which marked “a huge win” for the RNC’s fight to secure the election.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said, “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real-time, falsely insisted that “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States.” “I do not limit access to birth control or I.V.F. – THAT IS A LIE, these are all false stories that she’s making up,” he wrote. “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!”","summary":"While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats' warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/25/trump-would-veto-legislation-establishing-a-federal-abortion-ban-vance-says/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/CMlogo_white.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 22:16:17","author":"Jill Colvin,JILL COLVIN - Associated Press","authors":["Jill Colvin","JILL COLVIN - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":254904470,"title":"Labor Department’s 818K vanished jobs expose Democrats’ empty economic agenda","text":"“Bidenomics is working,” Kamala Harris and the rest of the administration told America for months, abandoning that line only when polls consistently showed it wasn’t working, even as their media allies pointed to various economic stats to argue that the public was simply wrong. And now that she’s the Democratic nominee, Harris has switched to insisting she’ll fix everything, though the details remain beyond sketchy and she has yet to announce a single break from the Biden policies of the last 3½ years. And last week brought news that, in at least one key area, the public was right and the stats were wrong: The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its count of jobs added from April 2023 to March 2024 down by 818,000 — the largest downward revision since 2009. That brought the total estimate of job gains over those 12 months from 2.9 million to 2.1 million, nearly 30%. And when a reporter asked Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about the grim news, she answered with the nuance characteristic of the Democrats who’ve presided over so much economic pain: “I don’t believe it” because the reporter had asked for her to respond to a clip of Donald Trump citing the stats. That is: One of the top Dems when it comes to economic policy didn’t know about a major piece of economic news, and fell back on Orange Man Bad. No wonder the Biden-Harris economy stinks. Of course, the public has many reasons to see the economy differently that the statistics the Democrats’ cheerleaders cite: Add in, for example, the fact the employment growth Biden-Harris actually produce is largely jobs in government or in federally-funded health care. People know, too that prices for groceries, gas and other basic goods have soared in the Biden-Harris years, while credit-card debt has hit record highs. Three in five Americans say they believe the United States is in a recession. Democrats and their press cheerleaders have dropped the “don’t believe your lying eyes (or bank accounts)” line of defense. Instead, they’re trying to memory-hole the entire Biden presidency, as if switching out Joe for Kamala — but offering the exact same economic approach — will somehow produce better results. Seriously: Accepting the nomination last Thursday, Harris vowed she would “grow our economy ” and “lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. What’s her plan to do this? Another $1.7 trillion in new spending plus $5 trillion in new taxes. The only new policies she’s announced are copying the Trump “no tax on tips” idea and the JD Vance “boost the child tax credit” proposal. Oh, and a flirtation with Sen. Liz Warren’s price-controls agenda, though (once even liberal press slammed the idea) her aides “clarified” that Harris didn’t really mean much by that. Joe Biden’s economic policies were Democratic Party orthodoxy, and a President Harris’ would be, too, even if she imposes them with more “joy.” Average Americans know they and their neighbors prospered in the Trump years but got slammed after the Democrats took over. And, as Charles Gasparino puts it, “Harris has no clue how to run a $25 trillion economy. If she did, we would have heard about it by now.” Jobs and the economy are voters’ top concern, and all Harris and her party offer are “vibes.”","summary":"\"Bidenomics is working,\" Kamala Harris and the rest of the administration told America for months, abandoning that line only when polls consistently showed it wasn't working.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/opinion/labor-departments-818k-disappearing-jobs-reveals-bidens-economy-lie/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/u-s-president-joe-biden-18867032-e1724623442351.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 22:14:17","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":254904472,"title":"Tim Walz faces another accusation of misrepresentation in unearthed, blistering letter: ‘Remove any reference’","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is facing another accusation of misrepresenting his background after a Nebraska Chamber of Commerce letter from 2006 resurfaced amid Walz’s campaign for vice president. When Walz first ran for Congress in Minnesota, he touted on his campaign website that he received an award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce in 1993 for his work with the business community, according to a 2006 article from the Post Bulletin. He never received such an award, however, which was outlined to him in a blistering letter from the then-president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, Barry L. Kennedy. “We researched this matter and can confirm that you have not been the recipient of any award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce,” the letter addressed to Walz on Nov. 1, 2006, reads. “I am not going to draw a conclusion about your intentions by including this line in your biography. However, we respectfully request that you remove any reference to our organization as it could be considered an endorsement of your candidacy. It should be pointed out, however, that the US Chamber of Commerce has endorsed your opponent, Congressman Gil Gutknecht, for his support of small business issues,” Kennedy continued. The letter was unearthed by Minnesota outlet Alpha News last week, after the controversy gained traction locally in 2006. The Post Bulletin, a Minnesota newspaper based in Rochester, reported in 2006 that Walz’s congressional campaign updated its website to reflect Walz did not win a Nebraska Chamber of Commerce award, but had won an award from the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as the Jaycees. The then-campaign manager passed off the issue as a “typographical error,” the outlet reported at the time. When approached by Fox Digital about the 2006 controversy, the Harris-Walz campaign said Walz frequently speaks “openly and off the cuff.” “Governor Walz speaks the way real people speak – openly and off the cuff. The American people appreciate that Gov. Walz tells it like it is and doesn’t talk like a politician, and they appreciate the difference between someone who occasionally misspeaks and a pathological liar like Donald Trump,” the campaign said. The claim follows a long history of people accusing Walz of misrepresenting himself and his history, most notably a bevy of veterans accusing the Gopher State Democrat of misrepresenting his military career. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005, when he launched a successful congressional campaign and served as a member of the US House representing Minnesota from 2007 until 2019. Following Vice President Kamala Harris naming him as her running mate, Walz has been slammed by a number of veterans for allegedly misrepresenting his service in the military, including identifying himself to the public as a retired “Command Sergeant Major.” Here is the latest on VP pick Tim Walz’s time in the military National Guard vet claims Walz went above him to secure retirement: ‘He knew I would have told him, “Suck it up”’ Tim Walz falsely claimed he carried weapons ‘in war’ in resurfaced clip: ‘Absolutely false’ Tim Walz left National Guard battalion ‘hanging,’ ‘slithered out the door’ before Iraq deployment: vets Tim Walz a ‘coward’ and ‘traitor’ for retiring from military before Iraq, says Guardsman who replaced VP pick Walz was promoted to the command sergeant major rank following a deployment to Italy in 2004, but he did not complete coursework with the US Army Sergeants Major Academy to retain the rank in retirement. Walz instead retired as a master sergeant, one pay grade below command sergeant major. “For 20 years, they let this guy go by with a lie that he deployed to Iraq, which he didn’t, and that he retired as a command sergeant major, which he did not. I mean, that’s just blatant lies,” Republican Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain, told The New York Post this month of Walz. The battalion commander of Walz’s former Minnesota Army National Guard unit also issued a scathing message to Harris’ running mate earlier this month regarding him portraying himself as a “retired Command Sergeant Major.”","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

He was flying in from Azerbaijan. According to TF1Info, the French outlet that first broke the news of his arrest, Durov was accompanied by a bodyguard and a woman. As best as anyone can tell, he spent the night in a French jail cell. Durov’s unexpected detainment came after an arrest warrant was issued by OFMIN, a new law enforcement office that began operations in November and is tasked with preventing violence against minors. Durov’s arrest is reportedly part of a preliminary investigation into a startling array of alleged offenses—drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime and the promotion of terrorism—deemed to have been permitted on Telegram, which Durov claimed in July has 950 million users. Investigators speaking to French media were unsure why Durov risked landing in the country given that he was on France’s wanted persons list. According to an unnamed police source who spoke to Reuters, investigators saw Durov’s name on a passenger list ahead of his private jet’s arrival. Representatives from OFMIN declined to answer questions about the investigation and redirected WIRED to France’s Ministry of Justice, which did not immediately respond. The Paris Prosecutor’s Office said in an email to say that a full press release is expected to be published on Monday. Durov is reportedly in the crosshairs of French authorities both due to lack of moderation on Telegram and lack of cooperation with police requests. Reuters reported that a cybersecurity gendarmerie unit and France's national anti-fraud police unit were leading the investigation. The investigative judge is also specialized in organized crime. Telegram did not respond to requests for comment from WIRED. John Hyman, Telegram’s chief investment officer, declined to comment “currently.” The Telegram News channel posted on Sunday evening that it was “absurd” to claim that an owner or its platform were responsible for abuses of that platform, noting that Durov has “nothing to hide” and travels frequently in Europe. “We’re awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.” Although France has yet to officially confirm the arrest, the Russian embassy in Paris was quick to accuse French authorities of not clarifying the reasons for Durov’s detention, nor facilitating consular access. “As of today, the French authorities are, at the present time, not cooperating on this issue,” the embassy said in a statement. “We are in contact with P. Durov’s lawyer.” Durov became a French citizen in 2021. Based in Dubai, Durov also has United Arab Emirates citizenship. Questions over lack of moderation on Telegram have plagued the company for years. Islamist extremists and far-right activists have both organized on the platform, and at times used it to incite violence. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the war in Gaza, Telegram has found itself at the heart of geopolitics—both as a vital source of information for people on the ground and a dangerous source of disinformation and sometimes graphic content. Durov always claims to be “neutral” and to have no political affiliations. “Civil society has had a complicated relationship with Telegram over the years,” says Natalia Kapriva, a lawyer at the digital rights group Access Now. “We have defended Telegram against attempts by authoritarian regimes to block and coerce the platform into providing encryption keys, but we have also been raising alarms about Telegram’s lack of human rights policies, reliable channel of communication, and remedy for its users.” Kapriva stresses that French authorities may try to force Durov to provide Telegram’s encryption keys to decrypt private messages, “which Russia has already tried to do in the past.” The hashtag #FreePavel has been spreading online, including via X’s CEO, Elon Musk, who has posted numerous times about Durov’s arrest. “POV: It’s 2030 in Europe and you’re being executed for liking a meme,” he wrote on Saturday night in response to a post about the Telegram CEO’s detention. “The need to protect free speech has never been more urgent,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who on Friday endorsed Donald Trump for US president, wrote on X, where he referred to Telegram as “uncensored” and “encrypted.” While Telegram is frequently described as an encrypted messaging app, messages are not end-to-end encrypted by default, and senior executives previously told WIRED that they view the platform as a social network. This is largely due to Channels—an one-to-many broadcast feature that allows unlimited subscribers to view posts. One of the posts that has gained the most traction on X was by right-wing former Fox News journalist Tucker Carlson, who alluded to the oft-repeated but debatable story that Durov left Russia because the government tried to take over his company. “But in the end, it wasn’t Putin who arrested him for allowing the public to exercise free speech. It was a western country,” Carlson wrote in a post that has so far been viewed at least 5.7 million times. Carlson also linked to an hour-long interview he did with Durov earlier this year, one of the first and only interviews the Telegram CEO has given in recent years. In Durov’s absence, Telegram’s future looks uncertain to some: “I am in shock, and everyone close to Pavel feels the same,” says Georgy Lobushkin, former head of PR at VK, a social network Durov cofounded, who is still in regular contact with Durov. “Nobody was prepared for this situation.” Asked if he worried about Telegram’s future and who could run the company in Durov’s absence, Lobushkin says: “[I] worry a lot.” TF1Info, which first broke the news in France of Durov’s arrest, reported that it was “beyond doubt” that Durov would remain in custody during the investigation. “Pavel Durov will end up in pretrial detention, that's for sure,” one unnamed investigator told reporters. “No one in Telegram was prepared for such a scenario,” says Anton Rozenberg, who worked with Durov from the early days of VK in 2007, before working for Telegram from 2016 to 2017. Rozenberg foresaw Durov acquiring the best legal defense money could buy. “But without him, the messenger may have huge problems with management, all crucial decisions and even payments,” he added, given Durov’s personal involvement in running the company. Rozenberg saw no obvious replacement for Durov, who makes key decisions on nearly all matters at Telegram—financing, development strategies, product design, monetization, and content moderation policy. For now, everything can be expected to continue as normal, says Elies Campo, who directed Telegram’s growth, business, and partnerships from 2015 to 2021. “Depending on how long this is going to last, it’s like a government, right? There’s this structure, there’s self-momentum.” Campo adds that the company’s staff is small enough—around 60 employees—that the infrastructure won’t be affected. The challenge, Campo concedes, would be if Durov needs to be physically present to pay providers—something Rozenberg also flagged. “As far as I know, Pavel did the payments,” Campo says. “So what's going to happen when there needs to be some payments for infrastructure providers, or providers in terms of connectivity—and he's still under arrest?”","summary":"Durov has reportedly been detained in France over Telegram's alleged failure to adequately moderate illegal content on the messaging app. His arrest sparked backlash and left some associates asking, what now?","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-arrest/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/66ca6d7eef92e0697a860966/16:9/w_4000,h_2250,c_limit/511820410","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 22:01:52","author":"Darren Loucaides","authors":["Darren Loucaides"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.469},{"id":254903912,"title":"Video of RFK Jr.'s Sister Condemning His Trump Support Takes Off Online","text":"A video segment of Kerry Kennedy, sister of former independent presidential candidate Robert F.

Kennedy Human Rights nonprofit organization that was founded in honor of her father, spoke with MSNBC's Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, in an interview appearance, two days after her brother dropped out of the race and endorsed the former president.Prior to exiting the race on Friday, Kennedy Jr. was the highest polling third-party candidate in the campaign, garnering around 5 percent of the vote, according to national aggregate polls.During her interview on Inside with Jen Psaki, Kerry Kennedy said that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are \"champions for the values that my family has fought for years. Donald Trump is the polar opposite. He's a threat to most basic freedoms.\"Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson, told Newsweek in an email Sunday morning in response to Max Kennedy's Los Angeles Times opinion article that expressed similar sentiments to Kerry Kennedy: \"President Trump is working to Save America from Comrade Kamala, and everyone should get on board. That's why so many people from different political backgrounds have supported President Trump.\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for updated comment via email on Sunday afternoon.Like many of her other family members, Kerry Kennedy denounced her brother's endorsement of Trump, saying she is \"outraged and disgusted\" by it. Five family members, including Kerry, posted a statement on Friday calling their brother's endorsement a \"betrayal\" of their family values.Kerry Kennedy initially endorsed Biden, but after his exit from the race on July 21, she shifted her support to Harris.She, like her brother Max Kennedy in his opinion piece published earlier today, referenced their father, Robert F.

Alastair Campbell, an activist, author, journalist, podcaster and political strategist, said younger people are leaving the political sphere due to how harshly they are treated by voters. Mr Campbell was then-prime minister Sir Tony's official spokesman and Downing Street press secretary from 1997 and later became director of communications and strategy at No 10. Speaking at a session during the Edinburgh Book Festival o n Sunday, host Isabel Hardman, assistant editor of The Spectator, asked Mr Campbell if \"good people\" are still entering politics. Mr Campbell, who is co-host of The Rest Is Politics podcast with former Conservative cabinet minister Rory Stewart, said he felt the current crop of politicians are generally of a lower standard because of the way they are treated by society. Mr Campbell said: \"Well, let's be frank about it, there are people who have just been elected who will become prime minister. \"There are people who have just been elected who will become foreign secretary and home secretary and chancellor in the next whatever - on both sides - so there will be very, very good people there. \"I think in general, the quality is lower than it was, but again, I think we've all got to take ownership of that. \"I think one of the reasons is we are so vile to them.\" The author of But What Can I Do? gave the example of the attacks made on Labour minister Jess Phillips, the MP for Birmingham Yardley, who he said receives \"so much abuse\", adding people have \"got to be very tough to go into politics at the moment\". Mr Campbell agreed with Ms Hardman that budding politicians \"have to have a thick skin that is almost on the level of a rhino hide\" in order to thrive. \"I agree. I've got a very, very thick skin. I put up with a lot of abuse, I get 'war criminal' every single day of my life on social media, very rarely to my face, but occasionally. \"And you do have to develop a thick skin, and you put your finger on it: developing your thick skin and remaining empathic to other people is hard, you have to think about how you do it.\" Mr Campbell said he met former SNP MP Mhairi Black, who had previously said the reason she did not stand for re-election was the \"toxic\" workplace environment at Westminster, on the night of the last General Election. \"I did Channel 4 on election night, and Mhairi Black was on, and I was thinking, 'there's Mhairi Black, she's still very, very young and she's given up politics', right? \"She's great. I mean, I'm Labour, she's SNP, but I just think she had something really special. She's given up.\" Mr Campbell said Ms Black, who was 20 when she was first elected in 2015 and is now 29, told him how unhappy she had been with how the Westminster Parliament operates. He made a wider point that many younger people, often in their 30s or 40s, are leaving politics, adding \"that can't just be about them\". \"That's about the experience that they're having as politicians and that's why I think we need to rebuild a sense of 'they're not as bad as we say'. \"Now, look, some of them are. It will be no secret to anybody who listens to my podcast or read anything I write, I despise Boris Johnson and what he did to this country.\" \"I've never picked that up,\" Ms Hardman joked, met with laughter from the audience. Mr Campbell added: \"I cannot stomach Donald Trump. Now there's two people who've ended up running countries, but I don't despise most politicians, and there are Tories that I can get on with.\" Mr Campbell's book, But What Can I Do, is available online.

And it extends beyond themselves to teammates as well. At the same time, they are likely to leave because they have so many opportunities and greater career mobility based on their capabilities. So how do you keep top performers and create the conditions for them to thrive, contribute and develop? It’s a critical question. The talent shortage is acute, and as a result, you want to hold onto your best people. In addition, engagement is at an 11-year low, requiring that you are intentional about culture and leadership. Fortunately, there are strategies that are especially effective in keeping and nurturing top performers. Top Performers Deliver Incredible Results—And Leave It’s important to know that top performers are especially critical to the organization. First, they deliver 400% greater productivity than an average performer. This is based on a study of over 600,000 people across job types, industries, time periods and assessment methods by researchers at Indiana University. Second, top performers have a positive effect on those around them. Specifically, those who sit within 25 feet of the best contributors tend to increase their own performance by 15%, according to research from Harvard. Third, top performers leave their organizations at higher rates than average employees. Specifically, 30% leave within the first year of their employment, according to research published in the Journal of Human Resource and Sustainability Studies. This is likely because they have significant career mobility based on their capability and visibility of their work (read: opportunity comes knocking for them). All of these factors create a perfect storm—making it especially crucial to lead and manage top performers effectively. How to Keep Top Performers MORE FOR YOU Floyd Mayweather Jr. Vs. John Gotti III Results: Winner And Reaction Apple iPhone 16 Release Date: New Report Hones In On Precise Date It ‘Ends Now’—Donald Trump Reveals Surprise Assault On ‘Crooked’ Wall Street These are the most important factors in creating the kind of work experience that top performers will stick around for. 1 - Provide Top Performers with Feedback and Recognition Never take top performers for granted, and ensure you’re providing plenty of feedback and recognition. Because top performers tend to maintain great performance over time, you’ll need to ensure you don’t take them for granted. If their first performance review reflects top marks, but then their next performance shows more average marks because you just know that’s how they perform, it will be a significant turn off for the employee. Be sure you’re always judging the top performer fairly and appreciating their ongoing performance. In addition, be sure you’re providing meaningful feedback. Typically, top performers get feedback that is based on their traits rather than their behaviors, according to a survey by Textio. For example, a leader may tell them they’re “brilliant”, rather than letting them know how the ways they approach problem solving are effective. Or a manager may say they’re a “team player” instead of being specific about how they bring others into the brainstorming process. Top performers need to hear which behaviors are working as well as how they can improve. Recognition is critical as well. When employees receive recognition, they are 20 times more likely to be engaged, according to a survey by Gallup and Workhuman. And according to Workleap, 87% of employees say that recognition is especially meaningful to them. So, be sure you’re providing appreciation, gratitude and reinforcement for top performers’ work. Provide top performers with opportunities for learning and promotion. getty 2 - Provide Top Performers with Rewards People don’t want praise alone, they also want to receive tangible rewards for their efforts—and if they’re delivering terrific results, it’s easy to justify providing them with great pay or bonuses. We all have a fundamental preference for fairness, so great employees want to know they’re being appropriately rewarded for the contribution they’re making. Pay them well, and find ways to give them bonuses or even perks like extra vacation. You’ll need to do this based on fairness and equity that is aligned with their work—and you don’t necessarily need to broadcast the way you’re rewarding them—but you will need to offer rewards for their work if you want to keep them around. 4 - Provide Top Performers with Meaningful Work Another important way to keep great employees motivated is to ensure you’re giving them meaningful work and substantive responsibilities. As much as possible, align what they are required to do with what they like to do. No job will offer a perfect match between these, but enrich their job as much as possible. Allow them to do job crafting in which they can shape the kind of work they focus on. Give them opportunities to work on projects that are adjacent to their core responsibilities or to contribute across departments. And provide opportunities for them to own their work and their outcomes—and to lead formally or informally. As much as possible, also keep evolving the content of their job. Instead of a static set of responsibilities, try to add fresh initiatives alongside their main tasks. 5 - Provide Top Performers with Growth Opportunities Also be sure to provide your best employees with learning, growth and development. Be sure these are a match to what they want—in terms of where their passions lie. They may be a especially talented on the marketing team, but have a desire to grow into a role on the strategy team. Also be sure to align with how they want to contribute. For example, if they don’t want the typical path of climbing the ladder, provide other options that are substantive and that leverage their skills. Find the right balance in giving them autonomy in shaping the learning they prefer, but also providing guidance and demonstrating you’re attentive to their progress. And ensure the learning pays off for them—by placing them on a leadership track or ensuring they receive appropriate promotions. 6 – Provide Top Performers with Mentorship When people have mentors, it is especially helpful to their success, but also their esteem. Link top performers with mentors who can guide them, provide advice, be a sounding board and also help them understand the culture and grow in their success within the organization. Because top performers have such a positive effect on others, also put them into roles mentoring others. By doing so, you reinforce their value and the impact they’re having—at the same time you’re magnifying it. 7 – Avoid Isolating Top Performers Feeling connected with colleagues is a fundamental aspect of retention. When people feel a sense of belonging and when they have good relationships with coworkers, they are more likely to stay with the organization. Be sure you don’t inadvertently undermine top performers’ relationships by over-focusing on them or creating resentment among team members. Great performance is always a team effort, and while someone may be a superstar, their success shouldn’t overshadow the performance of the team or the efforts of so many others who are part of the positive outcomes. In addition, avoid being personally threatened by a great performer. The best leaders surround themselves with those who talented and capable and who have tons of capability and potential. Remind yourself of your own unique contributions and of how there is plenty of recognition to go around. Having a top performer on your team doesn’t take away the opportunity for you to be a top performer as well. Keep Top Performers Ultimately, the strategies to keep top performers aren’t all that different than those for any level of performance. Everyone deserves to have meaningful work, helpful feedback and recognition, rewards for their efforts and opportunities to learn and grow. Providing these is a recipe for great leadership. And great leadership is good for all kinds of employees doing all kinds of work in all kinds of industries. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

The campaign has had no problems getting supporters to open their wallets since President Joe Biden announced on July 21 he was ending his campaign and quickly endorsed Harris. The campaign said it saw a surge of donations during last week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, accepted their nominations. “Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon wrote in a memo released by the campaign on Sunday. “Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day.” Trump has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump’s campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. The Harris fundraising totals were raised by Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. O’Malley Dillon said that nearly a third of contributions during convention week came from first-time contributors. About one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds were women, groups that the campaign sees as critical constituencies that Harris needs to turn out to win in November. The Harris campaign says it has also seen a surge in volunteer support for the vice president. During convention week, supporters signed up for nearly 200,000 volunteer shifts to help the campaign.

Pavel Durov, a dual citizen of France and Russia, was taken into custody at Paris-Le Bourget Airport on Saturday evening. This news has sent ripples through the tech world and caused immediate financial repercussions. The cryptocurrency Toncoin Toncoin , which is closely associated with Telegram, saw its value drop by 13% following the announcement of Durov's arrest. This arrest comes as a surprise to many, given Durov's high profile in the tech industry and Telegram's widespread use across the globe. The reasons behind the arrest are not yet fully clear, but they have sparked intense speculation and concern among Telegram's massive user base. What is Telegram? For those who might not be familiar with it, Telegram is much more than just another messaging app. Launched in 2013, it has grown from a simple messenger into a powerful social network with a range of features that go well beyond basic text messaging. Telegram offers: Anonymous channels where people can share information News feeds Bots that can automate various tasks Cryptocurrency features that allow users to buy and sell goods and services SPAIN - In this photo illustration, the online chat and communication app Signal Telegram logo seen ...

John Gotti III Results: Winner And Reaction Apple iPhone 16 Release Date: New Report Hones In On Precise Date It ‘Ends Now’—Donald Trump Reveals Surprise Assault On ‘Crooked’ Wall Street What sets Telegram apart from many other messaging apps is its focus on privacy and security. It uses encryption to protect users' messages and has become known for its stance against censorship. This has made it popular in countries where freedom of speech is limited. As of 2024, per Demand Sage, Telegram has approximately 900 million monthly active users. This reflects a significant increase from previous years, highlighting the platform's growing popularity. The app has seen a consistent rise in user base, adding hundreds of millions of new users over the past few years. Telegram's features, such as enhanced privacy options and its flexibility in supporting multimedia messages, voice, and video calls, have contributed to its broad appeal globally​. It's particularly popular in countries like India, Russia, Ukraine, and Iran. Telegram's popularity soared during times of crisis. For example, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainians began spending eight times more time on Telegram than before. The app became a crucial tool for sharing news, coordinating volunteer efforts, and even warning about air raids in areas where sirens couldn't be heard. Thoughts on Why Durov Was Arrested While the exact reasons for Durov's arrest haven't been officially announced, there are several theories based on Telegram's history and operations. One of the main criticisms of Telegram has been its lax approach to content moderation. The platform has been accused of allowing illegal activities to flourish, including arms trafficking, drug sales, and even human trafficking. Durov's arrest might be related to these ongoing concerns about illegal content on the platform. A close-up of the TikTok mobile app is being displayed on a smartphone screen next to the apps for ... [+] Instagram, Telegram, Facebook, X, YouTube, and Messenger in Brussels, Belgium, on November 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurPhoto via Getty Images Telegram has often been at odds with government regulations in various countries. Its strong stance on privacy and resistance to sharing user data with authorities has led to conflicts with governments around the world. The arrest could be related to non-compliance with French or EU regulations. Given Telegram's widespread use and its ability to spread information quickly, there might be national security concerns driving the arrest. It's important to note that these are speculations at this point, and the true reasons may only become clear as more information is released by French authorities. The Theories of Working with Russia or Not Telegram's relationship with Russia is complex and controversial. Despite efforts to distance the company from its Russian roots, debates about Kremlin ties continue to persist. Some argue that Telegram might be working with Russia. They point to its Russian origins and developers. Reports of servers in Russia raise concerns about data access. Telegram's enduring popularity in Russia, even as other foreign apps face restrictions, fuels suspicion. The failed 2018 blocking attempt in Russia is another point of contention. Some view it as a staged event to boost Telegram's credibility. Additionally, investigations suggest significant Russian revenue sources and oligarch bondholders.

Durov claims he was exiled from Russia in 2013 for refusing to share Ukrainian user data. Telegram's strong encryption and privacy features seem to contradict government surveillance interests. The platform's widespread use by opposition groups in authoritarian countries, including Russia, supports its independence. Telegram's global operations and conflicts with multiple governments also suggest autonomy. The truth is likely nuanced. Telegram's relationships with various governments, including Russia, may be more complex than simply \"for\" or \"against.\" Is it Censorship? Following the news of Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's arrest in France, several high-profile figures voiced their support on social media platforms, in particular X (Twitter). Notable among these were Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Elon Musk, and Rumble CEO Chris Pavlovski. Their support primarily centered around concerns for free speech and opposition to censorship. Kennedy emphasized the urgent need to protect free speech, while Musk repeatedly called for Durov's release. Pavlovski criticized France's actions, viewing the arrest as crossing a line in terms of censorship. X (Twitter) posted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr Sandy Carter Conservative commentator Ian Miles Cheong framed the situation as an attack on freedom of speech and an attempt to control information. These supporters generally view Durov's arrest as part of a larger issue concerning internet freedom and government control over digital platforms. Their reactions highlight the ongoing debate about the balance between free speech and content moderation on social media platforms, with Durov's case becoming a focal point for these discussions. Interesting is that Tucker Carlson interviewed the CEO of Telegram four months ago and posted it on YouTube. In that interview, Telegram founder Pavel Durov alleged significant pressure from U.S. authorities on his messaging platform. Durov claimed repeated encounters with FBI agents upon entering the U.S. and described attempts by cybersecurity officials to secretly recruit his engineer for information on Telegram's infrastructure. Durov interpreted these actions as efforts to gain greater control over Telegram, highlighting the ongoing tension between privacy-focused tech companies and government security interests. His claims underscore the challenges of balancing user privacy with national security concerns in the digital era. What's Next? Pavel Durov's arrest raises numerous questions about Telegram's future. Here are key areas to watch: Legal proceedings will take center stage. The charges against Durov and his response will be crucial. Telegram's day-to-day operations may face disruption. Interim leadership might be necessary. User privacy concerns will likely surge. Telegram must address these to maintain trust. Expect increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. New efforts to regulate the platform may emerge. The future of Toncoin and Telegram's cryptocurrency involvement could impact the broader crypto market. Content moderation policies might tighten if the arrest relates to illegal activities on the platform.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real time, falsely insisted that, “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States.” “I do not limit access to birth control or I.V.F. – THAT IS A LIE, these are all false stories that she’s making up,” he wrote. “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!”","summary":"“Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue.”","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/25/jd-vance-donald-trump-veto-national-abortion-ban/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24234762669044-e1724621939319.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:48:09","author":"Jill Colvin,The Associated Press","authors":["Jill Colvin","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":254903614,"title":"Today’s NYT ‘Strands’ Hints, Spangram And Answers For Monday, August 26","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Today's NYT Strands hints and answers.

He argued this comes down to a few reasons, such as Harris’s lack of policy discussion and current polling having her further behind Trump than former presidential candidates Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. “And then, No. 3, Kamala Harris cannot run from Joe Biden,” Donalds said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. “I know she’s trying to run as a prosecutor, but her current title is vice president of the United States, and she was riding shotgun with Joe Biden, creating one of the worst economies for working families and middle-class families in the history of our country while leaving our southern border wide open to more than 10 million illegal immigrants. I believe that Donald Trump is well positioned to win this race.” Donalds also contended that the Democratic Party has been in charge for 12 of the last 16 years, and the only time people were better off was when Trump was president. He backed up his statement by arguing the economy was “flourishing” and that there were no new wars under Trump’s leadership. When asked if he believes Trump can convince swing voters to support him over Harris, Donalds said he does, but that Trump needs to show the contrast between his policies and Harris’s. He also cautioned that wealthy people in the country will not be affected by Harris’s policies should she become president, and those who would be financially hurt would be working families and senior residents on fixed incomes. Earlier this month, Donalds encouraged the former president to campaign against Harris’s “soft on crime” record, saying “she was bailing out rioters during the summer of love with the Black Lives Matter riots in Minneapolis.” He also suggested that Trump conduct events with victims, referencing how some of these victims were at the Republican National Convention and spoke about “the failures” of Biden and Harris.

The former president listed more than a dozen incidents of children and women being sexually assaulted or killed by illegal immigrants, including the deaths of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray of Texas and 37-year-old Rachel Morin of Maryland.

The South Carolina senator is one of Trump’s continued allies in the Senate, though he has been subject to boos at Trump’s rallies and the occasional put-down from Magaworld. On Sunday, he was interviewed by Jake Tapper on CNN and asked about a comment Trump had made on Truth Social following his live response to Kamala Harris’s primetime speech last week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Posting on Truth Social, Trump made several dozen short remarks during Harris’s speech — which ended up being quite a bit shorter than his own 92-minute address to July’s Republican National Convention. In one post the next morning, he would then go on to claim that his administration “will be great for women and their reproductive rights”. Graham was asked by Tapper how the former president’s second term in the White House would fit that description: “I don’t know, you’d have to ask him,” he demurred. He then did what Trump campaign officials likely wished he would not have, and segued into an argument in favor of a national abortion ban for so-called “late-term” abortions. Trump has said repeatedly that he does not support a national ban on abortion even as he has taken credit for the end of federal protections; Democrats argue he is lying. The latter half of Trump’s claim from Truth Social, at a minimum, is questionable. The ex-president has repeatedly taken credit for the nationwide rollback of federal abortion protections which occurred in 2022 when a conservative Supreme Court majority including three justices appointed by Trump overturned Roe v Wade. That decision has led to a wave of state-led efforts to restrict abortion, some of which have caused cases of pregnant women being denied critical care in hospitals fearful of running afoul of the law. Trump and his wing of the GOP have attempted a delicate dance around the issue even as Trump himself has grown increasingly confident about signaling his role in Roe’s downfall. The party, at his campaign’s behest, scrubbed support for a national abortion banfrom their platform earlier this year. Graham himself famously declared Trump persona non grata in the Republican Party in the immediate wake of the January 6 siege on Congress, committed by the ex-president’s supporters and aimed at blocking lawmakers from certifying the 2020 election. But Graham and many other Republicans came back around and rejoined Magaworld, even at the expense of having to face uncomfortable questions about that day. That happened to Graham on Sunday as Tapper also questioned him about the ongoing lionization of January 6 rioters by the Republican base, pointing to a “January 6 awards gala” set to be held by some right-wing Maga groups. Former President Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports pardons and official apologies for some Americans charged and convicted in the January 6 attack, despite dozens of police officers being battered and injured during the assault. The South Carolina senator argued that any rioter convicted of attacking a police officer should go to jail, though he appeared to leave room for others to be let off. “The people who broke into the Capitol and assaulted police officers should go to jail. They committed a crime,” said Graham, while adding that “both parties” needed to “knock off” the normalization of political violence.","summary":"Trump issued Truth Social tirade amid Kamala Harris’s DNC primetime speech","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/graham-cnn-trump-dnc-kamala-b2601713.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/29/14/SEI201150922.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MG5T12Xm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:41:48","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":254906498,"title":"\"American women are not stupid\": Warren isn't buying that Trump would veto a federal abortion ban","text":"During his appearance on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, JD Vance told host Kristen Welker that Donald Trump has “explicitly” said that he would veto a federal abortion ban if a bill were to be passed by Congress. “I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said. “Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue.” And to this, Elizabeth Warren is calling BS.

The campaign has had no problems getting supporters to open their wallets since President Joe Biden announced on July 21 he was ending his campaign and quickly endorsed Harris. The campaign said it saw a surge of donations during last week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, accepted their nominations. “Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark,\" campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon wrote in a memo released by the campaign on Sunday. \"Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day.” Trump has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump's campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. The Harris fundraising totals were raised by Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. O'Malley Dillon said that nearly a third of contributions during convention week came from first-time contributors. About one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds were women, groups that the campaign sees as critical constituencies that Harris needs to turn out to win in November. The Harris campaign says it has also seen a surge in volunteer support for the vice president. During convention week, supporters signed up for nearly 200,000 volunteer shifts to help the campaign. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk By Grant Tucker Entertainment Editor Published:22:29 BST, 25 August 2024 |Updated:22:37 BST, 25 August 2024 e-mail View comments BBC bosses have slashed Strictly’s budget for the upcoming 20th series amid a series of scandals which could lead to payouts for former stars. The casting budget on the flagship show was cut in the wake of the Strictly bullying scandal, according to Corporation sources. Instead funding has been diverted to increased welfare measures on the dance show. There are concerns among bosses of further financial strain as former stars line up to make claims for being mistreated during their time on the show. The current scandal has seen numerous allegations of misbehaviour and forced professional dancers Graziano Di Prima and Giovanni Pernice to exit the long-running Saturday night programme. BBC bosses have slashed Strictly ’s budget for the upcoming 20th series amid a series of scandals which could lead to payouts for former stars The current scandal has seen numerous allegations of misbehaviour and forced professional dancers Graziano Di Prima and Giovanni Pernice (pictured) to exit the long-running show Read More Sacked Strictly star Graziano Di Prima 'wants to sue BBC' and has 'already hired top lawyers' A source said: ‘Money had to be found to pay for chaperones and welfare producers, and we still don’t know how much all these allegations are going to cost the show. It is not going to be cheap. A decision was made to make cuts to the cast.’ The reduced casting budget was noticeable with scores of Strictly fans underwhelmed when this year’s celebrity lineup was unveiled earlier this month. Audiences were left scratching their heads as they struggled to recognise little-known TV doctor Punam Krishnan and former Love Island contestant Tasha Ghouri. The source said that the only contestants on big money among this year’s cast are DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and football pundit Paul Merson. They added: ‘The line-up is one of our cheapest ever. We know audiences are disappointed, especially given the quality of our celebrities in the last five years.’ It is a further blow for Strictly bosses who had high hopes for the 20th anniversary series, which launches on September 14. Working on the latest series will be a team of new production staff to chaperone the celebrity stars. They will be present in rehearsal room training at all times to monitor any signs of inappropriate behaviour. BBC bosses were forced to take ‘decisive steps’ to improve the show’s protection for celebrities after allegations of abuse were made by contestants including actress Amanda Abbington and former reality TV star Zara McDermott. BBC bosses were forced to take ‘decisive steps’ to improve the show’s protection for celebrities after allegations of abuse were made by contestants including actress Amanda Abbington and former reality TV star Zara McDermott (pictured) Pernice, Strictly’s longest-serving male pro, was accused of bullying by Abbington in rehearsals last year and a BBC investigation is still ongoing. The 33-year-old Sicilian has strongly denied any wrongdoing. The Mail on Sunday yesterday revealed Pernice was to be exonerated after Abbington’s accusations. BBC insiders told the newspaper there was no evidence that Pernice had bullied her. But the actress is said to be so determined to win her case that she is having what friends of Pernice describe as ‘one last throw of the dice’ by telling the BBC about a short video clip he sent to her on WhatsApp. Sources within the Corporation say it is ‘sex-related’ but in its nature was ‘very much banter’.
