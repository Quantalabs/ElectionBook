This progress was made possible through the efforts of governments and the generosity of donors – including those in government, the private sector and philanthropic organizations – whose unwavering support was critical to the prevetntion and treatment of child malnutrition at a global scale.\n\n“Today, those hard-earned gains are being rolled back because humanitarian and nutrition partners face a different, deepening crisis – namely the sharp decline in funding support for our lifesaving work. But it is more than the quantity of the reductions … the problem is also how they have been made – in some cases, suddenly and without warning, leaving us with no time to mitigate their impact on our programmes for children.\n\n“Earlier this week, I saw the consequences of the funding crisis firsthand when I visited the Afar region in the north of Ethiopia and Maiduguri in northeast Nigeria. Due to funding gaps in both countries, nearly 1.3 million children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition could lose access to treatment over the course of the year – leaving them at heightened risk of death. \n\n“In Afar, a region that is prone to recurrent drought and floods, I visited a mobile health and nutrition team providing life-saving services to pastoralist communities in remote areas without health clinics. These teams are critical to supporting children with vital assistance, including treatment of severe wasting, vaccinations and essential medicines,” she noted.\n\nThe UNICEF boss emphasised that without the critical interventions, children’s lives were in peril as only seven of the 30 mobile health and nutrition units that UNICEF supports in Afar ere currently operational, declaring that such situation was a direct result of the global funding crisis.\n\n“We estimate that without new sources of funding, UNICEF will run out of Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food to treat children suffering from severe wasting in May – which could have dire consequences for the nearly an estimated 74,500 children in Ethiopia who require treatment each month.\n\n“In Nigeria, where around 80,000 children per month require treatment, we could run out of RUTF supplies sometime between this month and the end of May. But the focus cannot just be on RUTF – or treating a child once they become severely malnourished. Programmes must deliver services to prevent children from becoming malnourished in the first place – this includes support for breastfeeding, access to micronutrient supplementation such as Vitamin A and ensuring they get the health services they need for other illnesses.\n\n“The funding crisis goes far beyond Ethiopia and Nigeria … this is happening around the world, and the most vulnerable children are bearing the brunt,” he highlighted.\n\nShe stated that UNICEF’s immediate concern is that any disruption to its life-saving activities could endanger millions of children, as over 213 million children in 146 countries will need humanitarian aid in 2025.\n\nShe, however, said despite this, UNICEF remains committed to delivering support and working with partners to ensure efficient, effective, and accountable efforts.\n\n“While reviews of foreign assistance are ongoing in capitals around the world, I want to remind government leaders that delaying action doesn’t just harm children—it drives up the cost for us all. Investing in children’s survival and wellbeing is not only the right thing to do, it’s also the most economically sound choice any government can make,” she added.","summary":"The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund has said 1.3 million children (under the age of five) suffering from severe acute malnutrition can lose access to treatment, leaving them at heightened risk of death.

As protests grew on university campuses and in cities and towns across Turkey, she could no longer resist joining.\n\n“I saw the spark in people’s eyes and the excitement on their faces, and I decided I had to come down here,” she said with a grin, standing among tens of thousands that defied a ban on assembly to fill the streets around city hall on Friday night. Despite the crowds, Azra feared reprisals and declined to give her full name. Many demonstrators were masked in a bid to defy facial recognition -technology and fearing the teargas or pepper spray sometimes deployed by the police. Others smiled and took -selfies to celebrate as fireworks illuminated the night sky.\n\nThe arrest of the mayor of Turkey’s largest city in a dawn raid last week was a watershed moment in the country’s prolonged shift away from democracy. Opponents of president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fear it is a move to -sideline the sole challenger capable of defeating him in upcoming elections, expected before 2028.\n\nEarly on Sunday, prosecutors requested the formal arrest and jailing pending trial of İmamoğlu, who was being held pending a court decision. On Saturday, protests in support of İmamoğlu erupted in Istanbul – where flares and stones where thrown at police, who responded with pepper spray – while in Ankara, the capital, police used water cannon and tear gas on demonstrators. The interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said 323 people had been detained following protests on Saturday night. Earlier, he said: “There will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people’s peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.”\n\nDuring the week, İmamoğlu and more than 100 other people including municipal officials and the head of the mayor’s construction firm were served -detention orders and accused of embezzlement and corruption – charges the mayor denies. He also denies terrorism charges levelled at him over collaboration with a leftwing political coalition prior to local elections last year, which saw major losses for Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP).\n\nJustice minister Yılmaz Tunç attempted to rebuff any suspicion the charges against İmamoğlu and -others from the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) were -politicised. “Attempting to associate judicial investigations and cases with our president is, to say the least, an act of audacity and irresponsibility,” he said.\n\nWithin days, what began as protests in response to İmamoğlu’s detention has grown into something more. “This is bigger than İmamoğlu. It’s about a fight for democracy, law and equal rights,” said Azra as demonstrators massed around her.\n\nThe Turkish president has long sought to retake Istanbul from opposition control, fuelling protesters’ joy at defying a ban on gatherings in the city where Erdoğan began his -political career as mayor. Standing outside a metro station as hundreds of cheering people poured into the street, breaking into anti-government chants and banging on the escalators, another protester, named Diler, called the demonstrations “a response to the pressure that has built up over years”.\n\n“There are problems with the -economy, with education, with the health -system,” she said in a nod to the -economic -crisis that has seen the cost of -living soar. “We are fed up with this government.”\n\nSupporters of the mayor said 300,000 people joined the demonstration in Istanbul on Friday night, while video showed protesters taking to the streets and clashing with the police in major towns and cities across the country. Turkish interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said 343 -people were detained across nine cities after taking part in demonstrations.\n\nTurkish authorities ratcheted up their attempts to quell the growing protests, including blocking traffic across two bridges leading to city hall in Istanbul and locking down several thoroughfares nearby with lines of riot police.\n\nErdoğan voiced his increasing -displeasure at calls to demonstrate by the head of the opposition, saying: “Turkey is not a country that will be on the street – it will not surrender to street terrorism.”\n\nDespite the domestic outrage at İmamoğlu’s detention, the international response remained muted. The clearest reaction was -financial, with estimates that the Turkish central bank spent a record $11.5bn propping up the lira the day after İmamoğlu’s arrest as investors fled and the -currency plunged in value.\n\nReactions elsewhere were far less impactful. A spokesperson for the UN secretary general said they hoped “the normal rules for due process will be followed”, while US state -department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Washington “will not comment on the internal decision-making -processes of another country”.\n\nUS president Donald Trump and Erdoğan spoke by phone just days before İmamoğlu’s arrest amid reports the Turkish leader is seeking a meeting at the White House in the coming months.\n\nUS Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff told rightwing pundit Tucker Carlson in an interview that Trump and Erdoğan’s conversation was “transformational”, adding: “I think there’s just a lot of good, positive news -coming out of Turkey right now.”\n\n“The international climate has Erdoğan feeling very confident,” said Gönül Tol, an analyst with the Washington-based Middle East Institute.\n\n“The president of the United States is undermining democracy there, meaning the US is looking inward. He just doesn’t care what other foreign autocrats are doing to their people. Those things are really impacting a global climate where autocrats think they can do whatever they want.”\n\nEuropean leaders previously quick to criticise Erdoğan, such as French president Emmanuel Macron, have yet to voice objections to events in Turkey amid expectations they could increasingly look to Ankara to supply peacekeepers in Ukraine.\n\n“With Trump’s return to the White House and his shift towards Russia on Ukraine, the Europeans are panicking and trying to boost defence,” said Tol. “In this climate where Europe feels it has to defend itself against Russia alone, there’s more talk about engaging Erdoğan.”\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen became the highest-ranking official to offer any criticism, stating Turkey “must protect democratic values, especially the rights of elected officials”.\n\nSoner Cagaptay, a biographer of Erdoğan and an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said such statements were not likely to prompt any change in policy.\n\n“There are unlikely to be any meaningful actions to follow; there will be no sanctions or disinviting Erdoğan to summits, declining to include Turkey in future planning. There will be no concrete repercussions, because of the way Turkey has positioned itself in this new global arena as an important power,” he said.\n\nRelated: ‘This is about injustice’: crowds defy ban to protest over Istanbul mayor’s detention\n\nThe CHP is expected to push ahead with declaring İmamoğlu its -candidate for president this -weekend, after a symbolic primary vote. Those -outside city hall were insistent the Istanbul mayor should remain the opposition’s candidate, even if this means his running from prison.\n\nCagaptay said despite the lack of international criticism, the push to -nullify İmamoğlu could still -backfire. Erdoğan was briefly jailed in the 1990s while mayor of Istanbul, -galvanising his -support and fuelling his run for national politics.\n\n“He entered jail as a mayor and exited as a national hero,” said Cagaptay.\n\n“Erdoğan is betting this won’t happen [now] due to state capture, his control of institutions and the media, and he’s not worried about international criticism.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/turkey-protests-over-istanbul-mayor-160445010.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/a8e8c82b376f400b2d8567929614eb3d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:56:05","author":"Ruth Michaelson In Istanbul","authors":["Ruth Michaelson In Istanbul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":303105454,"title":"Canada's oil and gas CEOs using Trump threats for profit, says minister","text":"The CEOs of Canada’s largest oil and gas companies are using the fear of U.S. tariffs to unshackle themselves from government regulation and profit from crisis, the country's federal energy minister said.\n\nIn an interview with BIV, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson pushed back against the CEOs of the 10 of the largest oil and gas companies and the four largest pipeline companies in Canada, after they wrote an open letter to federal political leaders detailing their plan to strengthen the country’s economy. \n\nThe plan included declaring an “energy crisis” and using emergency powers to speed up development of key projects in the “national interest.”\n\nThe executives also called on Ottawa to eliminate the federal government’s cap on emissions; reassess the West Coast limit on oil tankers; and perhaps most significantly, repeal the carbon levy on large industrial emitters. \n\n“Ottawa’s elected eco-extremists have done everything they can to keep our oil and gas in the ground — that has to change now,” wrote Alberta Premier Danielle Smith in her own open letter Thursday.\n\nWilkinson said the comments represent an about-face by industry leaders, who had spent years publicly backing the industrial price on carbon as a mechanism to modernize high-emitting industries. \n\nCompany executives and Alberta's premier are using U.S. President Donald Trump as an excuse to say: “We don't care about climate change. We don't care about carbon emissions. We just want to be able to do whatever it is that we're going to do,” said the minister. \n\nOil and gas executives flip positions on industrial carbon pricing\n\nIn his own letter to CEOs, Wilkinson pointed out comments Suncor president and chief executive officer Rich Kruger made at a hearing at the House of Commons in June 2024. \n\n“I do support a price on carbon across the economy,\" Kruger said at the time, “because I believe that will drive the innovation, the economic incentives on all of our part to continue to improve our business.\"\n\nDerek Evans, executive chairman of the Pathways Alliance oil industry group also took a very different stand in previous comments. \n\n\"The advice I would give Pierre Poilievre is carbon policy is going to be absolutely critical to maintain our standing on the world stage,\" Evans said last year.\n\n\"We've talked for 40 years about climate change. And we've done very, very little about it.\"​\n\n​Wilkinson said he had no warning the CEOs were going to flip their position and is “frustrated” they weren’t honest with him. He said they seemingly looked “to profit from actions being taken south of the border — to the long-term detriment of your shareholders and Canadians generally.”\n\n“After spending millions of dollars over the past few years speaking to your sector's commitment to environmental sustainability — you arrive here,” as he put it in his letter.\n\nBarrelling toward 'moment of conflict'\n\nKathryn Harrison, a political science professor studying climate policy at the University of British Columbia, said Wilkinson’s move to oppose oil and gas executives comes as several undercurrents in climate policy come to a head with realities on the ground. \n\nCanada has committed to reducing its overall emissions 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Oil and gas operations make up about a third of the country’s overall emissions, meaning federal targets would be nearly impossible without changes to the fossil fuel industry. \n\n“It creates this moment of conflict,” said Harrison. “How do we meet our Paris agreement target without impacting production from the oil and gas industry?” \n\nAt the same time, support for climate policy has weakened across Canada in the past five years as voters looked to other crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation, said Harrison. Even the floods and heat dome that killed more than 600 people in 2021 seems like a distant memory for some, she said. \n\n“I've honestly been shocked by how short term the memory is, and I think it's because, you know, many people are struggling financially,” Harrison said. \n\nConservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre's push to “axe” the consumer price on carbon further undermined support in federal climate policy. \n\nThen came 2025 and the U.S. administration’s move to threaten, impose and dangle tariff after tariff on goods from Canada.\n\nPushing back against the threats, the Liberal Party's polling numbers have surged, especially under Prime Minister Mark Carney. The former banker immediately eliminated the consumer carbon tax. \n\nIn response, Poilievre has focused his political attacks on Carney and expanded his opposition to other aspects of federal climate policy. On Monday, the Conservative leader vowed to eliminate Ottawa's industrial price on carbon if elected. Two days later, the oil and gas CEOs released their letter calling for the same thing.\n\n“There is an understandable push to diversify Canada's export markets, and the oil and gas industry is seizing this moment to call for the unravelling of everything,” Harrison said. \n\nA pillar of Canada's climate and industrial policy\n\nAfter meeting with premiers from across Canada Friday, Carney said his government would move to enact a policy of “free trade by Canada Day” and set up a “one project, one review” system to fast-track the approval of major infrastructure projects. \n\nCarney also said his government, if re-elected, would keep the carbon emissions cap and focus on major investments in carbon capture technology. Draft regulations tabled by Ottawa would require producers to cut emissions by about one-third over the next eight years.\n\nLittle was said about Canada’s industrial price on carbon, which is expected to account for a third of a national decline in greenhouse gasses in the coming years.\n\nPast reporting has revealed many of Canada's largest oil and gas emitters have paid the lowest price for their carbon under the industrial output-based pricing system. Multi-year exemptions have also been provided to big LNG projects in B.C., documents have shown.\n\nDespite those shortcomings, there are few programs that rival industrial carbon pricing, said Dave Sawyer, principal economist with the Canadian Climate Institute.\n\n“It’s the single biggest emission-reducing program — provincial or federal — in Canada,” said Sawyer. “Pick a policy and it’s bigger.”\n\nAn industrial price on pollution works by applying an eight to 12 per cent levy on carbon released by large emitters. When a company in the program reduces its emissions, it receives credits — currently worth about $30 per tonne — that can be sold for cash on an open market to other companies so they can cover their own carbon pollution. \n\nThe system has proved cost effective since Alberta first rolled it out in 2007, said Sawyer. Since then, B.C. and Quebec have come up with their own version of industrial carbon pricing. The federal program applies to the rest of Canada's provinces and territories.\n\nAcross all jurisdictions, the prospect of credits has attracted billions of dollars of investment into Canada. \n\nMore than $60 billion at stake, says economist\n\nSawyer recently calculated that in Alberta alone, companies have banked $5 billion in credits. If the industrial price of carbon were eliminated, those assets would be wiped off the books. \n\nThe industrial price on carbon helps bankroll everything from small-scale agricultural projects to big investments in heavy industry, green energy projects, and decarbonization programs to make pulp mills and steel plants more efficient and more competitive.\n\nIf the system collapses, Sawyer calculated at least $57 billion in investment across more than 70 major projects would be put at risk.\n\n“That’s a conservative estimate,” said the economist. “You basically flip the project’s economics.” \n\nThe price on large emitters is meant to reduce greenhouse gases, but it’s also an industrial policy that allows Canadian manufacturers and producers to modernize equipment and access markets that want low-carbon products. \n\nEurope is in the process of rolling out carbon border adjustments — policies that will place tariffs on products whose manufacturing led to an out-sized release of emissions. \n\nSawyer analyzed about $3.8 billion in Canadian goods — mostly fabricated steel products — going to Europe. He said they would face up to $100 million in annual tariffs by 2026. \n\n“That’s a lot in competitive markets,” said the economist. \n\nCanada poised to be world's fifth largest gas exporter, says minister\n\nWhile pushing back against oil and gas CEOs, Wilkinson said he remains a “staunch supporter” of Canada’s energy sector. \n\nHe pointed to his government’s record of purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project and approving three LNG terminals in B.C.\n\nOn Friday, the minister said Ottawa would transfer another $200 million for the construction of Cedar LNG, a floating gas liquefaction facility being built off Kitimat, B.C.\n\nWilkinson said there’s an “increasingly urgent” need to accelerate the diversification of trade, and that includes speeding up projects designed to export gas. \n\n“Right now, almost every bit of gas that Canada sends outside of the country actually goes to the United States,” he said. \n\nIn B.C., Canada's approval of gas-processing plants — including LNG Canada Phase 1, Cedar LNG and Woodfibre LNG — is designed to divert some U.S.-bound gas to places like Japan, South Korea and other Asian countries, said Wilkinson. \n\nIf LNG Canada Phase 2 has its investment decision approved next year, the four combined projects would allow Canada to export 50 per cent more gas than it currently sends to the U.S, the energy minister claimed.\n\n“I don't think many people actually understand the magnitude of the diversification that is taking place in the context of being able to shift gas exports away from the United States, if that becomes necessary,” he said. “Canada would actually itself become the fifth largest LNG exporter in the world.”\n\nCritics question green gas claims, long-term demand\n\nCritics of LNG have raised concerns that gas isn't as clean as some proponents suggest.\n\nThe main ingredient in gas is methane. When it leaks into the air, it acts as a greenhouse gas 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years in the atmosphere. \n\nResearch has increasingly found more methane leaks along the gas supply chain than once thought — such as during extraction, as gas runs along pipelines, or when it’s shipped overseas.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) — which commands a wide audience and has long advised countries around the world on their energy policies since its birth in the wake of the 1973 global oil crisis — first modelled paths for the world to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in 2021. \n\nThat year, it concluded companies would need to abandon future oil and gas exploration and scrap new LNG projects if the world wanted to avoid heating the world 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. That’s the point where scientists say irreversible damage will be done to the Earth’s climate system.\n\nHarrison said there also remain big questions over whether newly built oil and gas infrastructure will be competitive on a global market. \n\nThe latest World Economic Outlook from the IEA anticipated that global demand for oil, gas and coal would peak by 2030, and then decline. \n\nExisting oil and gas infrastructure, found the fall 2024 report, would be enough to supply future demand if countries kept their promises to reduce carbon emissions. \n\n“The implication is that even under stated policies, we can expect a glut in production relative to demand after 2030,” said Harrison. “That raises big questions about the profitability after 2030 of new LNG terminals or new oil pipelines.”\n\nOne big element of uncertainty is how countries will react following U.S. President Trump’s attempts to gut environmental agencies and “drill, baby, drill,” as he has put it. \n\n“Will countries respond by relaxing their regulations in response to the Trump administration?” questioned Harrison. “That's exactly what these CEOs are asking Canada to do.”\n\n“From the private sector's perspective, the way to make them profitable is to have government subsidize them. So they're asking for more, looking for more federal and provincial funding in this moment of crisis.”\n\nHarrison worries that if big oil and gas projects start to fail as global demand declines, companies would look for another round of public investments to prop them up.\n\n“They're in a strong bargaining position right now, and are presumably looking for more,” she said. \n\nWith files from the Canadian Press","summary":"Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson accused oil and gas CEOs of using tariff fears to deregulate and increase their profits.","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/economy-law-politics/canadas-oil-and-gas-ceos-using-trump-threats-for-profit-says-minister-10414328","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/alaskahighwaynews/images/energy-pipelines/tmx-expansion-2021.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:50:28","author":"Stefan Labbé","authors":["Stefan Labbé"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.04},{"id":303105862,"title":"Elon Musk sounds off about Tesla drivers reportedly given low Uber ratings amid nationwide protests","text":"Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded Saturday to a social media post claiming an Uber worker driving a Tesla was given a 1-star rating amid national protests against the carmaker.

The deployment is in direct response to President Donald Trump's southern border executive orders and a national emergency declaration, with USNORTHCOM named as the Department of Defense's (DOD) operational lead.Both destroyers will work with LEDET teams, which specialize in maritime interdiction and counter-narcotics operations.Previous Navy-Coast Guard collaborations have yielded significant results, with joint operations preventing nearly 15 tons of cocaine from entering the U.S. last year alone. Criminal organizations increasingly use sophisticated vessels, including remote-operated submersibles, to smuggle drugs into the country.What People Are SayingGen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, U.S. Northern Command: \"With Spruance off the West Coast and USS Gravely in the Gulf of America, our maritime presence contributes to the all-domain, coordinated DOD response to the Presidential Executive Order and demonstrates our resolve to achieve operational control of the border.\"Sean Parnell, Pentagon Chief Spokesman: \"It's not only vital for the United States to have control of our border via land.

China, Canada and the EU have separately announced retaliatory tariffs.\nNone of these responses has proven effective. The appeasement strategy has quickly revealed its limitations. Japan remains concerned that the tariff Sword of Damocles may fall. Canadian and Mexican help with America’s illegal immigration and drug crisis also appears to be of no avail.\nAs with a school bully, showing weakness or catering to Trump’s whims is unlikely to motivate him to show mercy. His mockery of Canadia’s then-prime minister Justin Trudeau and threat to annex Canada is attributed in part to what he conceived as a weakness in Trudeau’s character.\n\nThe reality is that Trump needs all the resources he can lay his hands on to realise his Make America Great Again dream. He intends to fleece not just China, but the whole world.\nThe retaliatory tariffs have also turned out to be inadequate. One important criterion of the success of any countermeasure is its ability to deter Trump from levying further aggressive tariffs. Yet Trump remains as determined as ever to crush any resistance to his punitive import duties.\nTrump’s imposition of tariffs at will highlights the power of the US market over the rest of the world. This is what allows him to behave this way. The US is the world’s largest importer. It bought US$3.17 trillion of goods in 2023, accounting for 13 per cent of global imports. Furthermore, a number of countries have a high degree of dependence on the US.\nTo resist Trump’s economic coercion, it is essential for countries to minimise reliance on the US market. To be sure, weaning themselves off the US market will cause considerable pain. But short-term pain is preferable to enduring agony, or worse – just as the pain from appendicitis necessitates the removal of the appendix.\nAdmittedly, economic “de-risking” with the US would be fraught with challenges. For instance, geopolitics may get in the way. It has not gone unnoticed that the EU criticised Trump’s punitive tariffs on Canada and Australia while opting to ignore his action on China.\n\nBut the stakes are high if reliance on the US market is not lessened. Trump is leveraging this dependence when he wields his tariffs, and it is destroying the multilateral trading system, upending the global trade order and opening a Pandora’s Box of a bygone era – the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act saw global trade plummet by over 60 per cent between 1929 and 1934. Every effort must therefore be made to reduce reliance on the US market.\nFurthermore, de-risking with the US economically does not seem impossible. Over 80 per cent of global trade is conducted without America. And the potential for trade expansion among the rest of the world is huge. Brics countries, for example, would be able to absorb the effect of the loss of the US market in four years, according to Warwick Powell, an adjunct professor at Queensland University of Technology.\nFor this de-risking to happen, the rest of the world should strive to expand trade among themselves by improving market access and concluding trade agreements.\nIt is also imperative they work to shore up the multilateral trading system. This means standing up to Trump’s trade unilateralism, voicing opposition to his tariffs and filing complaints against the US at the World Trade Organization.\n\nIt also means they should refrain from adopting beggar-thy-neighbour policies such as erecting protectionist walls. In addition, they would be well advised to be on guard against Washington contravening WTO rules and insist on global trading norms in talks with the US.\nTo push back against Trump’s trade war, a unified response is essential. Operating independently would only play to Trump’s advantage, and render nations vulnerable to his bullying.\nSince Trump is unlikely to stop inflicting pain on other economies until his voter base or the US economy is badly hurt, concerted efforts should be geared to maximise the effect of retaliation on his major concerns. For this purpose, countries should work together to develop a list of common target products, which could focus on major US exports such as vehicles, aeroplanes, fossil fuels and agricultural products including soybean, wheat and beef.\nIdeally, a common minimum tariff for each target product would be set to enhance the impact of the retaliatory tariffs.","summary":"A unified response is essential.

This, as the US — the biggest revenue generator for these firms — unleashes global tariff wars under the new Donald Trump administration, triggering macro-economic uncertainties and fears of a potential recession. “Demand uncertainties from the second half of calendar year 2024 (2HCY24) have trickled into calendar year 2025 estimated (CY2025E) budgets, implying continued weakness in financial year 2026 estimated (FY2026E),” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on the IT sector. The IT services industry clocked the healthiest earnings rebound in six quarters in the October-to-December period backed by a modest uplift in business led by the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical. This had raised hopes of a likely boost in revenue growth from the low to high single digits in 2025 at top-tier firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCLTech. 119352643 However, the past few months have witnessed a return of the cautionary stance on client budgets in the US and other major regions, with the prevailing uncertainty likely to renew a pause in discretionary spending on technology. Experts have said this could inflate cost pressures, further delaying growth prospects for the $280-billion Indian outsourcing industry. Most firms, including top- and mid-tier ones, which scored robust deal wins previously, could see further protracted execution of the contracts. “The Trump administration is aggressively examining spending by US corporations on foreign products and services, but this is largely restricted to the EU, UK, Canada, China and Mexico at present. However, there is some expectation from industry leaders that exports of IT work to India will come under the spotlight as the tariff programmes get rolled out,” said Phil Fersht, founder and chief analyst at advisory firm HFS Group. Fersht believes the impact could ultimately result in about 20% cost increases for IT firms. Yet, stakeholders suggest they will wait and watch till April 2 — when Trump has pledged to impose reciprocal tariffs on many countries including India. This week, further heightening the concerns, the US Federal Reserve decided to pause interest rates citing sentiments sliding due to policy turmoil, and that inflation could rise faster than previously expected. On the positive side, Fed policymakers still expect the central bank to deliver two 0.25% rate cuts by this year-end as projected in December. A better FY26 Because of these factors, most companies and experts remain hopeful of a better FY26 than FY25, with an expected rebound from the second half of the coming fiscal year. “Some of the latest commentary by US retail companies raised concerns of a demand slowdown among US consumers. However, we see this as a sign of caution and not weakness, at least not yet,” wrote Kumar Rakesh, Indian IT analyst at BNP Paribas, in a March 6 report. He added that for 2025, major retail enterprises are targeting capital investments that match or surpass those of 2024. “While some of these firms highlighted weak demand in Feb-25, they have also seen strong retail sales during the Valentine weekend in the US. CEOs sentiment among US enterprises, especially for capex, continues to improve, giving comfort to our expectation of a demand recovery,” according to the report. Data from the BNP Paribas report showed deal wins in February moderated from the January highs but remained strong with TCS, Cognizant and DXC Technologies leading with three wins each followed by two announcements from HCLTech. Sectorally, it was on track with BFSI leading the deal momentum followed by energy and utilities contracts dominated by Europe with 11 deals. However, North America unexpectedly slowed with just two deal win announcements and the rest of the world bagging three deals. To be clear, the report does not show exhaustive deal wins. Moreover, most deal wins announced were related to IT and digital transformation, and business operation modernisation. Competitive landscape Analysts expect cost pressures on enterprises to increase competitive intensity in the software services industry as the latter faces a battle between margin protection and client retention. “The competition would be fierce given a modest increase in spending and a focus on spend efficiency by clients. These factors could impact pricing in new contracts,” the Kotak report highlighted. Further, select ESPs (external services providers) with strong capabilities in embedded engineering and offshore presence would benefit from large deal wins, it added. The intense competition is not just from smaller and mid-tier outsourcers but also insourcers or global capability centres (GCCs) of foreign companies, which could also be clients. To partly offset loss of business share to GCCs, India’s large and mid-sized IT services firms are also setting up dedicated units and practices with leadership and teams to help multinationals establish such centres. The AI impact There is a strong focus on small-and short-term deals though the emphasis remains on cost-efficiency and AI-led deals. On Thursday, IT services giant Accenture raised the lower end of its annual revenue forecast to 5-7% from 4-7% earlier, which is typically indicative of the likely performance by homegrown IT companies. TCS will kick start the Indian IT sector’s earnings season on April 10. “There were some pockets of improvement, for example, in banking and capital markets in the Americas, but again, going into the calendar year, discretionary spending was overall about the same constraint, and particularly in small deals that we’ve been seeing,” said Julie Sweet, CEO, Accenture. Accenture posted 5% revenue growth at $16.7 billion in FY24, but new bookings fell 3% while Gen AI new bookings edged up marginally to $1.4 billion from previous quarter’s $1.2 billion. “In H1, we did $1.1 billion in revenue, and last year, in FY24, we did $900 million for the entire year,” Sweet said in a post-earnings commentary. Accenture follows the September to August financial year. Most analysts agree that AI has transitioned from a buzzword to a core growth driver for the IT services industry. According to Fersht, the macro changes will further drive focus on AI-first services where increasing amounts of service provision are programmed into software platforms using agentic technology, generative AI and other AI technologies. The intense business environment is also witnessing an overhaul with reshaping of managements where at least eight new CEO changes at LTIMindtree, Cyient and Happiest Minds Technologies and at least three companies including Wipro tweaking their organisational structures since January this year. “For these firms, AI is both a tool to improve their own operations and a major service line, which can add value to their offerings. IT companies that successfully weave AI into their offerings are likely to see higher productivity, faster growth besides gaining access to larger transformation deals as clients accelerate investment in AI,” brokerage Centrum said in a report. Failing to embrace AI could render traditional outsourcing services less competitive, as automated solutions undercut labour-intensive work, it added. Hiring slowdown For the first time, the December quarter also saw a visible shift in commentary from labour to technology, signalling a slowdown in headcount expansion for the people-led outsourcing industry. While most IT companies announced increased commitment to hiring more than 82,000 freshers in FY26, overall employee addition is likely to remain subdued as companies remain on the edge for further recruitment. Looking ahead to FY26, the hiring outlook for the Indian IT services sectors remains subdued in the near term. “At the start of FY26, hiring in the IT sector is expected to remain cautious, with a focus primarily on niche skills essential for AI adoption and innovation,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD and CEO at mass recruitment firm CIEL HR. “Attrition rates, which reached a peak of 35% during the IT services boom, dropped to 18-20% in FY23 and further to 16-18% in FY24.” The drop in attrition is expected to persist due to economic slowdowns and a weak demand environment, he added. The Indian IT hiring landscape is transitioning towards a focus on efficiency, innovation and strategic workforce planning. With AI-driven automation reshaping business models, companies must prioritise digital transformation, employee upskilling, and advanced hiring strategies. “The growth momentum is expected to pick up in the second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate an 8-10% increase in hiring for IT services in FY26 with a primary focus on specialised skills like AI and data science,” said Kapil Joshi, CEO, Quess IT Staffing.","summary":"India's software services exporters face uncertainty as global tariff wars, particularly from the US, and economic concerns impact growth prospects.

LuckyChap also produced two of Emerald's other movies: Saltburn and Promising Young Woman. \n\nMargot Robbie wore a dramatic wedding gown as she began filming for Emerald Fennell's adaptation of Wuthering Heights on Friday\n\nThe actress, 36, is playing Catherine Earnshaw in the £62 million production, with Saltburn actor Jacob Elordi taking on the role of Heathcliff\nThe film will be directed by Emerald Fennell, 38, who also helmed Saltburn. No plot details have yet been revealed.\nMargot and Jacob are familiar with each other, as they star in the new short film, See You at 5, directed by Call Me by Your Name‘s Luca Guadagnino, for the new Chanel No. 5 campaign.\nMargot recently gushed about him in a new interview with Harper's Bazaar, saying, 'He's wonderful. And as you said, I worked with him on Saltburn in a producer-actor capacity. So I haven’t shared the screen with him before, but I know I've seen him on set, I've been around him on set, and he's just—he’s got an incredible presence.'\n'He's a movie star—he's got that charisma. He holds a frame. He's also really lovely and from the same state that I'm from in Australia. We're about an hour away from each other, but he's from Brisbane, and I'm from the Gold Coast.'\n'Even though the whole point of our film is that we cross paths and miss each other, it still felt like we did the campaign together.'\nBrontë's Wuthering Heights, published in 1850, is considered a masterpiece of English literature.\nThe original story centres around the Earnshaws, the Lintons, and their turbulent relationship with Heathcliff, a foster son of the Earnshaws.\nHeathcliff is one of the most infamous and complex romantic heroes in Western literature, known for his brooding nature and obsession with Cathy.\n\nMargot's long veil trailed behind her as it caught the breeze, while her costume was completed with a bouquet of roses\n\nFilming began in January with the film slated for a release date of February 2026\n\nThe Australian actress was a vision in white as the billowing veil was fanned out behind her\n\nThe star looked amazing in a wedding gown fitting off the period, featuring a structured bodice and full skirt\n\nThe actresses beautifully-styled locks were seen beneath her sheer veil\n\nThe cast grappled with the billowing veil as the actress got stuck into filming\n\nThe film will be directed by Emerald Fennell [pictured], 38, who also helmed Saltburn. No plot details have yet been revealed\nThere have been a number of film adaptions of the book over the years, with perhaps the most well known being the 1939 version directed by William Wyler, and starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier.\nThe most recent adaption is the 2011 film by Andrea Arnold, starring Kaya Scodelario and James Howson.\nWuthering Heights fans were puzzled by the casting choice when Margot and Jacob were announced for the new adaptation. \nThey noted that Catherine, who is no older than 19 in the novel, is being played by 34-year-old Margot Robbie. \nMeanwhile, Heathcliff, whose character is about 40 by the end of the story, will be portrayed by 27-year-old Jacob Elordi. \n\nThe role is a far cry from Margot's turn as Barbie in the 2023 hit film [pictured]\n\nThe film star swapped Malibu for the Moors as she got into character as Cathy\n\nThe crew were seen assisting Margot as she walked across the foggy Moors\n\nMargot's LuckyChap company is on board to produce the film.

There was a smattering of boos but they were drowned out by chants of 'USA'.\n\nTrump then took his seat in a VIP section by the mat next to Senator Dave McCormick and his wife Dina Powell.\n\nTrump's entourage at the event also included Elon Musk, Republican Jim Jordan, a two-time NCAA national champion wrestler, Outkick founder Clay Travis and his chief of staff Susie Wiles.\n\nTrump was pictured landing at Philadelphia International Airport on Air Force One just earlier in the evening and was greeted by Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin and his wife Christie Mullin.\n\nDonald Trump was given a standing ovation as he emerged from the bowels of the arena\n\nFans filmed the president and chanted 'USA' as he walked out to a standing ovation\n\nTrump then took his seat in a VIP section by the mat next to Senator Dave McCormick\n\nTrump shakes hands with Elon Musk and the rest of his entourage, who were sat by the mat\n\nRepublican Jim Jordan, a two-time NCAA national champion wrestler, speaks with Musk\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles was also among Trump's entourage at the event\n\nDonald Trump pays emotional tribute to George Foreman after boxing great dies: 'I knew him well'\n\nThe A-list entourage was in Philadelphia to watch Penn State try and secure its fourth straight men's team title. \n\nIt is the latest example of how Trump as mostly limited travel early in his new term to trips built around sports events.\n\nThe Republican president spent Friday night at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, about 70 miles northeast of Philadelphia, on what was his first visit there of his second term.\n\n'We're going to the big fight. The reason I'm going is in Philadelphia. They have the NCAA, world, wrestling for college.

It is also understood that the Austrian team has also struggled to make connections. \n\nMeanwhile former Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas has taken over from Josep Borrell as the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. She is also Vice-President of the European Commission and is known as a robust advocate for stronger more dynamic defence structures in the Union.\n\nThe issue, according to one Brussels insider, is that Kallas was not happy with the EUMC because of the length of time it took to build a consensus for advice and that as there was a difficult relationship with Brieger – she slotted in her own military advisor.\n\nThat is the fraught political atmosphere that Clancy and his team will be tasked with addressing. Multiple sources, both here in Ireland and abroad, said the first job will be to repair those connections.\n\nColonel Tim O'Brien will be promoted to Brigadier General when he makes the move to Brussels in June.Niall O'Connor / The Journal\n\nNiall O'Connor / The Journal / The Journal\n\nO’Brien and two other people on the team we interviewed this week, Naval Chief Petty Officer Cian McPartland and Air Corps Flight Quartermaster Tracey Walsh, did not discuss that political side but did say they are looking forward to getting stuck in.\n\nO’Brien said that his focus is managing Clancy’s office but he said he is fully cognisant of the fact that Europe and the EU is gripped in concerns about Russian activities, hybrid threats and individual member states worrying about the status of their security. \n\nO’Brien, who has extensive overseas experience, said that those issues around European defence is now front and centre. \n\n“This [deployment] wasn’t supposed to be into an area of crisis,” he said. \n\n“The role of the military staff here, when you have the European Council regularly discussing security and defence matters well, then the military voice they get is going to be extremely important and perhaps more important in this three year mandate.\n\nThe operations of the Irish led mission is broken down into several “cells” – they include policy, strategic communications and developing military advice. O’Brien stresses that Clancy and his team will relinquish their direct guidance from the Irish Government and they will be led by the EU institutions.\n\nThe non-commissioned ranks will be represented in the nine person team – McPartland and Walsh working in administrative roles for the coming three years. \n\nWalsh, who joined the Defence Forces first in the Army in the 1990s and then moved to the Air Corps, said people are not aware of how significant the appointment is for Ireland. \n\nShe has a long history of working with Seán Clancy when he was a helicopter pilot.\n\n“I suppose the first thing on this, it’s something very historical. It’s something that I believe that maybe the country doesn’t realise the importance of it or or how important the role the General is taking up.”\n\nMcPartland, who normally spends his work day on Naval operations and working in the communications and information technology section in Haulbowline, has also served overseas. \n\nHe said that he was “shocked” when he got the phone call to go – he said the historic nature of the mission was not lost on him.\n\n“Things are changing around the world and Europe is playing a more prominent part. There’s a determination by the whole Cabinet to hit the ground running and get into the guts of it as quick as we can.”\n\nThe team will take up their role on 1 June when Clancy arrives.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nNiall O'Connor\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Defence now Europe's 'number one focus' says Irish officer taking up military role in Brussels”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Defence now Europe's 'number one focus' says Irish officer taking up military role in Brussels”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nbrussels bound\nCian McPartland\nColonel Tim O'Brien\n\nFlight Quartermaster Tracey Walsh\nSean Clancy\nthe morning lead\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nDivision 1A\nCork blitz Galway to reach hurling league final as Tipperary defeat Clare\n\nQuiz: How much do you know about the original Snow White film?\n\nshannon lng\nFrom loss-making to lobbying: What we know about the company behind Kerry's planned gas plant\n\nUnited Rugby Championship\nLeinster suffer first defeat, Connacht's fightback falls short, and UIster escape Wales with win\n\nhave we dosed yet?\nParenting: Buckle up, this is going to get itchy... we're talking threadworms\n\nHere's What Happened Today: Saturday\n\nPlasterer off his medication was 'unhinged' in violent Dublin shop raids, court hears\n\nMan (50s) hospitalised after attack by XL Bully dog in Co Dublin\n\nTwo men seriously injured after shooting and violent disorder incidents in Tullamore\n\n'Dangerous Dublin': How two viral headlines were behind Conor McGregor's White House comments\n\nStephen McDermott\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nDaft.ie Property Magazine\n\nAllianz Home Magazine\n\nThe 42 Sports Magazine\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nThe Video Review\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

Ukrainian territory belongs to the Ukrainian state alone.'\n\nDonald Trump's special envoy has been accused of 'regurgitating Kremlin propaganda' and told to apologise to Ukraine's people\n\nSteve Witkoff (pictured) was labelled 'a disgrace' and 'out of his depth' over his comments about Ukraine giving up its territory\n\nMr Witkoff, 68, a billionaire property developer with no diplomatic experience, has been representing the US in visits to Moscow as part of Mr Trump's efforts to agree a ceasefire in Ukraine\n\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Green, who is on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ukraine, said: 'Witkoff doesn't care about Ukraine's sovereignty. He's more comfortable repeating Putin's propaganda than supporting Ukraine's heroic fighters and civilians.'\n\nAnd Dr Bob Seely, a former Tory MP and author of an upcoming book on Russian warfare, said: 'Witkoff is very clearly out of his depth and breathtakingly ill-informed. He doesn't know the names of the areas that he's talking about.\n\n'Saying the Ukrainian people want to be part of Russia – it is an absolute disgrace.\n\n'He makes no mention or recognition of the fact that in territories occupied by Russia the treatment of the Ukrainian citizens, whatever language they speak, has been appalling. \n\n'This man is simply regurgitating Kremlin propaganda. He should apologise to Ukrainians, and maybe talk to some Ukrainians who are dealing with the aftermath of the Russian invasion.'\n\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Green (pictured), who is on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ukraine, said: 'Witkoff doesn't care about Ukraine's sovereignty. He's more comfortable repeating Putin's propaganda than supporting Ukraine's heroic fighters and civilians'\n\nMr Witkoff said of the Russia-controlled territory: 'The elephant in the room is there are constitutional issues in Ukraine as to what they can concede to, with regard to giving up territory. \n\n'The Russians are de facto in control of these territories.\n\n'The question is, will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Can Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this?' \n\nHe also appeared to mix up Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, with the Eastern territories of Ukraine occupied since the 2022 invasion.\n\nMr Witkoff, a friend of Mr Trump's, was appointed as Middle East envoy but has since visited Russia twice to negotiate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIn the interview he also praised the relationship between Mr Trump and Vladimir Putin. \n\nHe said the Russian president had prayed for Mr Trump at a church in Moscow following the assassination attempt on him last July.\n\nHe also said Putin had presented him with a portrait of Mr Trump by a Russian artist, which Mr Witkoff then delivered to the US President.\n\nLast week Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after Mr Putin had rejected a 30-day full ceasefire\n\n'He was touched by it,' he said. 'This is the kind of connection that we've been able to re-establish, through, by the way, a simple word called communication.\n\n'President Putin had commissioned a beautiful portrait of President Trump, from the leading Russian artist, and asked me to take it home to Mr Trump.\n\n'It was such a gracious moment, and [he] told me his story… about how when the President was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the President.\n\n'Not because he was the President of the United [States]... but because he had a friendship and he was praying for his friend.'\n\nDr Seely said: 'The Russian negotiating team is highly professional and their tactics are very aggressive and controlled.\n\n'But you have these hotshot property guys walking into a world they just don't understand.\n\n'Ukraine has been invaded twice, in 2014 and 2022. No one in the occupied regions was given a choice, just the military oppression of the Russian State.'\n\nLast week Ukraine and Russia agreed in principle to a limited ceasefire after Mr Putin had rejected a 30-day full ceasefire.\n\nUkraineDonald TrumpRussiaMoscow\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nMPs' outrage over 'out of his depth' Donald Trump envoy who 'regurgitates Putin propaganda' about Ukraine - as Brit politicians brand him a 'disgrace'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Steve Witkoff was labelled 'a disgrace' and 'out of his depth' over his comments about Ukraine giving up its territory.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14527311/MPs-outrage-Donald-Trump-envoy-Putin-propaganda.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/22/23/96475693-0-image-a-8_1742687967417.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:04:44","author":"Anna Mikhailova,Editor","authors":["Anna Mikhailova","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.065},{"id":303099746,"title":"Rachel Reeves has six months to save her job: Rattled Labour MPs issue stark warning to Chancellor as unease over her £15bn plan to slash state spending  intensifies","text":"Rachel Reeves has been warned that she has six months to save her job, as Labour MPs grow increasingly restive over her plan to slash state spending by £15 billion.\n\nThe Chancellor is expected to announce deeper than expected cuts in her Spring Statement on Wednesday after she was forced to borrow an extra £20 billion over the first 11 months of the fiscal year – the result of inflation-busting pay rises for the public sector and spiralling welfare payments.\n\nSenior party sources say that if the economy has not sparked into life by the time of the Autumn Budget, Ms Reeves will have ‘run out of road’.\n\nThe Chancellor expected the economy to be in ‘credit’ by £10 billion at this point – her so-called ‘fiscal headroom’ – but flatlining growth means that the Treasury is closer to £5 billion in debt, necessitating at least £15 billion in cuts in order to return to her target.\n\nThe fiscal rules state day-to-day government spending must be paid for out of taxation, not borrowing, and stipulate debt must fall as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament.\n\nBut her £25 billion Budget raid on employers’ National Insurance last year hit business confidence and strangled growth, causing government borrowing costs to soar.\n\nA source said: ‘If we continue on this trajectory she will have three options to avoid a Liz Truss-style market turmoil – cut spending further, raise taxes or fiddle her fiscal rules to appear solvent. None of those will be politically acceptable and she will be at the end of the road.’\n\nDefence expenditure has already been boosted by cutting the foreign aid budgets, while a £5 billion cut to benefits was announced just last week.\n\nIn an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, the Chancellor pledges to keep ‘an iron grip on the country’s finances’.\n\nShe writes: ‘Stability must come first. And on that bedrock of stability, we will get our economy growing.’\n\nMs Reeves, who said yesterday that ‘we can’t tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services’, is nervous about her assault on public services being compared to the ‘austerity’ of former Tory chancellor George Osborne.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to halve its growth forecast for 2025 to around 1 per cent, piling more pressure on her to raise taxes again later this year to meet the fiscal rules.\n\nThe Treasury is searching for savings in addition to those from aid and welfare by targeting ‘unprotected’ spending departments such as the Home Office, Justice, Environment and local government.\n\nThe recent decision to abolish the NHS England quango could net another billion, while making more public services digital and reforming the civil service may yield another £3 billion and £2 billion respectively. \n\nPolling for today’s MoS shows that voters think Ms Reeves should cut spending rather than increase taxes.\n\nJust 18 per cent want to see an increase in taxes, compared with the 40 per cent for cutting spending and 11 per cent who think public borrowing should be increased. \n\nHowever, 46 per cent expect that she will increase taxes, while 26 per cent say she will slash spending.\n\nYesterday, Labour’s Lord Blunkett urged Reeves to ‘loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules’, calling them ‘Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst’.\n\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said: ‘The Labour Chancellor promised “growth, growth, growth” but since the Budget, growth is down, inflation is up, and business confidence has collapsed.\n\n‘Labour are having to come forward with an emergency Budget on Wednesday – a situation entirely of their own making. Rachel Reeves must urgently rethink her anti-business Budget.’\n\nVoters back benefit cuts - but fear the looming spectre of tax hikes\n\nThe public are clear what they want to hear when Rachel Reeves makes her Spring Statement on Wednesday – no more tax rises.\n\nLast year’s £25 billion hike in employers’ National Insurance payments has stifled economic confidence, and the electorate hope that is the end of the rises.\n\nExclusive research, by Tory former deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft and shared with The Mail on Sunday, shows that just 18 per cent of people want an increase in taxes.\n\nForty per cent back cutting spending and 11 per cent think public borrowing should rise.\n\nBut 46 per cent expect Ms Reeves will increase taxes, while 26 per cent say she will slash spending.\n\nReforms to the benefits system are welcomed by most of those surveyed, with 62 per cent agreeing that welfare should be amended to cut costs.\n\nLast week Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled changes aimed at saving £5 billion a year by 2030 and creating a ‘pro-work system’.\n\nThe survey shows that 39 per cent think it is too easy for people to apply for benefits. Just 18 per cent say it is not. \n\nThe poll also reveals that Sir Keir Starmer’s recent adventures on the world stage have arrested his plunge in the polls.\n\nHe is the best Prime Minister for 34 per cent of voters, compared to just 14 per cent for Tory Kemi Badenoch.\n\nSir Keir has extended his lead over Ms Badenoch from 12 to 20 points since meeting Donald Trump and rallying European leaders behind Ukraine.\n\nThe PM has also benefited from Reform UK feuding which pitted leader Nigel Farage against MP Rupert Lowe. \n\nAsked their view of Mr Farage, more than twice as many people think ‘he just wants to get publicity and cause trouble’ as think he ‘wants to get into government and change things’.\n\nThe King receives strong backing over his support for Canada in its diplomatic battle with Mr Trump. Seventy-one per cent told researchers he was right to do so.\n\nA total of 5,111 people were polled between March 13 and 17.","summary":"The Chancellor is expected to announce deeper than expected cuts in her Spring Statement on Wednesday after she was forced to borrow an extra £20 billion over the first 11 months of the fiscal year","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14526849/Rachel-Reeves-six-months-save-job-Rattled-Labour-MPs-issue-stark-warning-Chancellor-unease-15bn-plan-slash-state-spending-intensifies.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/22/19/96471345-0-image-m-9_1742673054468.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-23 00:02:33","author":"Editor,Glen Owen,Patrick Tooher","authors":["Editor","Glen Owen","Patrick Tooher"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":303103438,"title":"FEMA disaster workers need Homeland Security secretary’s approval to stay on job","text":"By Ellen M. Gilmer | Bloomberg News\n\nMost Federal Emergency Management Agency employees will need Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s approval to stay on the job after their current terms expire, paving the way for significant staffing reductions as President Donald Trump seeks to shrink federal agencies.\n\nFEMA announced the policy change Friday, stipulating that all renewals and extensions of term positions are subject to the secretary’s approval, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg Government. That includes reservists, temporary full-time employees, local hires, and on-call response employees who make up the bulk of the disaster agency’s workforce.\n\n“In order to get American citizens the rapid relief they deserve and demand, we are cutting out wasteful spending and bureaucracy that slows down relief efforts,” Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “FEMA has implemented a full hiring freeze and instituted a DHS review process for all disaster-field positions that are up for renewal.”\n\nThe cuts follow Trump’s broader efforts to slash the federal workforce. He has targeted FEMA explicitly, saying the agency should be restructured or even eliminated following complaints about its response to recent disasters in North Carolina and California. He created a council in January to explore overhaul options and issued an executive order promoting greater state and local involvement in emergency management.\n\nFriday’s memo, first reported by CBS News, leaves the fate of most FEMA workers in Noem‘s hands, as their employment terms reach expiration. Reservists and on-call workers made up nearly 80% of agency employees, as of fiscal 2022. Reservists deploy as needed for emergency management response and Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees are a separate category of workers who work directly on disaster response and recovery efforts.\n\nThe policy change includes exceptions for some positions, including fee-funded positions, emergency management specialists, attorneys, and human resources specialists. External hiring and onboarding of new FEMA employees, other than political officials, is on pause, according to the memo.\n\nFEMA’s top political official earlier this week outlined plans to narrow the agency’s mission and possibly close regional offices.\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the “broad abuse” of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.\n\nDuring his campaign President Donald Trump promised to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally, and as president he has been also ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S. and to stay.\n\nDHS said parolees without a lawful basis to stay in the U.S. “must depart” before their parole termination date.\n\n“Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,” DHS said.\n\nBefore the new order, the beneficiaries of the program could stay in the U.S. until their parole expires, although the administration had stopped processing their applications for asylum, visas and other requests that might allow them to remain longer.\n\nThe administration decision has already been challenged in federal courts.\n\nA group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for the four nationalities.\n\nLawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government’s decision.\n\nREAD MORE | Judge calls DOJ’s deportation flight submission ‘woefully insufficient’\n\nFriday’s action is “going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country,” said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February. She called it “reckless, cruel and counterproductive.”\n\nThe Biden administration allowed up to 30,000 people a month from the four countries to come to the United States for two years with eligibility to work. It persuaded Mexico to take back the same number from those countries because the U.S. could deport few, if any, to their homes.\n\nCuba generally accepted about one deportation flight a month, while Venezuela and Nicaragua refused to take any. All three are U.S. adversaries.\n\nHaiti accepted many deportation flights, especially after a surge of migrants from the Caribbean country in the small border town of Del Rio, Texas, in 2021. But Haiti has been in constant turmoil, hampering U.S. efforts.\n\nSince late 2022, more than half a million people have come to the U.S. under the policy, also known as CHNV. It was a part of the Biden administration’s approach to encourage people to come through new legal channels while cracking down on those who crossed the border illegally.\n\nAP editor Elliot Spagat and writer Tim Sullivan contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMIAMI &#8212; The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it will&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Did Trump cancel the legal residency of immigrants?

The Republican president, who in February said he was revoking the security clearance for former President Joe Biden, defeated Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Harris in last year&apos;s election. \"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information,\" Trump said in a late Saturday memorandum that also included former Secretary of State Antony Blinken. While the revocations may not have immediate impacts, it is another sign of the growing political rift in Washington as Trump seeks revenge on his perceived enemies. The memorandum was issued hours after Trump arrived at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf property for the weekend. Trump also targeted Republican former Representative Liz Cheney, a sharp Trump critic, former Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on his National Security Council during his first term. Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer in Washington who represents whistleblowers, and Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican lawmaker who is a sharp Trump critic, were among several others who had their security clearances revoked. Saturday&apos;s order confirmed that Biden&apos;s security clearance had been revoked, denying the former president the traditional access to US intelligence. Former US presidents have traditionally received intelligence briefings so they can advise incumbent presidents on national security and foreign policy. In 2021, Biden revoked the security clearance for Trump, who was then a former president.","summary":"Former US presidents and security officials have traditionally received intelligence briefings as a courtesy.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/donald-trump-revokes-security-clearances-for-kamala-harris-and-hillary-clinton/tzxafls2v","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/516cad7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2Fbf%2F39f35c124ad08387292f9e21a875%2Faust-open-3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:43:34","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.069},{"id":303099292,"title":"Unveiling the confidential list of daytime TV hosts from A to Z: Insider spills the beans on the anchor ready to leave and another known for being ruthless.","text":"Although a range of household anchors help to wake up the nation every morning with their expert knowledge and inside scoops on the news, who the real kings and queens of morning broadcast news are has been long up for debate… until now.\n\nThe Today show and Good Morning America have been staples across the country for decades, with CBS Mornings entering the fold in recent years.\n\nAnd while these shows all claim to be one big happy family, each has their own breakout stars: Gayle King, Savannah Guthrie, and Robin Roberts to name but a few.\n\nThe Daily Mail has taken a close look at the who’s who of morning television, unpacking how one popular star with a ‘ruthless streak’ has made it to the top, while another host is being singlehandedly blamed for major job cuts at GMA. \n\nAnd, even more crushingly, how one of the biggest names in daytime has had a fall from grace after a single move, which now runs the risk of destroying their career for good.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s look at America’s daytime power ranking – from A-list to D-list…\n\nDubbed ‘the first lady of Good Morning America’, Robin Roberts has been an anchor on the show for over two decades and has a price tag to match. She is said to be earning $20 million a year, making her the highest paid member of the GMA team.\n\nHer longevity means she is usually the first port of call to interview big name guests, including President Joe Biden’s first interview in the White House in 2020, and she co-hosted ABC’s coverage of Harry and Meghan’s wedding.\n\nWhile she doesn’t hide her sexual orientation, Robin has been more discreet about her private life on-air since she faced criticism when she brought her wife Amber Laign on the show in 2023 to celebrate their nuptials.\n\nA GMA source tells me that she is popular behind the cameras with production staff but will do anything to protect her squeaky-clean image.\n\n‘She’s got a ruthless streak. You don’t get to the top and stay at the top by chance,’ the insider claimed.\n\nI’m told that was the reason she didn’t invite her former long-time colleagues Amy Robach and TJ Holmes to her wedding after they had an affair and were fired by ABC.\n\nJoining Robin on the A-List of daytime television is Today show powerhouse Savannah Guthrie.\n\nHaving co-anchored the program since 2012, the 53-year-old broadcaster has found herself at the front and center of the country’s most popular morning show – and she’s not going anywhere.\n\nSavannah began her tenure at the network hosting alongside disgraced presenter Matt Lauer, before going on to present alongside Hoda Kotb.\n\nAs of January, following Hoda’s departure, Savannah fronts Today with Craig Melvin, and is undeniably the bigger name of the two.\n\nWith 13 years of experience under her belt, it’s no wonder that she has accrued power and popularity on the network – and there’s simply no one more dedicated.\n\nSavannah was across Today’s election coverage on the morning of November 5 and returned for the network’s evening coverage before she resumed her position the following morning – a tireless stint that didn’t go unnoticed by viewers at home.\n\nShe hasn’t completely escaped salacious gossip though, with reports emerging in 2022 and she and Hoda were secretly feuding behind the scenes.\n\nThose reports were later deemed baseless by sources close to the Today show.\n\nNepo-baby television host Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of former president George W. Bush and Laura Bush, leads the B-list.\n\nMom-of-three Jenna, 43, has fronted the Today show’s fourth hour since 2019, initially joining the program as Hoda’s presenting partner.\n\nSince Hoda’s exit in January, she has been headlining her own show with a rotating cast of fill-in co-hosts, which have included Scarlett Johansson and Keke Palmer.\n\nA huge part of Jenna’s success is clearly down to her infectious personality, which shines through on the Today show.\n\nEvery day, she gives audiences across the country an insight into her marriage and family life, making her relatable and warming.\n\nAnd there’s no denying her huge popularity, having accrued an impressive 1.5 million followers on Instagram, easily beating Savannah’s 1.1 million, and Craig’s 412,000.\n\nHer famous book club – Read with Jenna – has further helped catapult her into a household name, with her monthly reading recommendations having a huge influence over the charts.\n\nJoining Jenna is Al Roker, a true national treasure and the nation’s uncle.\n\nWeather presenter Al has been part of the Today show family for close to three decades and luckily for viewers, he’s not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHe assured me in January that he doesn’t have any immediate plans to retire just yet – despite being 70.\n\nAlthough he’s managed to climb to the top of the pecking order with his new job co-hosting the Today show, Craig Melvin is still lacking the A-list star power and is designated B-list until further notice.\n\nWhile his colleagues and fans alike were delighted to see him promoted, he’s currently stuck in Savannah’s shadow and is arguably not doing enough to break free.\n\nWith all that in mind, it has only been a mere three months since he got going – and one could argue that that is not enough time for Craig to be able to make a dent.\n\nThe standout star of GMA behind Robin is Michael Strahan. With his trademark gap-toothed smile and easy demeanor, the 53-year-old is a favorite among audiences.\n\nViewers have been particularly moved by the new grandfather’s support for his teenage daughter, Isabella, who was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a rare brain cancer, in October 2023.\n\nHe did, however, face a backlash in November. At Naval Base San Diego, when a marching band played Star Spangled Banner to honor Veteran’s Day, other TV stars had their hands on their hearts while Michael was captured on camera standing at the end of the line with his arms folded across the lower half of his body.\n\nFriends were quick to defend the host, and said the son of Major Gene Strahan who served the nation for 23 years was a proud patriot who was simply caught up in the moment.\n\nA former NFL star, Michael currently juggles his role as a GMA anchor with his duties as an analyst on Fox NFL Sunday, working up to six or seven days a week during football season.\n\nAs for his future at the network, it doesn’t seem like he’ll be there for much longer. \n\n‘He’s done,’ says an insider. ‘Michael doesn’t want to face another year of cuts and infighting at ABC.\n\n‘He would much rather spend time with his family, especially after everything they have been through. He will be out by this summer.’\n\nGMA is in crisis with large layoffs announced this month and long-time staffers packing up their boxes to leave – and there’s one presenter being held responsible by some for its downturn.\n\n‘It’s a nightmare in the office and there’s one man getting all the blame for the cuts, and that’s George Stephanopoulos,’ says my source.\n\nHe’s even been called ‘the most hated man in the building’ at ABC headquarters after the network settled a $15 million lawsuit with then president-elect Donald Trump, 78, after the network was sued over the anchor’s on-air comments.\n\nGeorge erroneously claimed on-air that the president-elect was found ‘liable for rape’ – rather than the correct phrasing of sexual abuse – against writer E. Jean Carroll. As part of the settlement, he was forced to issue a public apology.\n\nWhen his contract, for an estimated $18 million, was reportedly renewed in late 2024 I’m told there was a mixture of ‘anger and astonishment’ from junior staff facing job losses.\n\n‘He’s got a pretty large target on his back. The only consolation is he knows everyone despises him and he’s pretty miserable,’ my source added.\n\nIf rumors are to be believed, the 64-year-old anchor may leave GMA of his volition to spend more time making documentaries with wife Ali Wentworth.\n\nWhile she is currently off screen, Today show’s Sheinelle Jones remains firmly on the C-list.\n\nSheinelle, 46, hasn’t been on the program since December as she is currently taking time off to focus on a private family health matter.\n\nAlthough there’s not been any hint as to when she’ll be back, viewers haven’t given up speculating about her absence or missing her – cementing her as a firm favorite among the rest of the anchors.\n\nViewers love to hate standout CBS Mornings star Gayle King – and perhaps she would have still been among the A-list if she hadn’t signed up to Jeff Bezos’s space trip which has tragically spearheaded her catastrophic fall from grace.\n\nIt was revealed last month that the 70-year-old news anchor and close chum of Oprah Winfrey is joining Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and an all-women crew to blast off on one of the Amazon billionaire’s rocket ships in the spring.\n\nThe decision, understandably, has not gone down well, with many baffled at how she’ll ever be able to objectively report on Bezos again.\n\nBefore accepting the controversial space mission, Gayle, who has fronted CBS Mornings since 2012, had a reputation for not shying away from asking divisive questions.\n\nIn January, for example, she was accused of race baiting when asking why there weren’t more people of color at the Trump swearing-in.\n\nAnd more recently, she added fuel to the fire with the Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni case, by asking their It Ends with Us co-star Brandon Sklenar if he was Team Blake or Team Justin.\n\nLast year, it was reported that Gayle had extended her contract with the show until early 2025. Whether she has since renewed that contract remains to be seen.\n\nWith her reputation now in tatters, could she be about to walk away from CBS Mornings altogether? It would be quite the tragic end to her accomplished career…\n\nThe only hosts who could possibly trump Gayle at the bottom of the pile are Amy Roback and T.J. Holmes. \n\nThe pair were on-screen husband and wife at GMA3, but their careers came to an end when their real-life extra-marital affair went public.\n\nSince then, the disgraced duo have insisted countless times that they were separated from their respective spouses before getting together – but sources have told us that was not the case.\n\nAmy and T.J. grew close while training for the New York City Half-Marathon in March 2022. By that May, they were spotted canoodling in bars near their workplace.\n\nThey now host a podcast together called Amy and T.J. and are officially together.\n\nLuckily, last January, Amy declared on their podcast that she is done with daytime.\n\n‘I learned that I never want to go back to the grind of morning television,’ she said. \n\n‘I learned that I don’t miss the job, I miss the people.’ \n\nEarlier this month, they ignited engagement rumors after Amy was spotted with a ring on her finger. \n\nT.J.’s former wife Marilee Fiebig is now with Amy’s former husband of 12 years, Andrew Shue, and they have just moved in together.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlthough a range of household anchors help to wake up the nation&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unveiling the confidential list of daytime TV hosts from A to Z: Insider spills the beans on the anchor ready to leave and another known for being ruthless. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/unveiling-the-confidential-list-of-daytime-tv-hosts-from-a-to-z-insider-spills-the-beans-on-the-anchor-ready-to-leave-and-another-known-for-being-ruthless/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-The-secret-A-Z-ranking-of-daytime-TV.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:40:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.223},{"id":303099662,"title":"Trump greeted with huge cheers from ecstatic crowd as he attends NCAA wrestling championships","text":"President Donald Trump was hailed with massive cheers in Philadelphia Saturday, as he attended the NCAA Men’s Division I Wrestling Championship.\n\nThe crowd rose to its feet and heartily applauded Trump as he entered the Wells Fargo Arena and stood on the event floor for about a minute waving to the onlookers.\n\nBroadcaster ESPN even interrupted an interview with national champion Carter Starocci to cut to the president’s grand entrance.\n\nAs Trump took his seat the crowd chanted “U-S-A, U-S-A.”\n\nTrump was accompanied by DOGE chief Elon Musk and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio).\n\nJordan won the NCAA Division I men’s wrestling title twice as a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and later served as an assistant wrestling coach for Ohio State University.\n\nTwo of the sport’s biggest stars were thrilled the president would be in attendance for their final match.\n\n“We’re going to put on a good show for him.

House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.\n\nAn earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.\n\nThe result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams — some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress. A San Diego Democrat, for instance, warned that her colleagues must avoid “seeming too thirsty” in content.\n\nBut while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year’s election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital landscape will be key to a political comeback.\n\nAim to Double Engagement \n\nMore than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party’s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They’re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,” Booker said. “We’re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes … we’re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we’ve only just begun.”\n\nBooker said he’s aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year — and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump’s joint address to Congress, according to Booker’s office.\n\nEfforts Draw Republican Mockery\n\nNot all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump’s speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.\n\n“They are all actors reading a script,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it’s a strategy they’ve taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.\n\nThe Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after Sulhee Jessica Woo, a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats’ creators event, came up with a “Choose Your Fighter” video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women’s History Month.\n\nThe White House posted a video in response that read “America chose its fighters last November,” and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating “We chose our fighters a long time ago.”\n\nBut Booker and other Democratic leaders don’t consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans’ attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.\n\n“I do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,” said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral “Fighter” video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are “elitist” or “robotic.”\n\n“I didn’t like the jumping, I’m going to be honest, though,” Crockett added about the viral “Choose Your Fighter” video.\n\nMore Aggressive Digital Posture\n\nDemocrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump’s moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.\n\nSome of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. \n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party’s message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.\n\n“We want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don’t have Democrats on there,” said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive House district in Cypress. “The ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that’s not typical for the Democratic base.”\n\nDivide on message \n\nSome House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don’t intuitively understand. \n\nMeanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.\n\n“I think there’s a fine line before we’re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, (D-San Diego).\n\n“When it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing ‘get ready with me’ videos. It would look super cringe. But I’m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,” said Jacobs.\n\nSome Democrats think that the party’s messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium.\n\n“If you know how to talk to people, it doesn’t matter what medium is going to exist,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. “You could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don’t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn’t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it’s just not going to translate.”","summary":"Whether topping trending charts or drawing mockery from liberal allies and GOP foes, there has has been a burst of Democratic content.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/tech/2025/03/22/democrats-in-adopting-new-digital-strategy-hope-to-engage-voters-but-avoid-being-cringe/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0.mast_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:30:42","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.044},{"id":303106172,"title":"European nations tighten US travel advisories amid detentions","text":"Berlin, March 23 (SocialNews.XYZ) Several European countries have updated their travel advisories for the US this week following the detention of multiple European nationals, including German citizens, upon arrival.\n\nGermany's Foreign Office said on Saturday that it is taking the recent incidents involving German travellers seriously, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\n\"We have clarified and now clearly emphasise that an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) approval or a US visa does not, in every case, authorise entry into the US,\" a spokesperson told public broadcaster ARD's Tagesschau.\n\nThe advisory update follows reports of three German nationals being detained at US entry points, including one green card holder.

Putin did it “not because … he could become the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship with him, and he was praying for his friend.”\n\nDuring the same visit, the Russian president presented a painting of Trump that he commissioned from a Russian artist as a gift to the American president, Witkoff said.\n\n“I came home and delivered that message to our president, and delivered the painting, and he was clearly touched by it,” Witkoff said. “So this is the kind of connection that we’ve been able to re-establish through, by the way, a simple word called communication.”\n\nWitkoff dismissed criticism of the Trump administration’s outreach to Putin, saying the only way to resolve the war in Ukraine is to speak to all sides in the conflict. He also rejected portrayals of Putin as a nefarious actor who can’t be trusted.\n\nWitkoff said some people might question if he should have met with the Russian president because they see Putin as “a bad guy.” But he said: “I don’t regard Putin as a bad guy.”\n\nA real estate tycoon and friend of the president who has become a top diplomatic envoy for Trump, Wiktoff said he appreciated Putin being open to meeting with him and communicating in a “straightforward” way.\n\n“I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me,” he said, adding that “it was gracious of him to accept me, to see me.”\n\nPoisonings, shootings and plane crashes\n\nPutin, a former KGB officer who has ruled Russia for the last 25 years, has been blamed for the killings of multiple Russian opposition leaders, most recently Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian prison last year.\n\nMercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin died in a plane crash last year, just months after leading his Wagner Group forces in an aborted mutiny against Putin. His short-lived rebellion was sparked by disagreements about the war in Ukraine. No investigative findings were released after the fiery crash, which also killed nine other people.\n\nBoris Nemtsov, once considered the leader of Russia’s opposition and one of Putin’s fiercest critics, was shot dead in 2015, just a few feet away from the Kremlin.\n\nAnd in 2018 former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in the U.K. with a nerve agent believed to be the same Novichok poison later used on Navalny. Two Russians also allegedly poisoned former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, an outspoken critic of Putin’s who had fled to the U.K.\n\nRenowned journalist Anna Politkovskaya was gunned down outside her Moscow apartment in 2006 after warning reporters in Russia about the risks of challenging the Kremlin’s narrative.\n\nPutin blamed Biden\n\nWitkoff said Putin pointed out in their meeting that he and former President Joe Biden did not speak for three years, which Witkoff called a mistake.\n\n“How do you settle a conflict unless we establish trust and good feelings with one another?” Witkoff said.\n\nTrump’s envoy said an administration official had warned him beforehand that Putin was a former KGB officer. But Witkoff said that background merely meant that Putin was among the elite in the former Soviet Union, as he said the spy service recruited highly capable people.\n\n“In the old days, the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation,” Witkoff said. “That’s who went into the KGB. He’s a super smart guy.”\n\nPutin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine violated international law, and Russian forces appear to have committed war crimes there, according to European, United Nations and Biden administration officials. But Witkoff suggested the media coverage of the war had been distorted and that the conflict could not be blamed entirely on one side.\n\n“That is a complicated situation that war, and all the ingredients that led up to it,” he said.\n\nThe special envoy said the key to resolving the war in Ukraine was Russia’s claim to four eastern regions in Ukraine — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. He called the issue “the elephant in the room.”\n\nUkraine opposes ceding the territory, which remains part of Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.\n\nRussian troops occupy most of the regions and Moscow has held referendums on joining Russia, which Western countries and Ukraine have denounced as shams conducted under repression.\n\nBut Witkoff, who struggled to name all four of the regions in the interview, cited the Russian-organized votes as an indication that people in the area preferred Russian rule.\n\n“They’re Russian-speaking,” he said. “There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”\n\nWitkoff said it was unclear if Ukraine could accept ceding that territory to Russia and if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could survive politically if he acknowledged Russian control of the area.\n\n“The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,” Witkoff said. “Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?”\n\nHe added that Russia did not want to absorb all of Ukraine and that it already has what it wants, by taking the four eastern regions and the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n“The Russians also have what they want,” he said. “So why do they need more?”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said he prayed for “his friend” Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Putin prayed for Donald Trump after assassination attempt in 2024, according to U.S. envoy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/putin-prayed-for-donald-trump-after-assassination-attempt-in-2024-according-to-u-s-envoy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Putin-said-he-prayed-for-‘his-friend.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:24:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":303093904,"title":"Rosie O'Donnell floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Elon Musk after fleeing US after election","text":"Rosie O'Donnell floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Elon Musk after fleeing US after election\n\nPODCAST: All the latest headlines, including Trump’s bold move to void Biden’s pardons and Gavin Newsom’s unexpected statue plans\n\nBy JAMES GORDON FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 23:10 GMT, 22 March 2025 | Updated: 23:10 GMT, 22 March 2025\n\nRosie O'Donnell has suggested the 2024 presidential election may have been stolen during her first Irish television interview since leaving the United States for Ireland.\n\nThe famously outspoken comedian and former talk show host spoke with Patrick Kielty on Friday's The Late Late Show on the Irish channel RTE One in which she implicated tech billionaire Elon Musk without naming him directly.\n\n'I question why for the first time in American history, a president has won every swing state and his largest donor was a man who owns and runs the internet,' O'Donnell said. \n\n'I would hope that would be investigated,' she added. 'Whether or not it was an anomaly... or something else that happened on election night in America.'\n\nO'Donnell told Kielty how she found Trump's win strange because then-Vice President Kamala Harris was 'filling up stadiums with people who supported her and Donald Trump was not able to do that.' \n\nNow self-exiled in Ireland, O'Donnell explained how she fled the US following what she calls a 'terrifying' sequence of political events. \n\n'The president of the United States has it out for me,' she said, referring to Donald Trump, with whom she's had a public feud spanning decades. \n\nShe explained how her critique of Trump's bankruptcies and sexual assault allegations on TV show The View had made her a long-term target.\n\nRosie O'Donnell has suggested the 2024 presidential election may have been stolen during her first Irish television interview since leaving the United States for Ireland\n\nO'Donnell implicated tech billionaire Elon Musk without naming him directly\n\nDuring a recent White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin, Trump took a shot her saying the PM was 'better off' not knowing who she was \n\n'He hasn't let it go. He uses me as a punchline whenever he feels the need.'\n\n'The Supreme Court has given him ultimate power - the powers of a king or a monarch,' she warned, referring to what she perceives as the erosion of American democracy. 'That's not what the United States is about. It's terrifying.' \n\nIt appears Trump has not forgotten O'Donnell either. During a recent White House meeting with the Irish prime minister, Micheál Martin, Trump took a shot her saying the PM was 'better off' not knowing who she was. \n\nO'Donnell said she sent an apology note to the prime minister's office following the Trump meeting.\n\nO'Donnell now lives in Howth, a coastal town in Ireland, where she says her daughter Clay is thriving, charmed by the Irish pub culture. \n\n'She told me at dinner, \"Mommy, I like it here better. You can just be a normal person.\"'\n\nDespite settling into Irish life, O'Donnell insists she's not done with America entirely.\n\n'A large part of me does [want to go back and fight],' she said. 'That's what I've done my whole career.'\n\nBut before that, O'Donnell says she now plans to pursue Irish citizenship.\n\nTaking to earlier this month, the actress and comedian shared a nine-minute video in which she updated fans about her new life outside of the US\n\nO'Donnell's feud with Trump dates back to 2006, when she criticized him on The View for allowing that year's Miss USA pageant winner, Tara Conner, to keep her crown after she was caught drinking underage\n\nKnown for her harsh war of words with Trump over the years, long before he became president, the mother of five has been even more vocal to hammer his tough talk and policies in interviews and on social media since he started his first term in 2016.\n\nO'Donnell's feud with Trump dates back to 2006, when she criticized him on 'The View' for allowing that year's Miss USA pageant winner, Tara Conner, to keep her crown after she was caught drinking underage.\n\nTrump owned the Miss USA competition at the time and decided to not to strip the 20-year-old model's title, stating he believed in 'second chances' and that Conner would be going into rehab.\n\nWhen Trump heard that O'Donnell had mocked Conner's conduct, he called her 'a real loser.'\n\nOver the years, Trump has said 'The Flintstones' actress is 'dumb,' 'desperate,' 'fat,' and 'disgusting both inside and out.'\n\nHe also said that if he were in charge of The View, which O'Donnell was on for a brief time in the 2006-2007 season, he would have fired her.\n\n'I'd fire Rosie, I mean I'd look her right in that fat, ugly face of hers and I'd say, \"Rosie, you're fired,\"' he said, borrowing his catchphrase from 'The Apprentice.'\n\nTheir war of words reignited in 2015, after Trump shocked the world and announced a run for the White House.\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in August, moderator Megyn Kelly asked the then-real estate magnate and television personality about his treatment of women.\n\n'You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,' Kelly said.\n\nTrump interjected with, 'Only Rosie O'Donnell.' The one-liner got a tremendous response from the audience, who filled the auditorium with laughs and cheers.\n\nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, later attacked Trump in a debate, pointing out that he had called women nasty names just like Kelly had.\n\nIn that September debate, Trump once again name-dropped O'Donnell as a defense.\n\n'Rosie O’Donnell — I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her,' he said.\n\nIn one of more recent critiques she shared a video on TikTok of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hugging children and picking them up with a smile on his face.\n\n'If only the current president had a drop of his caring committed heart #resist #protest #defythem #love #FDT,' she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn December, O'Donnell took to TikTok to bash Time magazine for naming Donald Trump its man of the year for 2024, as reported by The Daily Beast. \n\n'Man of the year, Donald Trump. Well, f**k you Time Magazine. F**k you, seriously,' O'Donnell said. 'How about most dangerous man of the year? How about most criminal man of the year? How about the worst president we've ever had… of the year.'\n\nRosie becomes the latest celebrity to have move in the wake of Trump being elected to a second term in office.\n\nThe 62-year-old confirmed that the move happened on January 15, just days before President Donald Trump's inauguration \n\nThe star had hinted at the move on March 7, when she posed for a selfie snap behind the wheel while mentioning how she's having a difficult time driving on a different side of the road\n\nAmong the stars to recently move are actor Richard Gere, who sold his $11 million Connecticut home in November and moved to Madrid, Spain, in part to be closer to his wife's in-laws, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nGere, 75, told the outlet he felt it would be a 'great adventure' to relocate with Alejandra and their sons Alexander, five, and James, four, 'because I have never lived full-time outside of the United States.' \n\nFormer talk show host, comedian, and long-time liberal Ellen DeGeneres, 67, and her wife Portia de Rossi, 52, opted to move to the English countryside in December. \n\nIn a 20th anniversary tribute to her wife DeGeneres wrote how she was 'so happy we get to travel and explore the world together' in a selfie snap taken in the UK.\n\nDonald TrumpElon MuskRosie O'DonnellThe View\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nRosie O'Donnell floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Elon Musk after fleeing US after election\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Rosie O'Donnell has fled the US for Ireland, citing fear for her family's safety under Trump and suggesting a bizarre conspiracy theory about the election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14527029/Rosie-ODonnell-floats-bizarre-conspiracy-theory-Elon-Musk-fleeing-US-election.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/22/22/96473211-0-image-m-26_1742682388754.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/22/165511085869649267/1024x576_MP4_165511085869649267.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:10:05","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":303103108,"title":"Australia Treasurer Warns of ‘Seismic’ US Global Economic Shock","text":"Overall, the treasurer said he is expecting a small boost to revenue in the upcoming fiscal blueprint but the global economic chaos sparked by the return of US President Donald Trump to the White House has “cast a shadow over this budget.”\n\n“This is a whole new world of uncertainty that we’re dealing with here.

When caught in the act, the Trump administration has offered up the claim that these cases were merely mistakes—“malicious compliance” from bad actors within the government.\n\nRelated | Inside Trump’s racist crusade to erase American heroes from US history\n\nBut the excuses don’t pass the smell test, since Trump and his allies—like multibillionaire Elon Musk and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—have well documented histories of open bigotry against anyone who isn’t a straight, wealthy, white man.\n\nBut there is one unique period in U.S. history that Trump and his cronies are very interested in preserving and promoting: the Confederacy.\n\nQuick reminder: The Confederates, attempting to preserve the practice of enslaving Black people, illegally declared war against the government of the United States—starting the Civil War that killed hundreds of thousands—and ultimately was utterly defeated and humiliated.\n\nThe administration has most notably advocated on behalf of the pro-slavery Confederacy that rebelled against the U.S. government by reinstating the names of Confederate figures at military facilities. Under the Biden administration, it was determined that it was best to remove names honoring a racist, traitorous group that declared war on the country. Trump feels otherwise.\n\nTrump brought back Fort Benning, named after Henry Lewis Benning—a lover of slavery—and renamed Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg, named after a Confederate general. The administration has played cute with this restoration of names and attempted to argue that the “new” names honor servicemembers, but the true intent to restore the Confederacy is quite clear.\n\nRelated | Who do these Trump toadies think they're fooling?\n\nTrump’s love of the Confederacy isn’t new. During his first term, he railed against local and state efforts to move Confederate monuments out of the public eye.\n\nSo intense is Trump’s admiration for the pro-slavery Confederacy that he has frequently attacked one of the country’s most revered leaders, Abraham Lincoln. Trump—who failed to pass an infrastructure bill or get his southern wall built—has complained that Lincoln failed to prevent the Civil War.\n\nBut this isn’t just a Trump thing. For decades, conservatives have embraced the mythology of the Lost Cause. After losing the Civil War, many Confederates and their descendants have desperately tried to rewrite the causes of the war and the treasonous actions of the Confederate military and its leaders.\n\nThey argue that the secessionists were fighting for a noble, lost cause—usually something about taxation and states’ rights—omitting the central argument behind the Confederacy: It wanted enslaved Black people pick cotton and do other jobs for free.\n\nThis is directly tied to the origins of the modern conservative movement and the Republican Party. In 1964, conservatives took full ideological control of the GOP with candidate Barry Goldwater, who was opposed to the Civil Rights Act and lost in a landslide to Democratic President Lyndon Johnson, who signed the law with Martin Luther King Jr. at his side.\n\n King warned voters of the dangers of Goldwater, in an extraordinarily unusual step into electoral politics, highlighting his opposition to the bill.\n\nAccording to Johnson aide Bill Moyers, when the president signed the bill he said, “Well, I think we may have lost the south for your lifetime—and mine,” referencing the fact that conservative southern Democrats were vehemently opposed to the bill and would turn away from the party.\n\nAnd Johnson was right. Those voters became Republicans as the party moved further to the right, and their ideology forms the core of the MAGA voters who have backed Trump in the last three elections.\n\nWhen the rest of the country moved forward on racial issues, resulting in the election of the first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, the right did not. Trump led the racist birther movement, which falsely argued that Obama was ineligible to be president.\n\nBut even after Trump won, the push for racial justice did not stop. Protests like the Black Lives Matter movement emerged with Trump in the White House, and no matter how much he fumed about it, they didn’t relent.\n\nThe right is in a quandary. It has political power, but it still cannot force millions of Americans to concede to the white supremacy that motivates much of conservative politics. That’s why it’s so driven to erase history.\n\nRelated | Iconic WWII military plane is too ‘Gay’ for Pete Hegseth’s Pentagon\n\nWhen Trump and his administration push for the Confederacy and try to disappear the diverse past, they are delivering on the political primal scream that the right emitted after Obama won.\n\nIt’s doubtful that Trump will succeed in erasing the country’s collective memory, but like the men who tried to keep chattel slavery legal, Republicans are willing to give their crusade one last Confederate try.","summary":"The Trump administration has spent the last month on a tear, using President Donald Trump’s newfound power in multiple departments and agencies for a goal that seems bewildering at first glance: deleting history.\n\n\n\nUnder the guise of eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, the administration has literally erased government-maintained documents honoring and remembering key figures and moments from U.S. and world history.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Defense removed a photo of the Enola Gay B-29 bomber because it contains the word “gay.” Arlington Cemetery scrapped then reinstated a tribute to Jackie Robinson, the first Black man to play Major League Baseball and an Army lieutenant.\n\n\n\nPhotos and histories of people of color, women, and the LGBTQ+ community are being purged, and nearly every day some new erasure is being uncovered. When caught in the act, the Trump administration has offered up the claim that these cases were merely mistakes—“malicious compliance” from bad actors within the government.\n","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/3/22/2311705/-Why-conservatives-are-obsessed-with-erasing-history-except-the-Confederacy?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1411349/story_image/ETR_3.21.png?1742579484","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 23:00:14","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.067},{"id":303093462,"title":"Wes Streeting embroiled in row amid claims health secretary's allies were 'behind sexist briefings against Keir Starmer's top female ministers'","text":"Wes Streeting embroiled in row amid claims health secretary's allies were 'behind sexist briefings against Keir Starmer's top female ministers'\n\nLISTEN: Trump, Zelensky, the rise of Europe’s Far Right and what’s next for NATO – listen to Alas Vine & Hitchens wherever you get your podcasts..\n\nBy GLEN OWEN and DAN HODGES\n\nPublished: 22:44 GMT, 22 March 2025 | Updated: 22:57 GMT, 22 March 2025\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting is at the centre of an extra-ordinary row over alleged 'sexist' briefings against Sir Keir Starmer's top female ministers.\n\nThe spat erupted after the Prime Minister was told at last week's Cabinet meeting that Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson were being singled out for negative briefings from within the Labour Party.\n\nA Labour source said: 'Keir was read out of a list of women who were being briefed against and he was very clear he wasn't going to tolerate it any more. He said it was unacceptable and if it continued, there would be consequences.'\n\nThe finger of blame is being pointed at allies of Mr Streeting, which is denied by his team.\n\n'The briefing isn't being sanctioned by Keir – it's being done by allies of Wes,' the source said. 'They're on serious manoeuvres now. They want to target the women in the Cabinet who they think might be a threat.\n\n'They know that when Keir steps down, there's going to be a major push for the party to have its first woman leader.' However, a source close to Mr Streeting said: 'Wes has never briefed against anyone in Cabinet or asked anyone to on his behalf.'\n\nThe row comes as insiders claim that allies of Mr Streeting have 'infiltrated' the Government and are ready to back him in a future leadership contest.\n\nThey say the ambitious MP has a loyal 'network' already within Downing Street, across government departments and in Labour's ruling body the National Executive Committee, including senior No 10 advisers who are ready to 'switch allegiance' if Sir Keir was to leave before the next election.\n\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting (pictured) is at the centre of an extra-ordinary row over alleged 'sexist' briefings against Sir Keir Starmer's top female ministers\n\nSir Keir Starmer was reportedly read out a list of the women who were being briefed against\n\nThe Prime Minister was told at last week's Cabinet meeting that Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (right), Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall (centre) and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson (left) were being singled out for negative briefings from within the Labour Party\n\nA source said last month: 'His people are running the party.

JB Pritzker sits at a table surrounded by University of Illinois researchers who will soon be out of work, their lab set to lose its federal funding and close next month. One researcher, saying she feels betrayed by the government, turns to thank Pritzker.\n\n“My husband sometimes shows me videos of you talking,” says Aline Delpomdor, a research specialist at the university’s Soybean Innovation Lab. “This was the first thing that gave me hope – that someone is speaking out. Somebody is defending us.”\n\nPritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire, may seem like an unlikely champion for working-class people affected by the Trump administration. But he’s taken aim at President Donald Trump’s potential tax cuts, while backing universal health care and a higher federal minimum wage.\n\nThe governor used a statewide tour this past week to present a path forward for national Democrats struggling to unify around a strategy to counter the Republican president, highlighting the effects of Trump’s early actions in Illinois. The three-day swing included meeting with farmers in a central Illinois barn to discuss agriculture and with older adults in suburban Chicago who are concerned about Social Security cuts.\n\nWhile far from the center of power in Washington, the stops resemble those of a future presidential contender in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.\n\n“How do you play a role when you don’t have a vote?” Pritzker said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It’s hopefully reminding people who we are as a country, in a moment when I think people haven’t really stepped back and thought enough about democracy and our history – reminding people of that, using the bully pulpit to talk about that and then rallying the troops.”\n\nPritzker has built alliances within the party for years as a top donor to Democratic campaigns and causes, giving millions from his personal fortune and helping candidates raise money. That includes a recent $500,000 donation that went to support the Democratic-backed candidate in next month’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race, a contest with big implications for the swing state and an election seen as a test of the national political climate.\n\nLesser known than other potential 2028 contenders, Pritzker drew national attention in February when he used a joint budget and State of the State address to make the case for a parallel between Trump’s rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany.\n\n“If you think I’m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,” Pritzker said.\n\nThe speech stood in stark contrast to many of Pritzker’s fellow Democratic governors – who, at the same time, were on their way to Washington for face-to-face meetings with the newly sworn-in president. Pritzker skipped the gathering of the National Governors Association.\n\nSince then, the divide between Pritzker and other Democratic governors, particularly those potentially eyeing the party’s 2028 presidential nomination, has only widened.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently sat for a one-on-one meeting with Trump as she seeks to find ” common ground ” with him. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has launched a podcast in which he had friendly conversations with Trump loyalists, including Steve Bannon.\n\nSome Illinois Republicans walked out of the chamber during Pritzker’s speech. The state GOP has criticized Pritzker for overspending and helping create a migrant crisis in Chicago.\n\nREAD MORE | Pritzker calls for release of $2B in federal funding halted by President Donald Trump administration\n\n“All the while, he jet-sets across the country giving political speeches, more interested in headlines and presidential speculation than actually governing this state,” Illinois Republican Party Chairman Don Tracy said.\n\nPritzker has not relented in his criticism of Trump. On Tuesday, the governor spoke at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington, where he described Trump’s early months as “true villainous cruelty by a few idiots.” During his meeting Wednesday with farmers in central Illinois, he warned that their “way of life is under attack right now.”\n\n“People will go out of business, lose jobs. And the impact on our broader economy, not just in the state of Illinois, but in the United States, could be truly devastating,” Pritzker told a barn full of farmers at a roundtable in Urbana, adding that they risk becoming “collateral damage” in Trump’s efforts.\n\nHe has not spared Democrats, either.\n\nAt the same roundtable – the kickoff of his statewide tour – Pritzker blasted the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democratic senators who backed a Republican-led spending bill. Pritzker said their support was an “enormous mistake.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., who joined Pritzker at the roundtable, said the governor is helping “localize and tell the story of what this will mean for people.”\n\nEarlier, Pritzker stopped by the Soybean Innovation Lab, which is set to shut down April 15 with 30 employees set to be laid off.\n\nDelpomdor told Pritzker the cuts meant “everything we have done all these years is just lost.” Peter Goldsmith, the lab’s director, called the closure of the decade-old lab “surreal,” adding, “You can’t just grin and bear it.”\n\n“Very little thought has gone into the decisions that have been made,” Pritzker said. “And I think that six months from now, if we’re good enough at this, we will have been able to make some arguments that, maybe they’ve gone too far.”\n\nHe also told the AP he is “optimistic because we are going to fight.”\n\n“It’s not that I think if we all just sit back that four years will go by and everything will be fine,” he said. “I think we need to put the work in, and I’m optimistic that we will.”\n\nThe video in the player above is from a previous report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. &#8212; Illinois Gov.

The Federal Reserve was wrapping up its interest rate increases and on track to start lowering rates -- and this happened. The central bank launched rate cuts this past fall and indicated that more would follow. Against this backdrop, growth stocks also lifted benchmarks as these types of companies thrive in better economic environments -- it's easier for them to expand, and their customers generally have more money to spend on products and services.\n\nAll of this helped the Nasdaq advance more than 43% in 2023 and post a 28% increase last year. But in recent weeks, this sunny market environment has turned stormy. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on imports, a move that could weigh on prices, driving inflation higher and hurting corporate earnings. As a result, the Nasdaq fell into the correction zone, dropping more than 10% from its latest high in December. But here's the good news: Even though AI stocks are falling right now, they still remain a silver lining in this stormy market. Here's why.\n\nNvidia and Palantir's double-digit declines\n\nSo, first, a quick look at some of the losses we've seen in recent times. Nvidia (NVDA -0.75%), the world's top AI chipmaker, tumbled 15% over the past month; AI software company Palantir Technologies sank 17% during that time period; and AI voice specialist SoundHound AI lost 12%. And the list goes on...\n\nThough these companies and technology and growth players in general may face headwinds in the near term due to economic uncertainty or a potential slowdown, it's important to keep in mind that AI prospects over the long term haven't changed. Analysts predict a compound annual growth rate of about 35% for the AI market through 2030 when they say it will reach more than $1 trillion.\n\nAnd we have some concrete evidence that could happen. Companies from Meta Platforms (META 1.69%) to Alphabet (GOOG 0.76%) (GOOGL 0.79%) have announced increased spending to support their AI programs. Meta said it would spend as much as $65 billion this year and is planning to build a data center the size of part of Manhattan. Alphabet said it plans $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, and much of this will go toward servers, data centers, and networking.\n\nThe Trump administration is even getting in on the idea of boosting AI, applauding OpenAI's announcement of the Stargate project and pledging to help involved companies access the levels of electricity needed. Stargate, formed by OpenAI and several tech and financial partners, will invest $500 billion in the coming four years to build AI infrastructure in the U.S.\n\nEncouraging words from Jensen Huang\n\nFinally, words from one of the biggest authorities on AI also offer reason to be optimistic about the long-term growth story. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang says that the world's data center build-out will cost $1 trillion, and demand for Nvidia's chip architecture Blackwell -- a key step forward in accelerated computing -- surpassed supply during its recent launch. These trends point to more growth ahead even if certain headwinds temporarily weigh on revenue or stock performance.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you as an investor?\n\nNow is a fantastic time to get in on promising long-term players because today, many have fallen to bargain levels. For example, Nvidia now trades for 26 times forward earnings estimates, around its lowest in about a year.

And then they get there, but actually they’ve got lots of very silly and foolish ideas along with being able to fundraise for a local community.”\n\nSir Ed will say it is an “honour” to be seen as a party which fixes things locally.\n\n“I think she meant it as an insult! But I’ll happily wear it as a badge of honour. Because she’s right: Liberal Democrats fix things,” he is expected to say.\n\n“Isn’t it telling? Kemi’s sneering attitude that fixing church roofs is somehow beneath her, even beneath politics altogether; that what happens in our communities is trivial and insignificant compared to debating the true meaning of conservatism on Twitter.\n\n“It is exactly that kind of out-of-touch, disdainful thinking that explains the mess the Conservative Party is in today.\n\n“They have abandoned our communities – leaving schools and hospitals to crumble, whole areas without enough GPs or dentists, and water companies to pump filthy sewage into our rivers.\n\n“It’s why so many lifelong Conservative voters have turned to the Liberal Democrats, it’s why people rightly kicked them out of government last July, and why we have to kick them out of our councils in May too.”\n\nThe Conservative Party hit back, saying Lib Dems councillors are “clocking off early”.\n\n“While Conservative councils are getting on with the job of delivering lower taxes and better local services, Lib Dems are clocking off early,” Paul Holmes, the shadow local government minister, said.\n\n“In places like South Cambridgeshire, they have brought in four-day working weeks for council staff, leaving residents paying full price for part-time service.”\n\nIn Westminster, he said the Lib Dems are either “missing in action” or have become “Labour’s cheerleaders” on the big national questions.\n\nHE added: “Time and again, the Liberal Democrats have shown they are unserious, unprincipled, and unfit to hold Labour to account. Under new leadership, the Conservative Party is focused on delivering results, defending our communities, and offering the honest, credible opposition this country needs.”\n\nSir Ed will also describe the Lib Dems as the only party willing to speak out against Donald Trump and urge retaliatory tariffs against the US – starting with Tesla.\n\n“We must deal with him as he is: bullying, narcissistic, unpredictable.

But housing authorities were advised to move forward with “the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.”\n\nFor the housing authority staff who received the letter, it remains unclear whether the program is winding down simply because it has run out of funds on its own accord or whether it represents a policy shift from the Trump administration, which has been on an aggressive and often uncoordinated cost-cutting tear across the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe letter came as a shock to Lisa Jones, CEO of the San Diego Housing Commission. Jones said the commission could conceivably pay its share of the rent for the nearly 400 San Diego renters currently assisted by the program through December. After that, she could think of no obvious way to make up for the missing federal dollars.\n\nJones spoke to CalMatters from Washington, D.C., where the heads of housing authorities across the country recently gathered for a conference and to lobby their representatives. As news of the end of the program spread among her counterparts, “a quiet panic” has set in, she said.\n\nAbsent federal money, “we don’t have the funding to solve that problem,” she said.\n\nThe program was modeled after the much larger and well-known Housing Choice Voucher program. Also known as “Section 8,” that long-standing program pays at least 70% of the rent for anyone earning under a certain income and lucky enough to secure one of its scarce vouchers. The Emergency Housing Voucher program is more narrowly targeted at those in most dire need: people currently living on the street or in shelters, those just on the verge of homelessness and anyone fleeing domestic violence or human trafficking. \n\n“It’s a group of people who, but for the voucher, would be at extreme risk of falling back into homelessness,” said Mari Castaldi, who focuses on state housing policy for the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank.\n\nThe termination of the emergency programs comes at an inauspicious time for federal rental assistance programs across the country.\n\nFor decades, the federal government has offered Housing Choice Vouchers to fewer than 1 in 4 Americans who qualify for those benefits. In California’s large metro areas, voucher waiting lists — the time between when someone applies and actually receives one — regularly tops out at more than a decade. \n\nThat means few housing authorities will have many extra housing vouchers to offer anyone booted from the emergency program. Absent another solution, that would put housing authorities in the virtually unprecedented position of having to revoke assistance from people who are currently depending upon it to pay the rent.\n\n“There’s just no plan in place to determine what would happen” in that case, said Alex Visotzky with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “This could very well lead to thousands of additional people becoming homeless in California.” \n\nWhy the Funds Ran Out\n\nThe emergency program was never meant to be permanent. Creating one of many COVID-era additions to the nation’s social safety net, Congress funded the emergency vouchers in 2021 with a lump sum of $5 billion. Once those funds were spent, the program was meant to come to an end.\n\nThe wind-down was supposed to be gradual.\n\nAfter the program’s roll out, housing authorities were told to stop reissuing the emergency vouchers as renters exited the program — because they no longer needed the help, moved to a different city or died. That way, the program was meant to phase itself out of existence. The federal housing department was given until 2030 to spend all $5 billion.\n\nThat led many local officials and housing advocates to assume the program would be funded through the end of the decade.\n\nThe wind-down of the emergency program is the latest shudder in an unprecedented upheaval in federal housing policy enacted by President Donald Trump. The administration is making mass layoffs at the federal housing department, raising concerns among some housing policy experts about whether they can seamlessly operate federal programs, including Section 8. \n\nAfter temporary freezes on all categories of federal funding in late January, the administration, led by DOGE, its “Department of Government Efficiency,” has more quietly extinguished select federal housing programs. \n\nEarlier this month the City of Los Angeles stopped accepting new applications for its general Housing Choice Voucher program, citing uncertain support from Washington.\n\nThe federal housing department did not respond to repeated emails and voice messages requesting an interview about why the funds ran out sooner than many expected, and whether the news in the March 6 letter represented a change in federal policy.\n\n“To me it just doesn’t sound right, that we’re so far off the mark — four years off the mark,” said Emilio Salas, executive director of the Los Angeles County Development Authority, which oversees federal housing voucher programs for 66 cities and all unincorporated communities across the L.A. basin.\n\nSonya Acosta, a policy analyst with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said she hasn’t seen any evidence that the end of the Emergency Housing Voucher program is the handiwork of DOGE. Instead, she pointed to a familiar problem as the more likely culprit: sky-high rents.\n\nSince Congress authorized the new vouchers in early 2021, rents across the country experienced a post-pandemic boom. That’s even true at the bottom half of the rental market, which the federal housing department uses to set its rental support levels. \n\nBetween 2021 and 2025, for example, “fair market rents” in San Diego’s Barrio Logan neighborhood increased by 43%, nearly double the overall rate of inflation during the same period, according to the department.\n\nBecause the housing voucher programs pay the difference between a tenant’s income and rent, soaring rents and stagnant incomes mean the government pays more.\n\n“We’ve seen those really big increases in rent that has also meant that some of the spending might have gone a little bit faster than initial HUD estimates,” Acosta said. \n\nThat basic math problem has put the screws to the overall Section 8 program too. Jones, in San Diego, said the Housing Commission’s average per-household rental assistance payment at the beginning of the pandemic was around $870 each month. Now it’s roughly $1,400. Because the emergency voucher program allows for more generous payments and because its voucher holders tend to have even lower incomes than regular voucher holders, the average emergency voucher is about $2,200, she said.\n\n“The gap between the rental market and the lowest incomes in our community is widening,” she said.\n\nWhat Happens When the Money Runs Out?\n\nWithout fresh funding, there’s no way many housing authorities would be able to transfer emergency voucher holders onto the regular voucher program. \n\nIn Santa Barbara County, for example, nearly 1 in 10 of the local housing authority’s vouchers have been shelved, kept out of the hands of qualified renters because the authority can’t afford to provide the assistance. \n\nSo once the emergency funding runs out “we have no way of helping those people right now,” said housing authority director Bob Havlicek. “Even if we did have extra vouchers available, then it’s (a) public policy issue of ‘why are you helping these folks if you have people on your waitlist?’ We can’t win either way.”\n\nThere isn’t much optimism from advocates that the state will step up once the emergency funds run dry. \n\nBond funds that the state has used to prop up much of its affordable housing spending are running low, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget for the coming fiscal year includes little extra and rental subsidies, a costly and ongoing expense, have historically been a federal responsibility anyway.\n\nThat leaves the federal government, which does not appear to be in a big spending mood when it comes to social programs.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump signed a budget bill to continue funding the federal government at levels set last year. That may provide a steady funding source for the overall federal housing voucher program, though the bill may give his administration flexibility to redirect some of those funds if it chooses to. It does nothing to address the fate of the Emergency Housing Voucher program. \n\n“We should figure out a way to save this program and make sure these people continue to receive federal rental assistance,” said Tushar Gurjal, a policy analyst at the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, an advocacy group for affordable housing providers. “None of these folks did anything wrong. They’re just using their vouchers and following all the rules.”\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.","summary":"Federal housing authorities announced that a COVID-era emergency housing voucher is running out of funds – and there’s no plan to save it.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/life/2025/03/22/quiet-panic-says-san-diego-advocate-as-rental-assistance-program-set-to-run-out-of-cash/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/041421_HousingAuthority_PU_sized_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 22:30:00","author":"Ben Christopher • CalMatters","authors":["Ben Christopher • CalMatters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":303089678,"title":"‘STAND TOGETHER’: Elbows Up, Canada stages rally at Nathan Phillips Square","text":"That was the message hundreds of attendees heard Saturday afternoon during a rally held by Elbows Up, Canada at Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto.\n\nThe grassroots movement, which staged its first rally on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on March 9, was organized in response to U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly insisting that Canada become the 51st state.\n\nPeter Wall, one of the people volunteering their time to organize the rallies, said Canadians are feeling a mixture of frustration, concern and anger.\n\n“And when you’re feeling that, it’s great to come together and stand together and to be together for our country, which is why you are all here I think,” Wall said.\n\nHe said the Elbows Up, Canada co-organizers are guided by core values including their belief in Canada and being non-partisan.

He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.\n\nTren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation’s economy came undone last decade.\n\nTrump’s administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.\n\nMaduro’s government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.\n\nIn recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nThe Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.","summary":"Venezuela will once again accept repatriation flights from the United States carrying its deported nationals after reaching an agreement with the U.S., a Venezuelan official said on social media Saturday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/22/us-news/venezuela-to-resume-repatriation-of-migrants-after-us-deal/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100938850.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/iCMZg8bw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-22 22:26:34","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":303089408,"title":"Axed Hollyoaks star Sarah Jayne Dunn claims OnlyFans is 'safer' than working on the Channel 4 soap after show bosses failed to do anything about 'disturbing' stalker ordeal","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice chiefs pulled armed officers AWAY from Downing Street at the height of violent Black Lives Matter protests to appease hostile mob that left dozens of cops injured - as Met is accused of 'two-tier policing'\n\nRhian Sugden slams husband Oliver Mellor for 'going out drinking with his mates' while she and their son George, 11-months, are both rushed into A&E\n\nFury as primary school SCRAPS Easter service to 'respect' other religions - in a move branded 'disgraceful'\n\nStory behind Spencer Matthews and Vogue Williams marriage rumours: Why talk of 'incident' and Lottie Moss at Jamie Laing's wedding plus very intriguing 'fall out' are sweeping Chelsea, reveals KATIE HIND\n\nHere's the surprising reason why so many men cheat on their pregnant partners - including man who slept with another woman 40 minutes after his wife gave birth, reveals top psychotherapist JULIET ROSENFELD\n\nBargain Hunt star tragically dies just hours after filming as the BBC show pays tribute\n\nBritain's biggest 'baby deserts' are revealed amid terrifying threat of 'underpopulation': Interactive map shows how many children women have in YOUR area\n\nStory of Kate's cancer battle: A year ago the Princess made her unprecedented announcement.

Russia took control of Donetsk and Luhansk at the start of the 2022 invasion and subsequently took control of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. All of this is subsequent to invading Crimea in 2014 and holding it to this day.Kyiv has refused to proceed without an agreement that Russia will relinquish those territories.Witkoff defended Russia's claim to those regions by citing contentious referendums that Russia has pushed in the contended regions. Ukraine and its Western allies have condemned those referendums, held in 2022, as illegitimate.Witkoff claimed the regions were \"Russian-speaking\" and \"the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated they want to be under Russian rule.\" He referred to the issue as \"the elephant in the room,\" according to Radio Free Europe.\"When that gets settled, we're having a very, very positive conversation,\" Witkoff said, adding that Russia has \"de facto\" control of the territories. He asked: \"Will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Can Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is the central issue in the conflict.\"Then-President Joe Biden had labeled the referendums as a \"sham\" as they were held after Russia had already annexed the territories and occupied them as a pretense to invade all of Ukraine.Zelensky, as recently as last week, has maintained that his country does not recognize the occupied territories as Russian, responding to the issue after it was raised during talks in Saudi Arabia between the warring nations.The Trump administration has maintained that Ukraine will have to make concessions, including territory, if officials want to end the conflict sooner than later. However, following meetings between Trump and leaders from the United Kingdom and France, Trump said that the U.S. would help Ukraine \"get as much back as possible.\"Trump later had a high-profile bust-up in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump said that Ukraine had \"no cards\" and needed to take a more realistic stance on the peace talks.Witkoff told Carlson that Ukraine has a \"constitutional issue...as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory.\" Witkoff remains \"very, very optimistic that we're going to be able to bring the two sides together.\"What People Are SayingSteve Witkoff wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Thank you [Tucker Carlson] for having me today. Serving under [Donald Trump] has been a true privilege. He is the most effective President ever and under his administration and leadership, we will deliver peace to the world by settling our most devastating geopolitical conflicts.\"Yaroslav Trofimov, the Wall Street Journal's chief foreign affairs correspondent, wrote on X: \"It's clear from this that the only difference between Steve Witkoff's and Vladmir Putin's views on the war in Ukraine is that Putin actually knows the names of all the five Ukrainian regions he wants to keep.\"Former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis wrote on X: \"Witkoff's repeating of Kremlin lies about 'russian-speakers' wanting to 'join Russia' is truly chilling. This is nothing less than carte blanche for Putin's genocidal imperialism.

They’re Persuading Me to Take Action Now!","text":"The chief economist of the financial analysis company Moody Analytics warned on Wednesday that the chances of a recession in the US are ‘uncomfortably high’ and ‘rising,’ bolstering one of my long-held beliefs: I don’t care what economists think.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I respect the profession. It is certainly valuable to understand how supply and demand, and interest rates work. But the personal opinions of economists are mostly worthless.\n\nLike stock pundits, they’re asked to time the markets and predict when any economy is going to plunge into recession. But they’re wrong over 90 percent of the time. In fact, graveyards are full of the bones of people who’ve tried to forecast downturns.\n\nNo one can do it. Some still try.\n\nI’ll only ever make one guaranteed prediction: there is a 100 percent chance that there will be another global recession. It’s just that no one can tell you when it will happen.\n\nI’m watching the same market indicators that are driving the likes of Moody’s Mark Zandi into hysterics and hearing the same nattering on Wall Street, but I’m putting money into the market – not taking it out.\n\nHere’s what I am monitoring:\n\nFollow the (borrowed) money\n\nMore Americans than ever before are tapping into their 401(k)s to cover financial emergencies. Nearly five percent of account holders made early withdrawals in 2024 to pay for medical bills or avoid foreclosures, up from 3.6 percent in 2023, according to Vanguard Group.\n\nA record percentage of subprime auto loan borrowers are falling behind on their payments, the highest rate since 1994, says the credit rating agency Fitch. And consumer confidence, in some surveys, is falling to decades’ lows.\n\nTaken together, those indicators may seem concerning. But all of them are a result of interest rates moving from four to seven percent for most consumer loans and credit card rates inching up around 20 percent.\n\nThese borrowing rates are the result of ‘sticky’ inflation that skyrocketed under the previous administration and have not yet come down.\n\nMany consumers were anticipating that the Federal Reserve was going to cut rates in 2025 but I don’t anticipate that happening anymore. Until the Fed sees what they impact of new tariffs may be they’ll likely keep rates where they are.\n\nSo now Americans are coming to grips with this ‘new normal’ high-interest rate environment, and they are adjusting according.\n\nIs it an indicator of recession? I don’t believe so. Instead, I am closely following a more practical metric that points in the opposite direction.\n\nAmerica’s small business backbone\n\nI hold equity in at least 50 companies across all 11 sectors of the US economy. These businesses are involved in everything from insecticide to wireless charging and commercial airline kitchens to kitchen utensils. And I don’t see any slowdown in demand.\n\nI speak to the CEOs of these companies nearly every single day.\n\nRight now, in March, many of them are planning ahead for October and the start of the holiday buying season. They’re making critical decisions about how much capital they’re going to invest to meet consumer demand.\n\nThey need to invest now in their inventories so that they can ship to their retailers and fill online orders.\n\nIf they saw a recession on the horizon, they’d be pulling back on capital expenditures by up to 20 percent. But that’s not happening.\n\nI didn’t see a weakening in business investments last week. I haven’t seen it this week.\n\nThese small businesses are critical to the health of the US economy, as companies of between five and 500 employees create more than 60 percent of the jobs in the country.\n\nFrom my perspective, they are not planning for recession.\n\nSo, what about all the volatility in the stock markets? I’m not particularly concerned about that either.\n\nI see a buying opportunity.\n\nEmbrace the volatility\n\nThe US stock market closed slightly higher on Friday breaking four straight weeks of losses. But Wall Street remains rife with uncertainty.\n\nAs I’ve written for the Daily Mail that’s certainly no surprise to me.\n\nPresident Donald Trump came into office like a bull in china shop. He knows that he has only two years of guaranteed political control of Washington, DC (before the midterm elections) and he is determined to jam each one of his agenda items through.\n\nBut beside the blistering speed of the Trump White House, its radical transparency has been stunning to people.\n\nTake Trump’s public Oval Office negotiations with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month, for instance. What Trump did by allowing the talks to play out in front of the public has never been done before in modern day negotiations.\n\nThe world was in shock. And the president is conducting his trade wars in much the same way. No one likes to see the sausage made. It makes some nervous and that creates incredible volatility in the markets.\n\nBut times of volatility are immensely good for investors who are willing to take positions in times of turmoil. I’ve seen this movie before, multiple times in my investment career, it creates opportunity.\n\nWhile I never try to predict the ‘bottom’ of a market correction, I do see each ‘dip’ as an entry point into the market. Right now, I am a buyer of indices that are conservative in nature.\n\nSome track small capitalization firms in the US, others follow Asian or European industries. But I never pick specific stocks.\n\nThat’s how I invest – consistently and without attempting to time the market. Over decades, I’ve learned these moments of volatility are very interesting times to take positions.\n\nAgain and again in these tumultuous Trump times, I return to the same advice for investors: Pay close attention to the president’s ‘signals’ and ignore the ‘noise.’\n\nDoom and gloom predictions from economists like Mark Zandi as the ‘noise.’ He can’t predict the likelihood of a recession better than you or I could.\n\nInstead, watch Trump’s ‘signals.’ The President wants to renegotiate America’s trade deals with the ultimate goal of rallying the West to create a more efficient economic engine to take on rising challenges from China and its partners, Russia and North Korea.\n\nThat’s a vision that I’ll invest in.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe chief economist of the financial analysis company Moody Analytics warned on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kevin O&#8217;Leary Shares Genuine Signs of Recession.

country.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation campaign in US history and curb immigration, mainly from Latin American nations.\n\nThe order affects around 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the US under a scheme launched in October 2022 by Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden and expanded in January the following year.\n\nThey will lose their legal protection 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security’s order is published in the Federal Register, which is scheduled on Tuesday.\n\nThat means immigrants sponsored by the programme “must depart the United States” by April 24 unless they have secured another immigration status allowing them to remain in the country, the order says.\n\nWelcome.US, which supports people seeking refuge in the US, urged those affected by the move to “immediately” seek advice from an immigration lawyer.\n\nThe Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) programme, announced in January 2023, allowed entry to the US for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries, which have grim human rights records.\n\nBiden touted the plan as a “safe and humane” way to ease pressure on the crowded US-Mexico border.\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security stressed on Friday that the scheme was “temporary.”\n\n“Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status, nor does it constitute an admission to the United States,” it said in the order.\n\nTrump last week invoked rare wartime legislation to fly more than 200 alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which has offered to imprison migrants and even US citizens at a discount.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/trump-administration-moves-to-end-legal-status-for-532000-immigrants/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P14-C_23032025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22

talks","text":"March 22 (UPI) -- Leaders from China, Japan and South Korea met on Saturday and agreed to cooperate in the future amid growing uncertainty over U.S trade and security policies.\n\nRepresentatives of the three nations agreed to hold a summit in the near-future to discuss potential trilateral trade, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya told media.\n\n\"It is extremely important for the three countries ... to promote future-oriented exchanges and cooperation and guide the region and international community from division to cooperation,\" Iwaya said.\n\n\"It is more important than ever that we make efforts to overcome division and conflict through dialogue and cooperation,\" Iwaya added.\n\nIwaya, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul participated in the trilateral talks in Tokyo, which are aimed at improving regional relations among the three nations.\n\n\"It is necessary for China, Japan and South Korea to further strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust, deepen cooperation and provide more stabilizing factors for regional peace and development,\" Yi told the South China Morning Post.\n\nYi said the \"international situation\" is chaotic and changing, partly due to U.S. President Donald Trump's Indo-Pacific policies.\n\nTrump's willingness to apply tariffs to support the U.S. economy has caused many international trade partners to re-assess their positions.\n\nSaturday's trilateral talk was the first meeting involving Japanese and Chinese officials since April 2019 and could lead to China agreeing to import Japanese fishery products, Nippon reported.\n\nChina banned importation of Japanese fishery products following the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant's meltdown on March 11, 2011, after an earthquake damaged the now-closed facility that is located in Okuma, Fukushima, in northeastern Japan.\n\nChinese, Japanese and South Korean officials agreed to resume prior free-trade negotiations that were halted in 2019.\n\nSouth Korean and Japanese officials will have to work out differences related to Japan's use of forced labor of South Koreans during World War II.\n\nThose differences led to a diplomatic row last year after South Korean officials accused Japanese leaders of not properly honoring South Korean victims who were forced to work in Japan's Sado mines.\n\n\"The ministers agreed on the need to continue this flow of exchanges and steadily advance bilateral relations without disruption,\" Cho said in a news release.\n\n\"They emphasized the importance of candid communication between their diplomatic authorities to ensure the stable management of bilateral issues,\" he added.\n\nPolitical differences between South Korea and North Korea also would need to be addressed.\n\nYi said such talks would require addressing the political situation in the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\"All parties should face up to the root causes of the peninsula issue, meet each other halfway, show goodwill to each other, strive to form positive interactions and seek the greatest common ground for their respective concerns,\" Yi said.","summary":"Leaders from

Trump tariffs","text":"When Vivian Wu, a university student from Shanghai, planned a trip to Seoul to attend a concert in BTS band member J-Hope’s Hope on the Stage tour in early March, many of her family and friends urged her to reconsider.\nIt was only two months after the deadly Jeju Air plane crash and street protests were still taking place across the South Korean capital following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-yeol.\nBut Wu insisted on going – and she was not alone. Snatches of Chinese conversation could be heard all along the winding queue to enter the KSPO Dome, where BTS member J-Hope was performing.\n“I’ve read news that China may open wider to K-pop stars,” said Wu, while raising a glow stick to pose for a photo outside the stadium. “I hope it’s true. Cultural exchanges are key to bilateral relations.”\nDiehard K-pop fans like Wu – alongside businesspeople – represent the most resilient bond between the two East Asian countries, whose relations stand at a crossroads after a turbulent few years punctuated by political flare-ups.\nChina and South Korea maintain close economic ties – with trade and investment flows worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually – but relations have been strained due to the United States’ heavy military presence and deployment of the THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea.\nAnalysts, however, predict the return of US President Donald Trump could bring the two countries closer together, with both countries facing threats of American tariffs. There is even a chance Beijing and Seoul might upgrade their 10-year-old bilateral free trade deal and push forward with the economic integration of East Asia.\n\n“I’m expecting a bigger room for China and South Korea to cooperate in the Trump era,” said Huang Rihan, a professor of international relations at Huaqiao University.\nAt a recent bilateral forum in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang, Huang heard many South Korean experts express concerns about the rapid progress made by Chinese companies in industries such as electric vehicles. But they also shared their Chinese counterparts’ worries over US policy uncertainties, and their desire for more bilateral engagement.\n“Trump doesn’t really value allies,” he said, citing the US president’s fierce criticism of South Korean tariffs in early March, a claim that Seoul has denied.\n“His ‘America first’ policy will eventually force Japan and South Korea to reassess their need to improve cooperation with China. This is a very important signal.”\nBeijing is determined to step up economic cooperation with its major trading partners, with negotiations over a China-Japan-South Korea free trade area high on the 2025 to-do list of China’s top economic planning body, the National Development and Reform Commission.\nSouth Korea is one of a few developed nations to have signed a free trade deal with China. It, together with Japan, is also a member of the China-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. The three East Asian powers – which together account for about one-quarter of global GDP – also announced plans to restart talks over a trilateral free trade agreement in May.\nBut Seoul often finds itself caught in the middle of the China-US rivalry. It relies on the US for security protection, and it has also been involved in Washington’s efforts to contain China’s economic rise through initiatives like the Chip 4 alliance and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\nIn the Trump 2.0 era, South Korea and China must work together to ensure that free and fair trade continues in the region\nHyuntai Lee, Seoul National University professor\nYet, South Korea remains China’s second-largest trading partner by country after the United States, with bilateral trade rising 5.6 per cent year on year to US$328.1 billion in 2024, Chinese customs data showed. China trades more with South Korea than it does with all 54 African nations combined.\n“In the Trump 2.0 era, with protectionism intensifying, South Korea and China must work together to ensure that free and fair trade continues in the region,” said Hyuntai Lee, an associate professor of international studies at Seoul National University.\n“As a country highly dependent on global trade, [South] Korea has no choice but to participate in such multilateral cooperation frameworks.”\nSouth Korean businesses, however, remain wary of China’s rapid progress in a slew of hi-tech fields, which has eroded their competitive advantages and hit two-way investment.\n“The sense of crisis among Korean companies is increasing due to China’s improved technological capabilities. This competitive landscape is indeed a factor limiting cooperation between the two countries,” said Lee.\nLike many foreign car makers, South Korean brands Hyundai and Kia have lost market share to Chinese electric car producers. The global sales of Chinese television makers Hisense and TCL surpassed those of Samsung and LG for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to data from research firm Omidia.\nChinese shipyards, meanwhile, grabbed 70 per cent of global orders for new commercial vessels last year – with South Korea’s shipbuilders taking only 17 per cent – while rapidly penetrating into high-value-added industrial sectors.\nA South Korean government study found that China’s advancements in 136 key technologies outpaced South Korea’s for the first time in 2022. In late February, an industry survey by the Korea Institute of Science & Technology Evaluation and Planning showed that the country is losing ground to China in five areas of semiconductor technology.\nJunha Kang, a law professor at Hongik University in Seoul and a government trade adviser, said China and South Korea needed to enhance their FTA, as the original deal signed in 2015 did not reflect today’s reality, with its new technologies, growing digital trade, and altered bilateral economic dynamics.\n“In the phase 2 negotiations, [South] Korea aims to expand market liberalisation in service sectors such as entertainment and tourism,” said Kang, who previously took part in governmental trade negotiations with China.\n“Both sides need to address non-tariff barriers and improve trade transparency to facilitate smoother transactions.”\nThe US geopolitical alignments with Korea and Japan undoubtedly add complexity\nJunha Kang, Hongik University professor\nBut Korea and Japan may prefer to take a wait-and-see approach before proceeding further with the negotiations, Kang said, as Trump steps up his tariff war on China.\n“The US geopolitical alignments with Korea and Japan undoubtedly add complexity to trilateral relations among China, Korea, and Japan,” he said, warning that careful diplomacy would be needed to maintain regional stability and foster constructive cooperation.\nThe lack of leadership in South Korea is another concern.\nYoon was freed from detention on March 8 after prosecutors decided not to appeal a court decision cancelling his arrest. However, he is still suspended from his duties and faces criminal and impeachment trials for his declaration of martial law in early December.\nThe political turmoil is one of the reasons – together with tensions with North Korea and a rise in global protectionist policies – why ratings agency China Chengxin International downgraded the outlook of South Korea’s sovereign credit from stable to negative in December.\n“As trade protectionism is expected to intensify, South Korea’s economic growth rate is expected to slow down year-on-year in 2025,” the Beijing-based agency warned.\nIn Beijing, many policy advisers have suggested that China make bolder efforts to convince South Korea and Japan to proceed with further economic integration.\nBeijing could demonstrate its sincerity by taking action to address hot-button issues, such as industrial subsidies and the role of state-owned enterprises, said Xiang Haoyu, a special researcher with the China Institute of International Studies, a Beijing-based government think tank, in an article published in World Affairs magazine last year.\nDuring a meeting with President Xi Jinping in February, Woo Won-shik, the speaker of South Korea’s National Assembly, invited the Chinese leader for a state visit to coincide with the Apec Summit in November.\nWoo explicitly mentioned the phase 2 negotiations of the bilateral free trade deal and called for more cooperation to stabilise trade and supply chains, Yonhap News Agency reported.\nBut will China be willing to open its doors to K-culture? It is hard to imagine Beijing doing so easily, said Lee of Seoul National University, but more cultural exchanges and loosened visa policies might help enhance bilateral trust.\n“The recent move to expand cultural exchanges is a positive sign,” he said. “It is necessary to strengthen high-level dialogue channels between governments and establish institutional mechanisms to expand cultural content exchanges.”","summary":"The US’ tariff threats have raised hopes in Beijing that it can convince Seoul to move forward with an ambitious new trade deal.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3303346/hope-stage-china-south-korea-move-closer-amid-trump-tariffs","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/21/d32ad780-1611-422e-a2e5-8b503f8f0f1e_50c11024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-22 22:00:12","author":"Frank Tang","authors":["Frank Tang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.057},{"id":303084988,"title":"Paul 'Wags' Wagstaff dead: Black Grape and Happy Mondays guitarist dies as tributes pour in","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Mar 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolice chiefs pulled armed officers AWAY from Downing Street at the height of violent Black Lives Matter protests to appease hostile mob that left dozens of cops injured - as Met is accused of 'two-tier policing'\n\nRhian Sugden slams husband Oliver Mellor for 'going out drinking with his mates' while she and their son George, 11-months, are both rushed into A&E\n\nFury as primary school SCRAPS Easter service to 'respect' other religions - in a move branded 'disgraceful'\n\nStory behind Spencer Matthews and Vogue Williams marriage rumours: Why talk of 'incident' and Lottie Moss at Jamie Laing's wedding plus very intriguing 'fall out' are sweeping Chelsea, reveals KATIE HIND\n\nHere's the surprising reason why so many men cheat on their pregnant partners - including man who slept with another woman 40 minutes after his wife gave birth, reveals top psychotherapist JULIET ROSENFELD\n\nBargain Hunt star tragically dies just hours after filming as the BBC show pays tribute\n\nBritain's biggest 'baby deserts' are revealed amid terrifying threat of 'underpopulation': Interactive map shows how many children women have in YOUR area\n\nStory of Kate's cancer battle: A year ago the Princess made her unprecedented announcement.
