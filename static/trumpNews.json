The uproar follows the Trump administration 's declaration to its followers that there isn't an Epstein list, despite previous campaign promises to unveil all involved parties. Notably, it's Trump's own backers who are most irked by his sudden U-turn, with a new Democracy Institute poll indicating that 67% of MAGA supporters who voted for him last November are at odds with his decision not to release the client list, in contrast to 58% of Kamala Harris voters who also disagree. First-time voters in 2024 appear to be particularly incensed by Trump's choice, with a staggering 71% opposing his decision. Among all Americans, the figure dips slightly to 63%, yet this still signifies a majority, according to the poll. The incumbent's latest actions seem to be taking a toll on his approval ratings, signalling that even Trump's staunchest advocates might have found a reason to withdraw their support from the contentious figurehead. Presently, data shows that 50% of Americans disapprove of President Trump's performance, reports the Mirror US . All this turmoil has emerged after the Justice Department and the FBI issued an unsigned memo last week, asserting that there is no alleged Epstein client list, contradicting Attorney General Pam Bondi's February statement that the list was \"on her desk.\" The DOJ's decision has sparked controversy among Trump's supporters, with many viewing the Epstein case as a pivotal reason for backing Trump. FBI Director Kash Patel and his deputy Dan Bongino, before assuming their roles, had consistently spoken out about the list and the alleged \"deep state\" efforts to conceal it from the public eye. They also repeatedly insisted that Epstein did not take his own life. The DOJ memo confirmed that Epstein indeed died by suicide while detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City in 2019. On Saturday, the president took to social media to voice his discontent over the split within his staunch \"Make America Great Again\" following regarding this issue, throwing his support behind Bondi. In his extensive post, he made no reference to Bongino. \"What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'\" Trump penned. \"They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening.\" Nevertheless, following an exhaustive months-long review of the evidence held by the government, the Justice Department concluded in Monday's memo that no further revelations would be appropriate or justified. The department highlighted that much of the information was sealed by a court order to safeguard victims, and only a small portion \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"","summary":"The poll found that 67% of Trump voters in the 2024 election disagreed with the president's decision not to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, compared to 58% of Kamala Harris voters","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/poll-donald-trump-humiliated-maga-35556042","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35556048.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_JS375324583.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 01:31:56","author":"Anthony Orrico,Mataeo Smith,Michael D.

This appears to be a strategy he is determined to adopt even as his trade war is forcing some of the US-friendly countries to join hands with those with which they do not see eye to eye on many issues.\n\nTrump betrays his increasing impatience by making the BRICS group of emerging major economies a new target of his tariff war. He has threatened members of the group, which include China and India, with 10 per cent tariffs on goods exported to the US in addition to heightened tariffs already on the horizon for some of them. As leaders of the group met for an annual summit in Rio de Janeiro recently, Trump thundered, threatening on social media “any country aligning themselves with the anti-American policies of BRICS” will face those duties with “no exceptions.” He then followed it up with the assertion that he intended to break up the group.\n\nIn a sense, the new development demonstrates how the US under Trump is concerned by the fact that BRICS is growing from strength to strength, expanding its membership to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, while more countries are waiting in the wings for entry. It also puts the international spotlight on the group, which roughly serves as the Global South’s answer to the US-led G7 advanced economies. It is also true that the BRICS member states are too politically and ideologically disparate to be effective. That gives rise to the question why Trump is so concerned about it. The answer seems to be his worry that BRICS may pose a grave threat to the dominance of the dollar in the world economy and the accumulation of wealth in the USA. What he said during his cabinet meeting soon after the BRICS session points to this direction: “BRICS was set up to hurt us, degenerate our dollar and take it off as the standard.”\n\nIn fact, the ambitious goal of a “BRICS currency” had first been suggested by Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2023, but the idea was shelved as it appeared to be too complex and practically impossible. While most other nations supported Brazil’s idea, it was India that opposed the push for a unified currency simply due to political considerations and not economic. However, BRICS countries are keen on expanding trade in their national currencies, rather than relying on the US dollar. The aim is to reduce the dollar dependence of a significant chunk of the global economy. BRICS members account for more than a third of global GDP based on purchasing power parity. Interestingly, in a joint declaration released during their Brazil summit, the group of BRICS leaders endorsed ongoing discussions of a “cross-border payments initiative” between member countries. If such a system is developed, analysts suggest, it could potentially become an alternative to the SWIFT inter-bank network, using BRICS countries’ currencies or their digital equivalents.\n\nBypassing SWIFT and a dollar-denominated trade system has obvious benefits for certain BRICS countries, such as Russia and Iran, as it could allow them to wriggle out of heavy Western sanctions. Other countries also see a benefit in not relying on the US dollar for trade. For example, China has long been aiming to make its renminbi an international currency and counter what it calls the US’ “financial hegemony.”\n\nThere are conflicting interests in the BRICS group that make united economic actions a very difficult task. But, what appeared to be too complex even a few months back, now becomes feasible for the simple reason that Trump is resolved to reset the global economic order dismantling the previous system. His belligerence in asserting America’s economic power is ironically bringing together other countries in the Global South so that they can work against the might of the US and precisely negating his intentions.","summary":"US President Donald Trump is opening new theatres of his global tariff war.

He also said that countries buying Russian oil or other exports could face penalties if Moscow doesn’t agree to a peace deal by early September. Trump made these remarks on Monday during a meeting at the White House with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He said the U.S. would introduce what he called “secondary tariffs” though he didn’t explain exactly what that means. “We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days tariffs at about 100%” Trump said.\nLater US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick clarified that both tariffs and sanctions are options on the table and either could be used depending on the situation.\nThe warning gave Russian investors some hope since the 50-day grace period gives time to avoid harsh actions. As a result Russia’s currency the Rouble bounced back and its stock markets rose.\nIf Trump follows through with these so-called secondary sanctions it would mark a big change in how the West has handled Russia so far. While Western countries have largely cut business ties with Moscow during the war they have not stopped Russia from selling oil to countries like China and India. That oil trade has brought Russia huge amounts of money during the conflict.\nUkraine thanks US after Trump announces new weapons package\nUkraine has expressed its gratitude to the United States following Trumps announcement of a new advanced weapons package for the country. The aid includes Patriot air defense systems which are known for protecting against missile attacks.\nTrump said the U.S. would build the weapons but NATO allies would cover the cost. “We’re not buying it but we will manufacture it” he said. “They’re going to be paying for it.”\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shared on Telegram that he spoke with Trump and thanked him for his willingness to support Ukraine. Zelensky said they discussed efforts to stop the violence and work toward a fair and lasting peace.\nThe message came after Zelensky met with Trump’s envoy Keith Kellogg on Monday for further talks.\n(With inputs from agencies)","summary":"White House officials confirmed that Trump will pursue 100% tariffs on Russia and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy.

To some, that might appear like an excessively harsh attribution and perhaps a misuse of the term. \n\nOn Saturday, Florida state representatives and congressmembers visited Trump’s infamous “Alligator Alcatraz” immigrant detention center in the Everglades where about a thousand individuals are being held. The tour was limited – they were not allowed to examine the conditions up close or speak to the detainees and were denied access to the medical facilities.\n\nAccording to Congressman Maxwell Frost, “We saw humans being held in cages. 32 people per cage, three toilets in each cage for these 32 people […] There’s a little spigot on top of the toilet, and that’s where they drink their water as well. […] it’s gross and it’s disgusting, and this is where people are being held.” Frost reported hearing an inmate yelling out that he’s a US citizen.\n\nSpeaking to MSNCB, Florida Representative Anna Eskamani stated that, “We have animals that are in better conditions.”\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that conditions in the cages range from freezing at night to sweltering during the day. Giant bugs and mosquitos are ubiquitous. Some toilets fail to flush and at times, human feces floods the cages. Detainees are not allowed showers or confidential calls with their attorneys. \n\nThe wife of a detained man with a green card claimed that, “They eat once a day and have two minutes to eat. The meals have worms.” She also claimed that the detainees, despite already being underfed, went on a hunger strike in protest. The facility has only been open for two weeks. \n\nImmigration attorney Katie Blankenship shared that one of her clients within the facility is a 15-year-old boy.\n\nIt’s no wonder that the lawmakers who visited the tents reported hearing people screaming, “Help me, help me”.\n\nDespite Trump specifying that the detention center was for “deranged psychopaths” and “some of the most vicious people on the planet,” hundreds of those detained within have not been charged with any crime and have no criminal record.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has responded to criticisms of the detention center saying, “I wish they would have said that back during the Biden administration and back when Democrats were in the White House and they were piling people on top of each other on cement floors and literally didn’t have 2 feet to move. They never did that, and that’s why this politics has to end.”\n\nWell Kristi Noem, they did and we all remember it because Biden’s presidency only ended earlier this year. You can read more about the criticisms levied against Biden’s treatment of immigrants here, here, here, and numerous other places. Overcrowded and inhumane conditions at Biden-era detention facilities were widely reported and condemned. ICE abuses during his tenure were also well-documented.\n\nTrump’s current program of dehumanizing treatment toward immigrants and rights violations are simply a dramatic expansion of Biden-era indecency – Alligator Alcatraz is even worse than the already awful conditions that detained immigrants had to endure while Biden was in office. \n\nNow, it’s not only people who have arrived at the border and held for processing. It’s also hispanic-looking people being randomly approached on the street or at their jobs and being sent to a hell hole to eat maggot sandwiches. It’s unconstitutional, politically motivated racial-profiling that leads to cruel and unusual punishment – all sanctioned by the president. \n\nWhat we have now is a government agency whose job it is to roam the streets looking for Hispanic-looking people, detaining them because of how they look, and sending them off to cages, some of whom have green cards or citizenship, and many of whom are hard working and never committed a crime – all because the president has built a movement around scapegoating immigrants. \n\nThat’s really the important point here. All of this suffering is being created in service of Trump’s political goals – giving people a target to direct their scorn and making a big spectacle out of human misery to show how much he’s “winning.”\n\nLast week U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled that ICE must stop racial profiling practices, approaching people without reasonable suspicion, and must provide access to legal counsel. She wrote, “Is it illegal to conduct roving patrols which identify people based upon race alone, aggressively question them, and then detain them without a warrant, without their consent, and without reasonable suspicion that they are without status? Yes, it is” citing “a mountain of evidence” that this is happening. \n\nI would not hesitate to bet every cent I have that ICE is currently ignoring those orders.\n\nIf this doesn’t sound like a horrible stain on American history to you, congratulations, you now have a perfect understanding of how the Nazis were able to get away with what they did to the Jews without the German people revolting.\n\nIt turns out that human nature is such that not only can it ignore the brutal suffering of fellow people, but it can have a good laugh about it.

I wished I had not stayed in this relationship\".\n'Sometimes I feel like there are other powers at play. All the fear that comes around the word \"tumour\". Fearne and I understood each other at that time.\n'I mean, it's a really amazing place to get to, not being scared of dying. I think having no regrets and feeling like you are living fully in the life you want to be in, it's quite rare.'\nLast month, discussing her recent health battle, Davina explained to Women's Health: 'When I got this brain tumour I said to [my partner] Michael, \"If I make it, this will be the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me.\"'\nContinuing her positive outlook following the devastating ordeal, Davina insisted she would 'not change anything'. \nShe continued: 'Without sounding arrogant I now love myself. I have been on a massive life journey and I have been through terrible struggles. \n'That is where the learning comes from. If something rally hard happens now I know it is a good thing.\n'The learning that I have made in the past two years has been so immense and enriching. I would not change it for the world. \n\nDavina was diagnosed with a colloid cyst, a rare type of benign brain tumour in November and underwent a six-hour operation\n\nSpeaking at Fearne Cotton's (pictured) Happy Place Festival at Gunnersby Park over the weekend, Davina explained how it has shifted her perspective on life\n\n'I am not afraid of dying anymore and it was the biggest journey of my life from August 2023 to November 2024', she admitted\n\nDavina appeared in a video with her partner Michael Douglas, where she revealed to fans she received the all clear after undergoing an MRI scan \n\n Davina McCall reveals she urgently 'wrote letters and a will' before her brain tumour surgery 'in case she died' - as Jamie Theakston emotionally admits cancer has been a 'real gift' \n'Obviously when it happened it was like calamity but to not be afraid of disasters that will make you a better person.'\nDavina appeared in a video with her partner Michael Douglas, where she confirmed she had received the all clear after undergoing an MRI scan.\nThe TV personality also shared unseen before and after snaps from her scan revealing that the tumour has completely disappeared from her brain. \nAccompanying the video, Davina wrote: 'So here it is. Our final brain surgery update. Had the final MRI this week. @brain.surgeon.uk got everything out during surgery, it's not coming back. \n'Thanks so so much to everyone at @onewelbeck and @clevelandclinic . To my mum and @mdlondon for taking such good care of me . To Sarah for being my BFF to my amazing kids. To @brain.surgeon.uk for being the GOAT. \n'I am so so grateful particularly because I know a lot of people have inoperable tumours and and I know I'm lucky to be able to draw a line under this and move on with my life when so many people can't. And I'm just gonna say this one more time. Benign does not mean fine.'\nShe told how she had her final MRI and admitted that she was nervous' as if any of the tumour was left that it would grow back and she'd have to 'go through the whole thing again'.\nShe noted that she'd 'mentally prepared herself' for that scenario, while Michael added that he too was nervous as it had been 'a huge journey'. \nLaughing with joy and relief, Davina then added: 'but it was clear!'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall, 57, insists she's 'not scared of dying anymore' in powerful confession following life-changing brain tumour\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email arthur.parashar@mailonline.co.uk \nBy ARTHUR PARASHAR\n Published:01:29 BST, 15 July 2025 |Updated:01:40 BST, 15 July 2025 \n\nA woman who tracked down her long-lost brother after only finding out he existed when their mother died has revealed how her life has been 'enriched' in the midst of tragedy.\nJess Basey-Fisher, 53, was perched on the end of a bed holding her mother's ashes in 2019 when her father Nicholas dropped a bombshell that would change her life forever.\nUnbeknown to her, Jess, a nurse from Carleton St Peter, Norfolk, had a biological brother living on the other side of the world who had been hidden from her through her whole life. \nHer mother, Ann Weir, had given birth to a baby boy years before meeting Nicholas, but put him up for adoption in the 1960s due to the societal pressures of raising a child out of wedlock.\n In a bizarre coincidence in 1991, the secret sibling travelled from his adoptive family home in Australia to stay with his paternal aunt in the Norfolk village of Brundall - just 10 minutes away from where Jess was living at the time.\nHowever, it would not be until April 1 2025 - some 63 years after her brother was born - that the siblings would finally meet for the first time after Jess tracked him down through Ancestry and Facebook. \nIn another heartbreaking layer to their extraordinary story, he was diagnosed with stage four cancer in November 2024 - just a month after they first made contact online.\nWhat followed was an emotional reunion between Ann's separated children which came at a key moment in Jess' life when she was battling through a double tragedy along with the revelation that she had a secret older brother.\nHer GP father Nicholas, who had strongly urged her to track down her brother, died in a fatal cycling crash in Amsterdam just five months after Ann's death - and six days after the family laid her to rest.\n\nJess Basey-Fisher, 53, is pictured with her long-lost brother who she tracked down in Australia\n\nJess is pictured as a young girl. She had no idea she had a secret brother until her father told her upon her mother's death\n\nSecret brother Alistair is pictured on the right after being adopted as a young boy. He is seen alongside his adoptive siblings Janet and Andrew in 1964\n'I remember him saying you've got to find him. And I said, \"Yeah, too right\"... I just had this yearning to find him.'\nShe added: 'When when dad told me, obviously my jaw just dropped. It was just a real surprise but I had such an urge to find him.\n'The reason why dad had told me was because he'd read a book by Joanna Trollope, called Brother and Sister. He waited until probably six weeks after mum died to tell me so. It wasn't something that he told me straight away.\n'But he felt that we should know, because he'd read this book, and I've read it now, and I can see why he felt he needed to, and he was very keen for me to find Alistair.\n'I haven't got a very big family, so I suppose you want to find out any extra members. It was just something that I was really important to me.\n'I can't even begin to think how mum would have felt.'\nDespite being filled with determination to find her brother, the only information that Jess had to go off was her mother's name. \nShe subsequently discovered that her mother and the father of her long-lost brother had met at a ball at a US airbase in Sculthorpe. Ann, who went on to work as a nurse and a midwife, was then sent to London to give birth.\nJess then managed to track down her brother's birth record from September 1962 on the Ancestry website after guessing what his first name would be.\nShe was met with 50 different results for 'A Weir' but incredibly tracked her brother down by guessing what his first name would be based on knowing what her mother would have picked.\n\nJess went out to Australia to finally meet Alistair in the flesh. They are pictured with his wife Suzie (right)\n\nIn a devastating twist, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer - just a month after the siblings made contact\n'I searched down and looked at all the names that mum would have chosen. It was just a hunch. I thought I've got to start somewhere, so let's start with James. And it was the right one, so I didn't have to do any more searching, which was rather lovely.\nThrilled with the discovery, Jess then contacted a social worker who tracked James down on Facebook in 2021. He had been renamed Alistair Dalgliesh and was 62 and living in Australia, having moved over with his new family from Kent when he was three.\nHis new parents had a daughter but were struggling to have another child when they adopted Alistair. \nThey had moved Down Under via the Ten Pound Poms scheme, a term given to British immigrants who migrated to Australia and New Zealand after the Second World War.\nBack in England, Ann would go on to marry Nicholas, with the wedding taking place on Alistair's birthday - six years after he was born.\n'I think the fact that she got married on his birthday says a lot,' Jess said. 'That was her nod.\n'I mean it could be total coincidence that but equally I think you'd never forget.'\nBearing extraordinary similarities to her own childhood, Alistair's adoptive mother was also a nurse, his father also a GP. \n\nJess, Alistair and Suzie are pictured on the beach in Australia. Alistair is due to come to Norfolk in October\n\nJess is pictured with Marjorie, Alistair's adoptive mother who has welcomed her into the family \n\n Six long-lost sisters are reunited thanks to social media - are you their missing brother? \nThe journey to find Alistair did not come without stumbling blocks. To begin with, there was a red herring where Jess was told by a social worker they had found her brother, only for them to realise he was born 10 years too late.\nThen when the social worker found the right Alistair on Facebook, he failed to respond to follow-up emails. \n'I was quite nervous as well, because he might not want to be found, he might not know he was adopted for a start, he might have changed his mind, and I went through all the possible scenarios,' she added.\nSocial workers came and went but persistent Jess always asked them to keep contacting Alistair - and then one day he started replying.\nThe pair first started exchanging messages on October 3 2024 and held their first phone call, starting with Jess asking him 'Have you got red curly hair?' to which he replied yes.\nThe siblings then proceeded to have a two-hour FaceTime and connected instantly, laughing about how similar they look.\n'We were just having two hour conversations every couple of days, because we had so much to catch up on.'\nBut then came another tragedy. \n'Literally a month later, he was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer,' Jess said.\n'And I also had to tell him that his birth mum was no longer alive, which wasn't an easy thing to do.\n'But he he actually said to me, he said, \"Do you know what, Jess? The only thing I regret is not being able to say to her, \"Thank you, I had a really lovely life\".\"'\nJess then travelled to Australia in April this year to finally meet Alistair in person and support him through his chemotherapy. \nDescribing the moment she met her brother for the first time, Jess said: 'I was really cross with myself because I'd asked Suzie, his wife, to video us.\nIn a reference to ITV show Long Lost Families, she quipped: 'I said, all we need is Davina McCall to be there!\n'But I stupidly crept up on them which is just a bit stupid because she couldn't video it.\n'I saw them, and I was just so excited I forgot to do it properly. But never mind!\n'I couldn't stop looking at him. You're looking at every single detail. I was comparing him to my mum. I just kept saying, \"God, this is just so unreal. Is this happening?\" It's so weird.'\nJess was stunned by the similarities between Alistair and their mother, including his love for history and music. \n'I think I watched more English television when I was out there than I ever watched. That's all we watched, Antiques Roadshow, Antiques Road Trip, 1 % Club and all those.'\nJess said she was welcomed into the family by Alistair's adoptive mother, Marjorie, and has even been added to the family tree. She also has two nephews through Alistair.\nJess revealed how the pair nearly crossed paths 34 years ago, when Alistair came back to the UK to stay with a relative.\nShe explained: 'Alistair's been out there since he was three, and ironically, in 1991, he was staying with his adoptive father's sister in Brundall, which is 10 minutes from where I was living.\n'How weird is that? The parallel lives, it's just a bit weird, there's some real coincidences.'\nAlistair is having chemotherapy every three weeks but is due to come over and stay with jess in Norfolk.\nShe joked how he will have to adjust to his 'life in Suburbia' to the 'mud of the Norfolk farm'.\nJess says that Alistair as 'really enriched my life', adding: 'I still can't comprehend it really.\n'She said they are 'making up for lost time', adding: 'We're just basically picking up a little bit later.\n'It is weird because it's like I've known him all my life.\n'Every morning, every night, we'd have a hug and a kiss, and he's just such a loving person. I still can't believe it.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWoman finds her long-lost brother on the other side of the world after decades apart - and reveals they nearly crossed paths 34 years ago\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The Chinese government is due to report those figures today.\n\nStill, the outlook is less upbeat, noted Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, noting that “tariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices.\n\n“We therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,” Huang said in a report.\n\nData for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump’s return to the White House, China’s global trade kept growing.\n\nTotal trade including exports and imports hit a record of more than 20 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) as Chinese businesses diversified their overseas production and export markets.

And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.After returning to the White House in January, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) -- previously headed by Elon Musk -- to downsize the government.Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programs -- targeting diversity initiatives and abolishing the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency USAID and others.","summary":"A divided US Supreme Court gave President Donald Trump the green light on Monday to resume dismantling the Education Department.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/supreme-court-allows-trump-resume-education-department-dismantling-3778467","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4610790/us-supreme-court-has-cleared-way-president-donald-trump-resume-mass-firings-education.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 00:33:14","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":341614220,"title":"Trump Sours On Putin, But Bromance May Not Be Over","text":"Ever since his political rise a decade ago, Donald Trump has sung the praises of Vladimir Putin -- the Russian president was a \"strong leader\" who, perhaps more important, would often say \"very good things\" about him.With his announcement Monday of new arms for Ukraine via Europe and tariff threats on Russia, Trump's bromance with Putin has hit a new low -- but it may not have run its course.Trump, who had vowed to end the Ukraine war within a day of returning to the White House, said he was \"disappointed\" in Putin, who has kept attacking Ukraine as if the leaders' telephone conversations \"didn't mean anything.\"\"I go home, I tell the first lady, 'You know, I spoke to Vladimir today, we had a wonderful conversation. She said, 'Oh really? Another city was just hit.'\"\"I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. It's been proven over the years. He's fooled a lot of people,\" Trump said.Trump quickly rejected that he was among those fooled and again insisted that the 2022 invasion of Ukraine was the fault of his predecessor Joe Biden, who championed a hard line on Russia.Brandishing his favorite weapon, Trump gave Russia 50 days to comply before facing 100 percent tariffs on countries that purchase from Russia, but stopped short of backing a bill before Congress for up to 500 percent tariffs.Russia's own trade with the United States has slowed down a trickle.Trump had \"promised that he could get Putin to the negotiating table, and he has failed to do that,\" said Heather Conley, a former State Department policymaker on Russia now at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.His tariff threat \"shows frustration that he has failed to do it, but I don't see it as a big policy change,\" she said.Trump stunned European allies on February 28 when he publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House, telling him he was ungrateful for billions of dollars in weapons under Biden. Trump then briefly held up new military and intelligence.For the US president, a transactional-minded businessman, Putin committed a key offense -- undermining Trump's self-image as a deal-maker.\"For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down,\" Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally who has led the push for tough new sanctions on Russia, told CBS News show \"Face The Nation.\"\"One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump,\" Graham said.Yet Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to trust Putin, despite firm warnings from within the US government.Most famously, he sided with Putin over US intelligence at a 2018 news conference after they met in Helsinki after the Russian president denied meddling to support Trump in his first election.For observers of Putin, the longest-serving leader in Moscow since Stalin, there was never much chance he would accept compromise on Ukraine or work with the West.Putin has rued the demise of Russia's influence with the fall of the Soviet Union as a historic calamity and rejected the idea that Ukraine has its own historical identity.With Russia making small but steady gains on the battlefield and bringing in North Korean troops, Putin has put his entire country on war footing, Conley said.\"The Kremlin has thrown everything into this,\" she said.\"President Putin believes that this is just going to be a slow erosion of Ukraine's position and the West's position, and he will win this conflict on its own merits,\" she said.Mark Montgomery, a retired US rear admiral and Senate policy aide, said Putin believed in what has been referred to as TACO -- Trump Always Chickens Out.Putin \"thought he could take it to the limit each time, and he found out he was wrong,\" said Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish research group.\"I don't think this stops until Putin feels either weapons system pain or economic pain that he cannot sustain.\"","summary":"Ever since his political rise a decade ago, Donald Trump has sung the praises of Vladimir Putin -- the Russian president was a \"strong leader\" who, perhaps more important, would often say \"very good things\" about him.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-sours-putin-bromance-may-not-over-3778464","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4610784/us-president-donald-trump-meets-nato-secretary-general-mark-rutte-oval-office-white-house.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 00:33:13","author":"Shaun Tandon","authors":["Shaun Tandon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":341619508,"title":"Musk's xAI launches 'Grok for Government' after Pentagon contract","text":"Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) company, xAI, has announced a new suite of AI models called Grok for Government.

Proponents said the import tax will help rebuild the shrinking US tomato industry and ensure that produce eaten in the US is also grown there. Mexico currently supplies around 70 per cent of the US tomato market, up from 30 per cent two decades ago, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Also Read | Donald Trump Threatens 100% Secondary Tariffs on Countries Buying Oil, Gas and Uranium From Russia; India Could Be Collateral Victim. Robert Guenther, the trade group's executive vice president, said the duty was \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture\". But opponents said the import tax will make tomatoes more expensive for US consumers. Also Read | Muhammadu Buhari Dies: PM Narendra Modi Condoles Demise of Former Nigeria President. Mexico's Economic Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said the government would continue looking for a way to once again suspend the tariff, part of ongoing negotiations between the two trading partners. In a statement Monday, he wrote that the move would \"only affect the pockets of American consumers\". \"It's unfair and against not only Mexican producers, but on the American industry. The ground that Mexican fresh tomatoes has gained in the US is because of the quality of the product, not from unfair practices,\" he wrote. Mexican greenhouses specialise in vine-ripened tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are typically grown in fields and picked green. Tim Richards, a professor at the Morrison School of Agribusiness at Arizona State University, said US retail prices for tomatoes will likely rise around 8.5 per cent with a 17 per cent duty. Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a right-leaning policy institute, said areas with a higher reliance on Mexican tomatoes could see price increases close to 10 per cent, since it will be more difficult to replace that supply, while other parts of the US could see price increases closer to 6 per cent. \"As an industry, we are saddened that American consumers will have to pay a tomato tax, or duty, for a reduced selection of the tomatoes they prefer, such as tomatoes on the vine, grape tomatoes, Romas, cocktail tomatoes and other specialty varieties,\" said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, which represents importers of Mexican tomatoes. The duty stems from a longstanding US complaint about Mexico's tomato exports and is separate from the 30 per cent base tariff on products made in Mexico and the European Union that President Donald Trump announced Saturday. The Commerce Department said in late April that it was withdrawing from a deal it first reached with Mexico in 2019 to settle allegations the country was exporting tomatoes to the US at artificially low prices, a practice known as dumping. As part of the deal, Mexico had to sell its tomatoes at a minimum price and abide by other rules. Since then, the agreement has been subject to periodic reviews, but the two sides always reached an agreement that avoided duties. In announcing its withdrawal from the Tomato Suspension Agreement, the Commerce Department said it had been \"flooded with comments\" from US tomato growers who wanted better protection from Mexican goods. \"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \"This rule change is in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\" But others, including the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association, had called on the Commerce Department to reach an agreement with Mexico. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, had also urged the Commerce Department to leave the current tomato agreement in place. In a letter sent to Lutnick last week, the US Chamber of Commerce and 30 other business groups said US companies employ 50,000 workers and generate USD 8.3 billion in economic benefits moving tomatoes from Mexico into communities across the country. \"We are concerned that withdrawing from the agreement — at a time when the business community is already navigating significant trade uncertainty — could lead to retaliatory actions by our trading partners against other commodities and crops that could create further hardship for US businesses and consumers,\" the letter said.

More Office of the White House in Washington, DC on July 14, 2025. Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nDispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,237.\n\nTrump Unveils New Aid for Ukraine and Issues Ultimatum to Moscow\n\nOn July 14 U.S. President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in U.S. policy toward ending the war in Ukraine, unveiling a new plan to boost military support for Kyiv while increasing pressure on Moscow. Speaking in the Oval Office alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said the U.S. will provide Ukraine with as many as 17 Patriot missile defense systems.\n\n“We’re going to have some come very soon, within days,” Trump told reporters. Some of the systems will be transferred from European NATO allies’ stockpiles, with the allies ordering replacements from the U.S. The new aid is valued at billions of dollars.\n\nThe more aggressive posture comes with a clear warning to Moscow. Trump gave the Kremlin a 50-day deadline to reach a peace agreement with Kyiv. Otherwise, the U.S. will impose what President Trump called “very severe” tariffs. “If we don’t have a deal in 50 days, it’s very simple, and they’ll be at 100%.” A White House official later clarified that these tariffs would target Russian goods, as well as extend to countries that continue purchasing Russian exports, including oil.\n\nDonald Trump’s decision appears to be driven by growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “My conversations with him are very pleasant, and then the missiles go off at night,” Trump said, even as he denied being taken in by Putin and attempted to cast his predecessors as having done so: “He fooled Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden — he didn’t fool me.”\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPresident Trump’s decision, nonetheless, may not represent as abrupt a shift against the Kremlin as it might initially appear, thanks to the grace period Russia received to devise a resolution to the conflict before the measures take effect. The 50-day grace period was met with cautious relief by investors in Russia, where the ruble rebounded from earlier losses against the dollar and the stock market posted modest gains of 2.7%.\n\nReacting to Trump’s new pledges of military aid for Ukraine, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, welcomed his firmer tone toward Russia, but not the 50-day grace period. “It is very positive that President Trump is taking on a strong stance on Russia,” she said. “On the other hand, 50 days is a very long time if we see that they [Russia]\n\nare killing innocent civilians,” Kallas continued.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in his country's capital, Kyiv, with Keith Kellogg, President Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia. Zelenskyy said they had “a productive conversation” about strengthening Ukrainian air defenses, joint arms production, purchasing U.S. weapons in conjunction with European allies, and the possibility of tightening international sanctions on Russia. “We hope for the leadership of the United States, because it is clear that Moscow will not stop unless its unwarranted ambitions are stopped by force,” Zelenskyy wrote in his post on Telegram following the meeting.\n\nRussian Attacks on Ukraine\n\nRussian forces rained 597 drones down on Ukraine, along with 26 cruise missiles, overnight into July 12, marking the second largest aerial attack of the war. Ukraine’s Air Force reported intercepting 319 drones and 25 missiles, as well as electronically jamming 258 drones. The barrage was directed at western Ukraine, with impacts recorded at five locations. Officials in Chernivtsi, previously considered one of Ukraine’s safest cities, reported two residents killed, its first wartime casualties. In Lviv, a city widely regarded as the nation’s cultural capital, at least 12 people were injured amid damage to the city’s historic center. In total, the Kremlin fired more than 1,800 drones, 1,200 glide bombs, and 83 missiles at its neighbor last week.\n\nIn addition to the massive overnight assault on July 12, Russian daytime attacks between July 10-13 killed at least 29 civilians across Ukraine. In the blood soaked eastern province of Donetsk, sustained Russian shelling killed at least 14 non-combatants and injured 26 others. In northeastern Kharkiv oblast, or province, four residents were killed, with 21 others wounded; in southern Kherson region, Russian drone strikes left four civilians dead and 32 others injured, while in southeastern Zaporizhzhia oblast, Russian attacks killed at least two residents and injured three others. In northern Sumy oblast, where Russia has renewed its on-the-ground offensive, five residents were reported dead and 19 others suffered injuries.\n\nJune marked the deadliest month for Ukrainian civilians in the war’s more than three-year history. According to a recent report from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, 232 were civilians killed and 1,343 injured in June, nearly three times the losses a year earlier. The UN attributed the spike to a tenfold increase in Russian long-range missile and loitering munition attacks, which use drones that can hover over an area to allow precision targeting. These weapons were in use across at least 16 regions, including Kyiv. Civilian casualties across Ukraine in the first half of 2025 surged to 6,754, a 54% year-over-year increase, where civilian deaths and injuries from Russian strikes rose by 17% and 64%, respectively.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky announced a government reshuffle and proposed First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko as the next Prime Minister of Ukraine on July 14.

Sentiment was also weighed down by rising trade tensions,\" ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes wrote in a note to clients.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose a 30 per cent tariff on most imports from the European Union and Mexico from August 1, adding to similar warnings for other countries and leaving them less than three weeks to hammer out framework deals that could lower the threatened tariff rates.\n\nTariffs risk slowing down economic growth, which could sap global fuel demand and drag oil prices lower.\n\nElsewhere, oil demand is set to stay \"very strong\" through the third quarter, keeping the market snugly balanced in the near term, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' secretary general said, according to a Russian media report.\n\nGoldman Sachs on Monday raised its oil price outlook for the second half of 2025, pointing to potential supply disruptions, shrinking oil inventories in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and production constraints in Russia.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/oil-edges-down-market-contemplates-potential-sanctions-tariffs-5238411","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--sE8q_3_j--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-07-15t002057z_1_lynxmpel6e00e_rtroptp_3_usa-oil-permian.jpg?itok=8M","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 00:20:57","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":341611502,"title":"India News | Ram Division Showcases Cutting-edge Technologies in Strike Corps Ops Demonstration","text":"Meerut (Uttar Pradesh) [India], July 15 (ANI): A landmark demonstration titled 'Prachand Shakti' was conducted in which \"Employment of Disruptive Technology by Infantry in Strike Corps Operations\" was displayed at the Kharga Corps Field Training Area in Meerut, the Indian Army said.\nThis event highlighted the evolving face of modern warfare, where UAVs, AI-driven systems, loitering munitions, and autonomous platforms were redefining battlefield dynamics.\nAlso Read | Lok Sabha Ushers In AI Era; Adopts Multilingual Access, Digital Attendance, Real-Time Transcriptions To Modernise Parliamentary Operations.\nIt was scheduled and conducted on July 14.

In May, he signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the development of new nuclear power plants in the United States. Among other things, those orders direct: \n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission to approve or deny new nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months of receiving applications (an acceleration from the current timeline of about five years).\nThe creation of a pilot program that would have three new experimental reactors approved and operating by July 4, 2026 -- less than 12 months from now.\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) to begin deploying advanced small modular nuclear reactors at DOE-owned locations by the end of 2027.\nThe Pentagon to have at least one nuclear reactor operational on a military base by September 2028.\nThe DOE to generally improve the nation's nuclear supply chain, including by promoting domestic enrichment of uranium, both U.S.-mined and imported.\n\nIf all of this makes you think that now might be a good time to invest in nuclear power stocks, well, you're not alone.\n\nWho's doing best so far?\n\nThree start-up nuclear companies developing \"micro\" and somewhat larger \"small\" modular nuclear reactors -- Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE 5.20%), NuScale Power (SMR 12.81%), and Oklo (OKLO 11.29%) -- have all outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year. Nano's outperformance is currently the smallest, but NuScale for example is up 160% in 52 weeks, and Oklo's stock is up more than 620%.\n\nBy comparison, nuclear power plant builder Fluor (FLR 2.95%) stock's performance has been relatively tame. Up 19% over the past year, it has also outperformed the S&P 500. But if you ask me, Fluor stock should actually be doing much better than these smaller companies, because its valuation is so much cheaper ... especially relative to its earnings.\n\nIf you've got $1,000 or so lying around, and have been wanting to put it to work in a nuclear stock, Fluor just might be the one you've been waiting for.\n\nHow to value Fluor stock\n\nLast week, I went so far as to call Fluor \"the smartest nuclear stock\" money could buy. I came to this conclusion based on the fact that Fluor owns a majority interest in small modular reactor builder NuScale, yet has a smaller market capitalization than NuScale's $10.3 billion implied market cap (according to the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), as well ass Fluor's track record of being profitable for the past three years. Contrast that with NuScale, Oklo, and Nano Nuclear, all of which remain unprofitable.\n\nThe consensus view among analysts covering Fluor is that it will earn $470 million in 2026, nearly $530 million in 2027, and $638 million in 2028. Its 2024 and projected 2025 earnings are abnormally much higher and much lower, respectively, than these numbers. But assuming analysts are correct that Fluor's earnings volatility will finally settle down starting next year, $470 million in earnings on an $8.7 billion market cap values Fluor stock at only 18.5 times forward earnings.\n\nThis seems a reasonable price to me, given the steady earnings growth analysts are predicting.\n\nSpeaking of earnings, earnings quality for the company is good, with real free cash flow (FCF) largely backing up the GAAP numbers on Fluor's income statement. Analysts forecast it will generate positive free cash flow of $343 million already this year, making the price-to-free-cash-flow ratio 25. Back out the net cash on its balance sheet, and Fluor's enterprise-value-to-FCF ratio drops to just 21. Analysts expect its FCF to grow by more than 20% annually for at least the next three years, to $598 million by 2028.\n\nThat puts it very close to an EV/FCF/growth ratio of 1.0, which would qualify Fluor stock as a value stock. And if you further subtract out the value of Fluor's NuScale stake, I'd argue that it's cheap enough to make the company more like a deep value stock.\n\nWhen compared to most nuclear companies that aren't earning any profits at all, this cheap valuation makes Fluor not only one of the best ways to play the nuclear power renaissance, but a just plain cheap stock to invest in, period.","summary":"The best nuclear stock to buy last week was Fluor.

In view of this, he wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to address some of the problems faced by the Bru people in the state.\nThe Chief Minister made these remarks while addressing the District Level Mega Campaign on Dharti Aaba Jan Bhagidari Abhiyan at Gobinda Community Hall, Jirania Sub-Division.

He has been working to make the country stronger and to ensure a safe future for the next generation,\" Manik Saha added.\nCM Saha further said that in Tripura, the present state government is providing various beneficiary schemes to the people, ranging from drinking water, hostels for Janajati students, tribal multipurpose marketing centres, and giving land pattas.\nUnder the Dharti Aaba Jan Bhagidari, 779 Gram Panchayats and Village Councils will benefit, with 20 departments involved in the initiative, the CM emphasised.\nDuring the event, Social Welfare and Social Education Minister Tinku Roy, Tribal Welfare Minister Bikas Debbarma, social worker Bipin Debbarma, West District Magistrate Dr Vishal Kumar, Dr K Sashikumar (Secretary, Tribal Welfare), West District ki SP Kiran Kumar, and others were present.

I also cover the Coalition’s vote was inefficiently distributed at the federal election, as well as US and UK politics.\n\nThe Tasmanian state election will be held this Saturday. Tasmania uses the proportional Hare-Clark system for its lower house elections. The five Tasmanian seats used at federal elections each have seven members, for a total of 35 MPs. A quota for election is one-eighth of the vote, or 12.5%.\n\nA DemosAU poll for Pulse Tasmania, conducted July 6–10 from a sample of 3,421, gave the Liberals 34.9% of the vote (up 0.9 since the June 19–26 DemosAU poll), Labor 24.7% (down 2.6), the Greens 15.6% (up 0.5), the Nationals 2.7%, the Shooters 1.8% and independents 20.3% (up 1.0).\n\nThe Nationals are only contesting Bass, Braddon and Lyons, and the poll would not have included them in the other two electorates of Clark and Franklin, so the Nationals’ vote in the electorates they are contesting would be higher than their statewide vote.\n\nWith a total sample of over 3,400, the sample size per electorate would be over 680. Using the results in individual electorates, this poll has the Liberals on a total of 13–14 seats out of 35, Labor on 9–10, the Greens on 6–7, independents on 4–6 and both the Nationals and Shooters either winning zero or one seat.\n\nIf the election results reflect this poll, the Liberals would easily be the largest party, but they would not win the 18 seats needed for a majority. There would probably be a majority for Labor, the Greens and left-wing independents, but Labor did not attempt to form government in a similar situation after the March 2024 election.\n\nIt’s been 11 years since Labor last held government in Tasmania, with the Labor/Greens government at that time widely blamed for Labor’s heavy defeat in the March 2014 election. But with the continuing decline of the major parties, Labor may have to reach an agreement with the Greens if they want to form government again in Tasmania.\n\nLabor and the Liberals have both supported construction of a new AFL stadium. I believe this partly explains the drop in Labor’s vote, as many on the left would oppose this stadium. Labor’s refusal to attempt to form government after the March 2024 election probably also contributed to its low vote.\n\nVoters may also be blaming Labor for this early election, just 16 months after the previous Tasmanian election. This election is just over two months after the federal election.\n\nFederal election: Coalition’s vote inefficiently distributed\n\nAnalyst Kevin Bonham has a pendulum of House of Representatives seats after the results of the May 3 federal election. There are likely to be federal redistributions from July 2026 in some states, so this won’t be the pendulum used at the next federal election.\n\nLabor won 94 of the 150 seats, the Coalition 43 and all Others 13, from a two-party vote of 55.2–44.8 to Labor. Assuming the Others are unchanged, Labor would need to lose 19 seats to drop below the 76 needed for a majority. On the pendulum, this occurs when the seat of Whitlam falls, but Labor won Whitlam by 56.3–43.7, more than 1% higher than their national vote.\n\nThis means that, using a uniform swing on the actual results, Labor would have won a majority even if they had lost the national two-party vote by 51.0–49.0, despite 13 Other seats.\n\nDespite the electoral hammering, the Coalition retained many regional seats by large margins. This contributed to an inefficiently distributed vote. With voters in the cities making up a majority of all Australian voters, the Coalition can’t win by appealing just to voters in the regions.\n\nThe Coalition would be the largest party if they won 26 seats from Labor. This happens when the Coalition gains Braddon, which Labor won by 57.2–42.8, so the Coalition would need a 51.9–48.1 national two-party margin. For a Coalition majority, they would need 33 gains, and need a 53.7–46.3 national two-party win.\n\nUS and UK politics\n\nI wrote for The Poll Bludger on Saturday that United States President Donald Trump’s net approval was nearly unchanged at -6.7 after the passage of the “big beautiful bill” through Congress. I also covered Elon Musk’s new party and New York City mayoral general election polls.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a Labour MP has defected to a potential Jeremy Corbyn-led party. The far-right Reform has led Labour in UK national polls since the early May local elections. In a House of Commons vote on a welfare reform bill, 49 Labour MPs rebelled.\n\nTwo Queensland poll give LNP big leads\n\nA Queensland state DemosAU poll, conducted July 4–9 from a sample of 1,027, gave the Liberal National Party a 55–45 lead (53.8–46.2 to the LNP at the October 2024 election). The Poll Bludger said this was a one-point gain for the LNP since a February DemosAU poll.\n\nPrimary votes were 40% LNP (steady), 28% Labor (down two), 13% Greens (up one), 12% One Nation (up two) and 7% for all Others (down one). On the recent Queensland state budget, 24% thought it would be good for the Queensland economy, 19% bad and 57% were unsure. By 43–26, respondents thought Labor would not have delivered a better budget.\n\nA Queensland state Redbridge poll gave the LNP a 56–44 lead. Primary votes were 43% LNP, 29% Labor, 11% Greens and 17% for all Others (there was no One Nation breakdown).\n\nQueensland was the only state the Coalition won at the federal election, though only by 50.6–49.4. The state LNP is still benefiting from a honeymoon after ousting Labor at last year’s election.","summary":"Polling ahead of the count this Saturday shows the island state will likely go from one hung parliament to another.","url":"https://theconversation.com/hung-parliament-still-likely-outcome-of-tasmanian-election-with-liberals-well-ahead-of-labor-in-new-poll-261073","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/679976/original/file-20250715-56-hq3yrq.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-15 00:09:24","author":"Adrian Beaumont,Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate,School of Mathematics and Statistics,The University of Melbourne","authors":["Adrian Beaumont","Election Analyst Psephologist at The Conversation; and Honorary Associate","School of Mathematics and Statistics","The University of Melbourne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":341609954,"title":"Republican judges reject Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in 'rare move': report","text":"One of President Donald Trump's appointed interim U.S. attorneys just failed to win a vote of confidence from federal judges in his respective jurisdiction, according to a Monday report in the New York Times.\n\nProsecutor John A.

In protest of CM Siddaramaiah not being present at the event, no state ministers or MLAs of Congress were present at the event. The CM said that the event was originally agreed to be postponed, but a local BJP leader \"succumbed to pressure\" and organised it anyway. \"The program scheduled in Sagar taluk was requested to be postponed through a phone call and a letter written to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Although the Union Minister had agreed to postpone the program, local BJP leaders succumbed to pressure and organised the program today without bringing it to my attention. Due to pre-scheduled commitments, I have to travel to Vijayapur district, making it impossible for me to attend the program in Sagar taluk,\" the Chief Minister said in a post on X. Citing the non-adherence to protocol, the CM reaffirmed the role of the state government in centrally sponsored projects. \"In protest of this move by the BJP, no government ministers or local MLAs are participating in the program. It is the central government that has initiated this conflict between us. There has been no adherence to protocol here. State governments also have a role in centrally sponsored projects. In such cases, the state government strictly adheres to all protocols. For today's program, neither I, nor the concerned departmental ministers, nor the local MLAs have been properly invited,\" his post added. Apart from the bridge, Gadkari also laid the foundation stone for nine National Highway projects spanning 99 kilometres and worth more than Rs 2,000 crore in Karnataka, according to an official press release by MoRTH.\nThe statement by the ministry said that the widening of the 47-kilometre-long Bidar-Humnabad section of NH-367 will substantially reduce travel time between the districts of Kalaburagi and Bidar. Restoration works undertaken in the Shiradi Ghat stretch of NH-75 are expected to ensure safe and uninterrupted traffic movement during the monsoon season, particularly along the vital Mangaluru-Bengaluru corridor.\nMinister Gadkari also went to pay a visit to the Sri Sigandur Chowdeshwari Ji Temple in Shivamogga. He was accompanied by Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, and New and Renewable Energy, Pralhad Joshi and BS Yediyurappa.

President Donald Trump’s decision to send “billions of dollars” worth of weapons to Ukraine via NATO could prove a game-changer in Kyiv’s 40-month-old war against Russian aggression.\n\nThe prez on Monday also announced 100% “secondary tariffs” targeting Moscow if it fails to agree to a cease-fire within 50 days.\n\nIt’s a terrific combination.\n\nRussia’s been stepping up its attacks, including on civilian areas, Ukraine is running short of weapons and its ability to fight back is worsening. And the sanctions could break Russia’s economy.\n\nTrump didn’t provide details on the precise types of weapons for Kyiv, but he did say it’ll get a “full complement” of “the best” available.\n\nMatt Whitaker, the US ambassador to NATO, said the short-term plan was to send defensive systems, like the Patriot batteries that can take out Russian missiles.\n\nBut Ukraine will also get offensive weapons, including long-range missiles that can reach far into Russia territory, Axios reports. The Russian public, and Putin himself, will feel the consequences.\n\nBest of all, NATO countries will be paying the bill — with proceeds going to US manufacturers for weapons they produce. Sweet.\n\nTrump’s secondary tariffs can also help squeeze Russia, depriving it of revenue to fund its war — though giving Putin 50 days is generous.\n\n“It’s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil. It really is going to dramatically impact the Russian economy,” explains Whitaker.\n\nCongress, too, has been moving ahead with a bill to impose sanctions, including a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy.\n\nAgain, sanctions are key: Russia’s already facing dire economic pain; the prospect of another hit to its economy will help pressure Putin to work out a cease-fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the mystery of who halted US weapons shipments to Ukraine a couple of weeks ago grows deeper.\n\nWork on the shipments Trump announced Monday reportedly began months ago. Why order a pause in current shipments knowing more would be coming soon?\n\nNote, too, that some of Trump’s aides oppose US aid to Ukraine; did they halt the shipments without his OK — and despite emerging plans to provide additional weapons?\n\nUndersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby reportedly made the call; if he and/or Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did so without the commander-in-chief’s knowledge, the president ought to demand their resignation. Underlings cannot be allowed to make decisions like that on their own.\n\nFortunately, Team Trump is now on the right course.\n\nThe sooner Ukraine gets the weapons it needs and new sanctions hit Russia, the sooner Putin will feel pressed to make a deal.","summary":"President Trump’s decision to send “billions of dollars” worth of weapons to Ukraine via NATO could prove a game-changer in Kyiv's 40-month-old war against Russian aggression.
