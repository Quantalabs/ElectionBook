Josh Shapiro a ‘highly overrated Jewish Governor.’ ‘It is Antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of “dual loyalty,” said White House Principal Deputy Communications Director Herbie Ziskend in a statement issued to reporters. ‘President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat Antisemitism – and hate and bigotry of all kind,’ he said, in a comment that did not mention Trump specifically or explicitly identify the posting that prompted it. It came after Trump tore into Shapiro for his speech at the Democratic National Convention, while identifying him by his religion and criticizing Harris and claiming she ‘hates’ Israel . ‘The highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, made a really bad and poorly delivered speech talking about freedom and fighting for Comrade Kamala Harris for President, yet she hates Israel and will do nothing but make its journey through the complexities of survival as difficult as possible, hoping in the end that it will fail. Judge only by her actions! ‘ ‘Yet Shapiro, for strictly political reasons, refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had. I have done more for Israel than any President, and frankly, I have done more for Israel than any person, and it’s not even close. Shapiro has done nothing for Israel, and never will. Comrade Kamala Harris, the Radical Left Marxist who stole the nomination from Crooked Joe, will do even less. Israel is in BIG trouble!’ Trump’s statement tried to stir the pot on a complex and controversial issue after Shapiro did not get into Middle East politics during his convention speech. Instead, he tried to link Harris’ gauzy ‘freedom’ agenda to the nation’s early principles and patriots. ‘“E Pluribus Unum” You recognize this phrase from U.S. coins and the nation’s seal – out of many, one – it’s not merely a motto from the past, it’s our direction for the future. You see, you all give me hope and you all have the power,’ said Shapiro. The charismatic governor who got passed over for Tim Walz after being on Harris’ vice presidential short list , declared in Philadelphia when Harris announced Tim Walz as her running mate, ‘I am proud of my faith.’ Trump blasted out the statement on Truth Social at 12:09 AM, while Democrats were wrapping up Day Three of a convention featuring testimonials by Oprah Winfrey and Bill Clinton. It has more than 4,000 reposts and 15,000 likes. Asked why Trump identified Shapiro by his faith, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said ‘Kamala Harris talks out of both sides of her mouth to appease Hamas sympathizers while Democrats have emboldened antisemitic protests on college campuses. In contrast, President Trump has stood firmly with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, reaching many historic achievements like the Abraham Accords, moving the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, eliminating Qasem Soleimani, ending the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal, as well as combatting anti-Semitism in America and abroad.’ Trump’s comments came at a convention that has seen clashes and protests on the periphery, but not the major disruptions that organizers have feared. Protesters tried to unfurl a banner on the first day of the convention, and on Tuesday pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with police. The National Lawyers Guild said 72 people were arrested. The convention featured emotional testimony by parents of 23-year old American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from Israel. And ‘uncommitted’ delegates complained Wednesday that their request for a Palestinian convention speaker had been denied. Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

However, the court denied the portion of the RNC’s request to prohibit voters from participating in the presidential election or by mail unless they provide proof of citizenship. The RNC’s request emerged from a dispute over the 2022 Arizona law that would have required county officials to verify any person registering to vote via a federal form or state form is a US citizen. That means new voters would need to include their birth certificate or passport. A group of plaintiffs including voting rights groups, Democrats and the government challenged the law arguing that the National Voting Registration Act overrides the 2022 law. Citing a 2013 precedent, the government said, “A State violates the Act by rejecting a federal form on the ground that the voter failed to submit documentary proof of citizenship along with it. The Act thus preempts Arizona’s requirement that voters who register with the federal form submit documentary proof in order to vote for President or vote by mail.” A district court sided with the plaintiffs but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a partial ruling in favor of the RNC – allowing the voter ID requirement for state voting registrations to move forward. Among the GOP’s arguments included raising concerns over the Purcell principle – a precedent that states courts should not change election results too close to an election because it can be confusing. The RNC asked the Supreme Court to issue a decision before August 22. The 5-4 decision arrived in the form of an unsigned order – as typical for cases on the emergency docket – and did not provide any explanation for the decision. It noted that Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have granted the RNC its full request while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the request in full. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not indicate how they would have voted. The 2022 Arizona voter ID law was undoubtedly inspired by the unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the swing state made by former president Donald Trump and his allies after the 2020 election. The ramifications of Trump’s accusations are palpable. Republicans in the state have enacted sweeping changes to the state’s voting process. Disputes over election laws and other voting measures, like in Arizona, are likely to be a recurring theme at the court in the near future.","summary":"New law will require people registering to vote through a state form to provide proof of their citizenship","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/arizona-voter-citizenship-supreme-court-b2600533.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/22/21/GettyImages-1244608672.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:54:34","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.373},{"id":254719852,"title":"Significant development in search for Arizona man who threatened to assassinate Donald Trump","text":"Arizona cops have arrested a man accused of threatening to assassinate Donald Trump. Ronald Syrvud, 66, was apprehended Thursday evening, around seven hours after Cochise County Sheriff’s Office issued a wanted notice for him at about 2:30pm local time. ‘This subject has been taken into custody without incident in Cochise County. We appreciate all of the information received and the incredible collaborative efforts with all of our public safety partners,’ the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Police previously said Syvrud has several other warrants out for his arrest on separate charges, including for a DUI and failure to appear in court in Wisconsin, and for failure to register as a sex offender and felony hit and run in Arizona. It comes six weeks after an attempt on Trump’s life saw a bullet hit the former president’s ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Sheriff Mark Dannels had ramped up security in the area around the section of border wall Trump was visiting as the the search went on for Syvrud. Records show that he was a registered Democrat in the past, and owns a long rap sheet dating back to 1990 – including a conviction in 2000 for second degree sexual assault of a child, where he pleaded no contest. The exact nature of the threats is unclear, however Sheriff Dannels told DailyMail.com they were received ‘off social media.’ ‘We have zero tolerance for any kind of threats or intents of violence, so we’ll find him. He’ll go to jail,’ Dannels said. ‘He’s a registered sex offender here in Cochise County, and we were looking for him. He’s out of compliance as part of his violations. So we’re looking for him on that. ‘We’re going to arrest him on that. But also the fact his pulse was obviously directed toward this event. So we want to talk to him about that.’ As Dannels added that security was being ramped up ahead of the speech, Secret Service snipers could be seen perched on a crane surveying the area.

The Secret Service swarmed around the 45th US President as piercing screams were heard from the MAGA crowd. He then got to his feet with blood pouring down his cheek and raised his fist in the air and defiantly shouted ‘fight’ while the audience shouted ‘USA’ as he was dragged off stage and bundled into a vehicle. Secret Service agents could be heard shouting ‘the shooter is down’ in the ensuing chaos and the gunman was later confirmed dead.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nArizona cops have arrested a man accused of threatening to assassinate Donald&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Significant development in search for Arizona man who threatened to assassinate Donald Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/significant-development-in-search-for-arizona-man-who-threatened-to-assassinate-donald-trump-2/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724367126_rewrite-this-title-Huge-update-in-hunt-for-Arizona-man.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:52:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.052},{"id":254719736,"title":"Trump vows to impose ‘tough new sentences’ on illegal migrant criminals – including death penalty for sex traffickers","text":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to impose stiff punishments – including the death penalty – on illegal migrants found guilty of committing heinous crimes. “We will impose tough new sentences on illegal alien criminals, including 10-year mandatory minimum sentences for anyone found guilty of human smuggling; a guaranteed life sentence for any one found guilty of child trafficking; and a death penalty for anyone guilty of child or woman sex trafficking,” Trump said at a news conference in Cochise County, Ariz., just steps from the US-Mexico border. “We’ll also impose the death penalty on major drug dealers and traffickers,” the 78-year-old former president added. Trump also called for capital punishment for anyone convicted of killing “police, sheriffs, border patrol, ICE or law enforcement officials.” “The death penalty with a quicker trial,” the Republican presidential nominee said, “not a trial that lasts for 15 years and everyone gets exhausted.” “The amount of injuries sustained in fights and shootings is just incredible,” Trump said of the difficult and dangerous job law enforcement authorities face guarding the southern border. Trump, flanked by law enforcement officials and family members of migrant crime victims, toured the remnants of sections of a border wall he approved during his presidency that was never erected once the Biden administration took control of the project. The former president inspected the piles of steel sitting in the Arizona sun, seemingly rusting from neglect. “It could have been put up in a matter of weeks. It was all set to go,” Trump said of the heaps of metal. “It’s the ‘Rolls-Royce’ of walls,” he said, lamenting that President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “refused to put it up.” “That’s when I first realized they wanted open borders,” Trump explained, claiming that much of unused paneling “has been sold for five cents on the dollar.” Grieving ‘Angel Moms’ Back Trump Patty Morin’s 37-year-old daughter, Rachel, was brutally murdered on a Bel Air, Md., jogging trail last year. A 23-year-old illegal migrant from El Salvador – suspected of other heinous crimes – allegedly killed the mother of five before stuffing her body in a drain pipe. Speaking at the news conference, Patty expressed strong support for Trump’s plan to seal the border and crack down on migrant crime. “We are 1,800 miles from the border,” Patty noted. “And because of this open border, we’ve had two [cases] in the same county where illegal immigrants have come in and raped and murdered our citizens.” “I really want our words to be heard,” she pleaded. “We’re here because we are losing our moms, our daughters, our children to criminals – and that shouldn’t happen.” “This is a very very important issue,” Patty said of border security. “One that is going to make or break our country.” Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn, who police say was assaulted and murdered by illegal migrants in Houston, also spoke in support of Trump’s border policies. “There were over 300 detention beds they should have been at,” Nungaray said of the two alleged killers, one of whom was wearing an ICE ankle bracelet at the time of the crime. “They were detained and released when they shouldn’t have been released,” she argued. “We are losing very innocent people to heinous crimes that shouldn’t be happening in the first place,” Nungaray fumed. What Other Republicans are Saying Republican Vice Presidential nominee JD Vance spoke at a news conference in Georgia, just minutes before Trump’s border speech, touting the former president’s proposed agenda. “Donald Trump believes that we ought to make our law enforcement lives easier by closing down that southern border and getting the drug cartels out of our communities,” the Ohio senator said. He also warned changes to immigration laws backed by some Democrats and Republicans over the summer but opposed by Trump, would codify policies such as “catch and release.” “This is where a person comes into our country, they claim asylum, and then they’re released into our country with no follow up. Sometimes they don’t come back for five years. Sometimes they don’t come back for 10 years,” Vance said. “Kamala Harris and Joe Biden implemented catch and release through executive order, their so called border security package would have made catch and release the law of the land. So even if you have a guy like Donald Trump come in, he can’t undo it,” he added. Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, speaking on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention Thursday, told reporters that he found it amusing that the Democratic gathering was surrounded by barrier to keep protesters out. “I’m grateful that Democrats appear to now agree with Donald Trump’s policy of building a wall,” Ramaswamy quipped. “If only they cared as much about keeping illegals out of our country as they do keeping their own left wing protesters out of their own convention, our border crisis would actually be behind us.”","summary":"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed to impose stiff punishments, including the death penalty, on illegal migrants found guilty of committing heinous crimes.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/us-news/trump-vows-to-impose-tough-new-sentences-on-illegal-migrant-criminals/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-hen1tsyg8-1724367031534.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724352656&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:51:00","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":254719590,"title":"MTA boss ‘thrilled’ Kathy Hochul eyeing lower congestion toll after NY gov indefinitely paused controversial scheme","text":"MTA boss Janno Lieber and Manhattan lawmakers are “thrilled” that Gov. Kathy Hochul will propose a plan by year’s end to fund the MTA’s massive capital program that could include a lower “congestion” toll to enter Midtown. The governor shelved the unpopular $15 fee in June, but The Post earlier this week reported she’s floating a plan — for after the pivotal November election — that would include a lower toll to enter Manhattan south of 59th Street with exemptions for some city employees who commute into the zone. “It’s good news that the governor continues to focus on this issue,” Lieber, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s chairman and CEO said during a press event Thursday. “I’m also thrilled she’s talking about the [2025] legislative session” to address MTA financing, Lieber said, adding, “Private conversations are underway.” Lieber said in June that he was blindsided when Hochul surprisingly reversed course — just weeks before the $15 toll would be implemented — by calling for a “pause” in the program, claiming it was too costly for motorists still struggling with inflation post-pandemic. Hochul denied reports that she postponed congestion pricing because it would hurt New York Democrats running for House seats in swing suburban districts. But critics argued Thursday the renewed discussions of implementing the program with a lower toll prove Hochul’s pause was a gimmick to help Democrats in the fall elections. “This is a disgrace. Governor Hochul has now made it clear that she paused the Congestion Pricing Tax solely for political reasons,” said Susan Lee, president of New York Against Congestion Pricing Tax, and a Manhattan Chinatown business owner. “It had nothing to do with New Yorkers struggling to pay bills,” Lee added. “Is it any wonder that voters have lost faith in their elected leaders?” Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-Staten Island/Brooklyn) said, “Any elitist congestion pricing tax on my constituents to keep them out of Manhattan while shifting pollution and traffic to the outer boroughs is unacceptable.” She claimed the Biden-Harris administration broke federal law when they “rubber-stamped” congestion pricing and said the best way to kill it is to re-elect former President Donald Trump to the White House. “New Yorkers who oppose congestion pricing must vote accordingly. President Trump publicly committed to stop this cash grab on our working class,” Malliotakis said. Assemblyman Michael Tannousis, the Staten Island Republican Party chairman, said the toll should be “permanently suspended.” “This is just another tax that will encourage New Yorkers to flee the state for more affordable places,” Tannousis said. Congestion pricing came up Thursday after an event where Lieber and the MTA announced completion of three new elevators providing access from the street to the Sixth Avenue’s L train platform and the uptown F/M platform, as part of the 14th Street complex megaproject. State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, who was at the event in his Manhattan district, said he appreciated the governor’s concern about the “sticker shock” of a $15 toll for government employees — teachers, cops, firefighters, ambulance crews and sanitation workers — who work in the zone south of 59th Street. “But we need congestion pricing,” Hoylman-Sigal said. The MTA has already contracted or spent $500 million to install tolling technology and plate readers along the local highways and roadways to implement the new fee, Hoylman-Sigal noted. Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, who represents lower Manhattan, said, ” “I know [Hochul] is committed to finding an appropriate replacement, which may be a combination of a slightly lower toll and some additional state commitments.” Glick said it was important to provide the MTA the necessary financing to upgrade and expand mass transit as well as keep existing infrastructure in good repair. Hochul, during an interview with Politico she gave this week while attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, did not dispute that a lower toll is on the table. Congestion pricing remains highly unpopular. A Siena College poll released last week found 59% of New York voters want to scrap the scheme for Manhattan entirely. Two lawsuits were filed in Manhattan state Supreme Court last month claiming Hochul did not have the authority to stymie a state law approved by ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo enacting congestion pricing in 2019. Other lawsuits filed by the teachers’ union and other opponents have sought to block the toll. “Regardless of any rumors coming from unnamed sources, Governor Hochul’s position has not changed and congestion pricing continues to be paused indefinitely. Like the majority of New Yorkers, Governor Hochul believes a $15 daily toll is just too much for working people trying to get by in today’s economy,” Hochul spokesman John Lindsay said in a statement Thursday.“That’s why, as the Governor has repeatedly said in public, she is exploring multiple options with legislative leaders to fund transit as the pause continues.”","summary":"MTA boss Janno Lieber and Manhattan lawmakers are \"thrilled\" that Gov.

But in just over a week since Musk released the latest and most capable version of his AI generator — which he billed as “the most fun AI in the world!” in a post on X. It’s also widely available: Anyone who pays to use X can access Grok and images are generated directly within the service with simple prompts. And though the platform bars nudity and explicit content, many images nevertheless are sexually suggestive and degrading — with most of those being targeted at Harris, who is generally depicted in revealing outfits. But not all are so salacious. A surprising proliferation of content shows Trump and Harris not just getting along — but being deeply in love and sharing a happy family. Videos of the presidential opponents tenderly kissing, strolling hand-in-hand on a sunset beach, canoodling babies together, or rubbing Harris’ pregnant belly, turn up almost as frequently across X as the scenes of violence, depravity, and animosity between the two. Some even manage to blend both the harmony and the chaos. A series of images produced by X user “Luffy” show Trump and Biden smiling and playing the guitar together — and also laughing over loads of hard drugs and heavy weapons in their arms.","summary":"The images are clearly a fake — for now.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/us-news/elon-musks-grok-ai-is-flooding-social-media-fake-images-of-trump-and-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88143398.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VUDhBFL2-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:39:50","author":"Alex Oliveira","authors":["Alex Oliveira"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.266},{"id":254719098,"title":"Amy Coney Barrett Breaks With Supreme Court Over Granting Republicans' Wish","text":"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett broke from her fellow conservative justices about whether to hand Republicans a victory in a key voting rights case out of Arizona on Thursday.The court issued an order related to a case raised by the Republican National Committee asking the justices to block a lower-court order that blocked enforcement of a 2022 law that would bar registered voters who have not previously provided proof of citizenship from voting in presidential elections, or by mail in any federal elections.Arizona, which is viewed as a swing state in the 2024 presidential race, is home to a key Senate race and two battleground congressional races. It was viewed as Republican-leaning for much of the 2000s and 2010s but has drifted toward Democrats recently, with President Joe Biden narrowly carrying the state in 2020.Ultimately, in a 5-4 vote, the court granted part of the stay filed by the RNC while rejecting other parts. It will allow Arizona election officials to reject new voter registration forms that do not include proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or a passport.But it rejected part of the request that sought to block Arizonans already registered to vote but have not provided proof of citizenship from voting in federal elections or by mail.Had the court granted that part of the request, it could have blocked tens of thousands of Arizonans from voting in the upcoming presidential election.Presently, Arizonans must have proof of citizenship to vote in statewide elections. However, proof of citizenship is not required to vote in federal races, including the presidential and congressional elections. The challenge stems from a 2022 law passed in Arizona requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections, but that law has not been enforced.A majority of justices agreed to partially grant the request. But Barrett, a conservative appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, along with the bench's three liberal justices, supported completely rejecting the request, according to the order.\"Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Barrett, and Justice Jackson would deny the application in full,\" the order reads.Newsweek reached out to the Supreme Court for comment via email.Barrett at times has been viewed as a more moderate voice among the court's conservatives. For instance, she disagreed with the other Republican-appointed justices on aspects of Trump's immunity case.She voted to grant him immunity for official acts but said she disagreed with one part of the ruling that held the Constitution prevents protected conduct from being introduced as evidence in a criminal prosecution against a former president.In June, she sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Republican-led states, writing that they lack standing to sue administration officials over social media platforms' content moderation decisions regarding COVID-19 misinformation.Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded to the Supreme Court's decision in a statement released Thursday.\"Following the Supreme Court's decision, Arizona's law requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration is reinstated,\" the statement reads. \"Counties will reject new state forms missing documented proof of citizenship. Voters may still register using the National Mail Voter Registration Form, which requires an attestation of citizenship under penalty of perjury.\"My concern is that changes to the process should not occur this close to an election, it creates confusion for voters. We respect the Court's decision and will implement these changes while continuing to protect voter access and make a voting simple process.\"RNC Chairman Michael Whatley celebrated the decision in a statement.\"This is a major victory for election integrity that upholds a simple principle: American elections must be decided by American citizens,\" the statement said. \"While Democrats have worked to undermine basic election safeguards and make it easier for non-citizens to vote, we have fought tooth and nail to preserve citizenship requirements, see the law enforced, and secure our elections. The Supreme Court has sided with the RNC, and the American people, to protect the vote in November.\"","summary":"Barrett agreed with the Supreme Court's liberal justices in a case surrounding an Arizona voting law.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/amy-coney-barrett-breaks-supreme-court-arizona-voting-law-1943231","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2456366/supreme-court-justice-amy-coney-barrett.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:37:56","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":254719198,"title":"Search for man who allegedly made threats against Donald Trump","text":"Ronald Syvrud, a resident of Arizona, reportedly made threats to harm Trump through various social media posts in recent weeks, as stated by Cochise County public information officer Carol Capas.

Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. Can Harris win on good vibes alone? By Jonathan Allen CHICAGO — For now, Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is running on vibes, and many Democrats hope she can ride them to victory on Election Day. That may mean she will try to avoid laying out a comprehensive policy plan for the country. Whether she can do that and still win remains an open question. In the month since President Joe Biden stepped aside, Harris has offered a ton of talk about joy, vision and values, but very little in the way of detailed plans. The Democratic Party’s platform, released Sunday, didn’t change as a result of the switch at the top of the ticket. On the campaign trail, Harris has unveiled a handful of proposals that are largely retreads or souped-up versions of items on Biden’s wish list — among them, a 28% corporate tax rate, a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, an expanded tax credit of up to $6,000 for the first year of a child’s life. The latter two could create inflationary pressures at a time when Harris is promising to keep prices low. But Harris and her campaign team aren’t saying anything about a broader plan to bolster the economy or national security. At a roundtable with reporters this week, hosted by Bloomberg News, Harris policy adviser Brian Nelson repeatedly said he didn’t want to “get ahead of the vice president” when pressed for details of her agenda. “I think, you know, fundamentally she’s going to continue to do sort of more specific policy initiatives with a lot of detail behind them as she builds out this picture for her vision of the future both in the economy and domestic policy,” Nelson said. At the same event, longtime Harris policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu suggested that the Harris campaign would rather draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump and the “Project 2025” agenda he has disavowed than put down its own map of her plans. “The questions about even what voters want to hear in terms of her work over her career, her time as vice president and then moving forward may sound a little bit different than our traditional sort of longer-term campaigns that have had, you know, these huge apparatuses,” Kosoglu said. “On the opposing side, there’s a Project 2025 out there, and people also need to understand what’s in those 900 pages. What does it mean for their everyday life?” Harris campaign aides have said that she will not propose a single-payer, universal health insurance program — “Medicare for All” — as she once did and that she now opposes a fracking ban she once supported. Harris has yet to sit down for a major interview since she became the Democratic standard-bearer, so it may be some time before she is pushed to fill in her vision with more specifics — and do so in her own words, rather than through statements issued by campaign aides. There are risks to offering too few details and to offering too many of them. Democrats have tried to make Project 2025 an anchor on Trump. But given a short window to get to know Harris better, voters may not be willing to hold their breaths and hope that she will deliver what they want if she’s not willing to make hard promises on policy. Only time will tell whether she feels compelled to do that — and whether she will be rewarded or rejected if she doesn’t. Harris prepares for history-making convention speech By Yamiche Alcindor CHICAGO — Harris is set to deliver what is arguably the biggest speech of her life Thursday night, when she will make history as the first Black woman and first Asian American person to accept a major party’s nomination for president. Harris intends to focus her speech on three areas: sharing her personal and professional background, contrasting her vision for America with the one offered by former President Donald Trump and rooting her vision in “a deep and abiding sense of patriotism,” according to a campaign official, who requested anonymity to share details about the remarks. The speech will be one of her most significant opportunities to define herself since she took over the top of the ticket from Biden last month. She has been crafting the speech over the past two weeks, making trips to Howard University in Washington, D.C. — her alma mater — for both debate preparation and speechwriting sessions, two sources familiar with her preparations said. One person familiar with the speech preparations said Harris plans to dedicate the early part of her speech to praising Biden. Harris also plans to connect her policy proposals with her middle-class upbringing, including talking about plans for issues like taking on price gouging, lowering rent and helping first-time homebuyers, the two sources familiar with the speech said. A former aide familiar with the speech preparations said Harris’ team has also been cautious about how they will incorporate talking about race and gender while understanding that it will be important to acknowledge the history-making position Harris is in. The speech will focus on why Harris is qualified to be president, detailing, among other areas, her time as a lawyer and the types of cases she handled. ?️The lineup: Prior to Harris, several other prominent Democrats are slated to speak on the fourth and final night of the convention. They include: Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords; Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Roy Cooper of North Carolina; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Rep. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida; former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; and state Reps. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, also known as the “Tennessee Three.” In addition, Democratic candidates in key Senate races are on the schedule: Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; and Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. But as Henry J. Gomez and Bridget Bowman note, the party’s two most vulnerable Senate Democrats — Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — are skipping the convention. Alex Seitz-Wald also reports that a number of progressive lawmakers and officials, as well the United Auto Workers, have called on Democrats to reverse their decision not to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot. ?

Follow along with tonight’s speeches on our live blog → Trump says he will make ‘provisions’ for mixed-status families but doesn’t rule out separations with mass deportations By Garrett Haake, Jake Traylor and Alexandra Marquez SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — Trump on Thursday said the cost to deport millions of undocumented immigrants is justified and would not rule out separating families that are compromised of citizens and immigrants. “It’ll cost trillions of dollars to keep these people, and I’m talking about in particular, starting with the criminals,” Trump told NBC News in an interview during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. “That’s costing us a lot more than deporting. But we have no choice, regardless, we have no choice, we’re going to have to deport.” When pressed, Trump provided no details on how he would pay for his plan, which could cost billions of dollars to implement at scale. Trump spent much of his first term fighting with Congress to give him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an expensive undertaking that the legislative branch never agreed to fund. Ultimately, he took the money from other parts of the Pentagon budget. Asked whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who are part of mixed-status families, like those married to American citizens or those who are parents to American citizens, Trump said: “Provisions will be made, but we have to get the criminals out.” That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

To see the excitement of the students and their dedication to make a difference and pursue justice is inspiring.” Hutchinson served two terms as Arkansas governor and ran for the Republican presidential nomination before dropping out in January.

As the New York Times reported in 2016, Trump still refused to walk back the lie for years despite the matter of Obama's birth being settled. At the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner, when Trump was in attendance, Obama singled him out for ridicule. \"There's a rumor floating around that I think could really hurt Mitt Romney. I heard he passed universal healthcare when he was governor of Massachusetts! Someone should get to the bottom of that. And I know just the guy to do it: Donald Trump! Now I know that he's taken some flack lately, but no one is happier — no one is prouder — to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,\" Obama said. \"And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter.

Ronald Syrvud, 66, was apprehended Thursday evening, around seven hours after Cochise County Sheriff's Office issued a wanted notice for him at about 2:30pm local time. 'This subject has been taken into custody without incident in Cochise County. We appreciate all of the information received and the incredible collaborative efforts with all of our public safety partners,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. Police previously said Syvrud has several other warrants out for his arrest on separate charges, including for a DUI and failure to appear in court in Wisconsin, and for failure to register as a sex offender and felony hit and run in Arizona. It comes six weeks after an attempt on Trump's life saw a bullet hit the former president's ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Sheriff Mark Dannels had ramped up security in the area around the section of border wall Trump was visiting as the the search went on for Syvrud. Records show that he was a registered Democrat in the past, and owns a long rap sheet dating back to 1990 - including a conviction in 2000 for second degree sexual assault of a child, where he pleaded no contest. The exact nature of the threats is unclear, however Sheriff Dannels told DailyMail.com they were received 'off social media.' 'We have zero tolerance for any kind of threats or intents of violence, so we'll find him. He'll go to jail,' Dannels said.

J.D. Vance (R-OH) mocked as “childless cat ladies” before becoming former President Donald Trump’s running mate. The Democratic National Convention has elevated female leaders of the party, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to former first lady Michelle Obama, in each night of programming, all while nodding to the historic significance of nominating Vice President Kamala Harris, the first black woman to lead a major party ticket. But Democrats have also continued to latch on to the controversial remarks of Vance, in which he disparaged the party as being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies.” The label has been celebrated throughout the four days of festivities, with delegates proudly wearing pins and hats with the phrase emblazoned on it and cheering as speakers including legendary talk show host Oprah Winfrey mentioned it in their convention addresses. “When a house is on fire, we don’t ask about the homeowner’s race or religion,” Winfrey said on the third night. “We don’t wonder who their partner is or how they voted, no. We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too.” Vance has said his remarks were taken out of context, specifically that he was not mocking those women who are unable to conceive. But in the lead-up to the convention, social media content creators spun Vance’s comments into memes, while the Trump campaign endured a dayslong news cycle focused on the remark. “The cat ladies of America are united, OK? This went right back in their face,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said while speaking to the New York delegation on Monday. Many delegates were delighted to revel in the mockery, part of the political honeymoon the party has enjoyed since President Joe Biden agreed to drop out of the 2024 race. “It’s so fun to watch as they make these ridiculous comments and Democrats come back with empowering videos on social media — I love seeing all the swag of cats on a blue wave,” said Kelly Green, a delegate from Philadelphia. As Democrats prepare to wrap up the week in Chicago, the themes they’ve embraced during their gathering stand in stark contrast to the largely masculine programming from Republicans during their convention in Milwaukee last month. At that confab, Trump drew headlines for entering to a rendition of the song “It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World,” while the event also included hypermasculine theatrics from wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, who ripped off his shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance logo. “I was not involved in the programming decisions, but I think what we are showing is that our speakers really represent America, they represent the Democratic Party,” said Jason Rae, secretary of the Democratic National Committee, speaking with the Washington Examiner. “We are really trying to showcase some great talent.” On Thursday night, when Harris accepts the nomination and addresses the convention, many female delegates and elected officials on the floor will be clad in white, a nod to the women’s suffrage movement. “White is a symbol of solidarity — women showing not just our strength but our strength and our unity. Being of one accord when it comes to fighting for the rights of women — equal rights for women in every arena,” said Lottie Shackelford, chairwoman of the women’s caucus at the DNC. “To see that sea of white, it lets you know the importance of the moment, we are on the verge of making history.” Democratic women in Congress have often used their clothing to send a message. This past year, they wore white pantsuits, turtlenecks, and scarves in a sea of dark suits at the State of the Union address to draw attention to abortion access and reproductive care. They have also worn white as a form of solidarity and protest against Trump in the past. “Many of us want to let Kamala know that we’re there for her and we always remember that we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), who is in her 15th term in Congress. “This isn’t about us; it’s about the people who came before us, and hopefully we will be putting some things in place so that our daughters and granddaughters have a better chance than we had.” Over the last few election cycles, single women have demonstrated that they are the backbone of the Democratic Party. In CNN exit polls from the most recent midterm elections, single women supported the Democratic Party, 68% to 31% for Republicans. Never-married voters of both genders turn out at lower rates than their married or divorced counterparts, according to data from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Nevertheless, women are credited with propelling a wave of Democratic wins during the midterm elections in 2018. The group of voters was once again galvanized after the high court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022. This election will be the first presidential cycle since the Supreme Court overturned the ruling, and the week has been dominated by a focus on it, from morning delegate meetings to party panels in which women have shared their stories. In a post-Roe landscape, Democrats are counting on it to be a mobilizing factor that gets voters to the polls. “Women have become empowered as a result of the MAGA extremist movement and Trump’s nomination of three justices for the United States Supreme Court, who were confirmed, who then overturned Roe v. Wade,” said Gloria Allred, a renowned California-based attorney, speaking to the Washington Examiner. “Women, women of color, and young women, they are mad as hell, and they are not going to take it anymore, and a lot of men also, they care about their wives,” she said. Trump has attempted to attract female voters, too, as he runs for a second term in the White House. He is rejecting a national ban on abortion, in part, because it has jeopardized Republicans’ electoral prospects with suburban women. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER But Democratic leaders have attempted to frame the conversation over abortion into one about the Democrats being on the side of “freedom,” a frequent theme of Harris’s campaign. “When women are free to make their own decisions about their lives and to follow our dreams, we are unstoppable,” said Cecile Richards, a former Planned Parenthood leader, speaking to the convention on Wednesday.","summary":"CHICAGO — Democrats are working to energize a key demographic at their national convention: the women Sen.

Trump was in Arizona on Thursday, planning to visit the US-Mexico border and highlight his policy opposing illegal immigration. Shortly before he was scheduled to speak, the Cochise County sheriff’s office sent out an alert. Ronald Lee Syvrud “is being sought as an investigative lead for threats to kill a presidential candidate,” Sheriff Mark Dannels said in a Facebook post. The 66-year-old Syvrud’s last known address was in Benson, about 65km from Montezuma Pass, where Trump’s event was scheduled to be held. He was described as having outstanding warrants in Wisconsin for driving under the influence and failure to appear in court, as well as in Arizona for a hit-and-run and “failing to register as a sex offender.” The Wisconsin Department of Corrections lists Syvrud on their sex offender registry for “second-degree sexual assault of a child,” according to Fox News. When reporters asked Trump about the manhunt, he said no one had told him about it. “No, I have not heard that but I am not that surprised and the reason is because I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys,” said the former president. While it might be dangerous to be at the border, he added, “I have a job to do.” Trump was speaking at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13 when a gunman opened fire from a roof of a nearby building, clipping his ear and killing an audience member. Two more people were seriously wounded before a Secret Service counter-sniper killed the shooter. The Secret Service director eventually resigned because of the incident and the agency implemented tougher security protocols for Trump, including bulletproof glass barriers at his outdoor rallies.","summary":"A wanted sex offender in Arizona allegedly posted on social media about killing the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/602965-arizona-trump-threat-suspect/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.08/article/66c7b94d85f5404b09250876.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:24:24","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":254718560,"title":"Watch live: Final day of DNC in Chicago as Harris accepts nomination and delivers speech","text":"Watch live from the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where US vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris will give her acceptance speech.

By Jonathan Allen CHICAGO — For now, Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is running on vibes, and many Democrats hope she can ride them to victory on Election Day. That may mean she will try to avoid laying out a comprehensive policy plan for the country. Whether she can do that and still win remains an open question. In the month since President Joe Biden stepped aside, Harris has offered a ton of talk about joy, vision and values, but very little in the way of detailed plans. The Democratic Party’s platform, released Sunday, didn’t change as a result of the switch at the top of the ticket. On the campaign trail, Harris has unveiled a handful of proposals that are largely retreads or souped-up versions of items on Biden’s wish list — among them, a 28% corporate tax rate, a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers, an expanded tax credit of up to $6,000 for the first year of a child’s life. The latter two could create inflationary pressures at a time when Harris is promising to keep prices low. But Harris and her campaign team aren’t saying anything about a broader plan to bolster the economy or national security. At a roundtable with reporters this week, hosted by Bloomberg News, Harris policy adviser Brian Nelson repeatedly said he didn’t want to “get ahead of the vice president” when pressed for details of her agenda. “I think, you know, fundamentally she’s going to continue to do sort of more specific policy initiatives with a lot of detail behind them as she builds out this picture for her vision of the future both in the economy and domestic policy,” Nelson said. At the same event, longtime Harris policy adviser Rohini Kosoglu suggested that the Harris campaign would rather draw contrasts with former President Donald Trump and the “Project 2025” agenda he has disavowed than put down its own map of her plans. “The questions about even what voters want to hear in terms of her work over her career, her time as vice president and then moving forward may sound a little bit different than our traditional sort of longer-term campaigns that have had, you know, these huge apparatuses,” Kosoglu said. “On the opposing side, there’s a Project 2025 out there, and people also need to understand what’s in those 900 pages. What does it mean for their everyday life?” Harris campaign aides have said that she will not propose a single-payer, universal health insurance program — “Medicare for All” — as she once did and that she now opposes a fracking ban she once supported. Harris has yet to sit down for a major interview since she became the Democratic standard-bearer, so it may be some time before she is pushed to fill in her vision with more specifics — and do so in her own words, rather than through statements issued by campaign aides. There are risks to offering too few details and to offering too many of them. Democrats have tried to make Project 2025 an anchor on Trump. But given a short window to get to know Harris better, voters may not be willing to hold their breaths and hope that she will deliver what they want if she’s not willing to make hard promises on policy. Only time will tell whether she feels compelled to do that — and whether she will be rewarded or rejected if she doesn’t. Harris prepares for history-making convention speech By Yamiche Alcindor CHICAGO — Harris is set to deliver what is arguably the biggest speech of her life Thursday night, when she will make history as the first Black woman and first Asian American person to accept a major party’s nomination for president. Harris intends to focus her speech on three areas: sharing her personal and professional background, contrasting her vision for America with the one offered by former President Donald Trump and rooting her vision in “a deep and abiding sense of patriotism,” according to a campaign official, who requested anonymity to share details about the remarks. The speech will be one of her most significant opportunities to define herself since she took over the top of the ticket from Biden last month. She has been crafting the speech over the past two weeks, making trips to Howard University in Washington, D.C. — her alma mater — for both debate preparation and speechwriting sessions, two sources familiar with her preparations said. One person familiar with the speech preparations said Harris plans to dedicate the early part of her speech to praising Biden. Harris also plans to connect her policy proposals with her middle-class upbringing, including talking about plans for issues like taking on price gouging, lowering rent and helping first-time homebuyers, the two sources familiar with the speech said. A former aide familiar with the speech preparations said Harris’ team has also been cautious about how they will incorporate talking about race and gender while understanding that it will be important to acknowledge the history-making position Harris is in. The speech will focus on why Harris is qualified to be president, detailing, among other areas, her time as a lawyer and the types of cases she handled.

Mark Kelly of Arizona and his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords; Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Roy Cooper of North Carolina; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Rep. Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida; former GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; and state Reps. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson, also known as the “Tennessee Three.” In addition, Democratic candidates in key Senate races are on the schedule: Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; and Reps. Colin Allred of Texas, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. But as Henry J. Gomez and Bridget Bowman note, the party’s two most vulnerable Senate Democrats — Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio — are skipping the convention. Alex Seitz-Wald also reports that a number of progressive lawmakers and officials, as well the United Auto Workers, have called on Democrats to reverse their decision not to give a Palestinian American a speaking slot. ?

Follow along with tonight’s speeches on our live blog → Trump says he will make ‘provisions’ for mixed-status families but doesn’t rule out separations with mass deportations By Garrett Haake, Jake Traylor and Alexandra Marquez SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — Trump on Thursday said the cost to deport millions of undocumented immigrants is justified and would not rule out separating families that are compromised of citizens and immigrants. “It’ll cost trillions of dollars to keep these people, and I’m talking about in particular, starting with the criminals,” Trump told NBC News in an interview during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona. “That’s costing us a lot more than deporting. But we have no choice, regardless, we have no choice, we’re going to have to deport.” When pressed, Trump provided no details on how he would pay for his plan, which could cost billions of dollars to implement at scale. Trump spent much of his first term fighting with Congress to give him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an expensive undertaking that the legislative branch never agreed to fund. Ultimately, he took the money from other parts of the Pentagon budget. Asked whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who are part of mixed-status families, like those married to American citizens or those who are parents to American citizens, Trump said: “Provisions will be made, but we have to get the criminals out.” Read more → That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

(AP) — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced questions in a New York court Thursday about how his presidential campaign handled revelations that some people gathering signatures to get him on the state ballot concealed his name on the petitions and used other deceptive methods. Kennedy’s virtual appearance from an office in California came a day after his campaign announced that he will speak Friday about “his path forward.” The announcement fueled speculation that he could drop out of the race and support former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Testifying in a trial over a lawsuit backed by the Democratic National Committee that seeks to keep Kennedy off New York’s ballot, he acknowledged that his campaign submitted thousands of signatures gathered by a subcontractor despite knowing that some of its canvassers used deceptive tactics. The lawsuit alleges, among other claims of fraud, that the top of some petition sheets had been folded down, so the names of Kennedy and his vice presidential running mate, Nicole Shanahan, could not be seen, and only their little-known electors were visible. “I suppose I’m ultimately responsible for everything that happens in the campaign,” Kennedy said on the witness stand, pointing out that he wasn’t abreast of every detail involved in the subcontractor’s balloting efforts. When asked if he was ultimately responsible for the decision to submit the signatures, he said “Yes.” New York requires independent candidates to gather petitions with 45,000 signatures from potential voters to get on the ballot in the general election. Kennedy’s campaign ultimately managed to gather nearly three times that many on top of those gathered by the subcontractor. But an April complaint from a voter and a May New York Times article raised concerns about whether some people signing the petitions knew which candidate they had been asked to support. Kennedy’s staff was concerned, too. The day after the Times article was published, Kennedy’s campaign manager and daughter-in-law, Amaryllis Kennedy, said in an email to other staff that the questionable petitions gathered by the contractor should not be used. “We’re obviously pulling all of the petitions they’ve submitted and won’t use any of them as they are likely rife with other hidden errors, buried there to disqualify us once submitted,” she wrote. According to court documents, the campaign sued the subcontractor, arguing it had to pay them even though none of the signatures were usable. Kennedy said in news interviews at the time that no petitions from the subcontractor were submitted. But he acknowledged during his testimony that that’s not what actually happened. Instead, the campaign weeded out around 800 pages — containing 8,000 signatures — with visible creases indicating they’d been folded, putting them in two bankers boxes labeled “fraud box.” The campaign created an affidavit intended to “cure” the remaining petitions by having the canvassers affirm in writing that they hadn’t committed fraud and submitted over 12,000 signatures from the subcontractor as evidence of New York voters wanting to see him on the ballot. Lawyers for the plaintiffs however produced at least one example of a creased page that was submitted to the state instead of ending up in the “fraud box.” They also argued, and Kennedy acknowledged, that some canvassers had also verbally misrepresented what the signatures were for — for example, increasing candidate ballot access generally. The subcontractor did not immediately respond to a phone message and an email request for comment. A judge in a separate legal challenge has already barred Kennedy from appearing on New York’s ballot, though he has appealed. That suit had argued that Kennedy’s petitions were invalid because they listed him as living in New York when he actually resides in California with his wife, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Cheryl Hines. An appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments next week in that case. Kennedy is facing similar ballot challenges in several other states from Democrats and their allies.

After a week of Democrats’ most prominent figures rallying the party faithful, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept her party’s nomination for president during a speech in which she’s widely expected to offer her vision and policy agenda to the American people. The theme of the final night is “For Our Future,” according to convention organizers. Follow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: Here’s the Latest: ‘The answer is no’: Pro-Palestinian delegates say their request for a speaker at DNC was shut down Leaders of the “Uncommitted” movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands of votes in Democratic primaries across the nation in protest of the Israel-Hamas war, have been negotiating for weeks to secure a speaking slot for a Palestinian American at the DNC this week. The Uncommitted National Movement said Wednesday that a Democratic National Committee official delivered a firm response: “The answer is no.” In response, delegates decided to stage a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center and vowed to remain until their request is granted or the convention ends on Thursday night. The sit-in has exposed the most visible cracks in the Democratic Party during an otherwise energized week. The news came just a day after featuring the parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, igniting a firestorm of criticism from some on the left. More than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. ▶ Read more about the “Uncommitted” movement’s DNC shutout Will Beyoncé perform at the DNC tonight? The internet sure thinks so. Intense speculation that Beyoncé will make an appearance at the DNC has built to a frenzy in recent hours. The pop icon already gave Harris permission to use her hit song “Freedom” as a campaign anthem. But many have surmised that Beyoncé herself will make an appearance at the Democrats convention, pointing to a cryptic tweet by a top Harris aide, as well as an afternoon soundcheck inside the United Center that featured the Beyonce song “Cuff It.” An hour before festivities were set to kick off, White House political director Emmy Ruiz tweeted out an emoji of a bee, which some took as a reference to the Beyhive, a colloquialism for avid Beyoncé fans. Beyoncé isn’t the only star who was rumored to be making a surprise appearance. Some on social media postulated that Taylor Swift could appear, too. Live from the DNC, it could be one of your favorite online influencers Across this week’s convention, more than 200 online influencers, streamers and other social media personalities have been capturing and livestreaming their impressions of what’s going on. There’s the 12-year-old nicknamed “Knowa,” who’s posted with a swath of prominent Democrats and went head-to-head with Republican personalities like MyPillow founder Mike Lindell inside the convention hall. A veteran from rural North Carolina with more than 5 million TikTok followers proclaimed himself a “Hillbilly for Harris.” Other influencers and social media personalities are sharing everything from the food available at trucks outside the United Center to attendees’ thoughts on more serious issues, such the war in Gaza. The creators were invited to the DNC by convention organizers, a new but significant part of a digital strategy that aims to leverage the sizable followings of creators across platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Discord and Twitch, according to officials with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ campaign. They hope it will help Harris and running mate Tim Walz reach new voters who might not be following along with political news via traditional media. ▶ Learn more about Democrats’ influencer strategy Trump visits the US-Mexico border alongside victims of violent crime Trump ticked through a list of brutal crimes blamed on people who were living in the country illegally during a campaign event on the Arizona-Mexico border. Trump invited relatives of two victims to join him in front of the wall. Alexis Nungaray, whose 12-year-old daughter Jocelyn was killed in Houston, said the men charged with killing her should have been in immigration detention. She implored Americans to vote for Trump, saying he would get the border controlled. “Please, please, I really hope everybody can hear my pain,” she said. “He needs to be in office. We need better control. We need to stop this. We need to stop losing our littles.” Trump said Harris likes to talk about the future, calling out a central message she’s promoting at the Democratic convention, but the families joining him in Arizona, he said, “want to go back to the safe past.” Sudden fame for Tim Walz’s son focuses attention on challenges of people with learning disabilities “That’s my dad!” 17-year-old Gus Walz could be seen exclaiming Wednesday night during his father’s speech at the DNC. He stood, tears streaming down his face, and pointed to his father, the governor of Minnesota, who accepted the party nomination for vice president. Gus wept through much of the 16-minute speech, and took the stage with his family afterward, wrapping his dad in a tight bear hug, burying his face in his shoulder. The high school senior’s joy quickly went viral. He was still trending Thursday on X. And his newfound fame is focusing attention on the challenges of people with learning disabilities. His parents recently revealed to People magazine that Gus has ADHD, an anxiety disorder and something called a nonverbal learning disorder.

Sabrene Odeh, an uncommitted delegate from Washington, said that “it’s incredibly soul-crushing” to have their voices shut out of the convention. She said party leadership gave them a “flat out no” on Wednesday, leading the uncommitted delegates to spend the night outside the United Center in protest. “The lowest bar we could set is asking for a Palestinian American to speak,” said Asma Mohammed, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota. The delegates represent voters from several states who chose “uncommitted” during primary votes to protest President Joe Biden’s approach to the war in Gaza. Layla Elabed, a leader of the movement, said the goal was “not another bomb.” Trump criticizes Harris’ handling of border security Before his remarks, Trump began criticizing Harris’ record on immigration and border security, calling her “the worst vice president” as he walked and talked to a few locals near a fence. “She was the border czar. All of a sudden she is saying she is not the border czar,” he said. “There’s never a border in the whole world that’s leaked like this border.” Harris was tasked in March 2021 with tackling the “root causes” of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — Central America’s so-called “Northern Triangle” — but was not given the title of “border czar” or put in charge of border security. Trump’s motorcade has arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border near Sierra Vista, Arizona He plans to look at the fence with local law enforcement and border officials, then will speak to reporters. Trump sees border security, the issue that defined his first presidential campaign, as a major liability for Harris. Illegal border crossings reached record levels during the Biden-Harris administration, though they’ve ebbed more recently. Trump stepped out of his SUV wearing a suit and red tie and was talking to about a dozen people who greeted him, including several wearing law enforcement uniforms. In addition to it being the day of her DNC speech, Thursday is also Harris’ wedding anniversary Thursday isn’t just the biggest day of Kamala Harris’ political career as she accepts her historic presidential nomination. It’s also her 10th wedding anniversary with Doug Emhoff. Harris and Emhoff met on a blind date in 2013. In a speech Tuesday night, Emhoff recalled introducing himself in a rambling voicemail. “I remember I was trying to grab the words out of the air and just put them back in my mouth,” he said. Emhoff added that “Kamala saved that voicemail and she makes me listen to it on every anniversary.” CEO of Democratic-leaning think tank: ‘Folks don’t vote for 10-point plans’ Patrick Gaspard, the CEO of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, the large Democratic-leaning think tank, says Vice President Kamala Harris doesn’t need to roll out detailed policy plans to win in November. “Folks don’t vote for 10-point plans, if they did, we probably would have had President Warren emerge in that contest or Hillary Clinton’s campaign might be remembered differently,” Gaspard told reporters at a Bloomberg event at the Democratic National Convention. He said voters are more focused on values and their perceptions of whom candidates are fighting for. Said Gaspard: “It’s a vibes election, but guess what, every election for the last 200 years has been a vibes election. And that’s actually one of the reasons that I feel more confident today than I thought I could feel, at this point in the election.” Sen. Schumer talks about his hopes for Harris’ speech at the DNC Hours before Harris’ DNC speech, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he hoped “Kamala will talk about the aspirations of working families and what we, as Democrats, will do to help make their lives better.” He said he’d be listening specifically for efforts to reduce costs on housing, prescription drugs and groceries and to create new jobs, particularly green ones — all themes Harris has spoken about while campaigning around the country recently. “Talking about the aspirations of working families, what we can do to both lower costs and create ladders to give people greater income,” Schumer told a small group of reporters Thursday. Asked if it felt like Trump — rather than President Joe Biden — was the incumbent given how much the Democratic convention has focused on the former president, Schumer said Harris “will also talk about the danger of Trump winning again.” “The reason he’s mentioned so much is the great depth of the danger” Trump poses, Schumer said. “The feeling about the danger.” Police: It may have been mealworms, not maggots, that sickened hotel diner during the DNC Mealworms may have been what sickened a diner at a Chicago hotel earlier this week during the Democratic National Convention, the city’s police superintendent said Thursday. While the investigation continues, Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said clues point toward the foreign object being mealworms. “I’m not sure that those were maggots,” Snelling said when asked for an update on allegations of maggots being placed in food. “There was sawdust, so they were probably mealworms. They look the same. But that’s still under investigation.” Mealworms are common insects that have worm-like, yellow-to-brown colored bodies. They are the larval form of the mealworm beetle. Maggots are similar in appearance, but soft-bodied with white to transparent color. They are the larval stage of flies. Multiple female suspects entered the Fairmont Chicago, which was hosting a breakfast for delegates at the DNC and began placing “unknown objects” onto tables with food before leaving the area at around 6:45 a.m. Wednesday, police said. One person who ingested the food was treated by medical personnel and released at the scene, according to Chicago police. Shapiro responds to Trump calling him ‘the highly overrated Jewish Governor’ of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Donald Trump is “obsessed” with spewing hatred after the Republican nominee for president criticized Shapiro as “the highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Shapiro spoke Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention and said Trump “wants to take away our rights and our freedoms.” Trump’s missive on social media also said Shapiro had “refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had” and that “Shapiro has done nothing for Israel.” Asked about Trump’s statement by a reporter Thursday morning, Shapiro said “it’s clear over the last few years, Donald Trump is obsessed with me and obsessed with continuing to spew hate and division in our politics. He’s someone who has routinely peddled antisemitic tropes like this.” Shapiro has years of experience making Trump the focus of his rhetorical attacks, first as state attorney general and now as governor. The White House issued a statement, saying “it is antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” Senate’s top Democrat shrugs off possible political effect of protesters staging a sit-in outside DNC Asked about a small group of uncommitted delegates doing a sit-in because convention organizers haven’t including a pro-Palestinian voice among the speakers, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer recalled Vice President Kamala Harris saying when protesters interrupted her at a recent rally in Michigan that their disruptions might benefit Republican Donald Trump. “She said, ‘Be quiet unless you want to elect Trump,’” Schumer told a small group of reporters Thursday, ahead of the convention’s final evening. “We believe we need unity and there’s overwhelming — I have never seen such unity,” he said. “A small handful of people does not represent close to even a sliver of where the Democratic Party is right now.” Pressed on whether a pro-Palestinian voice should have a convention speaking spot, Schumer responded, “I think Kamala Harris has had a very diverse convention.” Chicago police say they’re not changing tactics and are ready for final night of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at DNC On Wednesday night, more than 2,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched peacefully past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered earlier. That demonstration came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests at a much smaller, unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Chicago. Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said the protest Wednesday night ended without arrests and that no one was injured. ▶ Read more about DNC protests Democrats are rounding out list of speakers for DNC’s final night before Harris takes the stage Among the politicians on tap are Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who was considered as a possible running mate for Harris, and his wife Gabby Giffords, a former representative who was nearly killed in a mass shooting in 2011. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive leader, is scheduled to speak as well. So is former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who became one of the few elected leaders of his party to oppose Donald Trump. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healy will also deliver remarks. And Tennessee state lawmakers Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson, the “ Tennessee Three, \" will speak. Jones and Pearson were expelled from the state Legislature for participating in a protest on gun control at the state Capitol. Chicago police superintendent says Wednesday night protest ended with no arrests and no one injured Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said the protest was pretty large though “not as large as we had necessarily anticipated.” Snelling praised organizers of the Wednesday protest, saying it’s an example of how people can hold First Amendment protected demonstrations peacefully by collaborating with law enforcement ahead of time. “Did we have a couple dustups? Sure, but those things were quickly rectified,” he said. Ramaswamy says media not giving enough coverage to Harris’ ‘policy deficits’ At a Thursday morning Trump campaign news conference in Chicago, Vivek Ramaswamy also blamed the media for what he characterized as lack of probative coverage of Harris’ policy proposals. “Many covered for Joe Biden’s cognitive deficits in the same way that I worry the media is now covering for Kamala Harris’ policy deficits, and Americans are left holding the bag both times over.” Ramaswamy also listed celebrities participating in this week’s DNC, portraying them as a distraction from the issues at stake in this campaign. “I see Oprah Winfrey. I see John Legend. I see Lil Jon,” Ramaswamy said. “Great — then still tell me what she stands for.” Trump says he plans to do a ‘LIVE PLAY BY PLAY’ on Truth Social of Harris’ speech at the DNC Trump has been largely quiet on the platform during convention programming, commenting mostly in interviews and events he’s been holding in battleground states. White House responds to Trump criticizing Shapiro as ‘the highly overrated Jewish’ governor of Pennsylvania The White House issued a statement on antisemitism the morning after Donald Trump criticized Josh Shapiro as “the highly overrated Jewish Governor of the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Trump wrote on social media that Shapiro had “refused to acknowledge that I am the best friend that Israel, and the Jewish people, ever had.” Herbie Ziskend, the White House principal deputy communications director, said “it is antisemitic, dangerous, and hurtful to attack a fellow American by calling out their Jewish faith in a derogatory way, or perpetuating the centuries-old smear of ‘dual loyalty.’” He added that “President Biden and Vice President Harris believe we must come together as Americans to condemn and combat antisemitism — and hate and bigotry of all kinds.” Trump’s allies are still counterprogramming against Harris’ policies as DNC wraps up At a news conference Thursday morning, Carlos Trujillo, who served as Trump’s ambassador to the Organization of American States, decried Biden-Harris administration policies that “completely eliminated” Trump-era immigration achievements. Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman who went from one of Trump’s GOP primary rivals to one of his most vocal surrogates, listed crime statistics for the city of Chicago. The DNC host city, Ramaswamy said, has been “ravaged and devastated … by rampant crime worsened by the effects of illegal mass migration to this country” he blamed on the Biden-Harris administration and the vice president specifically, due to her responsibilities related to the border. “From one kid of legal immigrants to this country to another, my message to her is, shame on you,” Ramaswamy said. Trump also said Democrats are spending more time at DNC talking about him than issues “It’s like they’re having a party. They don’t mention the border. All they do is make up lies about me,” the GOP presidential nominee complained as he called into “Fox & Friends” on Thursday morning. Trump is set to visit the southern border in Cochise County, Arizona, on Thursday as he continues to criticize the Biden administration’s border policies. He’s been spending the week campaigning across battleground states. Democrats on Wednesday night argued that they’re offering leadership on the U.S.-Mexico border, working toward policy solutions rather than simply demonizing immigrants and trying to use the issue as a political motivator for their base. Texas Rep. Veronica Escobar, from the border city of El Paso, said, “Forget what you hear on the news, I’m from there. … When it comes to the border, hear me when I say, you know nothing, Donald Trump.” Trump criticizes Democrats for linking him to Project 2025 Former President Donald Trump is taking issue with continued efforts by Democrats to tie him to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 at this week’s Democratic National Convention. Calling into “Fox and Friends” on Thursday ahead of the convention’s final night, Trump called the efforts “disgraceful.” “They know I have nothing to do with it. I had no idea what it was,” he said, despite the fact that the plan — which Trump and his campaign have repeatedly disavowed — was written by many longtime former staffers. “I have no idea what Project 2025 is.” He took particular issue with Democrats saying he would sign a federal abortion ban after appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. “I would never,” Trump said. “There will not be a federal ban. This is now back in the states where it belongs.” Trump also lashed out at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, who spoke at the convention Wednesday night, calling him a “total lightweight.” Dems gave freedom an expansive definition Wednesday night’s convention theme was “Freedom.” Backed by Beyoncé’s song of the same name, which the musician has authorized the Harris campaign to use, the word flashed on the video screen and in speech after speech at the United Center. Democrats firmly tied it to the fight over reproductive rights that went into overdrive after the fall of Roe v. Wade. But Democrats also used the freedom argument to slam Republicans on other social issues, from gay rights to the spread of book bans in schools. Hundreds of protesters rallied at park and train station on Democratic convention’s 3rd night More than 1,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched Wednesday past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered earlier. The demonstration, which stayed largely peaceful, came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests. As marchers passed under a new elevated train station near the United Center that was completed just before the DNC, officers were seen bringing a person to the ground on the platform above. In response, hundreds of protesters pushed against the edge of the station, banging on the glass with their hands and flag poles as they called on police to free the person. The person left through the station’s emergency exit moments later, accompanied by officers but not in handcuffs, prompting cheers from the crowd. ▶ Read more about Wednesday’s demonstrations","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Democratic National Convention kicks off its fourth and final night Thursday.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: New Update: Democrats prepare for Kamala Harris to give her acceptance speech at DNC first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/new-update-democrats-prepare-for-kamala-harris-to-give-her-acceptance-speech-at-dnc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-The-Latest-Democrats-gear-up-for-Kamala.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 22:00:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.275},{"id":254718590,"title":"Trump is still trying—and failing—to dodge Project 2025","text":"Beyond the energy at the Democratic National Convention, beyond its all-important TV ratings and the clear affection Democrats feel toward their presidential ticket, it seems that the one thing really getting under Donald Trump’s skin is Democrats tying him to Project 2025. “They know I have nothing to do with it,” Trump said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday, regarding the Heritage Foundation’s authoritarian agenda for a potential second Trump presidency. “A group of people got together,” he continued. “They drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some case, perhaps they went over the line. Perhaps they didn’t. I have no idea what Project 25 is, but they use it, and they know it.” And there’s a good reason he’s afraid for people to connect him to Project 2025. As Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at the DNC on Wednesday, Trump's campaign \"might not recover from\" from the public attention given Project 2025. Trump has been running from Project 2025 all summer. Even though a CNN review found at least 140 current or former members of Trump’s campaign and White House staff had worked on Project 2025, he claimed to know nothing about it. There’s a good reason for that too. A Navigator Research poll from July found that only 11% of voters held a favorable opinion of Project 2025, while 43% held an unfavorable opinion. Forty-six percent had no opinion. A big part of what’s gone on at the DNC has been informing those voters. On Monday, Michigan State Sen. Mallory McMorrow explained how the plan would “turn Donald Trump into a dictator.” On Wednesday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis also held up a jumbo-size printing of the plan as he talked about how it would affect our personal freedoms and enforce a strict Christian nationalist version of what constitutes a “family.” Also on Wednesday, longtime “Saturday Night Live” star Kenan Thompson followed up with examples of how the plan would impact individual lives. Appearing on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Buttigieg said that \"the biggest scandal of the year is a policy scandal,\" referring to Project 2025. “Most people say elections aren’t really about policy anymore,” said Buttigieg, “but if you think about it, the biggest scandal, the one that actually has the Republicans the most afraid, the one that has the president doing damage control, it’s not a criminal cover up, although they had one of those too. It’s not a sex tape. It’s the simple fact that they wrote down their own policies. That is the thing that they might not recover from.” And when people learn about Project 2025, they hate it. That same Navigator survey found that after voters read statements for and against Project 2025, 56% opposed the agenda. It’s no wonder that Trump is angry that people are talking about his ties to it. Now … let’s keep talking.","summary":"Beyond the energy at the Democratic National Convention, beyond its all-important TV ratings and the clear affection Democrats feel toward their presidential ticket, it seems that the one thing really getting under Donald Trump’s skin is Democrats tying him to Project 2025.\n\n\n\n“They know I have nothing to do with it,” Trump said on “Fox &amp; Friends” Thursday, regarding the Heritage Foundation’s authoritarian agenda for a potential second Trump presidency.\n\n\n\n“A group of people got together,” he continued. “They drew up some conservative values, very conservative values, and in some case, perhaps they went over the line.

Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) — a member of the Bipartisan House Task Force on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump — revealed the three countries linked to encrypted messaging accounts used by would-be Trump assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks. 'They need to be releasing information as they come across it, because this wasn’t an isolated incident.' Last month, Waltz said, \"Now, what we know, and this was on the briefing we just received, he had three encrypted overseas accounts the FBI is trying to get into.\" \"Well, we know that they were based in servers overseas,\" he added. \"And so you've got to work over there with the FBI liaisons overseas to start getting into them through their authorities.\" On Wednesday, Waltz informed reporters in Chicago: \"We still haven’t learned a lot. We haven’t learned that much about those overseas accounts. We do know that they were in, if I get this correctly, Belgium, New Zealand, and Germany.\" The House lawmaker asked, \"Why does a 19-year-old kid, who is a health care aide, need encrypted platforms not even based in the United States, but based abroad, where most terrorist organizations know it is harder for our law enforcement to get into? That’s a question I’ve had since day one.\" The FBI, Secret Service, and Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General are conducting their own investigations into the Trump assassination attempt. Waltz — who is retired from the U.S. Army Special Forces and is a former White House and Pentagon adviser — slammed the FBI and Secret Service for apparently withholding information regarding their investigations into last month's Trump assassination attempt at the campaign rally held in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"They need to be releasing information as they come across it, because this wasn’t an isolated incident,\" Waltz declared. \"The threats are continually Iran’s threats.\" Waltz — who serves on the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Oversight Committees — referenced the alleged murder-for-hire plot to assassinate Trump and other U.S. officials involving a Pakistani national with suspected ties to the Iranian government. Before the shooting, the National Security Council had reportedly warned the Secret Service and the Trump campaign that there were intelligence reports that Iran was actively plotting an assassination attempt on the former president. Iran rejected accusations that it had ambitions to assassinate Trump. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said Iran \"strongly rejects any involvement in the recent armed attack on Trump or claims about Iran’s intention for such an action.\" Kanaani continued, \"The Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to pursue legal action against Trump for his direct role in the crime of assassinating Martyr General Qassem Soleimani.\" Soleimani was the commander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ Quds Force and killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad in January 2020. The FBI reportedly was scheduled to brief the 13 members of the House task force on Wednesday. Waltz said he hopes the FBI will provide insight into the \"ridiculously flawed\" security detail at the Trump rally on July 13, 2024. Crooks accessed a roof just 130 yards from the stage where Trump delivered his campaign speech. The shooter was able to fire eight shots — including one that struck Trump in his right ear — before being neutralized. Crooks shot and killed 50-year-old Trump supporter and firefighter Corey Comperatore. Two other rallygoers — 54-year-old James Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch — were injured during the shooting.

Since its launch last week, Grok users have been churning out fake images of Trump — robbing a convenience store or flying a plane toward the Twin Towers. Others have depicted Harris pregnant with Trump’s baby, Musk as an overweight couch potato and former President George W. Bush snorting coke off his desk in the Oval Office. Some grisly deepfakes looked like the handiwork of kids — a blood-soaked Ronald McDonald brandishing a machine gun outside a Burger King or the Disney’s classic character Goofy committing a bloody murder with a hacksaw. Critics have blasted Musk and X for allowing the chatbot to launch with so few restrictions, citing risks ranging from misinformation to copyright infringement to harming kids. Harvard Law Cyberlaw Clinic instructor Alejandra Caraballo called the new software as “one of the most reckless and irresponsible AI implementations I’ve ever seen.” Thus far, Musk has only responded with jubilation. “Grok is the most fun AI in the world!” Musk posted on X last week after one user gushed that the new AI software was “uncensored.” Asked last week why X had released the tool to the public without guardrails, Musk came back with a shrugging response. “We have our own image generation system under development, but it’s a few months away, so this seemed like a good intermediate step for people to have some fun,” Musk wrote on X last week. Grok does appear to have some restrictions in place. Users have reported that the chatbot rejected requests for nude images or certain violent crimes. For example, it refused to comply with tech site The Verge’s prompt to “generate an image of a naked woman.” However, it responded to a prompt for a picture of “sexy Taylor Swift” by generating an image of the pop star in a black lace bra. Others, such as Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, posted examples of how easy it was to bypass what few restrictions are in place, creating pictures of Mickey Mouse, Trump and Musk wearing Nazi military uniforms adorned with swastikas. The Post has reached out to X for comment. It’s likely that Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, is searching for a way for his Grok chatbot to stand out from the pack, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University. “He is always pushing boundaries and wants to be in the spotlight. If you just toe the line associated with a large-language model and say, OK, here’s all the guardrails, it’s not going to be differentiated,” Lightman said. “On a surface-level perspective, if you say ‘hey, it’s wide open, it’s only available to X users,’ that’s a mechanism associated with saying we’re differentiated,” he added. X isn’t the first company to spark an uproar after rolling out an AI-powered image tool. In March, Google was forced to disable its Gemini chatbot’s image generator after it began spitting out historically inaccurate “woke” photos, such as Black Vikings and “diverse” Nazi-era German soldiers. The tool has yet to be fully fixed. AI giants have also faced a wave of legal action from musicians, authors, content creators and others for using copyrighted content without proper credit or permission to “train” their chatbots. In January, X was forced to temporarily ban searches for Swift after AI-generated nude images of the pop star created by a different image generator went viral. Grok’s AI-powered image creator is only available to paid subscribers of X’s premium plan, which costs $7 per month, and creates pictures based on the user’s text-based prompts. X partnered with a small German startup called Black Forest Labs, which developed the “FLUX.1” image generation software that powers the tool. In a blog post, X said it was “experimenting” with the FLUX.1 model “to expand Grok’s capabilities on X. The graphic nature of the AI-generated pictures could further complicate Musk’s shaky relationship with corporate advertisers. X has experienced a major plunge in ad dollars since Musk purchased the company, with some raising concerns about a lack of content moderation on the app. Musk has an active federal antitrust lawsuit against the World Federation of Advertisers and a handful of major companies for allegedly orchestrating an illegal ad boycott targeting X. The launch also could prompt more scrutiny of Musk and X in Europe, where regulators have an active probe over the app’s alleged failure to police dangerous content. EU Commissioner Thierry Breton caused an uproar earlier this month after he threatened Musk with a regulatory crackdown just before the billionaire’s interview with Trump on X Spaces.","summary":"Elon Musk’s Grok AI chatbot is flooding the web with \"deepfake\" images of everyone from Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to Taylor Swift and Musk himself – and the results range from totally wacky to downright disturbing.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/22/business/elon-musks-grok-ai-chatbot-goes-viral-with-mind-blowing-deepfakes/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88141915-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pzySBAvS-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:59:55","author":"Thomas Barrabi","authors":["Thomas Barrabi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":254718670,"title":"Trump campaign deletes video with Beyoncé's 'Freedom' after singer reportedly threatens legal action","text":"The Trump campaign does not have the freedom to use Beyoncé's \"Freedom.\" Former President Donald Trump's team has taken down a video featuring the singer's song after her record label and music publisher reportedly threatened to send a cease-and-desist letter, Rolling Stone reported on Wednesday. The video featured the Lemonade track playing as Trump walked off a plane in Michigan. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung posted the video on Twitter on Tuesday with the caption \"Touchdown in Michigan!! @realDonaldTrump.\" The tweet has since been deleted. The 2016 song has become Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' unofficial presidential campaign anthem with her running mate Tim Walz, and Beyoncé's team previously gave Harris' camp permission to use it. Harris has used the song since beginning her presidential campaign earlier this summer, walking up to the podium while \"Freedom\" played in her first appearance after President Joe Biden's endorsement, and as recently as Monday in a new ad also featuring Jeffrey Wright's narration. Beyoncé's \"Freedom\" has also been played throughout the ongoing Democratic National Convention, currently taking place in Chicago. Representatives for Trump's campaign and Beyoncé did not immediately respond to Entertainment Weekly's request for comment. Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more. This is not the first time Trump's team has used music without permission, prompting swift pushback from the artists. Earlier this month, Isaac Hayes' estate took legal action against the Trump campaign for its use of \"Hold On, I’m Coming\" at multiple Trump rallies over the last two years. And Celine Dion posted a statement on Instagram calling out the Republican presidential candidate for playing a video of her performing “My Heart Will Go On” at a recent campaign stop without her permission. In April, the estate of late Irish singer-songwriter Sinéad O’Connor blasted him for playing her 1990 hit \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" at several events, saying in a joint statement with Chrysalis Records, \"it is no exaggeration to say that Sinéad would have been disgusted, hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a 'biblical devil.'\" Other artists who have spoken out against Trump for using their music include Pharrell, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Adele, Guns N’ Roses, Aerosmith, Neil Young, Rihanna, Ozzy Osbourne, Nickelback, Linkin Park, the Rolling Stones, Village People, Panic! at the Disco, Queen, R.E.M, and the estates and families of Tom Petty, Laura Branigan, Prince, and George Harrison. Still, Trump has continued to play many of their songs without permission at his events.","summary":"Beyoncé&#39;s team previously gave permission for Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris&#39; presidential campaign to use the song.","url":"https://ew.com/trump-campaign-deletes-video-with-beyonce-freedom-after-singer-reportedly-sends-cease-and-desist-8700213","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/J7wNMEToy1QJ11Eav2-3_D4Vy-E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Beyonce-Black-female-country-artists-033024-01-1248b34e1eac4a149a8d253a349880c0.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/7EE2zQVi-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:59:14","author":"Sydney Bucksbaum","authors":["Sydney Bucksbaum"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.167},{"id":254717694,"title":"Poll analysis: What Democrats' excitement for Harris means and what it doesn't","text":"More Democrats now say this election is about hope about what might happen, rather than fear.Democrats are excited about Kamala Harris, but she trails GOP nominee Donald Trump on some key issues among the electorate overall.As Vice President Kamala Harris prepares to accept her party's nomination for president, most Democrats are excited about her, and since she first became the presumptive nominee, more of them have said they'll definitely vote. With this excitement, there's also a more optimistic outlook. We've been asking whether in general voters see this election as more about hope for what could happen or fear for what might happen. For Democrats, hope now eclipses fear. While Democrats may be excited and strongly backing Harris, she still faces some of the same deficits with the broader electorate that President Biden did. Harris runs behind former President Donald Trump on some key issues in this election, like the economy. Harris may take the opportunity to re-introduce herself to the country — a third of voters say they don't yet know what she stands for — and try to convince voters she would handle the issues that matter to them better than Trump.Democrats excited about HarrisTwo-thirds of Democrats are excited about Harris as the Democratic nominee, with majorities of Democratic men and women and both liberal and moderate Democrats feeling excited (although excitement is higher among liberals). Nearly all Democrats are at least satisfied with Harris as their nominee. Along with excitement for Harris, as we reported on Sunday Democrats have continued to close the gap with Republicans in expressing their intention to definitely vote. They now are effectively even with Republicans in saying so. And Democrats are thinking about this election differently now — feeling more hopeful than fearful about what might happen. The percentage of Democrats who say the election is about hope has risen 17 points since the spring and now outnumbers those who say it's about fear. What does Harris need to do?Harris may have made this a closer race with Trump, but some factors in the race remain the same.The economy and inflation are top issues for voters, and Harris trails Trump among those who say these issues are major factors in their vote, just as Mr. Biden did. And Trump leads Harris by an even greater margin among those who say the U.S.-Mexico border is a major factor for them. Harris does maintain advantages on other issues like abortion, the state of democracy and issues of race and diversity. Many voters don't know where Harris standsWhile most Democrats feel they know where Harris stands, many voters are still learning about her. A third of voters overall say they don't know what she stands for, a number that rises to 44% among independents, a group she will try to persuade to back the Harris-Walz ticket. This analysis is based on a CBS News/YouGov survey conducted with a representative sample of 3,258 registered voters nationwide interviewed between August 14-16, 2024. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as past vote. Respondents were selected to be representative of registered voters nationwide. The margin of error for registered voters is ±2.1 points.","summary":"Democrats are excited about Harris, but she trails Trump on some key issues among the electorate overall.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-democrats-excitement-poll-analysis/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/22/41326db8-d544-419b-bdbf-13f7fb083a02/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e917b2fdcbed77a2815e3e753d92f9ae/gettyimages-2167668185.jpg?v=29ebd300d9a3cd24077d945a46991f72","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3137293_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:58:00","author":"Jennifer de Pinto","authors":["Jennifer de Pinto"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":254718972,"title":"Jennifer Lopez turned Ben Affleck 'into a family man again' but she wanted to take the kids out while he preferred to 'stay home'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Thursday, Aug 22nd 2024 1AM 12°C 4AM 11°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Inside the decision to sack Jermaine Jenas: How rumours spread like wildfire on BBC WhatsApp chats before bosses made shock decision to sack the star - as 'concerned' TalkSport directors now examine claims Bid to find missing Hannah Lynch ends for another night: Divers still not found 18-year-old daughter of tech tycoon - after her father's body was recovered from sunken £30m superyacht Gareth Southgate lands new role just five weeks after stepping down as England manager following eight years in charge The ten very different types of affair revealed by a top psychologist... and how to heal from them The UK's 16 best market towns revealed by property experts: They're Britain's most sought-after postcodes.

Jennifer Lopez had a hand in getting Ben Affleck to focus more on his children, a new report from People has alleged. The site claimed that the Atlas actress motivated the Argo director to be more 'family oriented.' Seen with Emme and Samuel in 2021 During their two year marriage the kids were 'very important to them,' added the insider. Lopez shares twins Max and Emme, 16, with ex-husband Marc Anthony, while Affleck shares three children with ex-wife Jennifer Garner: Violet, 18, Seraphina, 15, and Samuel, 12 (pictured in March) 'They are very different people,' the source added of Affleck and Lopez. 'She's super public and wants to go out, and he's more of an introvert and is happy to hang out at home.' Read More Ben Affleck dropped a major clue MONTHS ago that his marriage to Jennifer Lopez was over Indeed, Jennifer was often seen traveling with the kids as she has a busy schedule. And she likely wanted to take all five of the children with her during her summer tour, which has been postponed to 2025. Ben may not want to go out as much as he is just not as gregarious as Lopez. In an interview with Kevin Hart earlier this year, Ben said he was 'shy': 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention,' he told the comedian. 'This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why is this dude always mad?' Because someone had their camera sticking in my face, and I'm like, 'OK, here we go.'' 'You have resting b***h face,' Hart joked. 'B****h? Now,' Affleck responded as he pretended to be mad. 'I have resting hard face. People are projecting onto me something that I don't feel about myself at all.'

But the way they spent their time with the kids divided them, it was claimed. While JLo was happy to take the little ones out shopping and to fun events, Affleck preferred to hang out at home. Seen at the after party for the Los Angeles premiere of Shotgun Wedding in January 2023 in Hollywood Also in the Hart interview, Ben went into great detail about how Lopez has crazy fame while he has sorta fame. Read More Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's split 20 years ago under microscope The Air star said fans went 'bananas' when they spotted the 55-year-old Bronx-born beauty with him in Times Square. Turns out, it was his idea to walk through one of the busiest neighborhoods with a superstar on his arm. 'We went somewhere with [Jennifer]—I can't remember because she's so famous, and she creates this—people love her, and she really represents something important to people,' Affleck stated. '[To me,] people are like, 'Hey, I like your movie,' and then they're like 'AAAHHHH! J-LO!' he yelled. 'It's amazing, you know what I mean?' Then he got more specific. 'I think it was when we rolled through Times Square,' he continued. In an interview with Kevin Hart earlier this year, Ben said he was 'shy': 'I'm also a little bit shy. I don't like a lot of attention,' he told the comedian. 'This is why people see me and they're like, 'Why is this dude always mad?' Because someone had their camera sticking in my face, and I'm like, 'OK, here we go'' 'We get out of the car, we were going to a play, and I was like, 'F*** it, babe, we're going to be late, we gotta walk a block and a half.' [Lopez] was like, 'Alright,' she didn't say s***.' They were with all their children - he has Violet, Seraphina and Samuel with Jennifer Garner and Lopez has Max and Emme with Marc Anthony. 'We get out with her, all the kids, through Times Square, and the s*** was like f****n' bananas,' Affleck noted. 'I was like, 'Oh my God.' There was a lady, she was smoking weed, in a full purple skintight suit—she's a heavy lady—and she starts running backwards filming, going '-LO!!' He added, 'Like a herald, that then gets everyone else, and then all the tourists come in.' Affleck said the chaos was a lot to take in. The stars seen in 2003 at the Los Angeles Lakers v. San Antonio Spurs playoff game at the Staples Center 'Then we've got our five kids, it's me and Jen and what feels like hundreds of people, and they're all screaming.' Meanwehile, Lopez is reportedly feeling 'disappointed and sad' after filing for divorce from Affleck but she knew it was 'time to move on'. The superstar was engaged to Hollywood actor Ben, 52, in the early 2000s and the pair famously reconciled in 2021 before tying the knot in two ceremonies in 2022 but the relationship is now over once again and Jennifer filed for divorce on Tuesday to bring the union to an end. Now a new report suggests Jennifer felt the time was right to start moving on with her life. A source told PEOPLE: '[She knows] it's time to move on' for various reasons 'She's very disappointed and sad, but Ben hasn't given her any signs that he wants to continue their marriage. He hasn't shown any commitment and interest in making their marriage work. It's gotten to the point that she just needs to look out for herself.' Affleck and Lopez got back together in 2021; seen in September 2021 in Italy The divorce filing came exactly two years after the couple's extravagant second wedding in Georgia on August 20 2022 - and an insider told the publication the significance of the date wasn't lost on Jennifer. They said: 'She was done waiting and the date she did it speaks a tonne ... [The divorce filing] gives her control of the process ... It's good that she did it ... 'She tried really hard to make things work and is heartbroken.' The source went on to insist the former couple's blended family is taking priority, adding: 'The kids are a top priority, as they always have been.' The singer/actress wrote a whole album - 'This Is Me ... Now' - inspired by the pair's reignited love affair and even made a film version. She was even gushing about the relationship just months before the official date of their separation, which is listed as April 26 2024. She told the Metro newspaper: 'I wrote This Is Me... Then when Ben and I fell in love 20-something years ago. As fate would have it, we came back into each other's lives. And on the 20th anniversary of This Is Me... Then, I announced that I would do This Is Me... Now.' 'It was inspired by the surreal miracle that had happened. Him coming back into my life and the two of us reuniting in a way that we never expected that was the inspiration for even going in the studio. 'The album just poured out of me. It was just something organic and beautiful, but it was definitely inspired by getting this incredible second chance at real, true love.'

The negotiations stalled late Wednesday when leaders with the Uncommitted National Movement say a Democratic National Committee official called and delivered a firm response: “The answer is no.” The leader, Abbas Alawieh, an “Uncommitted” delegate to the convention and co-founder of the movement, described the call as shocking after weeks of talks that he felt were positive. In response, he and other delegates decided to stage a sit-in outside Chicago’s United Center, where the convention is being held. They spent the night on the sidewalk on Wednesday, and vowed to remain until their request was granted or the convention ended Thursday night. “When we ran out of options — doing everything we can and working from the inside, when we ran out of options as uncommitted delegates, we just sat down,” Alawieh said in an interview Thursday. The Harris campaign declined to comment. The sit-in outside the United Center has exposed cracks in a Democratic Party that otherwise has rallied around the Harris campaign that has energized the vast majority of party members this week. The news that the DNC had denied the request of a Palestinian American speaker, just a day after featuring the parents of an Israeli American hostage held by Hamas, ignited fresh criticism from some on the left. The politically powerful United Autoworkers Union, which has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, said the party “must allow a Palestinian American speaker to be heard from the DNC stage tonight.” Cook County, where Chicago and the convention is located, holds the largest population of Palestinian Americans in the country. The party, however, has not budged. The Senate’s top Democrat shrugged off the potential political impact of the sit-in outside the convention. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer recalled Harris saying when protesters interrupted her at a recent rally in Michigan that their disruptions might be benefiting Republican Donald Trump. “She said, ‘Be quiet unless you want to elect Trump,’” Schumer told a small group of reporters on Thursday, ahead of the convention’s final evening. “We believe we need unity, and there’s overwhelming — I have never seen such unity,” he said. “A small handful of people does not represent close to even a sliver of where the Democratic Party is right now.” Tensions over the war in Gaza have at times escalated outside the convention center this week, as thousands marched through Chicago demanding a cease-fire. A smaller group of activists clashed with police outside the Israeli Consulate on Tuesday night, leading to 56 arrests. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Muslim Democrat, spoke Wednesday at the convention and praised Harris for saying “we need a cease-fire and an end to the loss of innocent lives in Gaza and to bring hostages home.” In an interview Thursday, he said that “not only is the content of the message important, the messenger is also important.” “A Palestinian-American sharing his or her story, calling for cease-fire and release of all hostages, and calling everyone to support the ticket against fascism would be powerful,” Ellison said on social media Thursday. Many other Democratic leaders urged the party to reconsider the request. In a statement, California Rep. Ro Khanna said that “the Democratic Party, which aspires to be the party of human rights, must not in 2024 perpetuate this erasure of the Palestinian story.” When asked at a roundtable discussion Thursday whether he agreed with the “Uncommitted” delegates’ demand to add a Palestinian American speaker to the DNC lineup, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said, “Yes, of course.” “We’re talking about thousands of babies and elderly people being brutalized by an act of war,” said Johnson. “You have to have a voice that can call for peace as well as the releasing of hostages.” According to Alawieh, the “Uncommitted” movement provided a number of potential Palestinian Americans who could speak at the convention, including Georgia State Rep. Ruwa Romman. Romman on Thursday released a draft of the speech she said she planned to deliver if asked. In it, she calls for electing Harris, defeating Donald Trump — and outlines demands for a cease-fire and to “end the killing of Palestinians, free all the Israeli and Palestinian hostages.” Earlier this week, activists were granted unprecedented space at the convention to hold a forum addressing the plight of Gaza residents, who have been under Israeli bombardment since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and its taking of hostages, as well as to share deeply personal stories about family members lost in the conflict. The panel was viewed as an olive branch from the Harris campaign, with hopes that other requests might be fulfilled later in the week. The convention has officially made Harris the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, with the vast majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates enthusiastically casting their votes for her. But those calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war — among other demands, such as an arms embargo on Israel — believe they will have an outsized influence in the November election, now just over 70 days away. Michigan, one of the key swing states, has the largest percentage of Arab Americans in the country. The UAW, which hosted Harris at a union hall event earlier this month, also has its largest membership base in Michigan. Through Thursday, Democrats on their way into the convention stopped by the sit-in. Rep. Cori Bush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the “Squad,” who lost her primary earlier this month, stopped to mingle with “Uncommitted” delegates. “We are Democrats. We are a part of this party. And we are just saying, ‘hear us because it matters,’” said Bush.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCHICAGO – Leaders of an “Uncommitted” movement, which garnered hundreds of thousands&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Pro-Palestinian delegates denied speaker at DNC, despite their request first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/pro-palestinian-delegates-denied-speaker-at-dnc-despite-their-request/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-039The-answer-is-no039-Pro-Palestinian-delegates-say.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:57:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":254719528,"title":"'Ghoulishness': Ann Coulter deletes 'incomprehensible' jab at Tim Walz’s son after backlash","text":"Right-wing commentator Ann Coulter on Thursday published a now deleted post making fun of 2024 Democratic nominee Tim Walz's 17-year-old son, Gus, who has \"a non-verbal learning disorder, an anxiety disorder and ADHD,\" according to the Minnesota governor's family.

A look at @somewheresy’s profile shows that he’s a semi-ironic shitposter, so not all of that checks out. The Daily Dot couldn’t immediately confirm Von paid any PR firms to scrub his father out of public records or find any proof of his dad’s previous employment. But information about his past is limited online. Von’s Wikipedia page does indeed list his name as Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III—and so does an article in the Atlantic’s May 2024 issue. The page also lists Roland von Kurnatowski Sr. as his father. An obituary from Find a Grave for a Roland Theodor Achilles von Kurnatowski Sr. mentions a Roland von Kurnatowski as a son. In turn, Roland von Kurnatowski’s obituary mentions a Theodor von Kurnatowski as a half-brother, but not as a son. A Community Note on the tweet dragging him says that Von “has acknowledged his heritage and shared that his dad was exiled from a wealthy family that wanted nothing to do with Theo, his mom, or his siblings.” According to Von’s stand-up and podcast appearances, Von’s dad was 70 when he was born, and he never spent much time with him. The Atlantic piece also explores the appeal of Von’s podcast This Past Weekend but doesn’t dig into his background too much. Von talked about his rough childhood in Covington, Louisiana, including how he was legally emancipated at the age of 14, on a 2015 episode of stand-up comedian Bert Kreischer’s podcast BERTCAST. But @somewheresy wasn’t the only poster to make the connection. “Comedian @TheoVon’s real name is Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III and he is from a Polish aristocratic family,” @QuantumDom posted, linking to a photo of Von’s Wikipedia page and highlighting an entry about the Kurnatowski family. According to that page, the family has been highly active in Polish politics since the 16th Century. Other people noted the ties, too. “theo von is polish aristocracy bro what the hell,” wrote one.“Today we learned that Theo Von’s real name is Theodor Capitani von Kurnatowski III (yes really) and he is from a Polish aristocratic family. What?” added one account. Von didn’t immediately respond to questions about his family’s heritage. In response to the viral posts though, he got a hearty defense from far-right comedian Owen Benjamin. “I know Theo von and I’ll tell ya exactly what I know about him … Nothing was handed to him. He ran an open mic above a bar. He hustled he worked hard and he always did well,” Benjamin said. He added that though he and Von had a falling out, he no longer held it against him. “I can fully bear witness that Theo earned it and wasn’t given shit for a bloodline. He def has demons but this claim about him sounds like bullshit.” But others were mystified by another aspect. “for some reason the fact that theo von is 44 is much more shocking to me than the fact that he is a polish prince,” wrote one poster.

By LINDSAY WHITEHURST and JACQUES BILLEAUD The Associated Press August 22, 2024 at 9:52PM WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a Republican push that could have blocked more than 41,000 Arizona voters from casting ballots for president in the state that Democrat Joe Biden won by less than 11,000 votes four years ago. But in a 5-4 order, the high court allowed some enforcement of regulations barring people from voting in state and local elections if they don't provide proof of citizenship when they register. The justices acted on an emergency appeal filed by state and national Republicans that sought to give full effect to voting measures enacted in 2022 following Biden's narrow win over Republican Donald Trump. The court did not detail its reasoning in a brief order. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have allowed the law to be fully enforced, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett would have joined with the court's three liberals in fully rejecting the push, the order states. The legal fight will continue in lower courts. National and state Republicans had asked the Supreme Court to get involved in a legal fight over voter registration restrictions that Republicans enacted in Arizona in 2022 following Biden's thin victory in the state in 2020. The court's action came after a lower court had blocked a requirement that called for state voter registration forms to be rejected if they are not accompanied by documents proving U.S. citizenship. A second measure, also not in effect, would have prohibited voting in presidential elections or by mail if registrants don't prove they are U.S. citizens. Federal law requires voters to swear they are U.S. citizens under penalty of perjury but does not require proof of citizenship either to vote in federal elections in person or cast ballots by mail. An appellate panel of three Trump appointees initially blocked the lower court ruling in part and allowed enforcement of a provision dealing with state voter registration forms. But another appellate panel voted 2-1 to keep both provisions on hold, with two Bill Clinton appointees allowing the voter registrations to go forward over the dissent of a Trump appointee. The measures were passed on party-line votes and signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, amid a wave of proposals that Republicans introduced around the country after Biden's 2020 victory over Trump, including in Arizona. For state and local elections, voters must provide proof of citizenship when they register or have it on file with the state. Since that isn't a requirement for federal elections for Congress or president, tens of thousands of voters who haven't provided proof of citizenship are registered only for federal elections. There were 41,352 of those voters registered as of August 9 in Arizona, Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said. Fontes warned in a court filing that an order in favor of the state and national Republicans this close to the November election ''will create chaos and confusion.'' The voters most affected would include military service members, students and Native Americans, Fontes said. About 27% of those voters are registered Democrats and 15% are Republicans. More than half, 54%, are registered independents, according to state data. Voting rights groups and the Biden administration had sued over the Arizona laws. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach led Republican attorneys general in 24 states in supporting the restrictions, saying the ''case threatens to continue chipping away Arizona's authority to secure its own elections.'' Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, who along with Senate President Warren Petersen had asked the court to take up the issue, said in a statement that the order was ''a step in the right direction to require proof of citizenship in all our elections.'' Toma and Peterson are both Republicans. Federal-only voters have been a subject of political wrangling since the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Arizona cannot require documentary proof of citizenship for people to vote in national elections. The state responded by creating two classes of voters: those who can vote in all races and those who can vote only in federal elections. One of the new laws sought to further divide voters, allowing votes in congressional elections without proof of citizenship, but denying the vote in presidential contests. The 2022 law has drawn fierce opposition from voting rights advocates, who described the statute as an attempt to get the issue back in front of the now more conservative Supreme Court. Proponents say the measure is about eliminating opportunities for fraud. There is no evidence that the existence of federal-only voters has allowed noncitizens to illegally vote, but Republican skeptics have nonetheless worked aggressively to crack down on federal-only voting. The Legislature's own lawyers had said much of the measure was unconstitutional, directly contradicted the earlier Supreme Court decision and was likely to be thrown out in court. ___ Billeaud reported from Phoenix.

The much anticipated moment follows a week of celebrating Joe Biden’s presidency while also crediting him for stepping aside to allow Harris an opportunity to run for president — a decision that has upended the polling trajectory of the 2024 election in the vice president’s favor. Keep reading to find livestream options for how to watch online Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at the DNC. The DNC has been a veritable party, no pun intended, with a steady parade of everyone from folks up and down the Democratic Party’s ranks, Hollywood A-listers, pop music superstars and everyday citizens tapped by the Harris campaign to participate. Aside from the celebratory aspect of the Democratic National Convention, some of the most pressing issues facing the U.S. have been front and center. That was particularly true on Wednesday night when the daily theme of the DNC was “A Fight for Our Freedoms” — a nod to Project 2025, the Republican-led plan that Democrats say will reduce civil liberties and freedoms. On Thursday, the DNC’s theme is fittingly “For Our Future,” an obvious nod to Harris’ candidacy and the expectations that she will beat Donald Trump and become the next — or, future — president. The contents of Harris’ acceptance speech were not revealed ahead of her appearance on Thursday night. However, on the heels of her speech earlier this month laying out her plan for the economy, there is a good chance that Harris will at least address some other element of her planned presidential platforms that she will prioritize should she win the 2024 election in November and advance to the White House. Thursday is also the 10th wedding anniversary of Harris’ marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, making the day all that much more special. Aside from Harris’ speech, there is plenty more to look forward to at the DNC Thursday night. That includes an unverified report quickly gaining steam on social media that the Queen B herself — pop superstar Beyoncé — will make an appearance. If that happens, it would only add to the established star power that’s been on display at the DNC thus far, including Oprah Winfrey, former President Barack Obama and our Forever First Lady Michelle Obama on Wednesday night. There’s also a rumor that all-world singer Taylor Swift may be on the schedule. Here’s who is for sure confirmed to appear: • Texas Rep. and U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred • Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin • Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey • North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper • Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost • Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego • Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, a gun control activist and notable shooting survivor • Interior Secretary Deb Haaland • Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey • Arizona Sen, Mark Kelly • Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican who has criticized Trump • Georgia Rep. Lucy McBath • Colorado Rep. Joe Neguse • California Sen. Alex Padilla • Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin • Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren • Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer • The Tennessee 3 – State Reps. Gloria Johnson, Justin Jones and Justin J. Pearson, who were notably expelled last year for demanding gun control following a mass shooting in Nashville Who else will be there? There’s only one way to find out and watch.

The groundwork for her performance has been laid by her boss, US President Joe Biden, who said \"She is tough, experienced and has enormous integrity. Her story represents the best American story.\" Barack Obama tweaked his 2008 campaign \"Yes We Can\" to Yes, She Can\", to praise Ms Harris. Meanwhile, Michelle Obama termed Kamala Harris's story as \"the embodiment of stories we speak about (in) this country.\" Kamala Harris is expected to talk about her past experiences, and her life story from a successful lawyer to becoming the first Black, South Asian female Vice President in American history. The seasoned lawyer will present her case in front of the delegates at United Center Arena in Chicago. From Barack and Michelle Obama to Bill Clinton, senior figures have warned all week that Ms Harris has a brutal fight on her hands to beat the 78-year-old Trump. Tim Walz, the Minnesota Governor, yesterday, accepted the Vice President nomination. He called it the \"honour of his life\" and shared his upbringing in a middle-class family in Nebraska, how he learned from helping his family on the farm and his experience of teaching students. These stories are intended to connect with the larger middle-class American population that is reeling through an economic slowdown coupled with inflation and unemployment. Mr Walz's son, Gus, stole the spotlight on day 3 of the event. The 17-year-old who is neurodivergent and has ADHD, was overcome with emotion as he watched his father take the stage. With tears streaming down his face, Gus stood up and proudly pointed at his dad, exclaiming, \"That's my dad!\". Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey endorsed the party's nominees. Ms Winfrey made a surprise entry yesterday and said \"What we're going to do is elect Kamala Harris as the next president of the United States. And let us choose joy!\" Winfrey said, a day after former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle addressed the DNC.\" The chemistry between 59-year-old Harris and Walz and the noisy energy generated at their rallies is helping to fuel Democratic hopes that they can defeat Donald Trump. A recent poll showed Kamala Harris holds a narrow lead over her Republican rival Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. The four-point lead is a small but notable improvement for Democrats in the election race, a month after polls had shown then-presidential nominee Joe Biden and Trump in a dead heat. Immigration is set to be a key issue in the upcoming Presidential elections. A slowdown in the economy which leads to unemployment and inflation, deeply impacts the attitude towards immigration. The immigrants fear a second Trump term, who has been a staunch hardliner on such issues.","summary":"The Democratic National Convention, a four-day mega event which saw a tearful Joe Biden getting a farewell, and Kamala Harris making a surprise entry in a tan suit, will end today.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-take-the-stage-on-last-day-of-democratic-convention-6396362","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/4i5380b_kamala-harris-_625x300_20_August_24.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:50:40","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.423},{"id":254717136,"title":"What to know about Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey ahead of her DNC speech","text":"The NPR Network will be reporting live from Chicago throughout the week bringing you the latest on the Democratic National Convention. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, one of the first Democratic governors to suggest that President Joe Biden should end his reelection bid, will address the DNC Thursday night in Chicago. Healey is scheduled to speak shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris accepts the party’s presidential nomination. Healey was elected governor in 2022, becoming Massachusetts’ first female chief executive and the nation’s first openly lesbian governor. Like Harris, she is a former two-term attorney general. Her office initiated or joined dozens of legal challenges against the Trump administration. Healey is expected to highlight her experience working with Harris and talk about “the stark choice in this election between a convicted felon and a dedicated prosecutor for the people,” according to her office. In July, shortly after President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, Healey, a campaign surrogate for Biden, released a statement urging the president “to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump.” Soon after that, Healey joined fellow Democratic governors on a call to the White House, telling chief of staff Jeff Zients that Biden’s political position was “irretrievable,” according to the New York Times. Healey, 53, grew up on the New Hampshire coast, and found success in sports. At Harvard University, she co-captained the women's basketball team, and went on to play professionally in Austria. Healey, a 5’- 4” point guard, said despite her height, she was always comfortable competing on the court. \"I never even realized how short I was,\" Healey told WBUR. \"Being that small and playing that game, I think you learn a little bit about toughness. You learn about taking on bigger people and bigger interests.\" After two years playing in Austria, Healey returned to Massachusetts to attend law school at Northeastern University.","summary":"Massachusetts Gov.

As millions wonder who will introduce Harris on night four of the DNC, House Democrats say she doesn’t need to focus too much on revealing a policy agenda as voters are more interested in her character instead. “They want to see who you are. What’s your character? Do you get it about me?” Virginia Representative Gerry Connolly told CNN. “Can you relate? Can you lead? Are you competent?” Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams shared similar thoughts, telling the outlet that voters are “looking for that candidate to bring us together.” “I haven’t heard from many voters looking for white papers and policy papers.” Williams compared Harris to former President Donald Trump, saying “Harris is for thinking, looking toward the future and moving out of the hatred and division of Donald Trump‘s politics.” Michigan Rep. Dan Kildee agreed, saying that the election will not be decided on policy but rather on character values. “The American people think about this choice is less about the minutia of policy and more about the direction of the country, number one, and secondly, about the person, character it does matter,” he said. MAIN EVENT As Harris gears up for her acceptance speech, speculation is still swirling on who will take the stage to introduce the vice president. Dozens of celebrities have already shown their face inside Chicago’s United Center, including Oprah Winfrey, rapper Lil Jon, director Spike Lee, singer John Legend, and actress Mindy Kaling, among others. But viewers are growing anxious to see who will serve as the penultimate speaker on night four. Many have created their own lists, narrowing it down to Ella Emhoff, the daughter of Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and Queen Bey herself, Beyoncé.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTOP lawmakers have urged Vice President Kamala Harris to focus on her&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Leading Democrat emphasizes that Americans prioritize an individual&#8217;s character over their policies, while Kamala Harris prepares for a highly anticipated speech at the DNC. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/leading-democrat-emphasizes-that-americans-prioritize-an-individuals-character-over-their-policies-while-kamala-harris-prepares-for-a-highly-anticipated-speech-at-the-dnc/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Top-Democrat-insists-Americans-‘care-about-character-not-policy-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:49:59","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":254717692,"title":"Trump campaign official on RFK Jr. possibly endorsing Trump","text":"Trump campaign official on RFK Jr. possibly endorsing Trump Several sources are telling CBS News that Robert F.

Now, they are bracing for these already alarming numbers to climb. Last May, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided to issue visas to 5,000 Palestinian refugees from Gaza. How many have ties to Hamas — designated a terrorist group in Canada and the US? Of the 1,700 KSTs caught trying to illegally enter the US since 2021, the majority — 1,054 — were apprehended at the northern border, most at ports of entry, said CBP. (Those apprehended are in the national Terrorist Screening Dataset, a federal database with sensitive information on identified terrorists or on a watchlist.)Yet these threats with sinister ties moved freely, seemingly undetected — and with proper documentation — in Canada which affords them safe haven. Thus, the Homeland Security News Wire (HSNW) reported that 2024 continues a trend of KSTs caught at the northern border outpacing those at the southern border.“The greatest number of KSTs to ever be apprehended in US history was at the northern border in fiscal 2023 of 484. The next greatest number to be apprehended in US history was 313 at the northern border in fiscal 2022, according to CBP data.”By comparison, 249 KSTs were apprehended at the southwestern US border in 2023. According to The Centre Square, a conservative news website, terrorist watchlist apprehensions at the Canada/US border keep breaking records.There have been 6,100 apprehensions, for various reasons, from 76 different countries along the Canada-US border in the past 11 months, it reported in May. No doubt that number has since climbed.Former Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said on HSNW that illegal northern border entries are “minuscule” compared to the millions (an estimated 12.5 million to 18 million) that entered through the southwest US border, but “the threat is not.”The Trudeau government’s decision to issue 5,000 Palestinian visas triggered alarm bells among Republican senators who fear the threat to the safety of Americans will increase. It compelled six senators led by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to call on President Joe Biden’s administration to “heighten precautions” at the Canada/US border in a July 24 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.At issue in particular, is the Liberal government issuing a Refugee Travel Document that replaces passports and is accepted by US Citizenship and Immigration Services as sufficient documentation to enter the US.“With little to no reliable records or background checks of these individuals from the Palestinian Territories, these policies unlock opportunities for individuals with ties to terrorist groups to enter Canada, receive new forms of identification, and then try to enter the US along the porous north border,” wrote the Republican senators.“Irrespective of Canada’s immigration policies, the US should not waive common-sense terrorist screening and vetting for any individual entering the US through other countries.”Americans, although grappling with their own wide-open southern border under the Biden administration, can be forgiven for being suspicious of Canada’s lax vetting measures — as evidenced by granting citizenship to an ISIS terrorist recently caught in a terrorist plot to kill Canadians.Couple that with the fact that 29,248 foreign fugitives banned from Canada are reportedly at large — including those implicated in crimes such as assault, murder, drug trafficking and fraud — both Canadians and Americans have cause to be worried.Hamas terrorists, along with Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthis, are generously funded by Iranian hardliners that claim the US is “the big satan” that must be crushed. Israel is the “little satan,” froth the mullahs with unbridled hatred.According to FBI Director Christopher Wray the threat of terrorist attacks reached “unprecedented levels” since the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel during which 1,200 children, women and men were savagely massacred.Wray has long warned that attack could inspire militants “the likes of which we haven’t seen since ISIS launched its so-called caliphate years ago.” He repeated his concerns about elevated threats from cybercrime and terrorist attacks in an exclusive interview Wednesday with ABC News.As well, prior to former president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, US intelligence detected an Iranian plot against him through online chatter and human sources. Iran, identified as the world’s biggest sponsor of terrorism, hasn’t been above hiring sympathizers or criminals to carry out their dirty deeds — including assassination attempts on political foes and attacks on innocents.Meanwhile, both Canada and the US continue to face disruptive pro-Palestinian protests calling for the annihilation of Jews.Who might Trudeau be rolling the red carpet out for? Well, more than 70% of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank in a poll released by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research last March said Hamas was correct to viciously slaughter, rape, dismember and burn Jews last October. That poll lined up with others that found similar conclusions. Can we trust the Liberals to vet haters? Demonstrably, we cannot.Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s communications department and immigration shadow minister Tom Kmiec didn’t respond to the Western Standard’s requests for comment.Americans have Republican senators — Rubio, Ted Cruz, Joni Ernst, Tom Cotton Mike Braun, and Josh Hawley — fighting for their safety, despite being stonewalled by Mayorkas who has refused to take any measures to stop the invasion of illegals — criminals, terrorists, rapists, murderers, human traffickers, and drug smugglers among them.“Canada recently increased the number of refugees they will allow to enter on temporary resident visas from Israel and the Palestinian Territories, including Gaza and the West Bank,” they wrote to Mayorkas.Here's the full text of the letter.“There is concern this may allow Gazans with potential terrorist ties to enter the US through Canada. Given the few reliable records or background checks available, Canada’s decision will turn the northern border into a much greater national security problem.”“The possibility of terrorists crossing the US-Canada border is deeply concerning given the deep penetration of Gazan society by Hamas. It would be irresponsible for the US to not take necessary heightened precautions when foreigners attempt to enter the United States,” they wrote. The Refugee Travel Documents the Trudeau government will generously hand out is recognized as valid in 146 countries, including the US, in place of a passport.“However, with little to no reliable records or background checks of these individuals from the Palestinian Territories, these policies unlock opportunities for individuals with ties to terrorist groups to enter Canada, receive new forms of identification, and then try to enter the US along the porous north border.”One would think the US senators know what their government will or will not accept as entry documentation. However, Immigration Minister Marc Miller took it upon himself to correct them in a statement in response to their letter, claiming the refugee travel documents being allowed to replace passports was “categorically false” and aren’t valid for transit to the US.The senators also mentioned a cold fact that seems to escape the Liberal government — “the deep penetration of Gazan society by Hamas.”They referred to the stream of terrorists and known criminals entering the US, including the most recent “233 suspected terrorists” encountered by CBP “at our northern border with many more likely going undetected.”“This is already higher than totals in previous years.” The senators requested that Mayorkas’s Homeland Security and the State Department coordinate to “ensure that the US is informed by the Government of Canada if particularly high-risk individuals are allowed to enter Canada from Gaza.”Really? They’re counting on a Liberal government to notify them of high-risk individuals entering Canada?This is the same Liberal government that granted Ahmed Eldidi, a man with seriously grim ISIS connections, Canadian citizenship.But for the commendable efforts of law enforcement who thwarted the terrorist attack he had planned with his son Mostafa, some innocent Canadians would be dead by now.It’s infuriating that the Canadian government not only puts Canadians at risk, but potentially endangers Americans, while it recklessly hands out visas to foreigners it cannot possibly properly vet like candy.","summary":"At least 233 known or suspected terrorists (KSTs) trying to enter the US from Canada have been caught by the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) so far in the 2024 fiscal year that ends September 30.","url":"https://www.westernstandard.news/opinion/slobodian-the-terrorists-among-us/57210","image":"https://media.assettype.com/westernstandard/2024-08-22/uq6zmtpt/Slipping into the US.png?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-22 21:47:34","author":"Linda Slobodian","authors":["Linda Slobodian"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.259},{"id":254716862,"title":"Donald Trump Blames Prez Biden for Reason He Avoids Security Briefings","text":"Former President Donald Trump said he’s uninterested in receiving security briefings this election season so he won’t be accused of leaking classified information. The Republican presidential nominee told the Daily Mail this week that he is refusing to sit down with security agencies during his campaign’s home stretch because he fears President Joe Biden’s team would accuse him of leaking confidential information. It’s a break from the norm for a presidential hopeful. Non-incumbent nominees of major parties often begin receiving security briefings in late August and receive them sporadically until Election Day. The briefings are often broad in scope and include classified information, but they’re far less detailed than the briefings provided to the president. “I don’t need that briefing,” Trump said Wednesday. “They come in. They give you a briefing, and then two days later, they leak it. And then they say, ‘You leaked it.’ The only way to solve that problem is not to take it—I don’t want it.” The former president also confidently commented, “I’ll have plenty of them when I get in.” He also justified his rejection of the briefing by claiming he already knows “what’s happening” in the world. The briefings are done, in part, so candidates don’t say something on the campaign trail that undermines U.S. national security, explained CIA Director Michael Morell in a Q&A. They’re also done to familiarize a potential future commander-in-chief with any pressing matters abroad that may not be publicly known. “The objective is to protect national security during the campaign by giving the candidates a deep sense of the national security landscape,” Morell said. Trump is different than any presidential nominee in the 21st century, however. He’s already been president for four years and remained at the helm of the Republican party in the interim, giving him perspective on national security other candidates have not had access to at this point in the race. Also unlike most candidates before him, Trump allegedly has a shaky history with keeping classified information secure. He was indicted in 2022 on accusations he swiped classified documents from the White House and kept them stored inside his South Florida estate at Mar-a-Lago. That case has since been tossed over the appointment of special prosecutor Jack Smith to the case, but allegations against Trump were never disproven in court. It’s likely Trump hasn’t received a national security briefing since he left office in early 2021. Former presidents are typically offered the courtesy of receiving briefings once they leave office, but Biden broke that precedent to deny Trump information because of what he called “erratic behavior” from his political rival.","summary":"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/ReutersFormer President Donald Trump said he’s uninterested in receiving security briefings this election season so he won’t be accused of leaking classified information.\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee told the Daily Mail this week that he is refusing to sit down with security agencies during his campaign’s home stretch because he fears President Joe Biden’s team would accuse him of leaking confidential information.\n\nIt’s a break from the norm for a presidential hopeful.

But we have no choice, regardless, we have no choice, we're going to have to deport.\" When pressed, Trump provided no details on how he would pay for his plan, which could cost billions of dollars to implement at scale. Trump spent much of his first term fighting with Congress to give him money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, an expensive undertaking that the legislative branch never agreed to fund. Ultimately, he took the money from other parts of the Pentagon budget. Asked whether he would deport undocumented immigrants who are part of mixed-status families, like those married to American citizens or those who are parents to American citizens, Trump simply said, \"Provisions will be made, but we have to get the criminals out.\" The former president did not elaborate on the provisions he would make for mixed-status families. Trump also brushed off a question about whether local law enforcement would be willing to help execute mass deportations, ignoring that some have said they are uninterested in assisting. \"They want to do their job,\" Trump said. \"The Border Patrol wants to do their job. They would have a much easier job if they didn't.\" Trump's remarks came during a packed day of events near the border, where he took a tour of the fence line and addressed the media. Trump blasted Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who are in Chicago for the Democratic National Convention this week. Trump blamed Harris and President Joe Biden for \"unleash[ing] a deadly plague of migrant crime\" in the U.S. \"We had it stopped,\" Trump said, referring to his administration, before accusing Biden and Harris of not doing enough to secure the border, adding: \"The first day in they just said, 'We're not doing anything, we're not doing anything.'\" Trump also criticized Walz, saying the governor, \"lied like hell last night\" during his speech at the convention Wednesday night and alleged Harris will \"lie just like the rest of them lied\" in her speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president on Thursday night. This is the former president's first time visiting the border in Arizona this year, though his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has visited this spot this year. Trump has visited other sections of the border, in Texas, twice since launching his re-election bid.

That couldn’t be further from the truth,” Gallegos wrote. “I want Kamala to not only win the election, I want a landslide. The only way I see that happening is if she forces a ceasefire.” He continued: “Together we can win and save lives.” Gallegos lives in Crete and was elected last year to the Crete-Monee School District 201-U board. Earlier this year, he was elected as a 2nd Congressional District Democratic delegate for President Joe Biden. He’s among 52 Democratic uncommitted delegates on the national roll call, many of them taking that stance to protest the Biden-Harris administration’s flow of weapons to Israel in its war against Hamas. He was the only one of 177 Illinois delegates to withhold their support. Uncommitted delegates are calling on DNC organizers to invite a Palestinian voice to the United Center stage Thursday night and started holding a sit-in outside the arena to publicize their plea. Terrence Healy, a vice president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, said at the Illinois delegation breakfast Thursday a “present” vote jeopardized Harris’ chances of defeating Trump. “One thing I love about the Democratic Party is that, unlike the other side of the aisle, we are always looking to expand our table, we celebrate the diversity, which allows us to grow and achieve success,” Healy said. However, he added, “I have to admit that while I support the right of that delegate to exercise their conscience, I fail to understand this vote. ... We are in a situation where we have to get Kamala Harris elected. We have to stop Trump.

When you were seated, you got the loudest applause. People stood up and roared and cheered when you walked in,\" Winfrey said during the interview. \"Why is that?

After Trump pondered his popularity with Oprah, she also referred to him as a \"folk hero.\" The unearthed interview came to light a day after Winfrey made a surprise appearance at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, during which she railed against Trump, her former friend.

One is the decline of the “double haters\": disillusioned voters who disdained both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The second trend is related — a marked shrinkage in support for third-party candidates, especially Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Many delegates cheering for Harris don’t actually think she’s the ideal candidate or would make a great president. Few backed her failed bid for the nomination that Biden won in 2020, and many gave her tepid reviews as his vice president. But this year, at this moment, she has one huge advantage: She is NOT Biden or Trump. On top of that, she has not served as president. She has not broken promises, failed tests, acquired scars. She is not an aging white man. She provides a fresher, younger option for many voters who, just a month ago, despaired over their choices. A Monmouth University poll in June found that only 46% of Democrats were enthusiastic about a Trump-Biden rematch. In a recent survey, 85% welcomed a Trump-Harris contest. In an ABC/Washington Post poll last month, only 1 in 5 Democrats expressed satisfaction with their choices. That number tripled to 60% after Harris replaced Biden. This election is far from over. Still, the electoral landscape looks a lot different today than it did on July 21, when Biden dropped out, and the double-haters are a major reason. ‘Shake things up’ The Pew Research Center had pegged their number of double-haters at 25%, the highest level of dismay in polling history. Monmouth counted 17% of those polled as deeply disdainful, but with Harris in the race, that number has been sliced in half, to only 8%. Of those unhappy voters, 53% now back Harris, only 11% have shifted to Trump and 35% remain unpersuaded. “Taking Biden out of the mix and replacing him with Harris has significantly altered a key metric in this race,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth poll. “Trump-Biden double haters want to shake things up, but they are wary of change that is too authoritarian. Harris appears to provide most of this group with the fresh outlook they desire.” As Harris has crested, Kennedy Jr. has crumbled. His polling numbers have plunged, he’s had trouble getting on some state ballots and Politico reports that his “sputtering presidential campaign is almost broke.” Kennedy has always been a quirky candidate — a Democratic name with many wild-eyed conservative positions, especially on vaccinations — so his impact is hard to measure. But analysts generally agree that his declining fortunes are helping Harris, at least at the margins. Pew reports that of those voters who supported or leaned toward Kennedy last month, 39% now back Harris, 20% support Trump and 39% remain committed to Kennedy. The Washington Post agrees, writing, “RFK Jr. and the third-party effect are now hurting Trump.” The Post cites a Marquette law school poll which calculates that Harris’ lead over Trump jumps by 2 points when third-party candidates are included. News site Semafor headlines, “Third parties were having a moment. Then Kamala Harris showed up” and quotes election analyst Lakshya Jain: “The biggest factor that was unique to this election cycle was a deep distaste of both candidates, which opened the door to elevated third-party voting even in a time of record polarization. Kamala Harris’ ascension seems to have completely changed this dynamic.” These are small numbers, but they can matter a great deal. One of the main reasons Hillary Clinton lost to Trump, and Biden beat him, was the third-party vote. In 2016, almost 6% of all voters rejected the two main candidates, and these dissidents were particularly critical in the key swing states that gave Trump his victory. Take Pennsylvania: Democrats easily carried the Keystone State three straight times — in 2004, 2008 and 2012. But in 2016, 268,000 voters backed third parties, and Trump squeaked by with a 44,000-vote margin. In 2020, the national third-party vote dropped from almost 6% to under 2%. Biden won Pennsylvania — and the election. Harris still faces many potential pitfalls — Trump’s attacks, reporters’ questions, an intense spotlight that will expose her past statements and exaggerate her mistakes. Voters rank the economy as their top priority and favor Trump on that issue. But as the double haters and third parties implode, Democratic prospects definitely improve.

The changes are designed to curb a massive increase in NDIS costs and are expected to save the government $14.4 billion over the next four years. NDIS Minister Bill Shorten attempted to quell fears, saying “the sun will come up tomorrow”, but this did little to reassure disability advocates. Marayke Jonkers, president of People with Disability Australia, told the AAP her organisation was “concerned people will lose access to support before these new foundational supports are trialled, tested or even designed”. Meanwhile, Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John called the changes a “betrayal”, saying there will be “no certainty over what will and won’t be provided through the NDIS”. The ABC is reporting that people with disabilities are wary of the “extra powers the legislation affords the agency that runs the scheme, and what will come of the proposed ‘foundational supports’ for those outside the scheme”. El Gibbs, deputy CEO of Disability Advocacy Network Australia, noted it’s not just about supporting people within the NDIS but broadening support to those outside it, who she says are currently getting little or no support. The ABC says only 660,000 of the estimated 5.5 million Australians with a disability are currently aided by the scheme. Meanwhile, Treasurer Jim Chalmers has told Australians to expect the government to be “responsible and restrained in the MYEFO [mid-year economic and fiscal outlook]” as it tries to rein in inflation, Nine newspapers are reporting. Inflation has almost halved since Labor came to power, but Chalmers says it’s too early to declare “mission accomplished” as he continues to jostle with the RBA, aiming to get inflation back in the central bank’s 2-3% target band. The Australian reports Chalmers is reaching across the House in an attempt to get support for his RBA reforms, with the treasurer trying to “break up its board into one that sets interest rates and -another that oversees the governance of the central bank”. The Coalition was reportedly wary that Labor intended to stack any new rate-setting board with sympathetic appointees, resulting in Chalmers ceding to demands to retain the current board should his proposed split take place. HARRIS’ HISTORIC MOMENT The time has come for Kamala Harris as she prepares to deliver her speech to the Democratic National Convention tonight (Chicago time), accepting the party’s nomination for president. If she were to win, she would be the first woman as well as the first person of South Asian heritage to be elected president, Reuters reports. CNN is calling the speech “the highest-profile moment of her political life”, noting that “Harris has never been regarded as one of the party’s master speechmakers”. The presidential candidate has been criticised for not revealing a detailed policy platform and there are suggestions she may use the speech to lay out the aims of her prospective government, including cracking down on price-gouging, helping lower rents and assisting first-time home buyers, NBC reports. Those close to Harris have suggested her speechwriting team will be “cautious about how they will incorporate talking about race and gender while understanding that it will be important to acknowledge the history-making position Harris is in”, the NBC continues. Axios writes that the mothers of some of the most high-profile Black victims of police violence have been explicitly invited by the Democrats, suggesting the party may be looking to restart the conversation about police reform. Nearly 13,400 people have been killed by law enforcement in America since 2013, with Black and Native American victims 2.9 and 3.2 times (respectively) more likely to be killed than the general population. On the same day Harris gives her nomination acceptance speech, Donald Trump will speak in Arizona in front of a stretch of the US-Mexico border wall, US ABC reports. It’s an interesting choice, given the wall that Trump previously promised to build was never actualised, with only 450 miles of barriers completed under his administration, much of which were upgrades to “existing barriers”. Trump has spent much of the week taking pot-shots at the DNC and its speakers, most recently calling the speeches by Michelle and “Barack Hussein” Obama “nasty”. “I try and be nice to people, you know, but it’s a little tough when they get personal,” Trump said.

Magic and Sphen inspired a Mardi Gras float, were featured on Netflix’s Atypical, and were perhaps the most famous queer bird icons to ever have not flown this Earth. Magic has been taken to see Sphen’s body and apparently grieved his lover with a song, the zoo said in a statement. I’m not crying, you’re crying… Say What? Okay, a buffalo will suffice, too.

And this is a group of people that I’ve gotten to know,” Trump said during a press conference, just feet from the border wall in Cochise County, Arizona. Trump listed more than a dozen incidents of children and women being sexually assaulted or killed by illegal immigrants, including the deaths of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray of Texas and 37-year-old Rachel Morin of Maryland. “They loved like as much as you can love someone. I’ve spent time with all of them. And what goes through my mind is I don’t know how the hell they can take it,” Trump said. Trump turned over part of the press conference to two families on site who had been personally affected by “migrant crime,” a term Trump has coined for criminal offenses committed by illegal immigrants who were admitted into the country during the Biden administration. Republicans have used such anecdotes to make illegal immigration the centerpiece of their election pitch. Alexis Nungaray, the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, said the months since her daughter’s death have been “very hard.” “She was left with no clothing from the waist down, was thrown in a bayou, left strangled to death,” said Alexis Nungaray. “There was over 300 detention beds that [the suspects] should have been at because they were detained and they were released when they shouldn’t have been released. They had one ankle monitor. Didn’t stop anything. So now I have to go through the rest of my life with my son always asking for his sister.” “I hope everybody could hear my pain to just please, please, he needs to be in office,” Alexis Nungaray said, referring to Trump, who stood behind her. “We need border control. We need to stop this. We need to stop losing our littles.” Jocelyn Nungaray was found deceased on June 16. Court records said Jocelyn Nungaray had snuck out of her home late the previous night and gone to 7-Eleven, where she encountered the two suspects after they had partied at a local restaurant. The two men were alleged to have lured her to a private area and then raped and strangled her before throwing her body into a creek to get rid of DNA evidence. One suspect reportedly searched how to get out of the United States before police arrested them. Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, said her daughter and mother of five was sexually assaulted and killed last August while on a jog on a local walking trail when she was attacked. The suspect, illegal immigrant Victor Martinez-Hernandez of El Salvador, was arrested this summer by police in Oklahoma. “She was brutally beaten, raped, and then stuffed into a drain pipe,” said Patty Morin. “Because of this open border, we’ve had not just my daughter, but we’ve actually had two in the same county that were from where illegal immigrants have come in and have caused rape and murder of our citizens.” Trump’s visit to the border is part of a week of counterprogramming as Democratic rival Vice President Kamala Harris is set to accept her party’s nomination in Chicago. “As Kamala gives her convention speech tonight, she will not mention the victim. She won’t even talk about them, or now that she sees us maybe she will,” said Trump. At the time of Trump’s arrival, police were searching for Ronald Lee Syrvud after learning that the 66-year-old man had allegedly threatened to assassinate Trump during his visit to the border Thursday. The Secret Service allowed Trump to step out of his motorcade vehicle but kept him from getting too close to the border wall, instead keeping him with his back to unused steel posts of border wall on the ground and facing reporters. Trump met with members from the National Border Patrol Council, the Border Patrol union, as well as local elected officials, including Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels, the Republican incumbent. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), also held an immigration-focused event in Valdosta, Georgia, on Thursday as the campaign focused on messaging about the border.

But in a 5-4 order, the high court allowed some enforcement of regulations barring people from voting if they don’t provide proof of citizenship when they register. The justices acted on an emergency appeal filed by state and national Republicans that sought to give full effect to voting measures enacted in 2022 following Biden's narrow win over Republican Donald Trump. The court did not detail its reasoning in a brief order. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch would have allowed the law to be fully enforced, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett would have joined with the court’s three liberals in fully rejecting the push, the order states. The legal fight will continue in lower courts. National and state Republicans had asked the Supreme Court to get involved in a legal fight over voter registration restrictions that Republicans enacted in Arizona in 2022 following Biden’s thin victory in the state in 2020. The court’s action came after a lower court had blocked a requirement that called for state voter registration forms to be rejected if they are not accompanied by documents proving U.S. citizenship. A second measure, also not in effect, would have prohibited voting in presidential elections or by mail if registrants don’t prove they are U.S. citizens. Federal law requires voters to swear they are U.S. citizens under penalty of perjury but does not require proof of citizenship either to vote in federal elections in person or cast ballots by mail. An appellate panel of three Trump appointees initially blocked the lower court ruling in part and allowed enforcement of a provision dealing with state voter registration forms. But another appellate panel voted 2-1 to keep both provisions on hold, with two Bill Clinton appointees allowing the voter registrations to go forward over the dissent of a Trump appointee. The measures were passed on party-line votes and signed into law by then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, amid a wave of proposals that Republicans introduced around the country after Biden’s 2020 victory over Trump, including in Arizona. For state and local elections, voters must provide proof of citizenship when they register or have it on file with the state. Since that isn’t a requirement for federal elections for Congress or president, tens of thousands of voters who haven’t provided proof of citizenship are registered only for federal elections. There were 41,352 of those voters registered as of August 9 in Arizona, Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said. Fontes warned in a court filing that an order in favor of the state and national Republicans this close to the November election “will create chaos and confusion.” The voters most affected would include military service members, students and Native Americans, Fontes said. About 27% of those voters are registered Democrats and 15% are Republicans. More than half, 54%, are registered independents, according to state data. Voting rights groups and the Biden administration had sued over the Arizona laws. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach led Republican attorneys general in 24 states in supporting the restrictions, saying the “case threatens to continue chipping away Arizona’s authority to secure its own elections.” Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, who along with Senate President Warren Petersen had asked the court to take up the issue, said in a statement that the order was “a step in the right direction to require proof of citizenship in all our elections.” Toma and Peterson are both Republicans. Federal-only voters have been a subject of political wrangling since the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Arizona cannot require documentary proof of citizenship for people to vote in national elections. The state responded by creating two classes of voters: those who can vote in all races and those who can vote only in federal elections. One of the new laws sought to further divide voters, allowing votes in congressional elections without proof of citizenship, but denying the vote in presidential contests. The 2022 law has drawn fierce opposition from voting rights advocates, who described the statute as an attempt to get the issue back in front of the now more conservative Supreme Court. Proponents say the measure is about eliminating opportunities for fraud. There is no evidence that the existence of federal-only voters has allowed noncitizens to illegally vote, but Republican skeptics have nonetheless worked aggressively to crack down on federal-only voting. The Legislature’s own lawyers had said much of the measure was unconstitutional, directly contradicted the earlier Supreme Court decision and was likely to be thrown out in court.

In what is likely to be one of many election-related disputes to come before the court ahead of the November election, the justices allowed for one of three provisions of the state law to be enforced. The vote was 5-4 on allowing limited enforcement of the law with conservative justices in the majority. One conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the three liberal justices in dissent. The court, in a brief order, did not explain its reasoning. Three conservative justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — said they would have allowed all three provisions to be enforced. More than 40,000 people have registered to vote in federal elections in Arizona without providing proof of citizenship, although state officials say most are inactive voters, and only a small number will likely be affected. In the 2020 election, President Joe Biden beat former President Donald Trump in Arizona by just over 10,000 votes. The provision the court allowed the state to enforce would require officials to turn away attempts to register to vote using the state’s own registration form if the person has no documentary proof of citizenship. But the court kept on hold separate provisions challenged by the Biden administration that would prevent people without proof of citizenship from voting in presidential elections or by mail if they registered to vote using a different, federal registration form. “My concern is that changes to the process should not occur this close to an election. It creates confusion for voters,” Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said in a statement. The RNC hailed the decision as a win for election integrity, despite the lack of evidence that noncitizens vote in U.S. elections. “While Democrats have worked to undermine basic election safeguards and make it easier for non-citizens to vote, we have fought tooth and nail to preserve citizenship requirements, see the law enforced, and secure our elections,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. The Biden administration argued that the provisions the Supreme Court kept on hold violate a federal law called the National Voter Registration Act. That law requires those registering to vote in federal elections to attest that they are U.S. citizens but does not require documentary proof. Arizona’s 2022 law, which has never been enforced, was itself a response to a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that invalidated an earlier attempt to impose a proof-of-citizenship requirement. Then, the Supreme Court said the National Voter Registration Act prevents states from adding additional requirements to forms people have to fill out to vote in federal elections. In the ruling’s aftermath, Arizona enforced its proof-of-citizenship requirement for state elections, but not federal elections. This effectively created a tiered registration process, whereby certain prospective voters can register to vote in federal elections only. While the Biden administration objected to the new provisions requiring proof of citizenship to vote for president or vote by mail, other plaintiffs, including voting rights groups, brought their own challenge focusing on the state registration form. State officials, including Fontes, have declined to enforce the law. The law was passed by Republicans, but Fontes and other state leaders, including Attorney General Kris Mayes, are Democrats. A federal judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 declined to block the ruling. The RNC, joined by Republican leaders in the state legislature, said in court papers that the lower court ruling was “an unprecedented abrogation of the Arizona Legislature’s sovereign authority to determine the qualifications of voters and structure participation in its elections.” Fontes had previously said that many of the more than 40,000 people who had registered to vote in federal elections only were likely students, service members and Native Americans who did not have birth certificates at hand when registering to vote. Only about 5,000 of the voters had registered to vote by mail.
