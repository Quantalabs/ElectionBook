The tariffs allow us to give a dividend,” the Treasury Secretary added.Bessent said that “we’re also going to be reducing debt.”How much does the US need to pay its citizens if Trump's plan is approved?Earlier this month, Donald Trump announced that every US citizen in the low and middle income brackets will be given $2,000 each out of the billions of dollars the country has collected from imposing tariffs on almost all countries across the world.Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Friday, Trump said the checks would go out sometime next year to “everybody but the rich.”“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” he wrote on Truth Social earlier this week.Trump also claimed that the tariff income will be used to bring down the US's debts.“We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,” he said.The plan could cost the US government double what it’s projected to take in for 2025, according to an estimate cited by Bloomberg.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a centrist watchdog group, estimated a preliminary $600 billion cost for the proposal, if the dividends were designed along the lines of government stimulus payments during the Covid-19 pandemic.Net US tariff revenue for the fiscal year through September totaled $195 billion and many economists have penciled in about $300 billion for calendar-year 2025.Scott Bessent said US citizens should start to feel more relief economically in the beginning of next year, citing the tax cuts in Trump’s signature policy bill passed earlier this year.“So I would expect in the first two quarters we are going to see the inflation curve bend down and the real income curve substantially accelerate,” he said.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trumps-2-000-dividend-plan-needs-congress-approval-as-its-a-lot-of-money-says-scott-bessent-11763316586388.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/16/1600x900/logo/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-ECONOMY-APPLE-40_1755051510142_1755051750375_1763318430424.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 18:44:11","author":"Swastika Das Sharma","authors":["Swastika Das Sharma"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":379625520,"title":"US military says aircraft carrier now in Caribbean","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe worlds largest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford sails in the North Sea during NATO Neptune Strike 2025 exercise on September 24, 2025.

Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, entered the US Naval Forces Southern Command's area of responsibility, which encompasses Latin America and the Caribbean, the command said in a statement. (Photo by Jonathan KLEIN / AFP) \n\n International News, Latest News \n\nNovember 16, 2025\n\n\n\n\n US military says aircraft carrier now in Caribbean \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON, United States (AFP) — A US aircraft carrier is now in the Caribbean Sea to bolster an anti-narcotics campaign, the military announced Sunday — a move sure to anger Venezuela — as US forces struck another alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered a troop buildup in the Caribbean as part of an anti-trafficking initiative, but speculation has abounded that Washington may be contemplating military intervention against Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which oversees American forces in Latin America and the Caribbean, had previously said that the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group had entered its area of responsibility.\n\nOn Sunday, it announced in a statement that the strike group had entered the Caribbean Sea, saying the move follows Trump’s “directive to dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations and counter narco-terrorism in defense of the Homeland.”\n\nThe strike group includes the most advanced US aircraft carrier, two guided-missile destroyers, and other support vessels and aircraft.\n\nIt joins several warships already in the Caribbean, with the deployment dubbed “Operation Southern Spear.”\n\nAs part of that operation, Southcom announced that a new strike took place on Saturday in the eastern Pacific, killing three suspects.\n\nSince launching the anti-trafficking military campaign in September, US forces have killed at least 83 people accused of ferrying drugs in international waters, according to an AFP tally of publicly released figures.\n\nThe United States has released no details to back up its claims that the people targeted — in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific — in the more than 20 strikes were actually traffickers.\n\nExperts say the deaths amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.\n\nCaracas meanwhile views the military buildup as an explicit threat.\n\nThe United States does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate president and has issued a $50 million bounty for his capture to face charges of leading a drug cartel.\n\nAmid reports that Trump held meetings with military advisors on potential options for Venezuela, the US president on Friday told reporters he had “sort of” made up his mind on the issue.\n\n“I can’t tell you what it is, but we made a lot of progress with Venezuela in terms of stopping drugs from pouring in,” he said aboard Air Force One.\n\nHe had previously said in a CBS News interview that he doubted the United States would go to war with Venezuela, but that he believed Maduro’s days were numbered.\n\nThe US military has also been stepping up its presence in Trinidad and Tobago, an archipelago just off Venezuela’s coast.\n\nUS and Trinidadian forces were due Sunday to begin joint training exercises for the second time in less than a month. On Saturday, Maduro blasted the drills as “irresponsible.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Trinidad and Tobago United States Venezuela \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sinner caps eventful year with ATP Finals triumph over great rival Alcaraz \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n TURIN, Italy (AFP) -- Jannik Sinner ended a turbulent season in the best possible fashion on Sunday after seeing off Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets, ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Portugal qualify for 2026 World Cup by thrashing Armenia \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n PORTO, Portugal (AFP) -- Portugal crushed Armenia 9-1 despite the absence of suspended talisman Cristiano Ronaldo on Sunday to clinch qualification fo... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Portland sales rep charged with gun-related offences \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n PORTLAND, Jamaica — Detectives from the Portland Police Division have charged a 32-year-old sales representative following an incident in Port Antonio... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Carpenter charged after jewellery, cash reported stolen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica —A 23-year-old carpenter from Kingston has been charged with simple larceny in connection with a break-in and theft reported in Tava... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n William Knibb High considering shift system to resume classes after Hurricane Melissa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica — William Knibb Memorial High School is exploring the introduction of a shift system to resume teaching and learning after Hurric... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apprentice jockey charged after armed robbery of teen in Portmore \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — A 21-year-old apprentice jockey has been charged with multiple offences stemming from the armed robbery of a teenage girl in P... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, Sports \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Carl Brown believes Boyz will give Jamaica ‘something to smile about’ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 16, 2025 \n\n\n Former Jamaica football coach Carl Brown is confident the Reggae Boyz will defeat Curacao on Tuesday to secure a second berth at the World Cup.

U.S. officials have accused Cartel de los Soles of working with the criminal organization Tren de Aragua to send narcotics to the United States. \n\nThe Trump administration has said that Maduro leads Cartel de Los Soles, which he denies. The Pentagon has deployed warships, fighter jets and a nuclear submarine to the Caribbean as U.S. officials consider taking military action against the Maduro government.\n\nThe news of possible discussions between the United States and Venezuela came as the Pentagon announced another attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific. The attack on Saturday killed three people, the Pentagon said.\n\n\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" the U.S. Southern Command announced in a post on social media. The announcement said the boat was in international waters when it was struck by Joint Task Force Southern Spear.\n\nIt was the 21st known attack on drug boats by the U.S. military since early September in what it has called a justified effort to disrupt the flow of narcotics into the United States. The strikes have killed more than 80 people, according to Pentagon figures.\n\nLawmakers in the U.S. Congress, human rights groups and U.S. allies have raised questions about the legality of the attacks. The Trump administration has said it has the legal authority to carry out the strikes, with the Justice Department providing a legal opinion that justifies them and argues that U.S. military personnel who carry out the operations are immune from prosecution.

As Trump admin halts production of one-cent coins, the last batch could fetch a fortune","text":"As the Trump administration halts production of the one-cent coins, the last set of US pennies minted this week may be worth a fortune, with experts estimating they could sell for up to $5 million, according to USA Today.On November 12, the United States Mint officially ended production of the one-cent coin, commonly known as the penny, marking the end of a 232-year-old chapter in American currency. US Treasurer Brandon Beach struck the final coin at the Philadelphia Mint. The US government first started minting pennies in 1793, when Philadelphia was the capital of the nation.The final five pennies were stamped with a unique omega mark and will not be circulated, as per the Treasury Department. The government intends to auction these pennies later. All auction proceeds will fund Mint operations, with any excess going to the US Treasury. Why are the pennies expected to be worth $5 million?The last pennies are expected to be highly valued, as collectors will be keenly interested in a modern rarity of the cents.“Collectors would go nuts for a modern rarity of business-strike Lincoln cents,” John Feigenbaum, publisher of rare coin price guide Greysheet, told USA Today.“The demand would be incredible because the item would be a required element of a truly ‘complete set,'” Feigenbaum said. Is the last penny really worth $5 million?Some experts and critics say that the final batch may not be valued as high as $5 million. Mike Fuljenz, president of Universal Coin & Bullion in Beaumont, Texas, told USA Today that he thinks the final penny that was struck could bring up to $1 million.The second and third final coins might fetch $10,000 and $20,000, he told USA Today.Meanwhile, Philadelphia-based numismatist Richard Weaver told phillymag.com that when US Treasurer Brandon Beach posed for a photo with one of the last pennies, he might have accidentally damaged it.\"If you look at that photo, he is holding the penny with his fingers on the coin,\" Weaver was quoted as saying. \"You just don’t do that. Copper is very reactive to sweat and the oils of the skin, and any serious collector is going to take this photo into consideration,\" he added.In February this year, US President Donald Trump announced plans to end the production of the one-cent coins.\"For far too long, the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \"This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"What happens to the pennies currently in circulation?Although production has stopped, billions of pennies are still in circulation. They continue to hold their 1-cent value and remain legal tender.

Now he’s a father facing deportation to Ukraine","text":"Roman Surovtsev was prompt in picking up his two daughters from school every afternoon. It’s important to him to be there for his smiley 3- and 5-year-old girls, peppering them with questions about what they learned and who they played with. At home with his wife Samantha, he would always be facilitating the bubbles at bath time, meticulously brushing out tiny blonde and brunette ponytails, and tucking the giggling girls into bed after reading to them. But giggles have grown quiet as the young girls wonder what happened to their loving dad, who, in their eyes, simply vanished this summer. The girls haven’t seen him in 107 days. Surovtsev was unexpectedly detained during a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement on August 1, and never came home. Now, it’s unclear when his family will see him again as the father of two learned just days ago of his imminent deportation on Monday to Ukraine, a country ravaged by war, and one he hasn’t lived in since it was part of the Soviet Union. His detainment stems from President Donald Trump’s determination to arrest and deport undocumented migrants en masse – an effort fracturing families across the country as communities watch their workers, schoolchildren and church members be swept up by ICE. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment. Surovtsev had never so much as skipped an event at the girls’ school before missing his oldest daughter’s fifth birthday later in August. He was still absent for his wife’s birthday a month later, then their wedding anniversary, and soon to be the holidays – Surovtsev’s favorite time of year to spend with his family. Samantha has been telling her young daughters their dad is at work, and gave their oldest a locket with his picture inside after he was detained. She’s been wearing it more often in recent days, her mother said, asking the photo inside, “Daddy, come home.” “They’re too little to understand, and there’s no way to tell them without making them fearful of their own country,” Samantha said through tears. She and the girls have been living on savings as they accumulate attorney fees, and she said she feels like she’s going through life as a single mom. In a court filing on Wednesday, the Department of Justice confirmed it has arranged for Surovtsev to be removed to Ukraine on Monday. His attorneys say 82 other immigrants will be on Surovtsev’s flight with the same fate, and fear for their safety in wartime Ukraine. “I’m afraid that my life will be taken in this war, and my girls are going to have to grow up without their dad, my wife is going to have to be a widow, and I myself will lose my life in a war that I know nothing about,” Surovtsev said in a video reviewed by CNN his wife recorded during one of his calls to her from detention. Surovtsev found love, work and God after escaping Soviet rule Surovtsev was born in the USSR city of Zhdanov – which has since been renamed Mariupol in present-day Ukraine – in 1984. After his father, a Chernobyl nuclear power plant worker, died from radiation poisoning after it exploded, Surovtsev fled the USSR at 4 years old with his mother and two siblings. The family came to the US lawfully, forfeiting their USSR citizenship, and slept in a San Francisco church for six months before settling further north in Sacramento, court filings show. But poverty followed them across California. Surovtsev was a young child when he began stealing small toys in an effort to hide that his family was poor, court filings show, and he was around 7 years old when he started helping his mother work by cleaning homes and law offices. What followed was a boyhood marked by struggles to get by in his adopted country. In 2003, at 19 years old, Surovtsev began serving a 13-year sentence after helping some friends commit an armed carjacking of a motorcycle. Surovtsev was released early on good behavior in 2014. Following his sentence, an immigration court judge ordered him to be deported, costing him his green card. He was placed into ICE custody but ultimately released by the US government on an order of supervision, after it determined it wasn’t likely he would be removed from the country anytime soon, and in that case, continued detention would be unlawful, according to court filings. Without USSR citizenship or a green card, Surovtsev has since lived his life as a stateless person with a work permit, routinely checking in with ICE. He’s never violated the terms of his supervision order, his lawyers said in court filings. As his family found relief from Soviet rule in the United States, Surovtsev also found love, gratifying work, and God. In his early twenties, Surovtsev was baptized in prison. When he came to Christ, everything changed, his wife said. He met Samantha in 2017 while jet skiing with mutual friends in Orange County. The two married, bought a home in a suburb north of Dallas, started a painting business together and welcomed their two girls. “He created a life here, and he’s being ripped away from it,” she said. “The person he is on paper is not the person he is now. Twenty years have passed since he committed that crime and a lot of life has been lived.” Between juggling the family business and raising his daughters, Surovtsev was training to be part of a prison ministry where he could travel to jails offering religious services and support for detainees. Then, he was detained himself. At the Bluebonnet and Prairieland Detention Facilities in Texas he’s been held at since August, Surovtsev’s faith hasn’t wavered, his wife said. He leads a nightly Bible study with his fellow inmates. Since he anticipates boarding a flight to Ukraine Monday, the group held an extra session this weekend to rally around him in prayer one more time. “On Monday, the US government plans to deport 83 people to Ukraine where they will be conscripted into the army and likely killed. Ukraine is a police state where the population lives under martial law,” Surovstev’s attorneys Eric Lee and Chris Godshall-Bennett said in an emailed statement. Neither DHS nor the Ukrainian Embassy responded to CNN requests for comment on the flight to Ukraine. “Among the detainees are individuals who have lived in the US since they were kids. Many have US citizen spouses and children,” the lawyers wrote. “Some do not even speak Ukrainian, and others are not even Ukrainian citizens, having been born in the Soviet Union before Ukraine existed as a separate country.” Surovstev does not speak or read Ukrainian. Having fled at such a young age, Surovstev has very little memory of the former Soviet town where he was born, his wife said. Surovstev’s birthplace, present-day Mariupol, Ukraine, has endured some of the most devastating strikes and sieges from Russia during the war. The city’s infrastructure and housing were almost entirely destroyed, civilians suffer starvation, and thousands have been killed or displaced. Despite reconstruction efforts being promoted by Russian authorities, the city remains heavily damaged. Lawyers say Surovtsev is close to regaining his green card status The US government had run into trouble trying to deport Surovtsev before. Having been born in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Consulate told the US government in early 2015 it had no records of Surovtsev, his lawyers wrote in court filings. The Ukrainian government also said at the time it couldn’t confirm his citizenship and therefore could not issue him Ukrainian travel documents. Subsequently, Surovtsev was released from ICE custody in May 2015 without his green card but with an employment authorization document, a work permit, and was required to wear an ankle monitor for six weeks. He checked in with ICE every other week before his visits became quarterly, then annual. “Often when he met with officers, he was told that ICE had made a new attempt to contact the embassy of either Ukraine, Russia or both, but that either or both governments had refused to grant him travel documents,” his lawyers wrote in court filings. For years, he checked in at the kiosk of the Dallas ICE office, confirming details like his address and any travel plans. But on August 1, he was unexpectedly detained, and an officer refused to accept his stay of removal from his immigration counsel who accompanied him to the appointment, his lawyers write in court filings. But now it’s unclear what documentation Ukraine may have for Surovtsev’s deportation or what changed from a decade ago, when the country couldn’t prove his citizenship. “In 2014 and 2015, ICE tried and failed to deport Mr. Surovtsev to Ukraine when the Ukrainian consulate told them it couldn’t prove he was a citizen,” Lee, the attorney, said in a statement. “Now we are told Ukraine is giving ‘temporary passports’ to detainees, whatever that means. To this day Ukraine has never acknowledged Mr. Surovtsev is a citizen.” DHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on Surovtsev’s detainment. “He’s always complied, but we knew that maybe something would be different this year, just because of what was going on with this immigration crackdown,” his wife said. “We didn’t think that this would be our reality.” His detainment mobilized Samantha, when she said she became his “assistant full-time” as she tirelessly drafted a legal team to get him out. His attorneys successfully vacated Surovstev’s carjacking charge, essentially wiping it from his record, and will have him plead to a lesser charge that doesn’t have immigration consequences. This change in circumstances would justify reopening his case, which his team has filed for, Surovstev’s immigration lawyer Jennifer Rozdzielski said, and Surovstev’s lawful permanent resident status would be restored if a judge agreed to dismiss it. All his family and legal team can do is wait for the case to be heard, but it sits in a heavy queue of similar motions. There is no expedited process at the immigration court level, Rozdzielski said. “As a result of securing post-conviction relief for a past crime, he is likely to receive his green card once again very soon. And he has also not been given the opportunity to express his fear of being deported to an active warzone,” Surovstev’s attorneys Lee and Godshall-Bennett said. The flight to Ukraine is poised to take off before a judge could make any new rulings. The motion was filed on November 4, and his attorney estimates a two- to three-month timeline. “Our family, our community and our country is not better off with him gone,” Samantha said. “Even if he’s remaining in detention, we just want time for our case to be heard. That’s all we want.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/soviet-union-refugee-deported-ukraine-immigration","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-img-1516.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:37:36","author":"Danya Gainor","authors":["Danya Gainor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":379646272,"title":"Iran says it is willing to resume nuclear deal talks with US, demands 'respect and dignity'","text":"Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday that Tehran is willing to restart nuclear pact talks with the United States, provided they are conducted with “dignity and respect”.

Araghchi also maintained that Iran did not have any undeclared nuclear sites, and Tehran could not yet allow the UN nuclear inspectorate to visit bombed nuclear sites for security reasons. While speaking about the Israel-US strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Araghchi noted that the country has emerged stronger militarily and psychologically from the tragedy.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The remarks from the Iranian foreign minister came on the sidelines of the security conference in the country’s capital as he reiterated that Tehran has an inalienable right to enrich uranium domestically that it will never give up,” – the primary cause of the impasse in the previous talks.\nMore from World Chile's presidential poll heads to a December runoff as race between left & far-right remains close US-China rare earths deal expected by Thanksgiving, says Treasury Secretary Bessent It is pertinent to note that the five rounds of talks between Iran and the United States were brought to an abrupt and acrimonious end on 12 June when Israel, with US support, attacked Iranian nuclear sites in a 12-day war that ended with Donald Trump claiming the sites had been obliterated. Subsequently, European nations also used their right to snap back sanctions on the West Asian nation after the 2015 JCPOA expired.\nIran remains optimistic Iranian officials said they felt they had reached a “magic solution” to the enrichment issue in previous talks, when it was agreed that an Iran-based consortium, with American involvement, could enrich uranium. At that time, both sides claimed victory since domestic enrichment would have continued and the US would have assurance that Iran’s nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful.\nIranian officials claimed that they had reached an agreement with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff three times, only for the deal to collapse due to “spoilers in Washington”. Iran’s hope for renewed talks came a week after US President Donald Trump said he had been receiving messages that Tehran wanted to reopen negotiations.\nQuick Reads View All Russia, US in active talks on Ukraine settlement, Alaska summit outcomes shared with Kiev, says Kremlin aide Zelenskyy says Ukraine working on prisoner swaps that could free 1,200 captives However, Iranian officials say they are not yet receiving coherent offers from Washington either directly or from key regional mediators, such as Qatar, Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the Iranian foreign ministry has been accused of passivity in the face of Trump’s direct instinctive approach, but Tehran says diplomacy is not part of a show.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In his speech at the Sunday forum, Araghchi said the 12-day war showed the conflict could not be ended by military means. He said the attacks started with a US demand for an unconditional Iranian surrender and ended with an unconditional call for a ceasefire.\n“It was not Iran that had fled diplomacy; it was America and the Western countries that had always sought to impose their will during the negotiations. Diplomacy can still be alive and remains the ultimate solution to resolve disputes, but its criteria, rules and principles must be adhered to,\" Araghchi said in his address.\n“If they speak to the Iranian people with the language of dignity and respect, they will receive a response in the same language,\" he added. The Iranian foreign minister maintained that he was confident that Tehran’s defence capabilities “are much stronger than before 13 or 14 June of this year. All our capabilities have been restored. We learned many lessons from this war; we have come to know our own weaknesses and the weaknesses of the enemy.”\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “We successfully passed this war. Our nuclear technology, which they intended to destroy, remains in place.

Immigration rights groups and others have accused the administration of illegally detaining scores of law-abiding citizens caught up in the raids.DHS officials on Saturday said that the raids in Charlotte were a response to the refusal of local officials to comply with almost 1,400 \"detainer\" requests by immigration officials to hold suspects for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily be released.Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, and city commissioners have urged people to seek help, including from the Charlotte and Mecklenburg County Police Department, which is not participating in the federal raids.(With inputs from Reuters)","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trump-mass-deportation-campaign-picks-up-as-81-arrested-on-first-day-of-charlotte-immigration-crackdown-us-border-patrol-11763338826843.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/17/1600x900/logo/IMMIGRATION-POLITICS-0_1763339134008_1763339142658.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:32:27","author":"Akriti Anand","authors":["Akriti Anand"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":379648606,"title":"The oil pipeline feud testing Canada's global ambitions","text":"As Canada looks to untangle itself economically from the US, the country's landlocked oil patch is eyeing new customers in Asia through a pipeline to the Pacific. Not everyone is on board.\n\nThe oil-rich province of Alberta has had one demand for Prime Minister Mark Carney: Help us build an oil pipeline — and fast.\n\nIt's no small task — in fact, some argue it has become near-impossible to build a pipeline in Canada because of laws designed to bolster environmental protections. Three oil pipelines have died on the vine in the past decade over fierce opposition.\n\nBut Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is not deterred.\n\nHer conservative government has taken the unusual step of drafting its own proposal for a pipeline from the Alberta oil sands to British Columbia's northern Pacific coast, aimed at reaching Asian markets. Still in the early stages, Smith hopes that by doing the groundwork a private company will eventually take over and build it.\n\nNeighbouring British Columbia, however, is firmly against it. Premier David Eby, with the left-leaning NDP, has dismissed Smith's plan as \"fictional\" and \"political\", arguing no company wants the burden of taking it on. He also accused Smith of jeopardising his own province's ambitions to expand liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Asia. \n\nSmith in turn, has called him \"un-Canadian\".\n\nThe feud between the Western provinces comes at a critical time. Canada is trying to wean itself off its economic dependence on the US amid President Donald Trump's tariffs, and Carney has signalled his desire to double non-US exports in the next decade. \n\nThat includes positioning Canada as a global \"energy superpower\". Almost all of its energy exports, including crude oil, are currently sold to the US.\n\nOn Thursday, Carney unveiled new \"nation-building projects\" he says are key to Canada's growth. The list did not include a pipeline, but does include critical minerals mines and an LNG project in BC.\n\nWith Canada home to one of the world's largest oil reserves, Carney is now facing questions from Albertans over whether he can achieve his goals without first solving the internal rifts.\n\n\"It is the perennial problem,\" said Heather Exner-Pirot, director of natural resources, energy and the environment at the MacDonald-Laurier Institute think tank, and who is based in Calgary, Alberta.\n\n\"It is unfortunately the main wedge issue in Canadian politics it seems like, and trust me when I say no one in Alberta wishes that their oil was the wedge issue in this country.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkz42yz35do","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/95ef/live/f34e05c0-c0d1-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:31:20","author":"Nadine Yousif","authors":["Nadine Yousif"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":379647600,"title":"School Assembly News Headlines For November 17: Top National, International & Others News","text":"News Headlines for School Assembly, November 17, 2025: From former Union Minister RK Singh announcing his resignation from the BJP to Indian equity markets ending the week on a high note, here are today’s top news highlights for today.\nTop National News:\n– Former Union Minister RK Singh announced his resignation from the BJP on Saturday, just hours after being suspended and receiving a show-cause notice which he claims did not specify the charges against him.\n– The Election Commission of India (ECI) has informed the Supreme Court that it has instructed officials in Bihar to use Aadhaar strictly as proof of identity, not citizenship, while updating the state’s revised electoral roll.\nTop International News:\n– US border czar Tom Homan, responsible for removing illegal immigrants from the United States, stated that the Catholic Church’s stance on President Donald Trump’s administration’s mass deportations is “wrong”.\n– Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI continues its ‘disappear and dump’ policy in Balochistan, according to top intelligence sources.

The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford and other warships, announced by the Navy in a statement, marks a major moment in what the administration insists is a counterdrug operation but has been seen as an escalating pressure tactic against Maduro.\n\nWhen asked Sunday what he meant when he said Maduro wants to talk, Trump simply said: “What does it mean? You tell me, I don’t know.”\n\n“I’ll talk to anybody,\" he added a few moments later. \"We’ll see what happens.”\n\nThe Ford rounds off the largest buildup of U.S. firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear\" mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines.\n\nThe carrier’s arrival came as the military announced its latest deadly strike on a small boat it claims was engaged in ferrying illegal drugs. The military’s Southern Command posted a video on X on Sunday showing the boat being blown up, an attack it said took place Saturday in international waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean and killed three men. The military did not immediately respond to a request for more information.\n\nSince early September, such strikes by the U.S. in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have now killed at least 83 people in 21 attacks.\n\nThe carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.\n\nRear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to \"protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey, the commander who oversees the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a statement that the American forces “stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region.”\n\nHolsey, who will retire next month after just a year on the job, said the strike group's deployment is \"a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland.”\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 7 miles from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun “training exercises” with the U.S. military that will run through much of the week.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Sean Sobers described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month and said they are aimed at tackling violent crime on the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. The prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the U.S. military strikes.\n\nThe exercises will include Marines from the 22nd Expeditionary Unit who have been stationed aboard the Navy ships that have been looming off Venezuela's coast for months. \n\nVenezuela’s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression. It had no immediate comment Sunday on the arrival of the aircraft carrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that U.S. troops have been training in Panama, underscoring the administration’s increasing focus on Latin America.\n\n“We’re reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever” Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth needed, he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.\"\n\nThe administration has insisted that the buildup of American forces in the region is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the U.S., but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were “narcoterrorists.” Trump has indicated military action would expand beyond strikes by sea, saying the U.S. would \"stop the drugs coming in by land.”\n\nThe U.S. has long used aircraft carriers to pressure and deter aggression by other nations because their warplanes can strike targets deep inside another country. Some experts say the Ford is ill-suited to fighting cartels, but it could be an effective instrument of intimidation for Maduro in a push to get him to step down.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio says the United States does not recognize Maduro, who was widely accused of stealing last year’s election, as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Rubio has called Venezuela's government a “transshipment organization” that openly cooperates with those trafficking drugs.\n\nRubio said in a statement released Sunday evening that the State Department intends to designate Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, a foreign terrorist organization. Rubio said the cartel is headed by Maduro and other high-ranking members of his government and is among those “responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.” When the designation takes effect on Nov. 24, it will be a crime to provide “material support” to the cartel or its members.\n\nMaduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S., has said the U.S. government is “fabricating” a war against him. On his Facebook page, Maduro wrote on Sunday that the “Venezuelan people are ready to defend their homeland against any criminal aggression.”\n\nVenezuela’s government recently touted a “massive” mobilization of troops and civilians to defend against possible U.S. attacks. Maduro and other officials in Venezuela’s socialist party also have been attending rallies this weekend to back the creation of neighborhood committees that will be in charge of increasing membership in Venezuela’s socialist party, and promoting the party’s policies.\n\nTrump has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nHe has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the U.N. human rights chief and U.S. lawmakers, including Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes. \n\nSenate Republicans, however, recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Trump’s ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization.\n\nExperts disagree on whether or not American warplanes may be used to strike land targets inside Venezuela. Either way, the 100,000-ton warship is sending a message.\n\n“This is the anchor of what it means to have U.S. military power once again in Latin America,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for the Andes region. “And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the U.S. is to really use military force.”\n\nFinley reported from Washington.

Jibari Brisport told those gathered that he twice tried to work with Hochul on passing universal childcare legislation, only to get rebuffed.\n\n“Kathy Hochul, if you get a third strike, you’re out!” Brisport said to whoops and applause at the rally.\n\nBrisport said, “There’s no way to get universal child care without raising taxes on the rich,” and that Hochul has to cooperate.\n\n“So if she [Hochul] does sabotage it and blocks it then I think the plan is that she has to go,” Brisport said.\n\nMamdani wants the state government to increase taxes on the wealthy and up the corporate tax to pay for his agenda, which includes free universal child care and bus service and a ramping of housing construction.\n\nHochul endorsed the democratic socialist in the general election, but has said she would hold the line on taxes — a stance that immediately puts her at odds with Mamdani and his energized supporters.\n\nCritics and political insiders have said Hochul created the situation by some of her own doing — with her support for Mamdani having empowered the leftwing of the party. DSA-backed challenges are now possible for anyone who doesn’t go along with its extensive policy goals.\n\nDSA co-chair Gustavo Gordillo set the tone at the start of the rally, saying the DSA member Mamdani’s win in the mayoral election provides the mandate for a tax increase.\n\n“The corporate press and the political establishment tell us it won’t be possible to tax the rich. They’re saying Governor Hochul is opposed to raising taxes,” Gordillo said. \n\n“Well, Governor Hochul, 12 days ago [on Election Day], over 1 million voters in New York made it very clear what we want,” he added.\n\nThe political threats come as state lawmakers are already ready to act on the tax plan — weeks before Mamdani takes office.\n\nState Sen. John Liu (D-Queens) and Assemblywoman Phara Souffrant Forrest (D-Brooklyn) just introduced a bill that would allow the city to impose a 2% surcharge on New Yorkers’ incomes over $1 million.\n\nUnder the bill, an individual making $1.5 million would face a surcharge on the $500,000 above the threshold.\n\nThey claim the surcharge could rise to $4 billion a year.\n\nThe revenues from the tax hike would go to expand healthcare, affordable housing, universal childcare, transit improvements, safe streets and other essential needs, the lawmakers said.\n\n“New Yorkers are insufferably squeezed by stagnant wages and escalating costs, a crisis that is only getting worse with new federal policies designed to benefit the wealthiest and punish working people,” said Liu, the former city comptroller and Mamdani ally.\n\n“It is entirely fair and appropriate to ask the highest income people, who just got a 2.6 percent tax cut from Donald Trump, to support a 2 percent increase in order for New York to generate the revenue needed to strengthen our economy and not leave working New Yorkers behind,” Liu added.\n\nLiu spokesman Scott Sieber said the senator introduced the millionaires’ tax bill following discussions with other senators and “fully expects bill cosponsors as the legislative session opens in January.”\n\nState Sen. Mike Gianaris (D-Queens), the deputy majority leader and second most powerful lawmaker, told The Post he’ll use his influence to get Albany to back Mamdani’s programs.\n\nGianaris and Mamdani have overlapping districts in western Queens and they teamed up in the past to steer $15 million in state funds to finance experimental free bus service in Queens.\n\nAsked about the $800 million cost to make bus service free, he said, “We do programs of that size every year in the budget.”\n\nHe also said Senate Democrats have pushed bills to advance subsidized child care.\n\n“I’m 100 percent going to push for this,” Gianaris said, calling financing for universal child care and free buses “important and necessary.”\n\nHochul, the most powerful player in budget talks, said she opposes raising income taxes or diverting funds from the MTA to subsidize bus fares as she faces voters next year, in what is expected to be a tough race, likely against upstate Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik.\n\nThe governor does not support raising the 7.3% corporate tax either, which Mamdani wants to raise to 11%, sources close to Hochul said. That plan would move New York from 17th among states to tied for first with New Jersey, sources close to the governor said.\n\nBut she has not taken a corporate tax hike off the table either, if the state has to close a multi-billion budget gap.\n\nWhile trying to navigate a growing movement on her left flank to raise taxes, the business community will resist a rise in corporate taxes, which would become an issue in the general election.\n\nJersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, the incoming CEO of the influential Partnership of the City of New York, said Mamdani’s proposal to boost the state’s business tax rate would be “absolute suicide.”\n\n“This proposal is absolute suicide for NYC and an absolute dream for NJ,” Fulop said.\n\nHe noted that businesses in the city pay other taxes that would raise would raise their overall rates to 16%.","summary":"Gov. Kathy Hochul is between Zohran Mamdani and a hard place.

Information about Epstein’s victims or ongoing federal investigations would be allowed to be redacted.\n\n“There could be 100 or more” votes from Republicans, said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., among the lawmakers discussing the legislation on Sunday news show appearances. “I’m hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote.”\n\nMassie and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., introduced a discharge petition in July to force a vote on their bill. That is a rarely successful tool that allows a majority of members to bypass House leadership and force a floor vote.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had panned the discharge petition effort and sent members home early for their August recess when the GOP’s legislative agenda was upended in the clamoring for an Epstein vote. Democrats also contend the seating of Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., was stalled to delay her becoming the 218th member to sign the petition and gain the threshold needed to force a vote. She became the 218th signature moments after taking the oath of office last week.\n\nMassie said Johnson, Trump and others who have been critical of his efforts would be “taking a big loss this week.”\n\n“I’m not tired of winning yet, but we are winning,” Massie said.\n\nThe view from GOP leadership\n\nJohnson seems to expect the House will decisively back the Epstein bill.\n\n“We’ll just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide,” he said, adding that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been releasing “far more information than the discharge petition, their little gambit.”\n\nThe vote comes at a time when new documents are raising fresh questions about Epstein and his associates, including a 2019 email that Epstein wrote to a journalist that said Trump “knew about the girls.” The White House has accused Democrats of selectively leaking the emails to smear the Republican president.\n\nJohnson said Trump “has nothing to hide from this.”\n\n“They’re doing this to go after President Trump on this theory that he has something to do with it. He does not,” Johnson said.\n\nTrump’s association with Epstein is well-established and the president’s name was included in records that his own Justice Department released in February as part of an effort to satisfy public interest in information from the sex-trafficking investigation.\n\nTrump has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and the mere inclusion of someone’s name in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise. Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial, also had many prominent acquaintances in political and celebrity circles besides Trump.\n\nKhanna voiced more modest expectations on the vote count than Massie. Still, Khanna said he was hoping for 40 or more Republicans to join the effort.\n\n“I don’t even know how involved Trump was,” Khanna said. “There are a lot of other people involved who have to be held accountable.”\n\nKhanna also asked Trump to meet with those who were abused. Some will be at the Capitol on Tuesday for a news conference, he said.\n\nMassie said Republican lawmakers who fear losing Trump’s endorsement because of how they vote will have a mark on their record, if they vote “no,” that could hurt their political prospects in the long term.\n\n“The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” Massie said.\n\nOn the Republican side, three Republicans joined with Massie in signing the discharge petition: Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.","summary":"Lawmakers seeking to force the release of files related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein are predicting a big win in the House this week with a \"deluge of Republicans\" voting for their bill and bucking the GOP leadership and President Donald Trump, who for months have disparaged their effort.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/16/epstein-vote-looms-over-house/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-NEWS-MAXWELL-ZUM.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:18:02","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":379644148,"title":"US to designate alleged Maduro-led cartel as foreign terrorist organization","text":"Rubio also claimed the cartel is led by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and “his cronies” who have “corrupted Venezuela’s military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary.”\n\nThe intended designation follows a slew of them on other drug cartels last winter, shortly after President Donald Trump reentered the Oval Office.

The changes in its leadership and strategic direction have sparked diverse reactions among the city’s arts community.\n\nDuring his second term, the President has aimed to reshape Washington’s leading arts institution according to his vision, a move first signaled by his decision to dismiss the entire board in his initial month in office.\n\nSubsequently, President Trump assumed the role of board chairman and appointed Ric Grenell, Special Presidential Envoy, as the acting president and executive director of the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe first couple, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, both attended a showing of ‘Les Misérables’ at the iconic venue in early June.\n\nThese changes have coincided with an increased emphasis on presenting classical performances, some of which have experienced high demand and sold-out audiences.\n\nThe Kennedy Center is presently home to the WNO as well as the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), which also performed to a sold-out crowd for their season opener at the end of September.\n\nDespite narratives of declining ticket sales and questions about WNO’s relationship with the Kennedy Center, the packed debut of ‘Figaro’ challenged these concerns.\n\nSome have even called for boycotts of the venue in the Trump era from both performers and audiences. \n\nHowever, Washingtonians of all stripes, decked out in everything from glittering gowns and full tuxedos to cashmere quarter zip sweaters and Lululemon trousers, came together to support the talented creatives on stage, as well as the dozens of staff who help run the capital’s premier arts and entertainment venue.\n\nAlthough Friday’s debut did not feature a red carpet, President Donald and First Lady Melania Trump have walked on the Center’s previous red carpets, as have other key cabinet members and A-list guests.\n\nThe president and first lady, as well as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Cheryl Hines, were among the notable attendees at the premiere of Les Misérables in June.\n\nThe musical’s entire five-week run was sold out, generating ‘135% of planned revenue’ and welcoming ‘over 85,000 patrons’ per a Kennedy Center press release shared this past summer.\n\nThe NSO’s gala opening was attended by media personality and celebrity investor Kevin O’Leary, as well as Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, who chaired the gala dinner.\n\nPrior to Congress’s August Recess, an amendment was made to a funding legislation that contains line items to fund the Kennedy Center, proposing to rename the opera house after First Lady Melania Trump, who serves as the Honorary Chair of the Center’s Board of Trustees.\n\nThe move was spurred by Republican Congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho, who is Chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\n‘Naming a theater after her is an excellent way to recognize her appreciation for the arts,’ said Rep. Simpson at the time.\n\n‘As Chairman of the House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee – which oversees federal funding for capital repairs and operations and maintenance at the Kennedy Center – I am proud to honor her support and commitment in promoting the arts and humanities.’\n\nCongressman Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat from Texas, criticized the proposed theater renaming, arguing it reflects Republican priorities that he views as misplaced in the context of national cultural discussions.\n\nThe move has also been ridiculed by members of the Kennedy family.\n\nMaria Shriver, the daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, said the idea of renaming the iconic cultural center makes her ‘blood boil.’\n\n‘This is insane. It makes my blood boil. It’s so ridiculous, so petty, so small minded. Truly, what is this about? It’s always about something. “Let’s get rid of the Rose Garden. Let’s rename the Kennedy Center.” What’s next?,’ she wrote on social media.\n\nShriver, the former first lady of California, is the niece of President John F. Kennedy, for whom the center is named.\n\nOther Kennedy family members had a similar reaction.\n\nJack Schlossberg, the former president’s lone grandson, raged about the matter on Instagram, writing: ‘Plain reading of the statute makes clear – You cant do that.’\n\nSchlossberg has recently announced his own entry into electoral politics, sharing that he is running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, which is being vacated by retiring longtime Democrat Jerry Nadler.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Kennedy Center’s Opera House was bustling with activity on Friday night&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kennedy Center Experiences Surge in Attendance as Plans to Rename Stage in Honor of Melania Trump Unfold first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/kennedy-center-experiences-surge-in-attendance-as-plans-to-rename-stage-in-honor-of-melania-trump-unfold/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MAGA-takeover-of-Kennedy-Center-sees-latest-success-as-shows.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:16:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.375},{"id":379643542,"title":"Loomered: Trump Withdraws Nominee For Top IRS Lawyer","text":"President Donald Trump on Friday withdrew the nomination of veteran tax attorney Donald L.

The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would designate an alleged drug organization, Cartel de los Soles, as a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" which makes it a crime for anyone in the United States to provide material support to the group. U.S. officials have accused Cartel de los Soles of working with the criminal organization Tren de Aragua to send narcotics to the United States. The Trump administration has said that Maduro leads Cartel de Los Soles, which he denies. The Pentagon has deployed warships, fighter jets and a nuclear submarine to the Caribbean as U.S. officials consider taking military action against the Maduro government. The news of possible discussions between the United States and Venezuela came as the Pentagon announced another attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the eastern Pacific. The attack on Saturday killed three people, the Pentagon said. \"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" the U.S. Southern Command announced in a post on social media. The announcement said the boat was in international waters when it was struck by Joint Task Force Southern Spear. It was the 21st known attack on drug boats by the U.S. military since early September in what it has called a justified effort to disrupt the flow of narcotics into the United States. The strikes have killed more than 80 people, according to Pentagon figures. Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress, human rights groups and U.S. allies have raised questions about the legality of the attacks. The Trump administration has said it has the legal authority to carry out the strikes, with the Justice Department providing a legal opinion that justifies them and argues that U.S. military personnel who carry out the operations are immune from prosecution.

'Unless you're a fake MAGA.'\n\nSanders also denied Trump's assertion that her mother is becoming more liberal, following an appearance on The View.\n\n'Let me be clear - Marjorie Taylor Greene is not becoming a Democrat. Never has been. Never will be,' she posted on Instagram, along with a clip from the interview.\n\n'What she is becoming... is a bigger problem for the Left - and for the weak, woke \"Right,\"' Sanders asserted.\n\n'My mom is unapologetically America First. She's not in politics to play games - she's in it to fight for the truth, for our freedom and for the future of this country.'\n\n'Some people on the Right may not agree with her for going on The View,' the 27-year-old noted as she invoked the words of the late Charlie Kirk: 'When people stop talking, really bad stuff starts… when civilization stops talking, civil war ensues.'\n\n'My mom chooses courage over comfort, every single time,' Sanders concluded. \n\n'She’d rather stand alone in the truth than blend in with corruption,' she wrote. 'That’s real leadership. That’s real America First.'\n\nSanders has also used her platform to ask the public for prayers for her mother's safety, after Greene claimed she is receiving death threats.\n\nAs tensions continued, Sanders shared a clip of her mother's tirade against the president on CNN Sunday, writing: 'So proud of you for fighting for the TRUTH!'\n\nThe 27-year-old announced her public online presence in a Facebook post in March, along with a photo of her, her mother, Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\n'Hi friends and patriots!' she wrote at the time. 'I recently decided to take a leap and go public on social media! I'll be sharing my life, thoughts and experiences - everything from faith and patriotism to creativity and everyday moments.\n\n'Excited to connect with like-minded people,' Sanders wrote.\n\nBut since the post, Sanders's mother has notably disagreed with the president on a number of issues - from healthcare to tariffs, to his administration's failure to release documents related to Epstein's crimes.\n\nIn her interview on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Greene even scorned Trump for welcoming Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa to the White House this week.\n\nThe Saudi-born leader joined al-Qaeda in Iraq just before the US invasion in 2003.

I stand with rape victims, I stand with children who are in terrible sex abuse situations, and I stand with survivors of trafficking and those that are trapped in sex trafficking', Greene told Dana Bash, adding that she would keep playing her 'small part' for the files to be released because 'rich and powerful people' should not be protected if they have done anything wrong. \n\nGreene has gained some support for her actions, with Republicans from her conservative district said they will stand behind her amid her feud with the president. \n\nMeanwhile, Greene's boyfriend, Brian Glenn, is gaining flack for sharing a photo of them together and declaring: 'I love this woman.'\n\nTrump's self-appointed loyalty enforcer Laura Loomer then declared he should lose his press pass as the chief White House correspondent for pro-Trump outlet Real America's Voice.\n\nGlenn returned fire on Loomer by replying 'Shut up b***h' with a laughing emoji, an apparent reference to her telling Greene to do the same thing.\n\nLoomer continued their budding feud with: 'Oh no MTG's boyfriend who cheated on his wife to be with an ape is calling me a b***h. How will I ever recover?'\n\nWho the 'ape' Loomer was referring to was not specified, but the Daily Mail caught Greene and Glenn together in 2022 while they were still married.\n\nGlenn left his then-wife Kerry just three days after Greene's then-husband Perry filed for divorce in September 2022.\n\nHe insisted at the time they were not an item and the two divorce filings were not connected, but by early 2023 they were openly dating.","summary":"Marjorie Taylor Greene 's lookalike daughter has come to her defense amid her viral rift with President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15296921/Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-daughter-defense-Trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/17/00/103930533-0-image-m-25_1763337698107.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:12:48","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.001},{"id":379643276,"title":"Hamas bus bomber who killed Briton is now among 15 terrorists freed in Turkey - and is happily wandering the streets","text":"A Hamas terrorist who murdered a British woman is among more than a dozen dangerous extremists living freely in Turkey after being released from Israeli jails.\n\nSecurity experts have warned of 'a serious concern' for the four million British tourists who visit each year.\n\nIshaq Taher Salah Arafah, 39, murdered Scottish-born Bible translator Mary Jane Gardner, 59, in a 2011 bomb attack in Israel.\n\nThe Daily Mail can reveal he is now at large in Istanbul.

With its arrival, the 'Operation Southern Spear' mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines. \n\nThe carrier strike group, which includes squadrons of fighter jets and guided-missile destroyers, transited the Anegada Passage near the British Virgin Islands on Sunday morning, the Navy said.\n\nRear Admiral Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to 'protect our nation's security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere.'\n\nAdmiral Alvin Holsey, the commander who oversees the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a statement that the American forces 'stand ready to combat the transnational threats that seek to destabilize our region.'\n\nHolsey, who will retire next month after just a year on the job, said the strike group's deployment is 'a critical step in reinforcing our resolve to protect the security of the Western Hemisphere and the safety of the American Homeland.'\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, which is only seven miles from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun 'training exercises' with the US military that will run through much of the week.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Sean Sobers described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month and said they are aimed at tackling violent crime on the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. \n\nThe prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the US military strikes.\n\nThe exercises will include Marines from the 22nd Expeditionary Unit who have been stationed aboard the Navy ships that have been looming off Venezuela's coast for months.\n\nVenezuela´s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression. It had no immediate comment Sunday on the arrival of the aircraft carrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said Sunday that US troops have been training in Panama, underscoring the administration´s increasing focus on Latin America.\n\n'We´re reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever' Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth needed, he told CBS´ 'Face the Nation.' \n\nThe administration has insisted that the buildup of American forces in the region is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the US, but it has released no evidence to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were 'narcoterrorists.' \n\nTrump has indicated military action would expand beyond strikes by sea, saying the US would 'stop the drugs coming in by land.'\n\nThe US has long used aircraft carriers to pressure and deter aggression by other nations because their warplanes can strike targets deep inside another country. \n\nSome experts say the Ford is ill-suited to fighting cartels, but it could be an effective instrument of intimidation for Maduro in a push to get him to step down.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio says the United States does not recognize Maduro, who was widely accused of stealing last year's election, as Venezuela´s legitimate leader. \n\nRubio has called Venezuela's government a 'transshipment organization' that openly cooperates with those trafficking drugs.\n\nThe secretary said in a statement released Sunday evening that the State Department intends to designate Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, a foreign terrorist organization. \n\nThe secretary said the cartel is headed by Maduro and other high-ranking members of his government and is among those 'responsible for terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere as well as for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe.' \n\nWhen the designation takes effect on Nov. 24, it will be a crime to provide 'material support' to the cartel or its members.\n\nMaduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the US, has said the US government is 'fabricating' a war against him. \n\nOn his Facebook page, Maduro wrote on Sunday that the 'Venezuelan people are ready to defend their homeland against any criminal aggression.'\n\nTrump has justified the attacks on drug boats by saying the US is in \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels while claiming the boats are operated by foreign terrorist organizations .\n\nHe has faced pushback from leaders in the region, the UN human rights chief and US lawmakers, including Republicans, who have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the boat strikes.\n\nSenate Republicans, however, recently voted to reject legislation that would have put a check on Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela without congressional authorization.","summary":"The nation's most advanced aircraft carrier - USS Gerald R Ford - arrived in the Caribbean Sea on Sunday in a display of US military power.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15296773/narco-terrorists-aircraft-carrier-Caribbean-Venezuela.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/16/23/103929591-0-image-a-14_1763336501669.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:03:43","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Trump has urged Republicans not to aid Democrats in spreading what he called \"the Epstein hoax,\" arguing that his opponents were seeking to undermine his presidency.\n Greene has also criticized US aid to Israel and Ukraine and claimed that Epstein may have been an Israeli agent.\n\n Discover moreImage news galleryLatest News HeadlinesNews aggregation serviceSports memorabilia team jerseysPolitical science coursesStock market trading platformsLanguage learning softwareWorld news digestMedia company profilesGeopolitical risk assessments\n\n Discover moreDigital newspaper subscriptionPolitical science coursesNewspaper archives accessBreaking News UpdatesLanguage learning softwareNews subscription serviceInternational relations newsMedia company profilesNews aggregation toolsNews headlines feed\n\n Wild looking to continue surge against HurricanesJerome Miron-Imagn Images)Big News NetworkUndoSantos looks to continue hot streakBig News NetworkUndoKnicks continue homestand, hope to freeze red-hot SunsBig News NetworkUndoTrump allies believe Zelensky should leave Ukraine 'immediately' - mediaVladimir Zelensky should departure for France as frustration is growing in Washington, according to a New York Post report Read Full Article at RT.comBig News NetworkUndoGermany weighs easing debt rules to boost defense spendingBig News NetworkUndoEpstein files will make you sick US Attorney GeneralBig News NetworkUndo\n\n Read This Next\n\n Discover moreInternational relations books\n\n Berkshire unveils $4.3B Alphabet bet as Apple trimming continues\n\n Verizon to slash 15,000 jobs in largest layoff under new CEO\n\n Swiss machine maker hit by U.S. tariffs and auto sector slowdown\n\n Disney, YouTube TV end two-week blackout with new carriage deal\n\n IEA warns global oil and gas demand may keep rising until 2050\n\nBig News Network\n\nBig News Network News Agency\nMidwest Radio Network\nMainstream Media\n\nBIG NEWS NETWORK.COM\n\nContact & Support\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPRODUCTS & SERVICES\n\nNews Releases\n\nCopyright © 1998-2025 Big News Network All rights reserved.

The US President Donald Trump’s decision to slash tariffs on a wide range of agricultural and processed-food imports marks a notable shift in his trade posture — a move driven as much by domestic compulsions as by emerging geopolitical recalibrations. But this gives India a relief it has been waiting for, as its agricultural sector was badly hit by Trump’s tariffs. The revised list exempts 254 products — including 229 agricultural items — from the scope of reciprocal tariffs imposed earlier. The biggest relief in this category would be for exporters of fruits, nuts, spices, tea, coffee, cocoa preparations, essential oils, and value-added food ingredients — almost all the products that find their way to the US.\n\nThough these items constitute a small portion of India’s exports to the US, they represent more than $1 billion worth of agricultural exports. But these items support thousands of farmers and agro-processors.\n\nZero tariffs on agri products give Indian exporters a level playing field vis-à-vis other Asian nations. India already enjoys credibility as a consistent supplier of high-quality agri products, backed by strong distribution networks and diaspora-driven demand — tea and coffee extracts, processed fruit products, and essential oils — would now be competitively priced in the US market.\n\nHowever, the big question is: why this sudden change of heart? Why is Donald Trump — who built his political career on aggressive tariff policies — suddenly softening his stance?\n\nThe answer lies squarely in US domestic politics. American consumers have been grappling with high food prices for months. Besides, the Democrats’ victories in states also rang alarm bells. Economic anxiety contributed to significant Democratic wins in Virginia and New Jersey. Trump’s climbdown is not just an economic decision — it is a political necessity with immediate electoral implications.\n\nThis reconsideration comes on the heels of Trump’s decision to restore parity in student visa fees for international applicants, including Indians. Both steps indicate an awareness that punitive economic measures — whether on imports or immigration-linked fees — lead to economic chaos and unease in his core vote banks.\n\nYet, these shifts may also reflect a broader strategic recalibration. With geopolitical competition sharpening and partnerships with India becoming more critical, Washington cannot afford to alienate India beyond a point. Easing tariffs on agri products may be the first in a sequence of pragmatic adjustments aimed at consolidating alliances and stabilising domestic markets simultaneously.\n\nFor India, the tariff rollback is a major relief. Trump would be realising that tariffs as a tool of foreign policy are not that effective after all. Economic realism would indeed be required for political headway. India, meanwhile, must be ready to seize the moment.","url":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/2025/columnists/trump-s-agri-tariff-rollback-signals-reset.html","image":"https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-17 00:00:00","author":"Daily Pioneer","authors":["Daily Pioneer"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":379643598,"title":"‘Last Samurai Standing’ Episode 3 Recap: Rebel Alliance","text":"Samurai schools are failing our children. There, I said it. Kyohachi-ryu School, “the origin of swordsmanship” if its brochure is to be believed, has one teacher and eight students — okay, so they’ve got class size under control at least — but they all have to kill each other to graduate. That’s a pedagogical method that would have even Donald Trump’s weird, pedophile-enabling Education Department destroyer Linda McMahon going “hey, slow down.” \n\nBut that’s the origin story not just for Shujiro, hero of Last Samurai Standing, but several other of the surviving contestants in this big sinister game called “Kudoku.” (More on that later.) There’s Iroha Kinugasa (Kaya Kiohara), the School’s one female student, who hates Shujiro for abandoning his fellow students before the final showdown they apparently all knew had to take place before the end. \n\nIn the chaos that follows, the school’s Master (Uzaki Ryudo) decides all the other students must die to safeguard the legendary School’s lethal secrets. To that end, he sets loose his terrifying enforcer, a towering old man who breathes in ghostly gusts and carries the bell-jingling staff of a Buddhist monk: Gentosai (Hiroshi Abe), the nearly supernatural old man we’ve watched slice through whole groups of rival warriors like a hot knife through butter. Iroha has spent her life on the run from this psycho ever since, and she blames Shujiro for dooming her to that fate.\n\nPersonally? I think she should be grateful. Had things gone to the Master’s plan, after all, there would have been only one survivor among the students. Now we know that in addition to Gentosai, at least three survivors of the School are participating in the game: Shujiro, Iroha, and Sansuke (Yuya Endo), who has yet to reveal himself to the others, perhaps out of fear of Gentosai.\n\nIn the meantime, however, Iroha decides to join forces with Shujiro and his youthful ward, Fubata. To this crew you can add the ninja, Kyojin, who remains charming as ever as he explains the nature of the game they’re all in. Based in part on a hint given to Shujiro by a guard, who refers to his team as “three bugs,” they recognize Kudoku as a crabs-in-a-bucket-type situation. It’s based on the kind of sick game where a variety of insects are placed in a jar and sealed in, allowed to kill each other until only one remains. They may have to kill each other eventually, but for now their goal is not only survival, but finding out who’s behind all this. \n\nKyojin even gets them — well, not Iroha — to shake on it. “It’s called a handshake,” he explains cheerfully. “It’s a foreign greeting. It means I’m not holding anything in my hands, and I trust you.” That’s actually a really nice way to put it, Kyojin!\n\nAlong the way, the group receive help from another unlikely ally: Kamuykocha (Shota Sometani), the ace archer with the distinctive white-and-black robe. He’s Ainu, a minority group from the northern island of Hokkaido so marginalized by mainstream Japanese society that Fubata has never heard of them and needs Shujiro to explain who they are. He saves our heroes from a group of attackers because, he says, his people regard those who kill children as the lowest of the low, and those who defend them as among the best. As long as Fubata remains with Shujiro and Iroha, the older warriors have nothing to fear from him. \n\nThere are still plenty of reasons Shurjiro and company to worry, however. Gentosai is out there, clearly looking to finish what he started at the school all those years ago. So is Bukotsu, aka the Savage Slasher, whom Shujiro and Fubata narrowly escaped last episode.\n\nWho’s presiding over it all? It may be a mystery to Kyojin, but the government now has the case cracked — to its great dismay. Lord Okuba (Arata Iura), the official who’s been looking into the worrying reports of ex-samurai activity in the area surrounding Kyoto, learns from his police chief, Kawaji (Gaku Hamada), that the four biggest business conglomerates supporting the Meiji government are themselves funding the chaos. \n\nAll the while, the representatives of these companies, known as zaibatsu, place bets on which contestants will pass each checkpoint first. The heads of Mitsui (Yoshi Sakou), Sumitomo (Takaaki Enoki), Yasuda (Satoru Matsuo), and Mitsubishi (Toshihiro Yashiba) — like Okuba and Kawaji, these are real historical figures — enjoy all the amenities of modern Japanese society while they play their part in the big game. All the while they’re attended to by the smiling butler (Daisuke Kuroda) who serves as liaison to the still-unseen Organizer.\n\nWho might that be? I suppose it’s possible it’s the Emperor himself, but it seems more likely it’s someone we’ve already met, most likely a contestant. I’m not sure who fits the bill myself; I’d guess Fubata, just for maximum mind-fuck potential, but we’ve already seen her backstory. Unless that flashback was a full-fledged lie — a dirty trick for a show to pull — we can rule her out. Who knows: Maybe the whole thing was orchestrated by the Master in an attempt to lure his surviving students out of hiding for Gentosai to pick off one by one. \n\nA pair of smaller mysteries pulls us into the next episode: What is the secret purpose Iroha wants Shujiro to fulfill to make up for his desertion? And what is the “experiment” Kyojin has in mind? With 95 samurai still standing, there’s no guarantee either fighter will get what they’re after. In the meantime, the finish line awaits them in Tokyo.\n\nSean T.

Bitcoin soared to a record US$126,251 on Oct 6, only to begin tumbling four days later after unexpected comments on tariffs by Mr Trump sent markets into a tailspin worldwide. \n\n“The general market is risk-off,” said Matthew Hougan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management. “Crypto was the canary in the coal mine for that, it was the first to flinch.”\n\nOver the past month, many of the biggest buyers – from exchange-traded fund (ETF) allocators to corporate treasuries – have quietly stepped back, depriving the market of the flow-driven support that helped propel the token to records earlier in 2025. At the same time, the recent cooling of high-flying technology stocks has led to a drop in overall risk appetite.\n\nFor much of the year, institutions were the backbone of Bitcoin’s legitimacy and its price. ETFs as a cohort took in more than US$25 billion (S$32.5 billion) , according to Bloomberg data, pushing assets as high as roughly US$169 billion. Their steady allocation flows helped reframe the asset as a portfolio diversifier – a hedge against inflation, monetary debasement and political disarray. But that narrative – always tenuous – is fraying afresh, leaving the market exposed to something quieter but no less destabilising: disengagement.\n\nOne of the starkest examples of a buying strike in the digital-asset community comes from Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the software firm turned Bitcoin hoarder. Once the poster child for corporate treasury crypto plays, its stock is now flirting near parity to its Bitcoin stash – a sign that investors are no longer willing to pay a premium for Mr Saylor’s high-conviction leverage model.\n\nBoom and bust cycles have been a constant since Bitcoin burst into the mainstream consciousness with a more than 13,000 per cent surge in 2017, only to be followed by a plunge of almost 75 per cent in 2018.\n\n“The sentiment in crypto retail is pretty negative,” said Mr Hougan, who sees the current pullback as a buying opportunity. “They don’t want to live through another 50 per cent pullback. People are front-running that by stepping out of the market.”\n\nBitcoin has whipsawed investors through 2025, dropping to as low as US$74,400 in April as Mr Trump unveiled his tariffs, before rebounding to record highs ahead of the latest retreat. The original digital asset accounts for almost 60 per cent of crypto’s roughly US$3.2 trillion in market value.\n\nThe market downturn has been even tougher on smaller, less liquid tokens that traders often gravitate toward because of their higher volatility and typical outperformance during rallies. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 digital assets is down around 60 per cent in 2025.\n\n“The markets are always an ebb and flow, and cyclicality in crypto is nothing new,” said Chris Newhouse, director of research at Ergonia, a firm specialising in decentralized finance. But “amongst friends, Telegram chats, and at conferences, the general sentiment I’ve received shows skepticism around capital deployment, and no natural bullish catalysts.” BLOOMBERG","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/bitcoin-erases-years-gain-as-crypto-bear-market-deepens","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/cdb4cf4f862af0a357e8e6b128548690a06369bd65845bce0be6a63c48354f83","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 23:58:00","author":"Mr Trump","authors":["Mr Trump"],"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":379642010,"title":"Major US carrier arrives in Caribbean as Trump puts Venezuela in crosshairs  - Trinidad Tribune – Latest","text":"The United States’ most advanced aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean Sea in a flex of military power by the President Donald Trump administration, as it raises pressure on Venezuela and prompts questions about what the influx of troops and armoury could portend.\n\nThe arrival of the USS Gerald R Ford and other warships, announced by the US Navy in a statement on Sunday, marks a potentially pivotal moment in what the administration has pitched as a counterdrug operation, but is seen in many quarters as an aggressive push against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe US has been conducting military strikes on vessels the administration alleges are transporting drugs. In recent months, the campaign has carried out about 20 strikes in the Caribbean and off the Pacific coasts of Latin America, killing some 80 people.\n\nInternational law and human rights experts have repeatedly said that such attacks amount to extrajudicial executions, even if those targeted are suspected of drug trafficking.\n\nThe administration has said that the build-up of American forces in the region is focused on stopping the flow of drugs into the US, but it has provided no evidence at all to support its assertions that those killed in the boats were what they term “narcoterrorists.”\n\nThe Reuters news agency reported on Saturday that senior Trump administration officials held three meetings at the White House this week to discuss options for possible military action against Venezuela, citing unnamed officials.\n\nThe reported meetings come as the Trump administration has continued to significantly expand the US military’s presence in the Latin America region, including with F-35 aircraft, warships and a nuclear submarine.\n\nEarlier this week, the Pentagon said the Gerald R Ford Carrier Strike Group, which includes the world’s largest aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with at least 4,000 sailors and dozens of “tactical aircraft” on board.\n\nIn total, there are now about 12,000 US sailors and Marines in the region, in what US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Thursday formally named “Operation Southern Spear”.\n\nUnder the US Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\n\nBut Trump has said that he would not “necessarily ask for a declaration of war” in order to continue killing people “that are bringing drugs into our country”.\n\nRear Admiral Paul Lanzilotta, who commands the strike group, said it will bolster an already large force of American warships to “protect our nation’s security and prosperity against narco-terrorism in the Western Hemisphere”.\n\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, which is only 11 kilometres (seven miles) from Venezuela at its closest point, government officials said troops have begun “training exercises” with the US military.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Sean Sobers described the joint exercises as the second in less than a month, adding they are aimed at tackling violent crime on the island nation, which has become a stopover point for drug shipments headed to Europe and North America. The prime minister has been a vocal supporter of the US military strikes.\n\nVenezuela’s government has described the training exercises as an act of aggression.

A new video circulating online features a woman talking about Trump allegedly liking her because she looks like his daughter, and she was only 13 at the time. However, the clip raises eyebrows due to its questionable authenticity.Netizens React To Katie Johnson's Video Accusing Trump of AssaultX User @Partisan_12 shared a video of a woman talking about Trump's alleged assault. 'Donald Trump knew that I was thirteen,' the caption read, quoting the woman in the interview.'Katie Johnson is one of the victims of Donald J Trump,' the social media user added.In the over 1-minute clip, Johnson mentioned another woman named Tiffany, who allegedly encouraged her to try on her different wigs because she showed interest in them. She chose the blonde wig because Tiffany told her it 'looked great' on her.Johnson claimed that Trump 'specifically asked about me' due to her resemblance to his daughter, who was also 13 years old. The incident happened in 1994, so Johnson was referring to Ivanka Trump.'He knew the first that he saw me, but he took a liking to me because I look like his daughter,' Johnson said.The woman in the video added that she decided to come forward in 2016 after learning Trump was running for president to 'tell the country what kind of man this person is.'Several immediately believed the clip. One even called out Trump to retire. Another claimed Johnson was to testify against Trump, but due to 'death threats,' she disappeared.However, the video was actually fake. @JohnnyRocket71 shared Grok's response, saying it was 'manipulated or AI-generated, with inconsistent audio-visual quality and no verifiable source tying it to a real deposition.' Also, there's no actual woman named Katie Johnson who accused Trump of assault. Katie Johnson was a pseudonym in the 2016 lawsuit alleging that Trump assaulted her, but it was dismissed due to a lack of substantial evidence.'Liberals just make up S**t. Always live in a hate Fantasy World,' @its_The_Dr commented with laughing emojis.While some just laughed it off, others believed the video. Thus, several people were furious that such fake news was spread online.'She has been debunked. You guys are pathetic and stink of desperation,' @MeezmoApril wrote.Katie Johnson 2016 Lawsuit RevisitedKati Johnson is a pseudonym in the 2016 lawsuit filed against Donald Trump. The woman behind the case claimed Trump and Jeffrey Epstein raped her when she was 13 in the summer of 1994 in Epstein's Manhattan residence.In her declaration, the woman said she was recruited by 'Tiffany Doe,' who worked as Epstein's party planner. The claims in the lawsuit were promoted by someone named Al Taylor, later identified as Norm Lubow, the former producer of The Jerry Springer Show. An associate of Lubow confirmed to the Guardian that he uses the 'Al Taylor' identity. The outlet also learned that the photographs of Al Taylors distributed to media outlets were actually pictures of Al Bowman, a Hollywood promoter and a former producer of The Jerry Springer Show. In a telephone interview, Bowman said he wasn't involved in the lawsuit and admitted that he was a Trump supporter.Lubow has a history of creating sensational or dramatised media content. He would allegedly recruit people to claim they were involved in 'salacious stories.' Lubow was also behind a tabloid report claiming O.J. Simpson bought illicit drugs on the same day Nicole Brown was murdered, Snopes reported.The outlet also noted that Revelist was the only outlet to score an interview with the accuser. However, Revelist's Emily Shugerman admitted she was unsure if the woman behind the lawsuit actually existed.'I don't know if the Katie Johnson I spoke to is the same girl who Trump allegedly raped in 1994, or if that girl even exists,' she wrote, per Snopes.So, the video of Johnson speaking about Trump allegedly assaulting her should be taken with a grain of salt.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pathetic-stick-desperation-social-media-users-react-katie-johnson-video-accusing-trump-assault-1755446","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1768883/donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=eb176522698c051a56b937dbbc64dcd3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 23:55:44","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.417},{"id":379645946,"title":"'Ranting lunatic': Why Trump just put a target on former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene's back","text":"US President Donald Trump has branded ﻿former political ally Marjorie Taylor Greene a \"ranting lunatic\" after a messy political split over the so-called Epstein files.\n\nNow the far-right firebrand has claimed the president's comments have ﻿endangered her life.\n\n\"The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong,\" Greene told CNN's Dana Bash on State of the Union.\n\n\"And those are the types of words used that can radicalise people against me and put my life in danger.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Trump hints at decision on Venezuela - is the US about to go to war?\n\nWhat happened between Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump?\n\nRepublican congresswoman Greene was once among Trump's most vocal allies.\n\nBut her tune has changed in recent months, largely due to the Trump administration's handling of ﻿files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nJust last week, Democrats on the US House Oversight Committee leaked three emails from Epstein that mentioned Trump by name.\n\nThe emails suggested he \"knew about the girls\", and that Esptein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was allegedly recruiting from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a \"hoax.\"\n\nBut Greene has repeatedly called for ﻿the ﻿release of the Epstein files, driving a major wedge between her and the president.\n\nShe has also criticised Trump's domestic agenda, questioning his administration's economic policies.﻿﻿\n\nREAD MORE: Giant US warship arrives in Caribbean as part of Trump military build-up\n\nIn response, Trump officially withdrew his ﻿endorsement of Greene on Friday (US time) in a Truth Social post, where he claimed she'd \"gone far left\".\n\n\"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,\" he claimed.\n\nIn another post, Trump called her a \"traitor\" to the Republican Party.﻿\n\nGreene responded with a social media post of her own on Friday, writing on X that Trump is trying \"to make an example\" of her.\n\nShe alleged that the president wants to \"scare all the other Republicans before next week's vote to release the Epstein files\" and that his comments sparked threats against her.﻿\n\n\"I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world,\" Greene added in another X post on Saturday.\n\n\"The man I supported and helped get elected.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Boy, 14, on bail allegedly stabs 19-year-old on quiet Melbourne street\n\n﻿Losing Trump's public support appears to have inspired a shift in Greene's political approach.\n\nToday she ﻿announced that she will stop ﻿using \"toxic\" rhetoric, marking a major change for the Republican firebrand.\n\n\"I would like to say, humbly, I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics;

Security Council planned to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution on Gaza that leaves the door open to Palestinian independence.\n\nNetanyahu has long asserted that creating a Palestinian state would reward Hamas and eventually lead to an even larger Hamas-run state on Israel’s borders. But as the U.S. attempts to push forward with its Gaza ceasefire proposal, he faces heavy international pressure to show flexibility.\n\nThe Security Council is expected to vote on a U.S. proposal for a U.N. mandate that would establish an international stabilization force in Gaza despite opposition from Russia, China and some Arab countries.\n\nHamas and Palestinian factions warned Sunday against the U.S. proposal, calling it an attempt to impose an international mandate on Gaza that is biased toward Israel and deprives Palestinians of the right to manage their own affairs. In a statement, the groups said the force must not involve Israel and must be under direct U.N. supervision.\n\nThe statement also rejected any reference in the U.S. proposal to disarming Gaza. Netanyahu on Sunday noted the proposal calls for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to be disarmed, telling his Cabinet: “Either this will happen the easy way, or it will happen the hard way.”\n\nThe U.S., under pressure from countries expected to contribute troops to the force, had revised the resolution with stronger language about Palestinian self-determination. It now says that President Donald Trump’s plan may create a “credible pathway” to Palestinian statehood. A rival Russian proposal uses even stronger language in favor of Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel is seen internationally as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict for the long term.\n\nNetanyahu’s hard-line governing partners have urged him to take a tough stand on the calls for Palestinian independence. Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel’s opposition to a Palestinian state has “not changed one bit” and is not threatened by external or internal pressure.\n\n“I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone,” he said.\n\nThat pressure increased during the war in Gaza. In September, after the U.K., Australia and Canada formally recognized a Palestinian state, Netanyahu blasted the countries for proffering a “prize” to Hamas.\n\nSettler attacks on the rise in the West Bank\n\nThe Israeli leader also made his first public comments about a surge in attacks by Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, saying the violence was the work of a small minority. Palestinians and human rights groups say the violence has been widespread and accused the government of turning a blind eye.\n\nPalestinian health officials said Sunday that a 19-year-old Palestinian man became the seventh person to be killed in the West Bank in the past two weeks by Israeli fire. The spike in violence has been accompanied by a surge in settler attacks.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was operating in Nablus, in the northern West Bank, early Sunday when the man hurled an explosive device at soldiers, who fired in response.\n\nThe military later said its forces had killed someone in the Far’a area of the West Bank who “attempted to harm them,” with no details. There was no immediate Palestinian comment.\n\nIn addition to Sunday’s clashes, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank said six teenagers — ages 15 to 17 — were shot and killed by Israeli fire in four separate shootings over the past two weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu cast settler violence as the work of a few extremists. But Palestinians and rights groups say the violence is carried out by settlers with impunity from Israel’s far-right government. Settler leaders and their allies hold top positions in Netanyahu’s government, including the Cabinet ministers who oversee the national police force and West Bank settlement policies.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio last week said there’s concern that the events in the West Bank “could undermine what we’re doing in Gaza.”\n\nU.N. Human Rights Commissioner spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan has said the U.N. recorded more than 260 attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property in the West Bank in October, more than in any month since 2006.\n\nMore on Gaza\n\nIsrael’s military said its troops on Sunday killed someone who crossed into territory they control in northern Gaza and “posed an immediate threat to them.”\n\nIn Khan Younis in southern Gaza, families in the crowded Muwasi tent camp picked their way along flooded streets after winter’s first strong rainfall that started on Friday. Water dripped through torn tents onto belongings. Children splashed barefoot or in sandals, or tried to ride bikes.\n\n“Our bathroom is made of fabric. Everything is made of fabric, and it’s worn out from the sun, so the rain pours down on us. It’s indescribable suffering,” said one displaced Palestinian, Abdallah Abu Quta.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/netanyahu-opposes-palestinian-statehood-israel-un_n_691a5fd2e4b0023259f5ce45?origin=home-zone-b-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/691a6515170000c4fe9c5be4.jpeg?cache=y3Ng8aph1v&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-16 23:54:41","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.175}]}
