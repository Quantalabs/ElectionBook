The news outlet wanted the court to overturn a three-judge panel's June 6 ruling not to let AP back into the events until merits of the news organization's lawsuit against Trump was decided.

It all stems from Trump's decision in February to keep AP journalists out of the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events too small for a full press corps, in retaliation for the news outlet's decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico's name. The AP sued in response. In April, a district court ruled that the administration could not exclude journalists based on their opinions. The Trump administration immediately turned to the U.S. Court of Appeals to successfully delay implementation of the ruling before the court could consider the full merits of the case.

Next up: This fall, the appeals court considers those full merits. “We are disappointed by today's procedural decision but remain focused on the strong district court opinion in support of free speech as we have our case heard,” said Patrick Maks, an AP spokesman. “As we've said throughout, the press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation.” The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Since the start of the case, the White House has instituted new rules for access to the limited-space events. AP photographers have been regularly permitted back, but its reporters only occasionally. On Monday, the White House said it would not allow a reporter from The Wall Street Journal onto Air Force One to cover Trump's weekend trip to Scotland because of the outlet's “fake and defamatory conduct” in a story about the president and late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in honor of the current FLOTUS. The new name for the compound's second-largest venue (at 2,347 seats) would be the First Lady Melania Trump Opera House.\n\n The only other named venue at the Kennedy Center is the 1,161-seat Eisenhower Theater.\n\n Rep. Mike Simpson, the Idaho Republican and chairman of the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, introduced the amendment. \"This is an excellent way to recognize [the First Lady's] support and commitment to promoting the arts,\" he said, per ABC News.\n\n The amendment is a part of a spending bill for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (which President Donald Trump's administration is working to dismante), and other federal agencies. The legislation still requires approval from the full House and Senate, with spending bills requiring 60 Senate votes to pass, giving Democrats and other opposed lawmakers a chance to strip the amendment from the bill.\n\n The amendment comes as the latest move in Republicans' effort to reshape the Kennedy Center, which was authorized by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958, named after President John F. Kennedy in 1964 following his assassination, and opened in 1971 under the Richard Nixon administration.\n\n Back in February, the Trump administration removed 18 members from the Kennedy Center's board of trustees — all appointees of former President Joe Biden — as well as the center's longtime president, Deborah F. Rutter. The board now consists entirely of Trump appointees, including White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Usha Vance, the wife of Vice President J.D. Vance. The takeover led to a mass resignation of appointees and advisors, including Shonda Rhimes and Renée Fleming.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n President Trump was subsequently elected the new chair of the board, and appointed his wife as honorary chairwoman.

The White House described Be Best's three main targets as \"the social and emotional health of children,\" \"online safety,\" and \"opioid abuse,\" specifically its harmful effects on young people.\n\n Her second time around, Mrs. Trump has vowed to expand Be Best, though by May she had spent fewer than 14 days at the White House.","summary":"GOP members of a key House committee slipped the proposed name change into a spending bill.","url":"https://ew.com/republicans-want-to-rename-kennedy-center-opera-house-melania-trump-11777262","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/K74X8YWVSRXzqg-kdyGysaUpsgE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/melania-trump57-072225-2193e71fcdb046f0a1bae39b1f9a8100.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 01:04:01","author":"Ryan Coleman","authors":["Ryan Coleman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.516},{"id":344276212,"title":"Stocks of Japan automakers soar on report that U.S. set to lower auto tariffs","text":"Shares of Japanese automakers surged after U.S. auto tariffs were reportedly lowered to 15% from the current 25%, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing a Japanese official.\n\nStocks of Japan's Honda jumped 8.42%, while Toyota climbed 9.97%.

CBS announced last Thursday that it would cancel \"The Late Show\" next May at the end of its broadcast season. Though CBS and Paramount clarified that the choice to cancel the series was \"purely a financial decision,\" and it's been reported that the show loses CBS $40 million a year, many liberal commentators have pointed to Paramount’s recent lawsuit settlement with Trump and an upcoming merger with Skydance as the reason. For his part, Trump celebrated the decision on Truth Social shortly after the news was announced, claiming Colbert’s \"talent was even less than his ratings.\" COLBERT'S MOST PARTISAN MOMENTS AS 'LATE SHOW' HOST, FROM LEADING BIDEN FUNDRAISER TO DANCING WITH SCHUMER Colbert fired back against Trump on his show Monday night. \"How dare you, sir?\" Colbert responded. \"Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism? Go f--- yourself.\" Hollywood Reporter editor Steven Zeitchik argued that the \"Late Show\" franchise ending, combined with Trump’s jabs, could motivate academy members to finally award Colbert’s iteration of the late-night comedy show after nearly a decade. \"Whether the president actually had a hand in the cancellation matters less than the fact that Emmys voters see a partisan battle in the firing,\" Zeitchik wrote. \"An Emmy won’t change public policy on immigration and Medicaid. But it’s one of the few ways liberal Hollywood can stick it to the leader they loathe.\" \"The Late Show\" is currently nominated for best Outstanding Talk Series against \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and \"Late Night with Seth Meyers.\" \"The Late Show\" under Colbert has been nominated for an Emmy 31 times since his run as host began in 2015. Zeitchik added that Colbert winning an Emmy could give the anti-Trump comedian an even bigger platform to attack the president on a personal level. DAVID MARCUS: STEPHEN COLBERT’S CHARACTER IS THE LATEST NEVER-TRUMP REPUBLICAN TO FALL \"In a grand irony, if Trump’s stance does give Colbert the Emmy the president will have enabled the host to win an honor that has saltily eluded him. ('The Apprentice' went 0 for 8.)

Trump, like others before him, has been distracted by efforts to broker peace in a range of conflicts, from Ukraine to Gaza.\n\nTariffs also are expected to be on the agenda. Trump has threatened to impose 20% tariffs on Filipino goods on Aug. 1 unless the two sides can strike a deal.\n\n“I intend to convey to President Trump and his Cabinet officials that the Philippines is ready to negotiate a bilateral trade deal that will ensure strong, mutually beneficial and future-oriented collaborations that only the United States and the Philippines will be able to take advantage of,” Marcos said Sunday when he was departing for Washington, according to his office.\n\nManila is open to offering zero tariffs on some U.S. goods to strike a deal with Trump, finance chief Ralph Recto told local journalists.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hinted that a trade agreement with the Philippines was in the works. “Perhaps this will be a topic of discussion,” she told reporters Monday when asked about tariff negotiations.\n\nThe White House said Trump will discuss with Marcos the shared commitment to upholding a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific.\n\nBefore a meeting with Marcos at the Pentagon, Hegseth reiterated America’s commitment to “achieving peace through strength” in the region.\n\n“Our storied alliance has never been stronger or more essential than it is today, and together we remain committed to the mutual defense treaty,” Hegseth said Monday. “And this pact extends to armed attacks on our armed forces, aircraft or public vessels, including our Coast Guard anywhere in the Pacific, including the South China Sea.”\n\nMarcos, whose country is one of the oldest U.S. treaty allies in the Pacific region, told Hegseth that the assurance to come to each other’s mutual defense “continues to be the cornerstone of that relationship, especially when it comes to defense and security cooperation.”\n\nHe said the cooperation has deepened since Hegseth’s March visit to Manila, including joint exercises and U.S. support in modernizing the Philippines’ armed forces. Marcos thanked the U.S. for support “that we need in the face of the threats that we, our country, is facing.”\n\nChina, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have been involved in long-unresolved territorial conflicts in the South China Sea, a busy shipping passage for global trade.\n\nThe Chinese coast guard has repeatedly used water cannon to hit Filipino boats in the South China Sea. China accused those vessels of entering the waters illegally or encroaching on its territory.\n\nDuring Marcos’ meeting with Rubio, the two reaffirmed the alliance “to maintain peace and stability” in the region and discussed closer economic ties, including boosting supply chains, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.\n\nThe U.S. has endeavored to keep communication open with Beijing. Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met this month on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They agreed to explore “areas of potential cooperation” and stressed the importance of managing differences.DIDI TANG, WASHINGTON, MDT/AP","summary":"President Donald Trump plans to host Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. today [Macau time] at the White House, as the two countries are seeking closer security and economic ties in the face of shifting geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific region.

It followed an agreement with the Philippines that will see the U.S. collect a 19 per cent tariff rate on imports from there. \n\n\"Though details are not yet available, it is commendable that the 25 per cent baseline tariff was avoided,\" Norihiro Yamaguchi, senior Japan economist at Oxford Economics.\n\n\"In the short run I think lowered uncertainty will be welcomed in the equity market.

Thank you for your attention to this matter! \n\nTrump said the country was 'becoming very rich again,' although some of the market's recent gains came after Trump hit 'pause' on his tariff decisions and backed off his repeated threats to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nTrump also dangled further talks. 'We're going to make a deal with Japan on the LNG in Alaska,' Trump said.\n\nA deal with Japan would restore some stability to a major trade relationship. Trump cranked up the pressure earlier this month when he threatened to slap a 25 percent tariff on Japan and South Korea – both key allies – if they didn't reach an agreement by August 1.\n\nHe also lauded House Republicans who jammed through his 'big, beautiful bill,' and promised to lend them political support.\n\n 'We're going to make all those robo calls for you,' Trump said, on a day he once again threatened to go after 'no' vote Thomas Massie (R-Ky.).\n\n'There's been no Congress like this Congress in terms of achievement,' Trump said.\n\nHe called out birthdays and anniversaries in the crowd, and spoke about House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise after he suffered a shooting. 'He was going to be a goner,' Trump said. 'You look better now than you did then,' he told him.\n\n'We're so grateful for you,' Housing Secretary Scott Turner told the president when Trump invited him to say Grace. 'You are a tremendous leader and we thank God for you,' he told Trump before the prayer. \n\n'Thank you for giving us favor to pass this big, beautiful bill,' Turner said during the prayer of the bill that passed the House 218-214 with Trump losing just two Republican votes.\n\nTrump took the opportunity to praise Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, on a day he accused Barack Obama of 'treason' and applied pressure for him to be investigated over the origins of the Russia probe in 2016. \n\n'Where's Tulsi? She's like hotter than everybody. She's the hottest one in the room right now,' Trump said.\n\nTrump repeated his claim that 'Obama cheated on the election,' after Obama slammed his earlier attacks. \n\n'With your stamina, you know we can never sleep,' Speaker Mike Johnson told Trump when he took the microphone.","summary":"President Donald Trump announced Tuesday he had reached a new trade deal with Japan, calling it 'the largest deal in history.'

Bove, a former criminal defense lawyer for President Donald Trump, is now a top official at the Justice Department. His nomination for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has come under intense scrutiny from Democrats after a fired department lawyer said he suggested the Trump administration may need to ignore judicial commands — a claim Bove denies. Also Read | Earth To Spin Faster Than Usual on July 22, To Skip 1.34 Milliseconds of 24-Hour Day; Next Shortest Day of 2025 To Be on August 5. He was at the forefront of the department's dismissed corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. He has also accused FBI officials of “insubordination” for refusing to hand over the names of agents who investigated the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and ordered the firings of a group of prosecutors involved in those Jan. 6 criminal cases. The 50-48 vote came after Democrats forced an additional procedural vote on his nomination, an effort to protest the nomination and delay the process. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Bove “the extreme of the extreme of the extreme” and “Trump's worst judicial nominee to date.” Also Read | US Shocker: Tattoo Parlour Owner Kidnaps Teen Mistress After Argument in NYC, Assaults Her With Wife and Nanny’s Help; All 3 Arrested. “Mr. Bove's entire career has been built on one thing: fealty to Donald Trump,” Schumer said. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against moving to consider the nomination. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted with Republicans to move forward but said in a statement that she will oppose Bove's confirmation on a final vote. “We have to have judges who will adhere to the rule of law and the Constitution and do so regardless of what their personal views may be,” Collins said. “Mr. Bove's political profile and some of the actions he has taken in his leadership roles at the Department of Justice cause me to conclude he would not serve as an impartial jurist.” It is unclear whether any other Republicans will oppose Bove's confirmation. If all Democrats vote against the nomination, Senate Republicans can lose three GOP votes and still confirm him if Vice President JD Vance breaks a 50-50 tie. The tension and delays over Bove's nomination come as Republicans have tried to move Trump's nominees as quickly as possible and as Trump has pushed Senate Majority Leader John Thune to skip the traditional August recess to stay in session and confirm more judges and executive branch officials. Thune said he is considering doing that if Democrats continue to force delays, and Democrats have shown little signs of letting up. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Bove took criticism of his tenure head-on, telling lawmakers he understands some of his decisions “have generated controversy.” But Bove said he has been inaccurately portrayed as Trump's “henchman” and “enforcer” at the department. “I am someone who tries to stand up for what I believe is right,” Bove said. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said Bove has used his position “to weaponize the Department of Justice against the president's enemies.” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, defended Bove against the whistleblower's claims and said he deserves fair treatment. He said Democrats withheld the complaint from the fired lawyer and that his staff had investigated the claims. “Mr. Bove has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably,” Grassley said at a Senate Judiciary meeting last week, where Democrats walked out in protest. The whistleblower complaint came from a former Justice Department lawyer who was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison. That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, described efforts by top Justice Department officials in the weeks before his firing to stonewall and mislead judges to carry out deportations championed by the White House. Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March concerning Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act over what the president claimed was an invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni said Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. Reuveni claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and “ignore any such order,” Reuveni's lawyers said in the filing. Bove said he has “no recollection of saying anything of that kind.” A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Trump's legal team during his New York hush money trial and defended Trump in the two federal criminal cases brought by the Justice Department. If confirmed by the Senate, he'll serve on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

(AP) — The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively prohibited transgender women from competing in women’s sports, communicating to organizations responsible for swimming, athletics, and other sports that it has an “obligation to comply” with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe new policy, unveiled Monday through a subtle update on the USOPC’s website and validated in a letter sent to national sport governing entities, follows a similar action taken by the NCAA earlier this year.\n\nThe USOPC alteration is subtly mentioned as a detail within the “USOPC Athlete Safety Policy” and refers to Trump’s executive order, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” signed in February. This order, among other stipulations, warns of “rescinding all funds” from organizations that permit transgender athlete participation in women’s sports.\n\nU.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that “the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials” since Trump signed the order.\n\n“As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,” USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. “Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.”\n\nThe National Women’s Law Center put out a statement condemning the move. \n\n“By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,” said that organization’s president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.\n\nThe USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs. \n\nSome of those organizations — for instance, USA Track and Field — have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Trump’s order. \n\nA USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC’s change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only “athletes who are of the female sex” in women’s competition and opening men’s events to “all athletes not eligible for the women’s category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.”\n\nThe nationwide battle over transgender girls on girls’ and women’s sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court after critics challenged the policies as discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.\n\nThe NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports.\n\nFemale eligibility is a key issue for the International Olympic Committee under its new president, Kirsty Coventry, who has signaled an effort to “protect the female category.” The IOC has allowed individual sports federations to set their own rules at the Olympics — and some have already taken steps on the topic. \n\nStricter rules on transgender athletes — barring from women’s events anyone who went through male puberty — have been passed by swimming, cycling and track and field. Soccer is reviewing its eligibility rules for women and could set limits on testosterone. \n\nTrump has said he wants the IOC to change everything “having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.” Los Angeles will host the Summer Games in 2028.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

The president said Japan would invest “at my direction” $550 billion into the U.S. and would “open” its economy to American autos and rice. The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1. With the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker — even as his tariffs when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector. Also Read | US Shocker: Tattoo Parlour Owner Kidnaps Teen Mistress After Argument in NYC, Assaults Her With Wife and Nanny’s Help; All 3 Arrested. But the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear. But the wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble. As the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia. The U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau. America had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them. The president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union. At a Tuesday dinner, Trump said the EU would be in Washington on Wednesday for trade talks. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating period with China that is currently set to run through Aug. 12 as goods from that nation are taxed at an additional 30% baseline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would be in the Swedish capital of Stockholm next Monday and Tuesday to meet with his Chinese counterparts. Bessent said his goal is to shift the American economy away from consumption and to enable more consumer spending in the manufacturing-heavy Chinese economy. “President Trump is remaking the U.S. into a manufacturing economy,” Bessent said on the Fox Business Network show “Mornings with Maria.” “If we could do that together, we do more manufacturing, they do more consumption. That would be a home run for the global economy.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

Maybe with the Canadian flag. Maybe with a Pride flag,' Larry Stewart, of Fergusons Cove, told the outlet.\n\nFeucht, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Republican in 2020, is also a missionary and author - one with increasingly visible ties to the 'Make America Great Again' movement championed by President Donald Trump. \n\nOn his website, the Christian rocker has voiced strong opposition to a range of issues, including abortion rights, critical race theory and the 2SLGBTQ+ community. \n\nHe has further advocated for US government policies rooted in deep, traditional Christian values, describing the current political climate as a 'spiritual war.'\n\nHis ministry website also calls on young people to resist what he describes as the 'progressive agenda being forced upon America.'\n\nHowever, Feucht's preaching has not been without controversy. Former leader of his ministry have accused the rocker of financial mismanagement as his operation raked in millions. \n\nFeucht's upcoming concert at the York Redoubt site near Halifax is part of what he describes as a national tour celebrating the 'Summer of Revival in the nation of Canada.'\n\nThe event is scheduled to take place at the historic site - a 232-year-old coastal fortification perched on a cliff overlooking the harbor, originally built to defend the city. \n\nHowever, residents who spoke to the outlet said this is the first time they can recall a concert being held at the historic site, prompting questions about how the event was approved.\n\n'It's completely inappropriate,' Eleanor Kure, a longtime resident of the area, told CBC.\n\nNancy Hunter, another resident, chimed in, adding: 'I think it's very upsetting.'\n\n'What I want to know is how this got approved in the first place,' Stewart angrily added.\n\nInstead, residents said they only learned about the controversial concert through an email sent out by Parks Canada, the outlet reported.\n\nIn the email, Parks Canada warned residents about potential noise and parking disruptions related to the event.\n\nMiedema said she has been urging Parks Canada to cancel the concert after hearing concerns from multiple constituents.\n\nAccording to CBC, the Liberal MP said she is working with the 'appropriate parties' to prevent the concert from going ahead, though there has been no official response to those efforts so far. \n\nWhile it remains unclear whether Feucht’s concert will be cancelled, protests are expected if the event goes ahead.","summary":"Furious residents are demanding the cancellation of a Christian rock concert in a Canadian national park, outraged by the performer's ties to the MAGA movement.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14930639/canada-liberal-lawmaker-demands-sean-feucht-concert-cancelled-pro-MAGA-views.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/23/00/100543077-0-image-m-38_1753226806601.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 00:22:31","author":"Editor,Kelly Garino","authors":["Editor","Kelly Garino"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.043},{"id":344273556,"title":"Trump announces ‘massive’ trade deal with Japan","text":"United States President Donald Trump has announced that he has struck a “massive” trade deal with Japan following months of fraught negotiations.\n\nUnder the agreement announced on Tuesday, the US will impose a 15 percent tariff on Japanese exports and Japan will invest $550bn in the US, Trump said.\n\n“We just completed a massive Deal with Japan, perhaps the largest Deal ever made,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States, which will receive 90% of the Profits.”\n\nJapan will also open up to US exports of cars, rice and certain agricultural products, Trump said, adding that the deal would create “hundreds of thousands of jobs”.\n\n“There has never been anything like it,” he wrote.\n\nJapan was facing a 25 percent tariff if Washington and Tokyo could not reach a deal by an August 1 deadline set by Trump.\n\nUntil now, Japanese exports have been subject to a baseline US tariff of 10 percent.\n\nTrump made no mention of his 25 percent tariff on automobiles or 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, key sticking points in the months-long trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, but Japan’s public broadcaster NHK on Wednesday reported that the rate on auto exports would be set at 15 percent.\n\nThe Japanese government did not immediately provide confirmation of the deal.\n\nJapanese stocks rose following Trump’s announcement, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 up about 1.8 percent in early trading.\n\nMore to follow…","summary":"US president says Japanese exports will be subject to a 15 percent tariff under the trade agreement.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/23/trump-announces-massive-trade-deal-with-japan?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25038708644609-1753229861_9bfcc0-1753229977.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 00:15:48","author":"Apps Support,John Power","authors":["Apps Support","John Power"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":344269182,"title":"US Reaches Trade Agreement with the Philippines","text":"Washington, July 23 (QNA) -

The 15% tax on imported Japanese goods is a meaningful drop from the 25% rate that Trump, in a recent letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, said would be levied starting Aug. 1.\n\nWith the announcement, Trump is seeking to tout his ability as a dealmaker — even as his tariffs when initially announced in early April led to a market panic and fears of slower growth that for the moment appear to have subsided. Key details remained unclear from his post, such as whether Japanese-built autos would face a higher 25% tariff that Trump imposed on the sector.\n\nBut the framework fits a growing pattern for Trump, who is eager to portray the tariffs as win for the U.S. His administration says the revenues will help reduce the budget deficit and more factories will relocate to America to avoid the import taxes and cause trade imbalances to disappear.\n\nBut the wave of tariffs continues to be a source of uncertainty about whether it could lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses if companies simply pass along the costs. The problem was seen sharply Tuesday after General Motors reported a 35% drop in its net income during the second quarter as it warned that tariffs would hit its business in the months ahead, causing its stock to tumble.\n\nAs the Aug. 1 deadline for the tariff rates in his letters to world leaders is approaching, Trump also announced a trade framework with the Philippines that would impose a tariff of 19% on its goods while American-made products would face no import taxes. The president also reaffirmed his 19% tariffs on Indonesia.\n\nThe U.S. ran a $69.4 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan last year, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nAmerica had a trade imbalance of $17.9 billion with Indonesia and an imbalance of $4.9 billion with the Philippines. Both nations are less affluent than the U.S. and an imbalance means America imports more from those countries than it exports to them.\n\nThe president is set to impose the broad tariffs listed in his recent letters to other world leaders on Aug. 1, raising questions of whether there will be any breakthrough in talks with the European Union.

Supply shortages have stoked the prices of cocoa, with the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which account for over half of the world’s cocoa supply, experiencing poor climate conditions that have hindered cocoa production. The regions have specifically experienced excessive heat during growing season, rainfall patterns and bug infestations, according to research from Climate Central.\n\nHershey’s stock moved higher Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% at $181.69—one of its highest closing prices of the year—in a day where markets were largely flat.\n\nKey Background\n\nTuesday marks Hershey’s latest price hike after it raised prices a year ago. The chocolate maker posted a $224.2 million profit in its first-quarter earnings this year, though it noted it expected to take a $15 million to $20 million hit from the sweeping tariff policies imposed by President Donald Trump this year.

has announced a trade deal with Japan, potentially resolving weeks of fraught negotiations between the two allies which had caused political uproar and economic uncertainty in Tokyo.\n\n“We just completed a massive Deal with Japan,” the US president announced in a post online, adding “Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 Billion Dollars into the United States.”\n\nJapanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba said his country’s tariff negotiator had received the details of the deal and he would examine them before responding. “Our overarching concern is the interests of the nation,” he said.\n\nRelated: Japan walks line between recession and submission as it seeks to overcome Trump tariffs\n\nIn the post on Tuesday evening, Trump said Japanese imports would face a 15% tariff, an improvement on the 25% he threatened to impose from 1 August earlier this month.\n\nHe also claimed that Japan would open its market to US products including cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products – many of which had proved to be a sticking point in negotiations.\n\nA senior member of the Ishiba administration told public broadcaster NHK, “what President Trump posted on social media is accurate, and it is something that Japan welcomes.”\n\nIt was unclear what tariff rate US imports to Japan would be charge at under the deal.\n\nIshiba had reportedly tied his fate to the success of tariff negotiations, after his coalition lost its upper house majority in elections last weekend.\n\nAsked about his future as leader now that negotiations were reaching their conclusion, the prime minister said he was focused on the national interest and, “would make an announcement once details of the deal were finalised.”\n\nIshiba is facing growing calls to step down from within his own party following the upper house elections last weekend and a loss in the lower house in October, which came after he called a snap election. His position is widely regarded as untenable in light of the two consecutive electoral defeats.\n\nJapan’s auto industry – which accounts for 8% of jobs in the country – was reeling from a 25% levy on imports to the US. The announcement on Tuesday made no mention of easing tariffs on automobiles – which account for more than a quarter of all Japanese exports to the US – shares in Japanese automakers surged after the announcement, with Japan’s overall Nikkei 225 index of stocks gaining more than one percent.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump bemoaned Japanese consumers’ lack of enthusiasm for American cars and rice – labelling Japan “very spoiled”. He suggested that a deal with Japan might not be possible.\n\nJapan’s top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa has been in the US this week for his eighth round of talks. Japan’s Asahi newspaper reported Akazawa met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal with Japan follows agreements struck in recent weeks with the Philippines, Indonesia, the UK and Vietnam, and come as Trump has faced pressure to wrap up trade pacts after promising a flurry of deals ahead of his 1 August tariff deadline.\n\nTrump announced a new 19% tariff rate for goods from the Philippines on Tuesday, after a visit to the White House from Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Trump said there would be no tariffs from the Philippines on US goods.\n\nLater, the White House confirmed the same 19% tariff rate for Indonesia, down from an initial 32%, as it released terms of a deal reached last week that calls for Indonesia to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers on most US goods.\n\nWith Reuters","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-announces-japan-trade-deal-233939576.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/63cd7c392bbeae265f010ea54ed85cf7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 00:01:41","author":"Gavin Blair In Tokyo","authors":["Gavin Blair In Tokyo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":344268460,"title":"US Olympic and Paralympic officials bar transgender women from competing in Olympic women’s sports","text":"The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women’s sports, telling the federations overseeing swimming, athletics and other sports it has an “obligation to comply” with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump.The new policy, announced Monday with a quiet change on the USOPC’s website and confirmed in a letter sent to national sport governing bodies, follows a similar step taken by the NCAA earlier this year.The USOPC change is noted obliquely as a detail under “USOPC Athlete Safety Policy” and references Trump’s executive order, “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” signed in February. That order, among other things, threatens to “rescind all funds” from organizations that allow transgender athlete participation in women’s sports.U.S. Olympic officials told the national governing bodies they will need to follow suit, adding that “the USOPC has engaged in a series of respectful and constructive conversations with federal officials” since Trump signed the order.“As a federally chartered organization, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations,\" USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes wrote in a letter. “Our revised policy emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women. All National Governing Bodies are required to update their applicable policies in alignment.”RELATED STORY | Supreme Court will take up a new case about which school sports teams transgender students can joinThe National Women's Law Center put out a statement condemning the move.“By giving into the political demands, the USOPC is sacrificing the needs and safety of its own athletes,” said that organization's president and CEO, Fatima Goss Graves.The USOPC oversees around 50 national governing bodies, most of which play a role in everything from the grassroots to elite levels of their sports. That raises the possibility that rules might need to be changed at local sports clubs to retain their memberships in the NGBs.Some of those organizations — for instance, USA Track and Field — have long followed guidelines set by their own world federation. World Athletics is considering changes to its policies that would mostly fall in line with Trump's order.A USA Swimming spokesman said the federation had been made aware of the USOPC's change and was consulting with the committee to figure out what changes it needs to make. USA Fencing changed its policy effective Aug. 1 to allow only “athletes who are of the female sex” in women's competition and opening men's events to “all athletes not eligible for the women’s category, including transgender women, transgender men, non-binary and intersex athletes and cisgender male athletes.”The nationwide battle over transgender girls on girls’ and women’s sports teams has played out at both the state and federal levels as Republicans portray the issue as a fight for athletic fairness. More than two dozen states have enacted laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some policies have been blocked in court by those who say the policies are discriminatory, cruel and unnecessarily target a tiny niche of athletes.The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes to limit competition in women’s sports to athletes assigned female at birth. That change came a day after Trump signed the executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports.Female eligibility is a key issue for the International Olympic Committee under its new president, Kirsty Coventry, who has signaled an effort to “protect the female category.” The IOC has allowed individual sports federations to set their own rules at the Olympics — and some have already taken steps on the topic.Stricter rules on transgender athletes — barring from women’s events anyone who went through male puberty — have been passed by swimming, cycling and track and field. Soccer is reviewing its eligibility rules for women and could set limits on testosterone.Trump has said he wants the IOC to change everything “having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.” Los Angeles will host the Summer Games in 2028.","summary":"The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has effectively barred transgender women from competing in women’s sports, saying it has an “obligation to comply” with President Trump's executive orders.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/sports/us-olympic-and-paralympic-officials-bar-transgender-women-from-competing-in-olympic-womens-sports","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28158a5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F6f%2Fb6fd3b0c4db9a80d30232a70b12a%2Fap24213249514429.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 00:01:19","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.383},{"id":344267426,"title":"‘Securing peace’: South Korea pivots to pragmatic diplomacy","text":"With a rare public apology and a pledge to move beyond “ideological divides”, South Korea’s newly appointed foreign minister has pushed aside past dogma – signalling Seoul’s shift towards pragmatic engagement under recently elected President Lee Jae-myung.\nThe clearest sign of this new direction came on Monday, when Foreign Minister Cho Hyun delivered the apology at his inauguration, acknowledging that the foreign ministry had “failed to meet public expectations” under impeached former president Yoon Suk-yeol, who is currently behind bars awaiting trial over his failed martial law decree.\n“Diplomatic issues were exploited for domestic political purposes,” said Cho, a veteran diplomat with decades of experience. “We need to move beyond ideological divides and pursue a pragmatic diplomacy rooted in rationality and efficiency, with national interests at the centre.”\n\nAnalysts say Cho’s remarks echo President Lee’s determination to steer the nation away from the “friend-or-foe” world view that defined the previous conservative administration, which critics contend placed political alignment above practical diplomacy.\nCho singled out South Korea’s failed bid to host the World Expo in 2030 – an effort championed by Yoon despite formidable competition from Saudi Arabia – as emblematic of misplaced priorities.\nHe also alluded to “inappropriate comments” by former officials that strained key relationships, likely a nod to Yoon’s unsubstantiated allegations of Chinese interference in South Korean elections and claims about anti-state forces linked to North Korea and China.\nObservers see Cho’s candid statements as a clear declaration that Seoul intends to break with the Yoon government’s value-based diplomacy in favour of a broader, more strategic approach: one that balances traditional alliances while expanding diplomatic outreach.\n“Amid growing geopolitical tensions, securing peace on the Korean peninsula must be our top priority,” Cho said.\nHe pledged to pursue dialogue with North Korea through a “phased and pragmatic” process, working closely with the United States while keeping lines open to China and others.\nSouth Korea can no longer afford the zero-sum logic of the past\nChang Yong-seok, Korean unification researcher\nDespite these aspirations, prospects for inter-Korean dialogue remain bleak.\nPyongyang has formally nullified inter-Korean relations, calling the South a hostile foreign state and deepening its military ties with Russia as the war in Ukraine grinds on.\nNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons development further complicates any path to reconciliation.\nLast month, both Koreas halted their cross-border loudspeaker broadcasts, ending a year of tit-for-tat psychological warfare. While the move has de-escalated tensions at the border, analysts caution that it does not signal a substantive policy shift from Pyongyang.\n‘Black or white’\nCho’s remarks reflect a fundamental policy shift under Lee, Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, told This Week in Asia.\n“The Lee administration sees the former government’s black-or-white world view as detrimental to national interests,” he said.\n“This is in line with broader global trends, such as US President [Donald] Trump’s rejection of value-based diplomacy in favour of transactional, interest-based foreign policy.”\nAt his confirmation hearing last Thursday, Cho reiterated that South Korea would not act as a pawn in the US-China rivalry. He confirmed that Seoul was working to conclude tariff negotiations with Washington before a looming August 1 deadline, when the US is expected to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Korean exports.\n\nRejecting the binary logic of “the US for security, China for the economy”, Cho emphasised South Korea’s commitment to a balanced and independent foreign policy.\nAsked whether President Lee would attend China’s Victory Day celebration in Beijing on September 3, Cho declined to confirm, citing sensitive negotiations with the US over trade and security.\nDiplomatic sources suggest Lee’s participation is unlikely, particularly with his first summit with President Trump still unscheduled.\nAppearing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, the latter of whom remains under international sanctions for the war in Ukraine, would risk diplomatic fallout for Seoul, they warn.\n\n“It would be an awkward scene, politically and diplomatically,” said Chang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.\n“Instead, Seoul will likely prioritise resolving the trade issue with Washington while cautiously improving ties with Beijing.”\nChang added that, ahead of the Apec summit South Korea is set to host in August – which Trump and Xi might attend – Seoul could scale back its annual Ulchi Freedom Shield joint military exercise with the US to avoid inflaming regional tensions.\n“To maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, South Korea can no longer afford the zero-sum logic of the past,” Chang said. “Pragmatism and balance are the only viable path forward.”","summary":"With a rare public apology and a pledge to move beyond “ideological divides”, South Korea’s newly appointed foreign minister has pushed aside past dogma – signalling Seoul’s shift towards pragmatic engagement under recently elected President Lee Jae-myung.\nThe clearest sign of this new direction came on Monday, when Foreign Minister Cho Hyun delivered the apology at his inauguration, acknowledging that the foreign ministry had “failed to meet public expectations” under impeached former president...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3319167/securing-peace-south-korea-pivots-pragmatic-diplomacy","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/07/23/47065142-84f5-4565-9562-6a8f1d64c58b_f4c60336.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-23 00:00:07","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.225},{"id":344279618,"title":"CNN's Anderson Cooper shows up to support 'Late Show' host Stephen Colbert after cancellation","text":"CNN anchor Anderson Cooper showed up to support CBS \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Monday night, appearing in a segment that took aim at the parent company of \"60 Minutes\" and President Donald Trump. CBS announced last week that it was canceling \"The Late Show\" and that Colbert's stint in late night will end in May 2026. While the network insisted the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" many skeptics believe the decision was politically motivated. On Monday, a bevy of celebrities, as well as fellow late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart and John Oliver, appeared on the \"Late Show\" to support their soon-to-be fallen colleague. Among the others on hand was Cooper, who is also a \"60 Minutes\" correspondent for CBS News. TRUMP DECLARES THERE'S 'STRONG WORD' THAT KIMMEL AND FALLON ARE NEXT ON THE LATE-NIGHT CHOPPING BLOCK The celebrity-packed segment featured \"Weird Al\" Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda performing Coldplay’s \"Viva la Vida\" to \"cheer people up\" amid the news Colbert would soon be canceled. CBS cameras showed various audience members during the performance, and the famous spectators were embedded in the crowd. Cooper was shown looking at his phone as Bravo host Andy Cohen, who was seated beside him, went bananas when he noticed they were on air. Cohen then leaned over and kissed Cooper, resulting in a look of disbelief from the CNN anchor. The segment ended with a cartoon image of President Donald Trump embracing the Paramount logo, a spoof of the viral \"kiss cam\" incident that occurred last week when former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was caught canoodling with another executive from the company at a Coldplay concert, both of whom are married to other people. Much like the Astronomer honcho, the cartoon Trump ducked in a panic when he realized he was on-screen. COLBERT TELLS TRUMP TO 'GO F--- YOURSELF’ AFTER PRESIDENT TAUNTS HIM OVER SHOW CANCELLATION Colbert concluded the segment by taking more shots at Paramount, mocking CBS for chalking the looming cancellation of his show to a financial decision. Though \"The Late Show\" reportedly loses CBS $40 million a year. While it was a lighthearted segment, Cooper’s involvement is noteworthy as it poked fun at both the corporate parent of CBS News, which controls \"60 Minutes,\" and Trump, who Cooper is tasked with covering for CNN. According to IMDB, Cooper has appeared on Colbert's show 20 other times as a guest. CBS News and CNN did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Two years ago, it was hot pink, officially heralding Barbiecore summer’s arrival. Then, 12 months later, a new plume was lime green to signify the start of Brat summer. Now, the faithful wait in sweltering temperatures to get their marching orders for 2025. Will this be a Lorde summer, as many punters have predicted? An Addison Rae summer? Maybe even a Krypto the Dog from Superman summer? No, this year the smoke was blown away by a British budget airliner. It’s officially a Jet 2 Holiday Summer. \n\nFor weeks now, much of the internet has been consumed with videos that riff on an ad campaign for Britain’s largest tour operator, Jet2holidays. The meme has flourished on TikTok, where audio from a 2024 ad — the poppy sounds of Jess Glynne’s 2015 song “Hold My Hand” mixed with the cheerful voiceover of a British woman assuring viewers that “Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday” — is overlaid against videos of vacationers experiencing calamity. They bounce wildly into the air from inflatables behind speedboats, accidentally light themselves on fire with birthday candles, experience near disaster while white-water rafting, almost drown in a few feet of water after shooting down a slide, or are waterboarded with liquor in a nightclub by a person in a Pink Panther costume. If Barbiecore Summer was about embracing frivolity and pink perfection, and Brat Summer was about reveling in grunge and neon depravity, then a Jet 2 Holiday Summer is about reluctantly accepting chaos as our new normal, trying to have a vacation in it anyway, and subsequently falling down the stairs or suffering whatever other catastrophe may hit us.\n\nIt’s the juxtaposition of mayhem and music that makes each Jet2 Holiday clip so perfect and enjoyable. It’s also what’s made the meme not just one of the biggest of 2025 (it’s been used in over a million posts), but something of a worldwide phenomenon. It has drawn global media attention to the aviation operator and boosted the career of Glynne, whose fans now scream the commercial during her performances.

A creative director and photographer (as well as the boyfriend of Overcompensating star Benito Skinner), O’Connor was instrumental in helping his friend Charli XCX with the social media strategy that made Brat such a phenomenon last year — which means he’s rather well placed to opine on the defining cultural trend of summer 2025. In a video posted on July 19 to his 132,000 TikTok followers, O’Conner declared that he’d officially seen enough: “It’s a Jet2 Holiday Summer whether you like it or not,” he said. “Most things from the past few weeks, or even the past few months, can really be bucketed under that label.” He then goes on to list some of the more troubling aspects of our current fuck-around-and-find-out era, from the frivolous ( C-suite types canoodling at a Coldplay concert) to the egregious (Trump supporters suffering from buyer’s remorse, thanks to his handling of the so-called Epstein Files or cuts to government services.)\n\nDonald Trump, of course, is chiefly responsible for the chaos many of us feel echoing through the culture right now. As he once again “infects every aspect of our daily lives,” as The Onion so aptly put it, it’s no surprise that Trump — freshly reinstated to power, armed with a list of enemies and facing seemingly no accountability — is at the center of this moment. It’s because of him that our institutions and social safety nets are actively crumbling around us, and the safeguards of the past are being slowly dismantled. And like a stone thrown into a lake, his influence ripples out across all facets of our culture. Consider him the captain of our Jet2 Holiday aircraft. But as you do so, remember that people actively chose to return to this state of precariousness. During the election last year, the country was presented with a choice of continuing with business as usual or risking a gamble by taking a trip on an airline we knew to be low-class and cheap, but which was promising an unbeatable vacation. Now, we’re been well and truly struck by turbulence.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nTrump Goes Full Fascist: ‘Whether It’s Right or Wrong, It’s Time to Go After People’\n\nOzzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath Singer and Heavy-Metal Pioneer, Dead at 76\n\nJon Stewart to CBS After Colbert's 'Late Show' Cancellation: 'Go F-ck Yourself'\n\nStephen Colbert Addresses Cancellation by Telling Trump to ‘Go F-ck Yourself’\n\nRelated Content\n\nClooney, Crack, and ‘Dictator’ Trump: Hunter Biden Unloads in Wild Interview\n\nTrump Goes Full Fascist: ‘Whether It’s Right or Wrong, It’s Time to Go After People’\n\nEveryone Who’s Backed Stephen Colbert Since CBS Canceled ‘The Late Show’\n\nJimmy Fallon Responds to Colbert Cancellation: ‘I Don’t Like What’s Going On’\n\nAs this Jet 2 Holiday Summer continues, think of all the others who have been embodying its messy promise of anarchy: The Republican lawmakers regrettably discovering the ugly provisions inside the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill only after they voted to enact it. CBS torching two of its tentpole prestige programs, 60 Minutes and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, amid a defamation lawsuit brought by the president.

The disgusting yet addictive opulence and crassness of the Jeff Bezos-Lauren Sánchez wedding. Katy Perry going through a breakup after going into space. All around us we can see chaos reign and people falling off their metaphorical jet skis. And just like on TikTok, I can’t look away. \n\nAnd so it is that we’ve found ourselves in the middle of a deeply unusual summer that all many of us know for certain feels different to last year’s. (Hell, if you needed any more proof Brat Summer wasn’t returning, consider that Charli XCX got married last week.) Unlike in 2024, there’s less hedonistic pleasure to be had in the mess we’re in now because it doesn’t necessarily feel like one of our own making. It’s just one big shitshow — and there’s no clean-up crew in sight. But at the end of the day, all we can really do is try to make the best of this trip we’re on together. It’s a Jet2 Holiday Summer, and as Glynne sings in the ad that kicked it all off, “Darling, hold my hand.”\n\nElection Gambling Is About to Blow Up With Polymarket Back in U.S.\n\nZach Bryan Recruits Bruce Springsteen to Perform 'Atlantic City' at New Jersey Concert\n\nHometown Hero\n\nLarisha Paul\n\nBehind the Scenes of 'Trophy Wife: Murder on Safari'\n\nDeath on the Savanna\n\nElisabeth Garber-Paul\n\nWNBA All-Star Players Wear ‘Pay Us What You Owe Us’ T-Shirts During Warm-Up\n\nTo the Point\n\nAlthea Legaspi\n\nThese Right-Wingers Won't Shut Up About Epstein, No Matter What Trump Says\n\nNot So Fast\n\nGo to PMC.com\n\nMost Popular\n\nMalcolm-Jamal Warner, 'Cosby Show' Star, Dies at 54\n\n‘The Cosby Show' Star Malcolm-Jamal Warner Dies in Accidental Drowning at 54\n\nJamie Lee Curtis Thinks Colbert’s Cancellation Isn’t Just About Ratings — & Her Words Are Chilling\n\nDonors to Reportedly Pull Funding from Florida University Museum After Proposed Transfer\n\nYou might also like\n\nVariety Announces Interview Studio Presented by Google TV at Comic-Con\n\nI’m a Shopping Writer & These $100-Off Knee-High Boots From Nordstrom’s Huge Sale Are All I’ll Be Wearing This Fall\n\n14 minutes ago\n\nJanelle James: ‘Having Money for the First Time in Your Life Can Be Traumatic’\n\nPolymarket Parlays Provide Paltry Payouts for Prediction Plays\n\n35 minutes ago\n\nRolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Rolling Stone, LLC.

There is now renewed pressure to end the war. United States President Donald Trump, who has appeared increasingly frustrated by Russia&apos;s intransigence in recent months, threatened Russia last week with \"severe\" sanctions if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine within 50 days. Russia and Ukraine will meet in Istanbul for the latest ceasefire talks, which will take place at the same venue where previous negotiations in May and June failed to yield a ceasefire, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported. The Istanbul talks could focus on further prisoner exchanges and a possible meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a senior Ukrainian official told AFP. Russia, however, has signalled that a meaningful breakthrough isn&apos;t expected anytime soon. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this week the two sides have \"diametrically opposed\" positions on how to end the war in Ukraine. One of the main sticking points at previous meetings has been over territory, as Russia has seized swathes of Ukrainian land since its invasion began three years ago. Ukraine continues to seek the return of the occupied territories, but Russia has shown no intent to retreat. \"There is no reason to expect any breakthroughs in the category of miracles — it is hardly possible in the current situation,\" Peskov said. \"We intend to pursue our interests, we intend to ensure our interests and fulfil the tasks that we set for ourselves from the very beginning.\" Asked if he could provide a sense of how the Kremlin viewed the potential timeframe for a possible peace agreement, Peskov said he could offer no guidance on timing. \"There is a lot of work to be done before we can talk about the possibility of some top-level meetings,\" he said. Zelenskyy outlined what he is seeking in the negotiations. \"The agenda from our side is clear: the return of prisoners of war, the return of children abducted by Russia, and the preparation of a leaders&apos; meeting,\" he said. The last meeting between Russia and Ukraine in June lasted just over an hour and resulted in a prisoner exchange . At the time, Russia told Ukraine it would only agree to end the war if Ukraine gave up big new chunks of territory and accepted limits on the size of its army, according to a memorandum reported by Russian media. The Russian memorandum, which was published by the Interfax news agency, said a settlement of the war would require international recognition of Crimea — a peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 — and four other regions of Ukraine that Russia has claimed as its own territory. Ukraine would have to withdraw its forces from all of them. Peskov suggested Russia still holds this view. \"There is our draft memorandum; there is a draft memorandum that has been handed over by the Ukrainian side. There is to be an exchange of views and talks on these two drafts, which are diametrically opposed so far,\" he said. Ukraine has repeatedly rejected the Russian conditions as tantamount to surrender. download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"Previous negotiations have failed to bring an end to the war, with both sides remaining resolute in their demands.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/what-to-expect-as-russia-and-ukraine-meet-for-third-round-of-peace-talks/49t9mk9ys","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/5eff421/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1600x900+0+0/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2F43%2Fe65a55194f758d6e6a1181ab602e%2Fzelenskyy-putin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 23:58:35","author":"Cameron Carr","authors":["Cameron Carr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":344269958,"title":"Trump likes renaming people, places and things.

Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that Witkoff was going to the region with a “strong hope” that the U.S. can deliver a ceasefire deal as well as a new humanitarian corridor for aid distribution.

Three U.S. officials said Witkoff is traveling to Europe this week to discuss a range of issues, including Gaza and the push for a ceasefire, but they had no details about Middle East stops and did not share where specifically Witkoff would travel to and when.

The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The State Department press office didn't respond to messages seeking more details on Witkoff's travel, and it wasn't immediately clear what his schedule would be this week. A breakthrough in talks on a ceasefire deal has eluded the Trump administration for months as conditions worsen in Gaza. The territory had its deadliest day yet for aid-seekers in over 21 months of war, with at least 85 Palestinians killed while trying to reach food Sunday. The Israeli army has said it fired warning shots, but says the reported death toll was greatly inflated. The United Nations' food agency accused Israeli forces of firing on the crowd of Palestinians seeking humanitarian aid. Bruce said the incident that took place while civilians were trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel is “absolutely horrible\" and reinforced why the U.S. is pushing for a new humanitarian corridor to be created as part of any truce. The sides have held weeks of talks in Qatar, reporting small signs of progress but no major breakthroughs. Officials have said a main sticking point is the redeployment of Israeli troops after any ceasefire takes place. The U.S. plan calls for a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release some hostages while Israel would free Palestinian prisoners and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. During the 60 days, the sides are also to begin negotiations on a permanent end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas yields power and is disarmed, while Hamas says it will not release all of the hostages until the war is over. It is seeking assurances that Netanyahu will not resume the war after the 60 days, as he did in March after an early ceasefire expired. Hamas is holding 50 hostages — 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.

This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.”\n\nThe New York Times recently assembled a chronology of Trump and Epstein's friendship over a period spanning more than a decade. Trump told New York Magazine in 2002 that he had known Epstein for \"15 years,\" calling him a \"terrific guy.\" The two remained friends until 2004, when the Times reported that the two had a falling out after fighting over Florida real estate.\n\nHowever, Epstein's brother, Mark, said that Jeffrey Epstein was the one who ended relations with Trump first, calling him a \"crook.\" Epstein was eventually arrested in 2006, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges in 2008 in order to avoid prison time.\n\nThe Epstein scandal has remained a thorn in Trump's side, as he continues to refuse to release the remainder of the FBI's evidence on the deceased child predator after he died in prison in 2019.

The greenback traded at 146.65 yen, little changed from the previous session when it slid 0.5 per cent.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said Japan would open to trade for U.S. cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products, among other items.\n\nTrump's announcement follows a meeting with Japan's top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, at the White House on Tuesday, according the Asahi newspaper.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.1745, down 0.1 per cent so far in Asia. Sterling was little changed at $1.35285.\n\nThe Australian dollar fetched $0.65555, flat in early trade. New Zealand's kiwi dollar traded at $0.6007, up 0.07 per cent.\n\nAlso weighing on investors' minds were worries about Federal Reserve independence, given Trump has repeatedly railed against Chair Jerome Powell and urged him to resign because of the central bank's reluctance to cut interest rates.\n\nBessent on Monday took a softer stance, saying there is no need for Powell to step down immediately, adding that he should see through the end of his term in May if he wants.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/dollar-holds-losses-against-yen-after-trump-announces-japan-trade-deal-5252991","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--YrElZlVh--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2025-07-22t235626z_2_lynxmpel6l16v_rtroptp_3_global-forex.jpg?itok=DlZNL","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 23:56:26","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.166}]}
