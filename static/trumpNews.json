Pat Ryan said Friday on CNN’s “The Arena” that he does not believe labeling Republicans as “fascist,” “Nazi” or “Hitler” contributes to the “overall problem” between the two parties.\n\nConcerns over political violence heightened Wednesday after Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was murdered in front of a crowd of students in Utah. While discussing the assassination, CNN’s Kasie Hunt asked Ryan if he thought phrases like “Nazi” or “Hitler” used by people on the left against Republicans “contributes to the problem overall.” (RELATED: How Charlie Kirk’s Alleged Assassin Was Caught)\n\n“I actually don’t think it does,” Ryan said. “I think people are trying to grapple with a really unprecedented time in our country where we’re seeing maybe history not fully repeat, but history rhyme at some of the darkest times in our world’s history and struggling in good faith to try to put some intellectual thought into that and find the right language to describe the fact that the constitution I risked my life for 27 months in combat is being tested and pushed.”\n\n“And, in many cases, I think not being honored by this president, that’s hard to figure out how to, how to put word to that in a way that is constructive. So those are words that are more academic. I think it is the call for violence to me,” Ryan added. “That is where the calls for violence linked to that, that are, that are the problem, the idea that we’ve heard from many leaders in both parties, unfortunately, that there’s some deeper evil if you feel a certain way.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Kirk had been speaking and debating with students at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, as he was known to do. About 20 minutes into the event, a fatal shot struck him, and security rushed him to the hospital. While Kirk was initially in stable condition, the TPUSA founder ultimately succumbed to his injuries.\n\nDuring breaking news of Kirk being shot, some Democrats suggested he was at fault for his death because of his political beliefs, while others blamed President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and Republicans for a surge in political violence.\n\nSince last year, tensions between Republicans and Democrats have risen during the 2024 presidential election cycle, as corporate media and former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign escalated their rhetoric against Trump. The then-GOP presidential candidate was called a fascist by Harris, with former President Joe Biden saying he should be locked up.\n\nOn July 13, 2024, the first assassination attempt against Trump occurred in Butler, Pa. During the campaign rally, Trump was speaking to a crowd when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks fired multiple rounds, grazing Trump’s ear and killing volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore. Just months later, on Sept. 15, 2024, a second attempt against Trump was uncovered when Secret Service agents found would-be assassin Ryan Routh hiding in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., with an AK-47-style rifle.\n\nIn June, Democratic Minnesota state Sen. Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot at their home. Additionally, a self-proclaimed socialist who supported the Black Lives Matter movement set fire to Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s official residence.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Charlie Kirk, a political activist and supporter of Trump , was tragically shot dead on Wednesday whilst addressing students at a public event at Utah Valley University. He was struck by a single to the neck as he sat under a small gazebo errected to protect him from the sun. The shot was fired from a roof of a building some 200 yards away. Kirk's assassination sent shockwaves through America’s political establishment and prompted warnings of rising civil strife. The horrific attack has been described as a 'watershed moment' in American history, amid a surge in political violence that has included the shooting of Donald Trump at a campaign rally last year.

The fundraiser, hosted on Christian crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo, was launched by ALP Pouches, a nicotine pouch company that pledged the first $1 million. In less than three days the page has reached $3.4m. The campaign's organizers wrote: \"Our team at ALP is heartbroken by the death of Charlie Kirk — a devoted husband, father, and friend. Love for God, family, and country defined his life.\" The page lists a fundraising goal of $5 million, with organizers urging supporters to give 'whatever you are able' to help Erika and the children in the wake of Kirk's death. The suspected shooter The suspected shooter, identified as 22 year old Tyler Robinson, was apprehended Thursday night. Robinson now faces charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty. Officials in Utah repeated that prosecutors are to seek the death penalty for the gunman responsible for the MAGA firebrand’s death as he spoke at Utah Valley University. Currently, Robinson is to be charged with aggravated murder, among other charges, at the state level, according to a probable cause affidavit released. Authorities have three days to file the documents in preparation for a preliminary court hearing, where the suspect would first go before a judge, likely early next week. Yet, despite the state charges, federal prosecutors are looking to bring their own indictment, which they say will carry capital punishment . Donald Trump said in an interview on Fox & Friends earlier today that he hoped the suspect would get the death penalty. You can donate to the fundraiser by clicking here .

His policies ignored decades of established diplomatic engagement between the two democracies.”\nDuring Trump’s presidency, the US has imposed higher import duties on steel and aluminium, affecting Indian manufacturers. In retaliation, India raised tariffs on a range of US products. The trade dispute escalated when Trump revoked India’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status in 2019, a move that ended duty-free access to the US market for nearly $6 billion worth of Indian exports—impacting small and medium-sized enterprises across India.\nTharoor, a former Under-Secretary-General at the United Nations and a noted foreign policy commentator, also criticised Trump’s undiplomatic style, saying it eroded the “mutual respect” that traditionally underpinned India-US relations.\n“Diplomacy is not about bluster and tweets,” Tharoor remarked. “It’s about cultivating long-term relationships based on trust and shared values. Trump upended that balance.”\nWhile India-US trade reached $146 billion in 2019 and continues to grow, many analysts agree that policy uncertainty under the Trump administration has added friction to what was once seen as a steadily deepening strategic partnership.\nTharoor’s remarks underscore broader concerns in India’s policy circles about the direction of US foreign policy under Trump—especially as India looks to balance its global trade relationships while navigating a shifting geopolitical landscape.","summary":"Tharoor slammed Trump’s undiplomatic style, saying it eroded the 'mutual respect' that traditionally underpinned India-US relations","url":"https://www.news18.com/india/shashi-tharoor-blames-trumps-tariffs-for-indian-job-losses-criticises-diplomatic-conduct-9568876.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/tharoor-2025-05-2ceaa0c675996a9536b12a8b859fc708.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-13 00:16:15","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.243},{"id":360051754,"title":"Appeals court rules Trump administration can end legal protections for more than 400,000 migrants","text":"By MICHAEL CASEY\n\nBOSTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration can end legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nThe ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization.

But we cannot let free speech die with Charlie Kirk.\n\n‘It is more important than ever that we stand up for it.’\n\nShadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said Mr Kirk’s death ‘must be a wake-up call for the Western world’, adding: ‘Free speech is under threat and political violence is growing.\n\n‘We must fight back with a renewed commitment to defend the right for people to speak freely – even those we vehemently disagree with – or democracy will die.’\n\nTurning Point UK, the political campaign group set up by Mr Kirk, 31, held a vigil in Whitehall in his memory last night.\n\nChief executive Jack Ross told the crowd of around 500 people: ‘Despite what certain members of the Press have reported, Charlie was not a hateful “far-Right” bigot – he was a good Christian man and his passion came from his desire to help people.\n\n‘Charlie did not hate anyone through his work – he wanted to educate them and teach them to make better decisions.\n\n‘Charlie’s legacy will be one of hope. Hope that the world will return to normalcy. Hope that people will once again embrace Christianity and family values. Hope that what happened to Charlie will never happen again.’\n\nThe organisation has warned that left-Wing activists had tried to ‘stir up assassination attempts’ against its members by posting lies and threats on social media.\n\n‘We are majorly concerned about copycat attacks in Britain,’ Mr Ross added. ‘But we will not be deterred or intimidated out of delivering our message. Charlie’s brutal assassination is a stark reminder of why we need more free speech. When political echo chambers shut out other opinions it leads to radicalisation, swiftly followed by violence.\n\n‘I think it is truly sick that people are celebrating Charlie’s murder. The far-Left have not learnt any lessons from this tragedy.’\n\nShadow Foreign Secretary Dame Priti Patel said it was ‘disgraceful’ that ‘far-Left mobs would seek to target’ the group ‘with intimidation and threats’.\n\nShe added: ‘Charlie Kirk’s assassination was an assault on the freedom of speech that we hold so dear. The right to openly and peacefully express one’s views, without fear of violence, is fundamental to democracy.\n\n‘This must be a wake-up call for our country and for the West. Freedom of speech must be defended at all costs.’\n\nLast night, Mr Farage blasted the rise in political violence, and called for police to investigate those calling for him to be shot.\n\nHe said: ‘If we are serious about understanding what the limits of freedom of speech are, those people posting on TikTok calling for me to be killed yesterday, let’s see if the police go and arrest them. Because if they don’t, we truly are living in two-tier Britain.’\n\nDozens of Bluesky users revelled in Mr Kirk’s death yesterday, posting messages including one that said: ‘Charlie Kirk is dead, YAY!!!!

Catch!'\n\nThe killing sparked a desperate nationwide manhunt that ended 33 hours later, when a relative of Robinson contacted a friend - who tipped off law enforcement.\n\n'We got him,' Utah Governor Spencer Cox declared at a press conference earlier on Friday, confirming Robinson's identity and lauding the family's reluctant role in his capture.\n\n'On the evening of September 11th, a family member of Tyler Robinson reached out to a family friend, who contacted the Washington County sheriff's office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident,' Cox said.\n\nKirk was killed with a high-powered hunting rifle in front of hundreds of supporters at a campus stop on his 'America First' college tour. \n\nAuthorities quickly recovered the murder weapon from a wooded area nearby but without a suspect in custody, early efforts to identify the shooter stalled. \n\nThe FBI mistakenly detaining two unrelated individuals before narrowing in on Robinson late on Thursday.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the arrest took place around 10pm that night.\n\nFor many in Robinson's orbit, the news was incomprehensible. He had by all accounts, been raised in the faith Kirk had publicly praised, and shown no outward signs of radicalism.\n\n'He went to our church when he was younger,' said Kristin Schwiermann, a former head custodian at Robinson's elementary school in Washington County. 'I was a head custodian for 18 years at Riverside Elementary. He went to Pine View High School,' she told The New York Post.\n\n'I just know that [Tyler] carried himself nicely. He was very nice. He was smart. I hear he had a full-ride scholarship [to college]… I was shocked that this was even him.'\n\nPhotos circulating on social media show Robinson dressed in a Halloween costume made to appear as if he was riding Donald Trump's shoulders. In others, he can be seen poses with guns.\n\nRobinson had been working toward a career as an electrician and was in the third year of an apprenticeship when the shooting occurred.\n\nWhile no motive has officially been declared, clues are beginning to emerge.\n\nTwo unused bullet casings found near the scene bore scrawled slogans, authorities say. One read, 'Hey, fascist! Catch!'. Other cartridges included gaming references and internet symbols.\n\nGovernor Cox confirmed the writing appeared 'hand-etched' and said forensic analysis was ongoing to determine whether Robinson had acted alone or with influence from extremist online communities.\n\n'We do not yet have definitive proof of political motivation,' Cox said. 'But the markings on the casings are deeply troubling.'\n\nBefore Robinson had even been named publicly, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints condemned the violence and issued a plea for peace.\n\n'We condemn violence and lawless behavior. We also pray that we may treat one another with greater kindness, compassion and goodness,' said Church spokesman Doug Andersen on Wednesday. 'For members of the Church, we reaffirm the Savior's teaching and admonition is to love our neighbor.'\n\nSuch message echoed the tone of Kirk's final moments as he expressed admiration for the Mormon ethos of service, community, and evangelism.\n\nHe even teased a man in the crowd for wearing the signature 'white shirt and tie,' joking that he must've 'just come from knocking on doors,' a reference to missionary work.\n\nThen he turned serious again: 'I really respect what you guys do.'\n\nKirk had long been a lightning rod with his fierce in his rhetoric on race, immigration, guns, gender identity, and religion. He co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012, rising to prominence as a fiery youth voice for conservatism.\n\nHis online presence, particularly on TikTok and YouTube, drew millions of views. \n\nFollowing Kirk's killing President Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff and vowed swift justice.\n\n 'I want the death penalty for the killer,' Trump said on Thursday night.\n\nVice President JD Vance personally accompanied Kirk's casket on the return flight to Phoenix, using Air Force Two. Video footage showed Vance placing his hand on the flag-draped coffin as it was carried off the plane.\n\n'It still feels insane that this happened,' Jonathan Silva, 35, said at a vigil in Orem Park, where hundreds gathered on Thursday evening with candles and MAGA hats. 'It's totally surreal.","summary":"Charlie Kirk was fatally shot moments after praising the Mormon faith during a speech at Utah Valley University.

p.m.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has denied an application for another stay order to delay a cull of about 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm that was hit by an outbreak of avian influenza.\n\nKatie Pasitney, the spokeswoman for Universal Ostrich Farms, says the ruling means an interim stay granted last weekend to give the farm time to make legal submissions \"no longer exists.\"\n\nIt leaves the farm in Edgewood without legal protection against the cull proceeding.\n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency ordered the slaughter on Dec. 31, 2024, during an outbreak of H5N1 avian flu that killed 69 ostriches.\n\nThe farm has been fighting the cull order ever since, but it lost its case in Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal.\n\nIt had been seeking another stay to mount a challenge at the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nBut the Appeal Court says it has been denied, with Justice Gerald Heckman disregarding affidavits filed by the farm in response to submissions by the CFIA on the stay application, in line with what it says are court rules.\n\nORIGINAL 11:07 p.m. \n\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency says material submitted by a British Columbia ostrich farm to support another stay of an avian flu cull order for its flock is improper, because it asks the court to decide on a matter of science.\n\nThe lawyer for Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, B.C., had written to the Federal Court of Appeal on Wednesday seeking \"retroactive\" permission for having submitted the documents four hours late.\n\nThe CFIA says in response that it has no objections to the extension, but that doesn't mean it agrees the submissions are \"admissible or material\" to the request for another stay.\n\nIts cites a new expert report for the farm by a University of B.C. professor that it says largely repeats opinions in other expert reports already deemed by the Federal Court to have \"improperly\" asked it to become an \"arbiter of truth\" on matters of immunology and public health.\n\nFarm spokeswoman Katie Pasitney meanwhile says in a news release that the farm has \"formally petitioned\" the minister of agriculture to rescind the cull order.\n\nThe farm is fighting a cull of about 400 birds that was ordered by the CFIA on Dec. 31, over an avian flu outbreak that went on to kill 69 birds.\n\nThe CFIA says there are ongoing risks posed by the flock and the conditions in which they are kept, while the farmers say the birds are healthy and scientifically valuable, having acquired \"herd immunity.\"\n\nThe farm's situation has drawn attention from opponents of government overreach and the U.S. administration of Donald Trump, whose Health Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has called for the birds to be spared and studied.\n\nSupporters of the farm have been camping out at the property, staging music concerts and other events to draw attention to the case.\n\nThe farm has already lost hearings in Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal and says it wants another stay to prepare an application for the Supreme Court of Canada to hear its case.","summary":"UPDATE 4:50 p.m.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has denied an application for another stay order to delay a cull of about 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm that was hit by an outbreak of avian influenza.\n\nKatie Pasitney, the spokeswoman for Universal Ostrich Farms, says the ruling means an ...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Nelson/571967/Federal-Court-of-Appeal-rejects-B-C-ostrich-farm-s-bid-for-stay-of-cull-order","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/9/de3068e7323c34f46ab52328a470f870ebee46ffea181d481d5def93a00bb868.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:50:00","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":360053760,"title":"Joby Aviation Jumped Today -- Is the Stock a Buy Right Now?","text":"Joby Aviation (JOBY 2.38%) stock surged early in Friday's trading, but it wound up giving up most of its gains. Shares of the maker of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles rose 2.3% today, but they had been up as much as 11.2% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.4%.\n\nJoby stock posted gains today following a press release from the company announcing that it will be participating in the White House's eVTOL Integration Pilot Program. Following an executive order from President Donald Trump, it seems mature eVTOL aircraft will be able to operate in select markets without receiving full certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIs Joby stock a buy right now?\n\nThe recent executive order on eVTOL aircraft and the White House eVTOL Integration Pilot Program look to be significant wins for Joby Aviation. The ability to conveniently train pilots in the U.S. could make the launch and scaling up of the company's commercial flight business in the territory significantly easier. It could also be a big boon when it comes to the development, testing, and adoption of eVTOL craft for defense applications.\n\nSporting a market capitalization of roughly $12 billion and still without revenue, Joby is undeniably a high-risk investment. For those unwilling to embrace the potential for huge downside volatility, the stock should be a no-go -- but it could make sense as a buy for investors seeking exposure to the eVTOL market.","summary":"The Trump administration just gave Joby investors some good news.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/12/joby-aviation-jumped-today-is-the-stock-a-buy-righ/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F833496%2Fgettyimages-1292531161.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:46:18","author":"Keith Noonan","authors":["Keith Noonan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.581},{"id":360048654,"title":"Charlie Kirk's widow Erika set to deliver 1st public address since fatal shooting","text":"Just days after a gunman shot and killed conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, his wife, Erika, is set to deliver her first public remarks on Friday night.\n\nHer address will be streamed live at 8:15 p.m. ET on the social media platforms of Turning Point USA, the organization Kirk founded.\n\nCharlie Kirk was husband to Erika and the father of two young kids at the time of his death on Wednesday, a 1-year-old son and a 3-year-old daughter.\n\nThe founder of the conservative youth activist organization was shot while speaking at Utah Valley University, the first stop this fall for Turning Point USA's \"The American Comeback Tour,\" which was traveling to multiple college campuses across the country.\n\nIn what has been described as a \"political assassination,\" Kirk was struck by a single shot while he was speaking at the event on Wednesday.

Dick Durbin joined violence prevention leaders Friday in Little Village to tout the organizations’ efforts that some credit for the city’s plummeting crime rates.\n\n“If we work together, we can reduce crime. That is critical for the lives that will be affected and for the reputation of this city,” said Durbin, D-Ill.\n\nHe joined state Sen. Celina Villanueva, D-Chicago, to speak with New Life Church pastor Matt DeMateo and Christa Hamilton, the president and CEO of the social services organization UCAN about how their work with violence interruptors have led to a drop in shootings and homicides in their communities.\n\nFrom June through August, Chicago recorded the fewest homicides in 60 years during that three-month span, and overall violent crime has remained near its lowest point in at least four decades, WBEZ previously reported.\n\nIn the police district that primarily serves Little Village, shootings and homicides have dropped by about 50% this year compared to the same point last year, according to Chicago police data.\n\n“Lives are being turned around through these programs. Sadly, the budgets for these programs in Washington are being cut by the same president who wants to put troops on the street. Doesn’t make sense. Let us invest in things that work,” Durbin said.\n\nDeMateo partially credits the drop to his group’s street outreach program, which involves more than 2,000 violence prevention workers canvassing the neighborhood and responding to incidents to mediate conflicts.\n\nHe rejects the president’s threats to deploy troops to Chicago, which Trump said Friday “he would have preferred” instead of his pivot to sending troops to Memphis.\n\n“The plan is working. We need investment in those programs and investment in peace, not investment in the Department of War and the deployment of federal troops,” DeMateo said, referring to Trump’s recent executive order renaming the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nFederal funding for violence intervention programs like DeMateo’s and Hamilton’s have been slashed this year, and DOJ grants for those programs have been canceled under Trump’s administration.\n\n“We need consistency in this type of funding because every single moment where we lose someone that is doing the work — a case manager, somebody that’s working with the young people in the neighborhoods — it’s just a lost opportunity to be able to provide the support that’s needed for our young people,” Villanueva said.\n\nHamilton, a South Side native who has lost loved ones and clients to gun violence, said she’s been a victim of property crimes and had “bullets outside my windows.”\n\nShe represents 175 community violence interventionists who work daily to respond to incidents, provide youth mentoring and other outreach services, and who she also credited for helping Chicago’s violent crime numbers to decrease.\n\n“[Community violence intervention] is working, we see the return on our investment, we need to continue an approach that is working,” Hamilton said. “Obviously, we all want a safer Chicago, and that is what me and my colleagues are working day and night to create.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/12/durbin-pushes-for-more-violence-intervention-programs-as-chicagos-crime-rates-decline","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9750608/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1024x690+0+0/resize/1024x690!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F57%2F96%2F0d21a8d043f38b024bec60446132%2Fdurbin","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:27:00","author":"Kade Heather","authors":["Kade Heather"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":360048618,"title":"'Christ is king!' chants break out at large memorial for Charlie Kirk in London","text":"British admirers of the slain activist Charlie Kirk gathered in a large memorial in front of the Prime Minister's Office on Downing Street in London.\n\nThe 31-year-old activist was shot and killed Wednesday while debating students on his celebrated national campus tour stop at Utah Valley University.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy HANNAH MCDONALD, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:23:15 BST, 12 September 2025 |Updated:00:20 BST, 13 September 2025 \n\nDavina McCall is reportedly engaged to her hairstylist boyfriend Michael Douglas - just weeks after she revealed she would never marry again. \nThe TV presenter was friends for years with celebrity hairdresser Michael, 47, but they only began dating after she finalised her divorce with ex-husband Matthew Robertson in April 2018. \nThey went public with their relationship in 2018 and by January 2023, Michael had moved in with her - and now, the smitten couple are reportedly set to tie the knot.\nTo ensure her loved ones were the first to know, Davina managed to keep the engagement private and didn't even tell ITV bosses.\nRevealing her engagement, a friend of Davina's said: 'She has a ring but is only wearing it in private.'\n'It is wonderful news and everyone who knows them is just so thrilled. They really do make the most gorgeous couple,' they told The Sun.\n\nDavina McCall is reportedly engaged to her hairstylist boyfriend Michael Douglas - just weeks after she revealed she would never marry again\n\nThey went public with their relationship in 2018 and by January 2023, Michael had moved in with her - and now, the smitten couple are reportedly set to tie the knot\nThe friend said Davina had come to the conclusion that life is too short, one year on from her terrifying brain tumour ordeal. \nAn ITV source said: 'Davina kept it a secret for a long time, she didn't even tell ITV.\n'She isn't someone who likes to talk about her private life much so she wanted to make sure all of her loved ones knew the news before she told anyone else.'\nIt's a stark difference from Davina's stance a month ago, when she said that she would never marry again.\nShe told The Mirror: 'We go on honeymoons all the time but without getting married. \n'We're in the honeymoon period even after all these years. I couldn't be more happy. \n'And sometimes there's an idea of, why change anything?' \nDavina explained how her late father taught her that every successful relationship needs 'friendship, attraction, trust and respect'. \n\nRevealing her engagement, a friend of Davina's said: 'She has a ring but is only wearing it in private' (pictured with Michael in March) \n\n'It is wonderful news and everyone who knows them is just so thrilled. They really do make the most gorgeous couple,' the friend told The Sun\nShe added: 'If any of those things are lacking, love can't flourish. And I think he was absolutely spot on.' \nShe and Michael met when he styled her hair during her stint on Big Brother. \nWith so much in common, the pair stayed good friends until they realised they had romantic feelings for each other.\nDavina was married to Matthew for 17 years, and had three children with him, Holly, Chester, and Tilly. \nBefore that, she was married to Andrew Leggett from 1997 until 1999.\nShe was given the Special Recognition prize at last year's NTAs for her near three-decade long career on screen. Davina received a standing ovation from the crowd at London's O2 Arena. \n\nShe told The Mirror: 'We go on honeymoons all the time but without getting married. We're in the honeymoon period after all these years'\n\nDavina was married to Matthew Robertson (pictured) for 17 years, and had three children with him. Before that, she was married to Andrew Leggett from 1997 until 1999\nIn an emotional VT, telly pals Dermot O'Leary, Alison Hammond and Claudia Winkleman opened up about their friendships as they heaped praise on her career. \nIt left Davina in tears as she collected the award from Hannah Waddingham. \nDavina later revealed the reason she was so emotional, opening up on her terrifying brain tumour ordeal that saw her go under the knife.\nShe told The Mirror: 'Last year, I knew I had a brain tumour and I knew I was being operated on six weeks later, and I picked up the award which meant so much to me.\n'Everybody else knew why it meant so much to me, it just meant the world to me because I wasn't sure where I was going to be six weeks later.' \nMichael DouglasDavina McCallITV\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall is 'engaged to hairstylist boyfriend Michael Douglas' just weeks after revealing she has no plans to marry again\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 16\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed Friday that law enforcement arrested the suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Cloud deleted an X post that prompted backlash, in which she made presumptions about the alleged killer's family's political beliefs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"So how y'all gone twist this? Raised in a good middle class family, dad was an officer/church leader, whole family of Republicans and gun owners [and] Trump supporters,\" Cloud said in the deleted post. Cloud left several other controversial posts remaining on her feed. One post made the unsubstantiated assertion that Robinson was a \"far-right Republican.\" \"Tyler Robinson and his parents were Republicans. FAR RIGHT REPUBLICANS,\" Cloud wrote. Cloud also left a post on her feed that contained a racially-charged comment about Robinson, and connected the assassination to recent threats against historically Black colleges and universities. The FBI, in a statement Thursday, said it is \"aware of hoax threat calls\" to HBCUs. \"So why were y'all threatening HBCU’s when it was a 22-year-old white boy from Utah who shot Charlie? Racism. Not politics. Racism. Difference in policy is you giving tax cuts to billionaires. Y'all dumb but I digress. Your hatred for other people is not politics,\" Cloud wrote. TIMELINE OF CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION Cloud responded to a criticism of that post by another user, using more racially-charged language. \"A white boy is literally what he is. He didn’t even have facial hair. Stop being soft,\" she wrote. Journalist Jemele Hill came to Cloud's defense after conservative influencer Jon Root responded to Cloud with criticisms. On Wednesday, shortly after Kirk was shot, Cloud used the incident to call for tougher gun laws in a post on X. \"I AM TIIIRRREEEED,\" Cloud wrote. \"We need legislation surrounding our firearms. NO FAMILY deserves to lose a loved one when these are CONTROLLABLES. Your 2nd amendment was written for guns that took powder. Not military grade weapons. We’re the leading country in gun-related deaths.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the New York Liberty for a response to Cloud's statements. Since-deleted Facebook posts, viewed by Fox News Digital, paint a picture of Robinson’s life in Washington County, Utah, filled with family milestones, birthdays and school achievements. Steven Dunham, director of communications for the Washington County School District, confirmed to Fox News Digital that Robinson was a student in the district from 2008 to May 2021, attending Pine View Middle School and Pine View High School. By 2021, Robinson was shown moving into Utah State University (USU), with photos outside the Richard and Moonyeen Anderson Engineering Building. At the time of his arrest, Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College. In a statement, the Utah Board of Higher Education said that he is a \"third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College. He briefly attended Utah State University (one semester in 2021) and received concurrent enrollment credit through Utah Tech University while in high school (2019-2021).\" Meanwhile, Cloud has been one of the WNBA's most outspoken players over the last year. In July, she made controversial comments about Trump and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while speaking to reporters earlier in the week. Cloud, who has been a vocal supporter of socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, gave praise for the candidate while warning Trump against sending ICE to the city. \"Mamdani, my boy!\" she told reporters following a New York Liberty practice. She added, \"If Donny wants to come down here, if ICE wants to try and come down here, that's fine.\" \"But [they're] going to learn the hard way… New Yorkers really don't f--- around. They don't play about one another. The don't play about this city.\" Cloud went on to deliver a lengthy rant about her support for socialism and belief that Trump's opposition is \"getting to them.\" \"I just think that it's reckless of our president, reckless of this administration but it's also exciting for us, the people, because that's when you know we're getting to them,\" In June, she seemingly reacted to the U.S. military’s strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities, writing on X, \"A sad sad day,\" and \"Grounds for impeachment.\" In February, Cloud responded to President Donald Trump’s decision to eliminate several government DEI programs. \"The systems of power are working as they always were intended to work,\" Cloud told The Associated Press. \"And it’s time to break down a system that has only been about White men.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cloud added that she believes the country is putting \"money over people.\" \"I understand the business aspect and I understand the human aspect,\" Cloud said. \"Too often this country has put the human aspect aside, and put profit and money over people.\" Fox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten, Michael Ruiz and Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report.

It is believed that because the peer refused to resign, he could receive a substantial taxpayer-funded payout. He is still on the Government payroll and will be paid until a settlement is reached.\n\nIt comes as Labour MPs angrily rounded on Sir Keir and his most senior adviser last night amid a fractious blame game over Lord Mandelson’s exit.\n\nBackbenchers said the PM was ‘not up to the job’, while others said his chief of staff Morgan McSweeney would ‘have to go’ after another disastrous week for the Government.\n\nBut MPs and ministers are furious Sir Keir picked the New Labour architect for the post in the first place, with several pointing the finger over who is to blame for the poor judgment followed by the delay in getting rid of him.\n\nMr McSweeney, the PM’s chief adviser, is said to have championed Lord Mandelson’s appointment and sought to save the peer even after the email revelations – a claim disputed by senior No 10 figures.\n\nLast night MPs were calling for him to be sacked – while others questioned how long Sir Keir could survive in office after yet another humiliating blunder. One backbencher, who is close to Mr McSweeney, told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s pretty clear that Morgan is going to have to go now – and he should go because it is such an appalling decision that he clearly pushed through.\n\n‘Keir ultimately does make the decisions, but you still want to ensure that he is surrounded by good people and you have to seriously question Morgan’s judgment on this.’\n\nThe MP described the mood in the party as ‘febrile’, and warned that rebellions would become more common if No 10 did not up its game.\n\n‘This is our worst moment since getting elected and the most difficult moment in Keir’s leadership – it has been incredibly damaging,’ they added. Clive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, became the first backbencher to call publicly for Sir Keir to go as he accused him of not being ‘up to the job’.\n\nHe told the BBC’s The Week In Westminster programme that the PM had ‘lost control within the first year’, and warned: ‘We don’t have the luxury of carrying on this way with someone who I think just doesn’t seem up to the job.’\n\nMr Lewis added that there was ‘a very, very dangerous atmosphere in the PLP [parliamentary Labour Party]’ following a ‘deeply unpopular’ Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nHis comments came as a Labour minister told the Daily Mail Sir Keir looked ‘weak’ but warned: ‘If Keir doesn’t stand by Morgan, Keir won’t last very long. The buck obviously stops in No 10 with the PM, and the pattern we’ve learned about Keir Starmer is that people around him get felled by his own limits one by one.\n\n‘And Morgan is essentially the last man standing between the baying masses and him, and I think he knows that without Morgan they would come for him.’\n\nThey said Sir Keir needed to ‘quickly show that he has strength and leadership and courage, because time is running out’.\n\nLord Mandelson’s departure marked the second time in less than a week that Sir Keir has defended a senior figure only for them to be forced out over a scandal after Angela Rayner’s resignation. It caps a disastrous start to ‘Phase Two’ of the Government.\n\nAnd it comes just days before Donald Trump is due in the UK for a State visit, which could still be overshadowed by the furore over Lord Mandelson’s departure. Allies of the peer told The Times yesterday that he had admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with Epstein for many years.\n\nLord Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein was known prior to his appointment, but emails leaked to Bloomberg revealed details of their communication after the financier’s crimes had emerged. The messages included passages in which the peer had told Epstein to ‘fight for early release’ shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nHe is also reported to have told Epstein ‘I think the world of you’ the day before he began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.\n\nA No 10 spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has confidence in his top team and they are getting on with the important work of this Government.’\n\nOne source, however, suggested that the reports about Mr McSweeney’s involvement was ‘Sue Gray’s revenge’ after he ‘drove her out’ of Downing Street.\n\nBaroness Gray, the PM’s controversial former chief of staff, never considered Lord Mandelson for the job, it was suggested. He ‘wasn’t even on the candidate list’ under her watch, the source said.\n\nOthers in Labour also pointed the finger at Sir Keir, suggesting that he has given Mr McSweeney too much responsibility.\n\nOne said: ‘Morgan does make these decisions, but the PM trusts him to make all these decisions. He just completely outsources all of his thinking: he did it with Rachel [Reeves] on the economy and he does it with Morgan on day-to-day judgment.’\n\nLabour grandee Lord Blunkett suggested Sir Keir should listen to more experienced advisers and ‘seasoned politicians’. He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘All I would say to Keir is: politics is a rough ride and being in government is much more difficult… than being in Opposition.’\n\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch said the Prime Minister was ‘in office, but not in power’ and ‘should never have appointed’ Lord Mandelson. She added: ‘What this is showing is that he [Starmer] had very bad judgment and he was only forced into sacking Peter Mandelson because I raised those questions at Prime Minister’s Questions and a lot of his backbenchers heard how bad it was and put pressure on him… All of that is Keir Starmer’s fault, not anyone else’s.’\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage suggested the PM ‘ignored the warnings’.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Caerphilly, Mr Farage said: ‘You sort of begin to get the feeling that the PM ignored the warnings, carried on without really having much support in his own party, and then it took him quite a long time to actually remove Lord Mandelson.’\n\nSpeaking from the Ukraine capital Kyiv where she is on her first overseas visit in her new role, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the decision to sack Lord Mandelson, which she was part of, was ‘rightly taken’.","summary":"Lord Mandelson then backed by Sir Keir at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday before he was dramatically sacked on Thursday as Britain's ambassador to the US.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15093829/Peter-Mandelson-Keir-Starmer.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/12/23/101964767-0-image-m-23_1757715750356.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/10/7029245156208062895/1024x576_MP4_7029245156208062895.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:18:11","author":"Editor,Harriet Line","authors":["Editor","Harriet Line"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":360047648,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, September 12","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode September 12, 2025 38:51 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, September 12 \n Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump, DOJ\n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump, DOJ","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6379279216112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/856712fb-a89a-4171-8740-67e72f2e4fb9/e0370e5d-23d5-4430-9692-fdf5d076bdd9/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:18:09","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":360047360,"title":"Possible accomplice of Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson probed as footage emerges of suspicious character after shooting","text":"Possible accomplice of Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson probed as footage emerges of suspicious character after shooting\n\nThe Assassination of Charlie Kirk: Listen to the latest on the Daily Mail podcast \n\nBy STEPHEN M.

But officials said Robinson became 'more political' in recent years and spoke about disliking the conservative activist's ideas. \n\nThe alleged killer confessed to his father Matt, who owns a construction company, sources told the Daily Mail. \n\nHe reportedly told his father that he would rather kill himself than turn himself in, but was convinced to speak with a local youth minister who also worked with the US Marshals Service. \n\nThe suspect's arrest came after Utah's Governor Spencer Cox pleaded with the public to help find the person who shot 31-year-old Kirk dead while he spoke to students at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. \n\nThe FBI was offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Kirk's killer.\n\nHis mother, Amber Robinson, works for Intermountain Support Coordination Services, a company contracted by the state of Utah to help disabled people receive care.

He lives in a $600,000 six-bedroom home in Washington, Utah - about 260 miles south of Kirk's assassination site in Orem. \n\nRobinson faces charges of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by NBC News. Authorities said at a press conference on Thursday night that Robinson will face the death penalty if convicted. \n\nAt a press conference on Friday morning, Utah governor Spencer Cox began his remarks by declaring: 'We got him.' \n\nHe said that investigators learned from Robinson's family that he had become more political in recent times, and had recently expressed his dislike for Kirk, describing him to his family as 'full of hate'.\n\nCox said that casings from the weapon used to kill Kirk were found to have several anti-fascist messages engraved on them, including one referencing the WW2 Italian anti-fascist song Bella Ciao. \n\nOne engraving read 'Hey Fascists, Catch!' - next to an up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol and three down arrow symbols - another read 'OwO', and a third read 'If You Read This You Are Gay LMAO', Cox said. \n\nA memorial for Charlie Kirk is displayed outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA in Phoenix\n\nThe family's social media profiles show Robinson, who has two younger brothers, often enjoying family vacations and sharing smiling selfies, including one of his mother celebrating her 'genius' son getting into college \n\nThe governor added that Robinson's roommate helped investigators by showing messages on Discord where the alleged killer talked about retrieving a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, and references to engraved bullets and a scope. \n\nSocial media accounts linked to Robinson's family show he was often around guns as a child, including one image shared by his mother showing him posing with an M2 Browning 50. caliber machine gun. \n\nHe also received a gun kit for Christmas, and was seen wearing shoes that appeared to match those worn by the suspect in images released by investigators during the manhunt. \n\nIn another image from Robinson's mother's social media from 2017, he was seen wearing a Donald Trump costume for Halloween. \n\nCox described Kirk's assassination as a 'watershed moment' in American history, but added: 'The question is, what kind of watershed?'\n\nTrump announced the arrest in an appearance on Fox News, where he said that 'someone very close' to the suspect turned him in.\n\nRobinson's arrest comes after a manhunt for the suspect stretched to over a day and a half, with officials previously offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his capture.\n\nSurveillance footage had been released showing a figure on top of a roof leaping from a building and sprinting into a nearby neighborhood after Kirk was shot from around 200 yards away.\n\nPeople attend a vigil at Orem City Center Park, after U.S. right-wing activist and commentator, Charlie Kirk\n\nRobinson's arrest comes after a manhunt for the suspect stretched to over a day and a half, with officials previously offering a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his capture\n\nThe conservative commentator was hit by a single bullet while speaking to a crowd at the public university in Orem on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe father of two, known for his fierce MAGA views and thrilling debates with college kids across the country, collapsed immediately after being hit by the gunfire.\n\nThe alleged killer was found after multiple suspects were incorrectly apprehended on Tuesday.\n\nInitially, a 'person of interest' was said to be in custody in connection with Kirk's shooting, Utah governor Spencer Cox announced Wednesday evening.\n\nHowever, they were later released, FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed.\n\n'The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,' Patel said in a statement.

Its foreign minister said Poland hopes Washington will take action to show solidarity with Warsaw.\nLater on Friday, the US joined Western allies in a statement to express concern about the drone incursion and to accuse Moscow of violating international law and the founding UN Charter.\nThe statement was read by Poland’s Secretary of State Marcin Bosacki before a UN Security Council meeting on the drone issue.\nRussia said its forces had been attacking Ukraine at the time of the drone incursions and that it had not intended to hit targets in Poland.\n\nNato Secretary General Mark Rutte called the incursions “reckless and unacceptable”. “We can’t have Russian drones entering allied airspace,” he told a press conference announcing operation “Eastern Sentry”.\nThe mission, which begins on Friday evening, will involve a range of assets integrating air and ground bases.\nAllies, including Denmark, France, Britain, and Germany, have committed to the mission with others set to join, Rutte said, adding that Nato was still assessing the possible intent behind the incursion.\nNato’s top military official, Supreme Allied Commander Europe Alexus Grynkewich, a US Air Force general, said the alliance would defend every inch of its territory.\n“Poland and citizens from across the alliance should be assured by our rapid response earlier this week and our significant announcement here today,” Grynkewich told the same press conference at Nato headquarters in Brussels.\nGrynkewich said Eastern Sentry was designed as a flexible operation to bolster defences along Nato’s entire eastern flank, which stretches from the Baltic states in the north to Romania and Bulgaria in the south.\nNato already has substantial forces in Eastern Europe, including thousands of troops. It did not specify how many additional troops would be involved in the new operation.\nIts announcement detailed a modest number of additional military assets – including two F-16 fighter aircraft and a frigate from Denmark, three Rafale fighters from France, and four Eurofighter planes from Germany. Britain said it would play its part and would detail its contribution soon.\nResponding to Trump’s comment on Thursday that the incursion could have been an accident, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk responded on social media: “We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn’t. And we know it.”\nTrump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday that his patience with Putin was “sort of running out and running out fast”, but stopped short of threatening new sanctions over the war.\nTrump has repeatedly set deadlines for Moscow to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions, only to row back.\nAt the emergency Security Council meeting, acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea said the “United States stands by our Nato allies in the face of these alarming airspace violations … and rest assured, we will defend every inch of Nato territory.”\nShe said Russia’s intensified bombing campaign since Trump and Putin met in Alaska last month and its violation of Polish airspace “intentionally or otherwise show immense disrespect for good-faith US efforts to bring an end to this conflict”.\n\nAfter strong condemnation of Russia by European leaders over the incident, Germany said it had extended air policing over Poland and summoned the Russian ambassador on Friday. France also summoned the Russian envoy to Paris over the incursion.\nFor Polish leaders to directly contradict Trump is almost unheard of and a sign of Europe’s alarm at the US president’s willingness to give weight to Moscow’s account.\nPoland has praised Trump for calling for greater European military spending and has been praised in turn by the Trump administration for devoting the largest share of its economy to defence of any Nato ally, including the United States itself.\nThis week’s incident has raised questions about Nato’s ability to respond to the sort of mass drone attacks – often involving hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicles – that have been a feature of the war in Ukraine following Russia’s 2022 invasion.\nEuropean leaders say the incident again shows Moscow has no interest in a peace deal in Ukraine, weeks after Trump hosted Putin in Alaska and dropped a demand that Russia accept an immediate ceasefire.\nEuropean officials have been in Washington this week, hoping to coordinate sanctions on Russia with the US administration. Announcing such sanctions in tandem was previously standard practice, but has not taken place since Trump returned to office.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that peace negotiations were on pause and that “the Europeans are hindering this” peace process.\nRussia and its close ally Belarus began a long-planned joint military exercise on Friday involving drills in both countries and in the Baltic and Barents seas.\nDismissing concerns abroad about the exercise, Peskov said Western European countries were suffering “emotional overload” and that Russia did not pose a threat to them.","summary":"Nato announced plans to strengthen the defence of Europe’s eastern flank on Friday, two days after Poland shot down drones that had violated its airspace in the first known action of its kind by a member of the Western alliance during Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nWarsaw has portrayed the drone incursions as an attempt by Russia to test the capabilities of Poland and Nato to respond.\nOn Friday, Poland rejected Donald Trump’s suggestion that the incursions could have been a mistake, a rare...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3325409/nato-boosts-defence-europes-eastern-flank-after-poland-shoots-down-russian-drones","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/13/7617bcbb-353a-4599-893b-d9bbff6be3bd_4ad1fcdf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:16:50","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.052},{"id":360049906,"title":"Pete Hegseth urges Pentagon staff to identify service members’ negative posts about Charlie Kirk","text":"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has instructed his team to track down any military personnel who have either mocked or shown approval of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, aiming to enforce disciplinary action, according to two defense officials speaking to NBC News.\n\nSeveral service members have already been removed from their positions due to such content on social media, the officials reported, mentioning that Hegseth’s order also covers individuals linked to the Defense Department. The exact number of those reprimanded remains unspecified.\n\nIn a move to encourage vigilance, Hegseth and other top Pentagon officials shared messages on X this week, urging the public to highlight any posts that could be seen as negative towards Kirk or lacking sympathy for his death.\n\n“We are tracking all these very closely — and will address, immediately. Completely unacceptable,” Hegseth wrote on X Thursday.\n\nThis was further supported by Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell’s statement on X, declaring, “It is unacceptable for military personnel and Department of War civilians to celebrate or mock the assassination of a fellow American.”\n\n“The Department of War has zero tolerance for it,” Parnell added, using the secondary name for the Defense Department.\n\nNumerous social media users have responded to this call by helping Hegseth and the Pentagon identify and report relevant posts. A significant number of service members and civilian Pentagon staff have had their controversial posts noted and brought together under the hashtag #RevolutionariesintheRanks.\n\nSome entries within this compilation do not directly endorse or ridicule Kirk’s assassination but are considered to hold a negative stance — like one that stated, “I don’t give a s— about Charlie Kirk.”\n\nOthers have been much harsher. “The hatred you spew is enough to get you what you deserve pal,” one post read.\n\nOne U.S. military officer said troops know they are not allowed to condone political violence, but being fired for criticizing a person, particularly a civilian who has no ties to the military, is extremely rare.\n\n“We can’t criticize the commander in chief, but I can’t remember anyone ever telling me we can’t say anything critical about a civilian like this. He was not in our chain of command or anything,” the officer said.\n\nFar-right activist Laura Loomer, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has called for the investigation of an Army major general, saying on X that his son had posted online that Kirk was a “racist homophobe misogynist.”\n\nShe said the son works for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “fire” him. Loomer also said Hegseth should “review the employment” of his father.\n\nA spokesperson for FEMA said the “employee’s words are revolting and unconscionable” and he “was immediately placed on administrative leave.”\n\n“Celebrating the death of a fellow American is appalling, unacceptable and sickening. Such behavior does not reflect the values of public service, and it will not be tolerated among individuals entrusted to work at FEMA,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe disciplinary action against the employee was first reported by Fox News.\n\nAsked for comment on the effort to find these social media posts, the Pentagon referred back to Parnell’s statement. “Beyond that, we don’t have anything additional to provide from the Department’s level and we would refer you to the services,” another defense official said.\n\nKirk, an influential conservative and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot dead Wednesday at an event on a college campus in Utah.\n\nAuthorities said Friday that Tyler Robinson, 22, of Utah, has been arrested in connection with the killing. He is expected to be charged with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily injury and obstruction of justice, according to a probable cause affidavit.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has instructed his team to track&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Pete Hegseth urges Pentagon staff to identify service members&#8217;

This coincided with the resurfacing of the debate clip featuring Charlie Kirk and Stone Lambert.

He was shot in the neck while speaking at the quad of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.According to a BBC News report dated September 11, the shooting took place around 12:20 p.m., shortly after Kirk had been asked about mass shootings in the United States. Law enforcement officials soon released security camera images of a person of interest and urged the public to help identify him.On September 12, authorities identified the suspect as Tyler Robinson, 22, a Utah native accused of fatally shooting Charlie Kirk.According to Reuters, Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel told reporters. The agency also stated that they had received more than 11,000 tips by Friday morning, the most since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.Robinson was ultimately identified when a family member recognized him in FBI surveillance images, bringing an end to the nationwide manhunt. Two law enforcement sources told CBS that Robinson’s father was the one who alerted authorities.The first public announcement of Robinson’s capture came from President Donald Trump during a live Fox & Friends interview on September 12.“I think with a high degree of certainty, we have him,” Trump said.Utah Governor Spencer Cox also expressed relief after the intense manhunt came to an end and confirmed the arrest of Robinson.“We got him,” he told the reporters on September 12.According to BBC, Robinson lived in St. George, Utah, near Zion National Park, about 250 miles (400 km) from Utah Valley University, where Kirk was gunned down. Public records showed Robinson had previously registered as an unaffiliated voter in Utah.At a Friday press briefing, FBI officials declined to comment on Robinson’s background, political leanings, or possible motive, stressing that the investigation would remain active.“We are confident we have the right individual in custody…but we are still working to establish the full picture of who he is and why he acted,” an FBI spokesperson said (as per BBC).As per the BBC report, investigators also noted his immersion in online culture. Shell casings recovered at the scene bore trolling-style inscriptions. This includes ones like “notices bulges OwO what’s this?” and “if you read this, you are gay lmao,” and both of these are tied to internet “copypasta” memes.Charlie Kirk’s murder is still under investigation.The prime suspect, Tyler Robinson is being held without bail in a Utah jail on multiple charges, including aggravated murder. Utah County prosecutors were expected to formally file charges on Tuesday, September 16. According to CNN, Robinson had so far refused to speak with investigators.","summary":"Myron Gaines weighed in on a recently resurfaced video of Charlie Kirk debating Stone Lambert.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/pop-culture/news-myron-gaines-reacts-video-charlie-kirk-debating-stone-lambert-internet-debates-fbi-s-person-interest-photos","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/09/4f600-17577174018210-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:13:16","author":"Shayari Roy","authors":["Shayari Roy"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.328},{"id":360047434,"title":"Telegram founder calls Charlie Kirk’s murder ‘assault on free speech’","text":"The murder of conservative American influencer Charlie Kirk is an attack on freedom of speech, Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov has said, warning that other liberties could soon be at risk as well.\n\nKirk “fought for open debate, and enemies of truth hated him for it,” Durov wrote in a Telegram post, paying tribute to the activist, who was shot on Wednesday while addressing thousands of students at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University.\n\nUS officials have described the killing as a targeted political assassination, while Durov called it a direct “assault on free speech.”\n\n“Once free speech is lost, every other freedom soon follows.

This is me thinking about my constituents, this country, and the fact that the person who is eight points ahead of us is Nigel Farage. That terrifies me. It terrifies my constituents, and it terrifies a lot of people in this country.\n\n“We don’t have the luxury of carrying on this way with someone who I think increasingly, I’m sorry to say, just doesn’t seem up to the job.”\n\nMr Lewis said the Cabinet reshuffle that came after Ms Rayner’s departure was “deeply unpopular” among many backbench MPs and that “the party feels very narrow in terms of the political outlook from the right of the party”.\n\n“I think we’re feeling left out, I think we’re feeling alienated, marginalised and that needs to change because it’s a very, very dangerous atmosphere in the PLP (Parliamentary Labour Party) at the moment,” he said.\n\nBarry Gardiner, MP for Brent North, said his party colleagues were frustrated over “a series of what people regard as political slip-ups”.\n\n“People are saying, look, the leadership needs to listen to backbench MPs and to party members. And a command and control structure simply will not work,” he told BBC Newsnight.\n\nHe warned the party is “splitting into factions” and that both MPs and party members are unhappy with the “top-down approach”.\n\nHe said an atmosphere of “resentment that’s being built up and that is toxic” has to be dealt with in an “open listening approach”.\n\nMs Powell, who lost her post as Commons leader in last week’s reshuffle, told The Guardian: “We need some change, and we do need a change of culture, especially how we’re going about making decisions, and how we’re going about including people.”\n\nShe added: “We’ve got a bit of a groupthink happening at the top, that culture of not being receptive to interrogation, not being receptive to differing views.”\n\nSome MPs, including several suspended from Labour after voting against the Government’s welfare plans earlier this year, have called for the Labour whip to be removed from Lord Mandelson so he can no longer sit as a peer for the party.\n\nHowever, his role as ambassador to the US meant he was on a leave of absence from the Lords and does not technically have the Labour whip.\n\nThree months’ notice must be given to end the leave of absence.\n\nSir Keir’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney was reported to have lobbied for Lord Mandelson’s initial appointment.\n\nOne Labour backbencher suggested the Mandelson scandal could be “terminal” for Mr McSweeney, but could also prove a serious problem for the Prime Minister.\n\nThey told the PA news agency: “I think Morgan McSweeney runs the show, and Keir just enables it and makes very bad decisions. I’m not sure how long this can continue though.”\n\nAnother also suggested that problems in Number 10 went beyond the chief of staff. They said: “Even a Morgan problem is ultimately a Keir problem.”\n\nDowning Street said on Friday that the Prime Minister still had confidence in Mr McSweeney’s judgement.\n\n“Of course the Prime Minister has confidence in his top team,” a No 10 spokesman said.\n\nSir Keir, who had said he had “full confidence” in Lord Mandelson before the emails were published, is facing questions over what he knew and when about the ex-ambassador’s ties to Epstein.\n\nThe chairwoman of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee is also demanding answers from the Foreign Secretary on the vetting process for Lord Mandelson’s appointment.\n\nDame Emily Thornberry said allegations that security concerns may have been overlooked during the appointments process were “potentially very serious”, in a letter to Yvette Cooper.\n\nShe asked whether the Foreign Office or Downing Street decided to dismiss any security concerns that were raised or change the vetting requirements for Lord Mandelson.\n\nNewly appointed Foreign Secretary Ms Cooper said the decision to sack Lord Mandelson was “rightly taken” and backed Sir Keir’s “strong leadership” during a trip to Kyiv.\n\nScotland Secretary Douglas Alexander earlier told BBC Breakfast he understood why Labour MPs were “despondent” after the last week’s events, but said action had been taken and the Government was looking forward to moving on.\n\nAllies of Lord Mandelson told The Times that he had admitted in his vetting interview that he continued his relationship with Epstein for many years.\n\nHis friendship with Epstein was known prior to his appointment, but reports in The Sun and Bloomberg showed their relationship had continued after the financier’s crimes had emerged.\n\nEmails published on Wednesday afternoon included passages in which Lord Mandelson had told Epstein to “fight for early release” shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.\n\nHe is also reported to have told Epstein “I think the world of you” the day before the disgraced financier began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.\n\nMr Alexander said the emails had provided “materially new information” that exposed “manifest weaknesses” in Lord Mandelson’s judgement.\n\nHe added that an “unconventional ambassador” was needed to deal with an “unconventional presidential administration” under Donald Trump.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said Sir Keir had continued to back Lord Mandelson without the support of his party, which put him and his “right-hand man” Mr McSweeney in a “very difficult position” with their parliamentary party.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats called for the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee to scrutinise the next US ambassador before they are officially appointed.","summary":"Clive Lewis, MP for Norwich South, said his fellow Labour MPs were feeling ‘concerned, slightly downtrodden, a little bit browbeaten’.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/peter-mandelson-keir-starmer-clive-lewis-lucy-powell-labour-b1247530.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/09/13/00/df4cee893116e0452af3e5f6fcb87217Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU3ODAzMDUz-2.81558007.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:10:12","author":"Helen Corbett","authors":["Helen Corbett"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":360055928,"title":"What we know about Charlie Kirk's accused killer, Tyler Robinson","text":"Tyler Robinson grew up among some of the most spectacular natural scenery in the United States.\n\nWashington, Utah, is a short drive from the stunning peaks and rock formations of Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon, and about three and a half hours from Orem, where Charlie Kirk was shot on Wednesday.\n\nAs a high school student, Robinson appears to have excelled. In 2021, he won a residential scholarship to study engineering at Utah State University, near Salt Lake City.\n\nBut it didn't last. The university confirmed Robinson dropped out of his pre-engineering course after just one semester.\n\nHe returned home to Washington, where he took up an electrical apprenticeship at Dixie Technical College, living with his family.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, the 22-year-old was in the third year of his apprenticeship, with no criminal record, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nLike much of rural Utah, Washington is overwhelmingly white. And politically, it's overwhelmingly red: in last year's election, Donald Trump won more than 75 per cent of the vote there.\n\nYet Robinson did not appear to be particularly political. He is registered to vote, but did not choose a party affiliation, as most registered voters in the US do.\n\nWhat's more, he is listed as an \"inactive\" voter — meaning he did not vote in the last two general elections.\n\nBut according to Utah Governor Spencer Cox, things had changed.\n\n\"Investigators interviewed a family member of Robinson who stated that [he] had become more political in recent years,\" Cox told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"The family member referenced a recent incident in which Robinson came to dinner prior to [the day of the shooting], and in the conversation with another family member, Robinson mentioned Charlie Kirk was coming to UVU [Utah Valley University].\n\n\"They talked about why they didn't like him and the viewpoints that he had. The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\"\n\nWhen the first grainy images of the suspect were released on Thursday, it was Robinson's father who recognised his son and confronted him.\n\nHe urged his son to turn himself in, a law enforcement source told the Associated Press. Robinson refused at first, but then changed his mind.\n\n\"A family member of Tyler Robinson reached out to a family friend, who contacted the Washington County Sheriff's Office with information that Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident,\" Cox said.\n\nThe family friend is reportedly a youth pastor and a US Marshals task force officer. And he advised Robinson's father to keep him in place until the FBI arrived.\n\nRobinson was arrested late on Thursday night, local time, and taken to the Utah County Jail at Spanish Fork, near the site of the shooting. He was admitted in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\n\"I want to thank the family members of Tyler Robinson, who did the right thing in this case and were able to bring him into law enforcement,\" the governor said.\n\nHe said investigators had spoken to a person they identified as a \"roommate\" of Robinson, but did not explain why he had a roommate if he was living at the family home.\n\nThe roommate showed investigators messages sent by Robinson on the chat app Discord.\n\n\"The content of these messages included … [stating] a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush,\" Cox said.\n\n\"[There were] messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel. The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique.\"\n\nCox also said police saw messages from Robinson mentioning a change in outfits — and that at the time of his arrest, he was wearing clothing consistent with those seen in surveillance images at the university campus.\n\n\"When he's first spotted on campus, he has different clothing on,\" he said.\n\n\"Then he changes clothing on the roof, and then changed back into that clothing at some point. So when he was arrested, the clothing matched the clothing he had on before the shooting here at UVU.\"\n\nThe governor said investigators had recovered significant physical evidence.\n\n\"Investigators discovered a bolt-action rifle wrapped in a dark-coloured towel,\" he said.\n\n\"The rifle was determined to be a Mauser Model 98 30-06 calibre bolt-action rifle. The rifle had a scope mounted on top of it. Investigators noted inscriptions that had been engraved on casings found with the rifle.\"\n\nOne unfired casing bore the words, \"Hey fascist! Catch!\" and an up, right, and three down arrows. The arrows resemble a possible cheat code for a video game, but it's not clear, and no images have been released by the FBI.\n\nAnother casing carried lyrics to the song Bella Ciao, an anti-fascist anthem with its roots in the Italian partisans of World War II, fighting against the Mussolini dictatorship and Nazi occupation.\n\nOther inscriptions displayed apparent references to online trolling humour. One read: \"If you read this, you are GAY lmao.\"\n\nThe casing of the bullet that killed Kirk read: \"notices bulges OwO what's this?\"\n\nRobinson remains in custody without bail on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm causing serious bodily harm, and obstruction of justice charges, according to a court affidavit.\n\nBefore Robinson was identified and arrested, the Utah governor issued this warning:\n\n\"We have been working with our attorneys, getting everything that we need ready so that we can pursue the death penalty in this case. And that will happen.\"","summary":"After his father encouraged Tyler Robinson to turn himself in, people close to the 22-year-old provided investigators with crucial insights.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-13/tyler-robinson-charlie-kirks-alleged-killer/105769710","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a69bf228e9aaf2daa259fd798c22d05c?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=62&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:10:02","author":"Ben Knight","authors":["Ben Knight"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.243},{"id":360049738,"title":"Outcry over FEMA employee's 'revolting' comments about Charlie Kirk","text":"Outcry over FEMA employee's 'revolting' comments about Charlie Kirk\n\nREAD MORE: Outrage erupts after Amazon sells book about Charlie Kirk's assassination HOURS after the shooting\n\nEverything we know about Tyler Robinson - get the latest on The Assassination of Charlie Kirk podcast\n\nBy STACY LIBERATORE, US SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY EDITOR\n\nPublished: 21:19 BST, 12 September 2025 | Updated: 00:08 BST, 13 September 2025\n\nA Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employee has been placed on administrative leave after making controversial comments about Charlie Kirk.\n\nGavin Sylvia, a data analyst with FEMA since November 2024, posted on Instagram: 'Half mast for the literal racist homophobe misogynist??

Millions of people watched — sometimes whether they wanted to or not — as the videos autoplayed on social media platforms.Video was easy to find on X, on Facebook, on TikTok, on Instagram, on YouTube — even on President Donald Trump's Truth Social. The platforms, generally, said they were removing at least some of the videos if they violated their policies, for instance if the person was glorifying the killing in any way. In other cases, warning screens were applied to caution people they were about to see graphic content.Two days after Kirk's death, videos were still easily found on social media, despite calls to remove them.“It was not immediately obvious whether Instagram for example was just failing to remove some of the graphic videos of Charlie Kirk being shot or whether they had made a conscious choice to leave them up. And the reason that it that was so hard to tell is that, obviously, those videos were circulating really widely,” said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University.The events illustrate the content moderation challenges platforms face in handling fast-moving real-time events, complicated by the death of a polarizing conservative activist who was shot in front of a crowd armed with smartphones recording the moment.It’s an issue social media companies have dealt with before. Facebook was forced to contend with people wanting to livestream violence with a mass shooting in New Zealand in 2019. People have also livestreamed fights, suicides and murder.Similar to other platforms, Meta’s rules don’t automatically prohibit posting videos like Kirk’s shooting, but warning labels are applied and they are not shown to users who say they are under 18. The parent company of Instagram, Facebook and Threads referred a reporter to the company’s policies on violent and graphic content, which they indicated would apply in this case, but had no further comment.YouTube said it was removing “some graphic content” related to the event if it doesn’t provide sufficient context, and restricting videos so they could not be seen by users under age 18 or those who are not signed in, the company said.“We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,\" YouTube said.In a statement, TikTok said it is \"committed to proactively enforcing our Community Guidelines and have implemented additional safeguards to prevent people from unexpectedly viewing footage that violates our rules.”TikTok also moved to restrict the footage from its “for you” feed so people have to seek it out if they want to see it and added content warning screens as well as worked to remove videos that showed graphic, close-up footage.Social media platforms algorithms reward engagement. If a video gets a lot of reaction, it moves to the top of people's feeds, where more people see it and engage with it, continuing the cycle.“I mean, this is the world that we have all made. This is the deal we all made. The person who gets to decide what’s newsworthy on Instagram is Mark Zuckerberg. The person who gets to decide what stays up on X is Elon Musk. They own those platforms, and they get to decide what is on them. If we want another world, well, then someone else needs to make it,” Edelson said. “The fact is that we live in a world where the most important channels for what information circulates are controlled by single individuals.”And it is these individuals who decide what to make a priority. Meta, X and other social platforms have cut back on human content moderation in recent years, relying on artificial intelligence that can both over-and under-moderate.The U.S. has no blanket regulation prohibiting violent content from being shown on the internet, although generally platforms attempt to restrict minors from being able to see it. Of course, this doesn't always work, since users' ages are not always verified and kids often lie about their ages when signing up to social platforms.Authorities in other places have drawn up laws that require social media companies to do more to protect their users from online harm. Britain and the European Union both have wide-ranging laws that make tech platforms responsible for “online safety.”The British Online Safety Act requires platforms, even those not based in the United Kingdom, to protect users from more than a dozen types of content, from child sexual abuse to extreme pornography.Content that depicts a criminal offense such as a violent attack on someone isn’t necessarily illegal content, but platforms would still have to assess whether it falls foul of other banned material such as encouraging terrorism.The British government says the rules are especially designed to protect children from “harmful and age inappropriate content” and give parents and children “clear and accessible ways” to report problems online.That includes material that “depicts or encourages serious violence or injury,” which online services are required to prevent children from seeing.Violations of the U.K. rules can be punished with fines of up to 18 million pounds ($24.4 million) or 10% of a company’s annual revenue, and senior managers can also be held criminally liable for not complying.The U.K. law is still fairly new, and only started taking effect in March as it gets rolled out in stages.The rest of Europe has a similar rule book that took effect in 2023.Under the European Union’s Digital Safety Act, tech companies are required to take more responsibility for material on their sites, under threat of hefty fines. The biggest online platforms and search engines, including Google, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, face extra scrutiny.Platforms should give users “easy-to-use” mechanisms to flag content deemed illegal, such as terrorism and child sexual abuse material, Brussels says, adding that platforms have to then act on reports in a “timely manner.”But it doesn’t require platforms to proactively police for, and take down, illegal material.","summary":"Graphic videos of Charlie Kirk&#39;s shooting at a Utah college event spread rapidly on social media (X, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Truth Social), despite platforms&#39; removal policies.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/graphic-videos-of-charlie-kirk-shooting-spread-rapidly-on-social-media-content-moderation-challenge-surfaces","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/charlie-kirk-s-assassination-exposes-security-gaps-at-us-political-events-1757618327729-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:08:47","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":360047370,"title":"Friends share how Charlie Kirk's 'lioness' wife Erika is coping after seeing her husband's brutal murder","text":"As the motorcade following Charlie Kirk's hearse made its somber way through Phoenix, the window of one vehicle slowly wound down.\n\nErika Kirk, now a widow, wanted to acknowledge the crowds. Visibly distraught, she reached out to the masses - all the while clinging to a small symbol of solace: a white rosary.\n\nThose who know her best have told the Daily Mail that Erika, 36, will be holding fast to her faith this week as she desperately seeks solace from it in her time of need.\n\nThe full horror of her political-activist husband, Charlie’s, assassination on Wednesday – killed with a single bullet to his neck while speaking to Utah students – is surely just now taking hold after the shock of his sudden, violent death.\n\nErika and their two young children - three-year-old daughter 'GG' and a one-year-old son - were with him at the time.\n\nNow those closest to Erika have spoken of her grace under the most appalling circumstances. They have recalled how Kirk was, quite simply, ‘the love of her life’ and they have described her as a ‘lioness’ who will not be cowed by the senseless act that took her husband.\n\nIn the face of grief beyond expression she is, they said, determined to continue the legacy of her husband’s work.\n\nOn Thursday she returned with her children to her home state of Arizona, where she and Kirk set up home together just four years ago following their marriage in 2021.\n\nIt was here that they were raising their young family in a $4.75 million Spanish-style home in a gated compound, with spectacular views of the Sonoran desert.\n\n'She's devastated,' said Donald Trump on Friday morning, explaining that he had spoken to her the day before.\n\nBut the beauty queen and businesswoman, who hosts a Bible studies podcast and runs a series of charities is, the president said, determined to continue the work of Turning Point, the organisation Kirk founded.\n\nThe donations have flooded in in the aftermath of Kirk’s death and Erika, the president said, has every intention of honoring them.\n\nBecause while it is far too soon for her to look to the future, those who know her best have told the Daily Mail she is more than qualified to continue her husband's work.\n\n'She's very confident, very self-assured, and just a very joyful person,' said Dana Loesch, a radio host who spoke at the women's conference Erika organized in Dallas in June.\n\n'I really admire that quality because not everyone is joyful, and I'm very envious of that quality. And she's radiant.\n\n‘She was very bright, very friendly, incredibly kind to everyone, and took a moment to speak to everyone that she that she came across. She's formidable.'\n\nAndrew Kolvet, Kirk's spokesman and executive producer of his podcast, described Erika as 'fierce and strong.’\n\nHe said she was a ‘lioness’ who made Kirk a better, stronger man.\n\nAccording to Kolvet: 'Charlie wanted to marry her because of how strong she was.’\n\nCertainly, she will need every reserve of courage she possesses to navigate through the coming days.\n\nSpeaking from his podcast studio – Kirk’s empty chair beside him - he said: 'Ultimately he knew that she could do this life that he was leading'.\n\nThe couple met in August 2018, when Erika arrived at the Phoenix offices of Turning Point USA - the conservative youth organization Kirk founded in 2012 - with the hope that she might be hired.\n\nSeveral days later Kirk sent her a message on Instagram asking her to text him.\n\nThe couple would later record the story of their meeting for a Turning Point Video. 'I was in the Hamptons at the time,' recalled Erika, adding that she had moved from Arizona to New York City five years previously, to work as a model and casting director. 'I waited a few days before I replied.'\n\nKirk told her he would soon be in Manhattan for a Fox News appearance, so the pair arranged to meet at Bill's Burgers near the Rockefeller Center.\n\n'I quickly pivoted away from wanting to hire her to wanting to date her,' Kirk explained. 'And we all know how that worked out.'\n\nIt is not hard to see what the driven, ambitious Kirk saw in Erika Frantzve.\n\nBorn in Scottsdale to Lori and Kent Frantzve, both IT specialists, Erika and her older brother Travis were raised as Catholics.\n\nHer Swedish grandfather, Carl Frantzve, was awarded the Bronze and Silver stars in the Second World War and knighted by the Swedish King, Carl XVI Gustaf, for furthering Swedish and American relations - giving Erika a lifelong respect for the military.\n\nErika attended Notre Dame high school, a private Catholic institution in Scottsdale, where fees are currently $17,000 a year.\n\nAnd while Travis taught drumming before becoming a firefighter, remaining in Scottsdale, Erika was academically gifted and doggedly determined.\n\nShe represented her school on the track and volleyball court.

She graduated in 2007 as runner up Student of the Year, then became a National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Basketball athlete at Regis University in Colorado.\n\nShe switched to Arizona State University and graduated with a double major in political science and international relations, then earnt a master’s degree in American legal studies from Liberty University, a private college in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nWhile at high school she founded an NGO, Everyday Heroes Like You, to raise funds for underrepresented charities. Charity work would see her travel to Romania, where she assisted several missions helping at an orphanage.\n\nErika had also entered beauty pageants from an early age and in November 2011 - on the day of her 23rd birthday - she was crowned Miss Arizona.\n\nThe accolade secured her entrance to Donald Trump's Miss USA pageant in 2012, and although she failed to claim the national title, Erika said the competition provided a platform to advance her causes.\n\nSpeaking to Arizona Foothills magazine shortly after her win Erika said: 'My mom used to take us to soup kitchens and constantly said we needed to share our blessings with others.\n\n‘When I learned that by competing I could touch more people, further my causes, I knew it was a chance to make a greater impact.'\n\nBritt Boyse, the executive producer of Miss Arizona USA, recalled Erika as a star.\n\n'She catches your eye with her stunning looks, then captures your heart with her warmth and character,' she said at the time, adding that Erika was perfect in the role as 'an ambassador, someone who can be comfortable in any situation, with many different personalities - and Erika is all that and more.'\n\nErika moved to New York City soon after the competition, pursuing work in modeling and as a casting director.\n\nBut then came that 2018 meeting with Kirk which would change her life.\n\nLila Rose witnessed those early days of the couple’s relationship.

Since founding the organization in 2005, Collinge has been featured on “60 Minutes” and in numerous print publications, including Fortune magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, Boston Phoenix, Village Voice, and Inside Higher Ed. He has published editorials in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Hill. Before founding StudentLoanJustice.Org, Collinge was an associate scientist of aeronautics at the California Institute of Technology and the regional project director for a government loan program administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nCredit Line: This article was produced for the Observatory by the Independent Media Institute.\n\nWith the student debt crisis spiraling out of control, some media outlets have called it a “national emergency.” Outpacing most other borrowingsby consumers, Americans who owed federal student loans more than doubled between 2000 and 2020, “from 21 million to 45 million, and the total amount they owed more than quadrupled from $387 billion to $1.8 trillion,” according to a 2024 article in Brookings.\n\nA notable demographic shift has also emerged, with older borrowers now outnumbering younger ones, holding more debt despite having taken out smaller loans many years earlier. According to my analysis of the 2024 second quarter figures from the Department of Education, there are now 2.1 million more people over the age of 35 (23.7 million) with student loans than under the age of 35 (21.6 million), and they owe 160 percent more on average ($43,680 versus $27,250).\n\nApproximately 5.3 million borrowers who had taken federal student loans are “in default,” states an April 2025 PBS article.\n\nImproving access to education is integral to ensuring the economic success of any nation, leading to substantial returns in terms of salaries and gross domestic product. “When more individuals hold high-value credentials, workforce participation increases, financial security becomes attainable for more families, and economic growth accelerates. But these benefits won’t materialize without action. Federal and state governments must prioritize education funding, align learning with workforce needs, and reaffirm education as a public good,” according to an opinion piece in the nonprofit news publication, The 74.\n\nUnlike the U.S., many other countries are prioritizing investing in education to support economic growth. If America doesn’t rectify its policies, which have led to “declining confidence in the value of a degree,” the situation could become irreparable in the future.\n\nThe Vicious Cycle That Has Made Education Inaccessible\n\nStudent loans were introduced to make education more accessible for students from low-income backgrounds, which would eventually lead to better job opportunities. Far from achieving this goal, the flawed loan system has been monetized by politicians and companies over the years, keeping students in an endless cycle of debt.\n\n“A generation ago, Congress privatized a student loan program intended to give more Americans access to higher education. In its place, lawmakers created another profit center for Wall Street and a system of college finance that has fed the nation’s cycle of inequality. Step by step, Congress has enacted one law after another to make student debt the worst kind of debt for Americans—and the best kind for banks and debt collectors,” states ABC15 Arizona.\n\nThe consequences of this financial burden are severe and worsening, leading to tragedy in some instances, like in the case of the Nelson family from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. They filed for bankruptcy in 2020 as their debt grew, “most of which was unpaid student loans,” according to the New York Post. The family, including six children, was found dead in 2022 in what was termed a “murder-suicide,” owing mainly to their financial circumstances.\n\nThe Ballooning Student Loan Debt\n\nThe student debt exceeds the state budget in most states (particularly Southern states), based on the first quarter 2025 data I analyzed. The increasing debt has resulted from a significant increase in borrowing and the cost of education over the years. The lending system, by all rational metrics, is a catastrophic failure.\n\nUnfortunately, the political dynamics that have taken hold of both Congress and the White House over the past couple of decades—from both parties—have only solidified against student loan borrowers, perpetuating this broken and dangerous loan program. It is crucial that the public understand the history of how we arrived at this point, the current political and other dynamics at play, and, most importantly, how we can move away from the ledge we, as a nation, now find ourselves on.\n\nHow Sallie Mae Monopolized the Lending Industry\n\nThe debtor’s revolt in Western Massachusetts, which took place in the 1780s and came to be called “Shays’ Rebellion,” was believed to have compelled the drafting and ratification of the U.S. Constitution, which called for uniform bankruptcy laws ahead of the power to raise an army, coin currency, and declare war in Article I, Section 8.\n\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson came to power, he signed the Higher Education Act (HEA) into law in 1965. The HEA “created… guaranteed loan programs establishing that loans borrowed by students from private loan companies were now guaranteed by the federal government if students defaulted,” according to the Boston University website. During the signing ceremony, Johnson declared that the loans would be “free of interest,” pointing out that the act would ensure that “the path of knowledge is open to all… [who] have the determination to walk it.”\n\nIn 1972, a hybrid, public-private company, Student Loan Marketing Association, which was later called Sallie Mae, was established to serve as a repurchaser and guarantor for federal student loans made by private banks. The company had all the profit-making incentives of a private company, but also had the full backing of the U.S. Treasury, whose money it used for its operations. This created a monopoly over the nascent student loan industry, and the company became the de facto expert and driving force, along with Congress, on legislative matters.\n\n“In the mid-1990s, skyrocketing demand for student loans prompted by escalating college tuitions, expanding eligibility for student loans, and a host of new types of lending combined to make the student loan industry infinitely more complex, larger, and more lucrative. And Sallie Mae emerged as the industry’s biggest player,” stated a 2007 report, “Leading Lady: Sallie Mae and the Origins of Today’s Student Loan Controversy.”\n\nIn 1976, bipartisan legislation—pushed by Sallie Mae and other related financial interests in Washington—was enacted by Congress, which made federal student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy for five years after the repayment period started, unless borrowers could show “undue hardship.” The reason given for this unprecedented removal of standard bankruptcy rights from student loans was that there was a crisis of graduates flocking to bankruptcy court in droves to expunge their debts.\n\nAccording to a 2013 policy brief by the nonprofit Reason Foundation, however, “the narrative that students are routinely graduating from college with debt and immediately declaring bankruptcy after graduation was pushed by Sallie Mae and other student lending companies in the hopes that these measures would even further reduce the risk shouldered by lenders when issuing student loans.” The discharge rate of student loans in bankruptcy at that time turned out to be far less than 1 percent—lower than almost all other debts in bankruptcy court.\n\nWhile a waiting period for bankruptcy discharge surely seemed inconsequential to most in Congress at the time, Sallie Mae was just getting started. In the ensuing years, this unique exception to discharge was extended to include loans made or insured by nonprofit companies. Then, the waiting period was extended to seven years in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Sallie Mae (and the lending industry it essentially controlled) successfully convinced Congress to remove statutes of limitations from federal student loans. And in 1998, Sallie Mae and the student loan industry managed to end any “waiting period” for bankruptcy discharge with the passage of the Higher Education Amendments.\n\nPolicy Changes That Helped the Lending Industry Thrive\n\nThe number of loans made annually between 1990 and 2000 doubled from 4.5 million to 9.4 million, according to the American Council on Education 2001 brief. “This increase in student borrowing was fueled, in large part, by legislative changes enacted early in the decade.”\n\nTo keep up with the increasing demand, Sallie Mae went on an acquisitional drive, purchasing two of the largest student loan guarantors, USA Group and Southwest Student Services, in 2022, and also “went on to purchase the student loan collection companies, so that by 2006 it dominated all aspects of the student loan industry,” according to a 2010 article by World Socialist Web Site (WSWS). These companies generated most, if not all, of their revenue from collecting on defaulted student loans.\n\nSallie Mae eventually became a completely private company in 2004. “Sallie Mae’s moves to acquire numerous guarantee, origination, and collections companies under a single corporate banner had fundamentally altered the student loan marketplace and made Sallie Mae the undisputed leviathan of the student loan industry,” stated the Reason Foundation brief.\n\nBut Sallie Mae and the student loan industry weren’t finished. In 2005, they managed to convince Congress, after spending millions of dollars in lobbying, to end bankruptcy rights from all student loans—including those made by private lenders—as a part of the landmark bankruptcy bill, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. At the time, they argued that this would allow the industry to lend to more needy students. But this never happened. Instead, they began demanding cosigners (typically parents or grandparents) for nearly all of their private loans.\n\nThese were truly the “happy times” for the student loan industry. Sallie Mae’s stock price shot up. “In 2005, Sallie Mae was named by Fortune as the second most profitable company in the U.S. (Microsoft was 18th that year),” according to WSWS. The company’s CEO at the time, Albert Lord, was the “highest-paid CEO in Washington, D.C., that year.” He built his own private luxury 18-hole golf course.\n\nBy 2004, Lord even bragged to shareholders that the company was actually “writing checks” to the Treasury at the end of every year—a reference to the fact that the government was making a profit on defaulted student loans through Sallie Mae’s collection activities.\n\nNo lender makes a profit on defaulted student loans in any other lending industry. The fact that the federal government profits from defaulted loans is a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system, resulting from the removal of bankruptcy rights and statutes of limitations. It is even more true today for the Department of Education, as it now owns the loans outright, rather than the old-style lending model where it only guaranteed the loans.\n\nHow Politicians Supported the Growth of the Student Loan Industry\n\nThe federal student loan servicers (who were largely the lenders and guarantors under the older FFELP program) can generate more revenue from defaulted loans than from those that remain in good standing through a program called “student loan rehabilitation,” where a defaulted borrower is coerced into making nine payments for 10 months and ultimately signs for a new, much larger loan. The private companies that facilitate these loan rehabilitations receive 16 percent of the value of the new loans, for instance, on a $50,000 defaulted loan that is rehabilitated into a new $100,000 loan, a $16,000 payment is made by the taxpayer to these companies. This, of course, gives the industry a perverted incentive to want loans to default.\n\nWall Street and Washington had found a way to make profits on a lending instrument: Remove all standard consumer protections, hyperinflate loan balances—including and especially through defaulting loans—and use collection powers that would “make a mobster envious,” as stated by Senator Elizabeth Warren, to extract the money from the borrowers and their families.\n\nThis is precisely the sort of lending tyranny that the founding fathers wanted to avoid when they called for uniform bankruptcy rights and equal protection under the law.\n\nUnder President Barack Obama, the lending program was nationalized, resulting in the Department of Education making and owning all new loans from July 2010 onward. While private companies like Sallie Mae did not like this change, they remained in the mix by both servicing healthy loans and collecting on defaulted student loans.\n\nDisturbingly, because lending companies could now only make revenue through these two means—where rehabilitating defaults would be far more profitable for them than servicing loans—this only strengthened the perverted incentives these companies already had to frustrate, baffle, and bamboozle borrowers into default.\n\nThis change was clearly a boon for the Department of Education, which now stood to earn interest on the loans. Some of the profit was even used as an offset to pay for the Affordable Care Act. The federal government loved this new arrangement, as lending skyrocketed, leading to the accrual of interest.\n\nIt also became apparent that the Department of Education had no intention of fairly administering the lending program under Obama’s presidency. The various income-driven repayment (IDR) plans that were in place were run in ways that would lead to the disqualification of the overwhelming majority of borrowers. Between 2013 and 2014, the department found that an astonishing 57 percent of borrowers had “fallen out” of these programs for failing to verify their incomes—just one of many hurdles borrowers must overcome to receive the promised loan cancellation after 20–25 years of making payments.\n\nThe Department of Education also fought tooth and nail behind the scenes to keep bankruptcy rights away from student loans on Obama’s watch. They regularly submitted testimony to judges in bankruptcy cases and even micromanaged such cases directly or through contracted attorneys.\n\nDespite the long-standing promise by Democrats to return bankruptcy rights to federal student loans (which they failed to do in 2008), the best we saw from President Obama was an order to “study” the feasibility of returning bankruptcy rights to the loans. There was no meaningful action on this front. During Obama’s two terms in office, nearly $1 trillion was added to the nation’s student debt tab, according to my analysis.\n\nThe Worsening of the Crisis\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first term in office was—with a couple of notable exceptions—a nightmare. He hired Betsy DeVos—who held stockin student loan collection companies—to be his secretary of education. DeVos ran the department in even worse faith than seen during Obama’s term. She was even threatened with possible prison time by a federal judge for violating “a court order to stop collecting loans from former students of a now-bankrupt for-profit college,” according to the online news publication Government Executive.\n\nThere were, however, a couple of surprising bright spots from Trump’s first term. First, he became the first president to cancel student loans broadly, and by executive order. He first did this in August 2019 when he canceled student loans for 25,000 disabled veterans. He did it for a second time for everyone when he first enacted the repayment pause at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proved that the president can, indeed, cancel federal student loans by executive order. There were no lawsuits or controversies surrounding either of these actions.\n\nInterestingly, it was these actions that compelled my group to start the petition in March 2020 to return bankruptcy rights to all student loans, igniting public conversation about canceling student loans by executive order. The petition quickly grew to hundreds of thousands of signatures and went viral in the mainstream media. Within six months, leading senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, began making a similar call.\n\nJoe Biden, who won the election in 2020, meanwhile, promised to both “eliminate” the student debt of people who went to public colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and also committed to restoring standard bankruptcy rights to student loans.\n\nThe feeble attempt that Biden made in 2023, however, toward fulfilling these promises was struck down by the Supreme Court. While most point to the obvious reasons—Republican attorneys general and their lawsuits—the key reason was opposition to it from leading Democrats.\n\nShortly after the 2020 election, Steven and Mary Swig, a billionaire San Francisco “power couple,” circulated a memo within Democratic circles declaring that the president could not cancel student loans by executive order.\n\nSoon after, Democratic leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Susan Rice were parroting this memo, declaring that the president could not cancel the loans administratively. When the Supreme Court handed down its verdict, Chief Justice John Roberts actually quoted Pelosi in the majority opinion.\n\nIt seems like Biden himself wasn’t entirely behind this plan. He rejected a “$50,000 student loan forgiveness plan” shortly after the elections, according to ABC News, and the law that he attempted to use to justify the cancellation was “ill-fitting.”\n\nThe loans that were canceled during Biden’s term weren’t because of anything that Biden did or didn’t do. Instead, these were loans that were, by and large, supposed to have been canceled through existing rule or law, years or even decades ago. While Democrats often cited them as evidence of their concern for student loan borrowers, the fact remains that these cancellations were relatively small compared to the loan portfolio’s growth over four years.\n\nOn returning bankruptcy rights to student loans, the Biden administration did, indeed, stop “opposing” student loan borrowers in bankruptcy court, but the “new bankruptcy process” they put in its place effectively transferred the power to determine the case from the judges to the departments of Education and Justice. The process has proven to be an expensive joke on the borrowers, with only a few borrowers getting discharges. In fact, out of 450,000 student loan borrowers who have filed bankruptcy since the new process was implemented, only around 2,500 people (0.6 percent) have received partial relief.\n\nMeanwhile, Dick Durbin, former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had a good bipartisan bill called the FRESH START Through Bankruptcy Act of 2021, which he introduced along with Republican Senator John Cornyn. It proposed making “federal student loans eligible for discharge in a bankruptcy proceeding ten years after the first loan payment comes due.” Leading Democrats, like Elizabeth Warren, however, refused to endorse the bill.\n\nIn 2025, Trump returned to the presidency, and the Republicans gained control of the White House, the House, and the Senate. He has promisedto “eliminate” the Department of Education, and “return student loans to the states” (which is incredibly ambiguous). Trump has already gotten the go-ahead from the Supreme Court to dismantle the department.\n\nIn fact, the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill in July 2025 makes the situation worse for student borrowers. It reduces “the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven… [also] capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education,” states CBS News. Critically, the bill eliminates the President’s ability to cancel loans by executive order and allows defaulted borrowers to rehabilitate their loans twice. This provision is tantamount to an economic death sentence for these borrowers, whose loans will default again around 80 percent of the time.\n\nBoth parties in Washington have joined hands in keeping this failed loan scam going. At this point, this is not just unwise, but also immoral. We are truly in uncharted territory here. Going forward, we can easily expect half of all student loan borrowers to wind up in default in the next few years. This is precisely what the founding fathers wanted to avoid when they called for uniform bankruptcy rights. The worsening of this situation is going to take a tremendous toll on millions of people.\n\nWe can take action to prevent this by compelling Congress and the president to restore the standard, constitutional bankruptcy rights that were removed in the first place. This will end the widespread abuse that we’ve seen, prevent the far greater financial and social harms that the lending industry is poised to inflict on the country (particularly in light of the passage of the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” law in 2025, and, over time, should lead to more rational pricing and more sensible lending.\n\nWhat Other Countries Are Doing to Ensure Access to Higher Education\n\nAs the U.S. lags in understanding the value of investing in public education, other nations have recognized the importance of an educated workforce to ensure a thriving economy.\n\nIn Norway and Sweden, higher education is “tuition-free,” which guarantees equitable access to learning. To prepare students to meet industry demands, Germany offers a dual apprenticeship system, which “integrates classroom learning with paid, on-the-job training, producing well-prepared graduates for industry demands,” according to The 74 opinion piece by Courtney Brown, vice president of impact and planning at Lumina Foundation. Denmark provides students with grants to support them financially.\n\n“Switzerland has a vocational education system that allows students to split their time between school and work in fields like health care, information technology, and advanced manufacturing. Singapore’s SkillsFuture program gives adults financial credits they can use to pursue short courses and certificates at any stage of their careers. In Finland, adults can attend publicly funded retraining programs to gain new skills when industries shift or disappear,” adds the May 2025 opinion piece.\n\nThe U.S. student loan crisis is not simply the result of rising tuition costs, but of decades of deliberate policy choices that transformed higher education from a public good into a profit engine for lenders, politicians, and corporations. The stripping of bankruptcy protections, the monopolization of the lending system by an unholy alliance of the Department of Education and its private financial partners, and the bipartisan complicity of Congress have entrenched borrowers in a cycle of debt with no escape, leaving millions in financial ruin and undermining confidence in the very value of a degree. Meanwhile, other nations are investing in free or low-cost education, apprenticeships, and lifelong learning as a foundation for economic growth and social equity. Unless the United States confronts this broken system head-on—by restoring basic consumer protections, reducing costs, and reaffirming education as a public good—the crisis will continue to deepen, threatening not only individual livelihoods but the country’s long-term economic stability.","summary":"From hopeful beginnings to a broken system, student loans reveal how policy choices turned higher learning into a lifelong financial trap.\n\n\nThe post How Student Loans Became America’s Financial Catastrophe appeared first on IEyeNews.","url":"https://www.ieyenews.com/how-student-loans-became-americas-financial-catastrophe/","image":"https://www.ieyenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/unnamed-54.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:07:59","author":"ieyenews","authors":["ieyenews"],"language":"en","source_country":"ky","sentiment":0.228},{"id":360049524,"title":"Kudlow - Friday, September 12","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?

It is owned by the Israeli state and supplies equipment, including drones, for use in the war in Gaza.\n\nThe planes that AerCap are buying from IAI will be leased to other cargo airlines and so won’t be used by the IDF.\n\nNeither AerCap or Israel Aerospace Industries responded to a request for comment. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nIAI supplies weapon systems to IDF\n\nAlongside its civil operations, IAI produces a range of equipment for the IDF, including missiles, weapon systems for fighter jets and air defence systems.\n\nThe company also produces large unmanned drones, which the IDF use to carry out airstrikes in Gaza, and smaller quadcopters, also known as loitering munitions.\n\nLoitering munitions, sometimes fitted with bombs or guns, have been used by the IDF for attacks in Gaza.\n\nIAI’s involvement in Israel’s attacks on Iran in June this year is also featured prominently in a promotional video on the company’s website.\n\nOnce the first freighter 777-300 aircraft is delivered by IAI, AerCap will reportedly lease it to US cargo airline Kalitta Air.\n\nKalitta Air describes itself as a “leading provider” of commercial aircraft for the US Air Force Mobility Command, “contributing to the operational readiness and success of U.S. military missions globally”.\n\nThe company was involved in the Gulf War in the 1990s under the now-defunct business name American International Airways. In 2024, Israeli media reported that Kalitta Air was among several cargo airlines that delivered military equipment from the US to an air base in southern Israel.\n\nIt is unclear what cargo the Boeing 777-300 will carry. Kalitta Air did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAerCap received Irish investment\n\nAircraft leasing is common in the aviation industry, and Ireland is a hub for these companies. Roughly a quarter of the world’s commercial planes are owned by companies based in Ireland.\n\nIn May this year, The Journal Investigates reported that AerCap was among the Irish companies leasing aircraft to operators running deportation flights for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nThe Irish government has previously supported some of the companies involved through funding or through millions in investments.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nWhat role do Irish companies have in the US deportation industry?\n\nThis includes AerCap, which received investment from the Department of Enterprise, through IDA Ireland.

Both took out their victims in broad daylight. Both scrawled their messages on their bullet casings, and both managed to flee the scene of the crime before eventually the inevitable happened and their luck ran out.\n\nAnd both have what has been called a narcissistic oblivion to humanity – not giving a damn for the consequences of their actions.\n\nLuigi Mangione and Tyler Robinson have something else in common – a twisted and devoted following that believes the killings they are implicated in were justified.\n\nMangione, who is accused of shooting healthcare executive Brian Thompson to death on a New York City street last December, and Robinson, now awaiting charges in connection with Wednesday's killing of Conservative gadfly Charlie Kirk, are seen as heroes in some liberal circles.\n\nTheir victims deserved their fate, the sick argument goes. Thompson, 50, was responsible for denying health care to millions, Mangione's followers claim, while those same people say Kirk, 31, was justly killed for preaching hate to anyone who would listen.\n\nAnd now the country is girding itself for an outpouring of support for Robinson – who was turned in by his family late Thursday – similar to the one that has seen Mangione lionized as a sort of Robin Hood figure.\n\nWithin a day of Kirk's murder the Internet was awash with messages saying the father of two young children deserved to die.\n\nAnd now the scenes that have greeted Mangione's court appearances – with supporters expressing their love for an accused killer – can now be expected anew when Robinson has his days in court in the coming days, weeks and months.\n\nMangione's narcissism has been there to see all along. From the loafers and no socks he wore to his first New York court appearance to his 'manifesto' in which he wrote: 'I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done.'\n\n'Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming,' he scribbled before adding: 'A reminder: the US has the $1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank #42 in life expectancy.'\n\nFurther into his screed he wrote: 'It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.'\n\nRobinson's narcissism expressed itself in the Discord messages he shared with his roommate, where he couldn't help himself describing how he retrieved his rifle from a drop point and later left it wrapped in a towel.\n\nThose who have turned up in downtown Manhattan with 'Free Luigi' placards will likely be mirrored when Robinson appears 2,000 miles away in suburban Salt Lake City.\n\nClearly Mangione's chiseled good looks have much to do with the reason people – mainly young women – are obsessed with his innocence.\n\nBut both he and Robinson have followers who support the ideologies that led to the death of Thompson and Kirk.\n\nDespite their cult-hero status, neither Mangione nor Robinson was known to be particularly political.\n\nMangione followed both left-wing Democrat congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He was no fan of either Joe Biden or Donald Trump.\n\nHe had a minor obsession with Unabomber Ted Kaczynski – who killed three people and injured 23 more with mail bombs over a 17-year period – but said he was 'rightfully imprisoned' because he killed innocent people.\n\nRobinson appears to have become more radical as he grew older in true-blue Washington, Utah. When he learned the right-wing activist was coming to the state he told family members: 'Kirk is full of hate and spreading hate.'\n\nBut there was nothing to hint that he had the passion to drive for more than three hours so he could kill him, nor that his worldview would lead him allegedly to scrawl messages such as 'hey fascist, catch' or the lyrics to Bella Ciao, a song sung by anti-Mussolini forces in Italy on his bullet cases.\n\nBut like Mangione, his messages appear mixed. Another casing read: 'If you read this you are gay lmao,' while a fourth used a phrase used to troll 'furries' and transgender people.\n\nThompson's killer famously scrawled the words 'delay', 'deny' and 'depose' on three casings – tactics healthcare critics claim insurance companies use to save themselves from paying out on claims.\n\nThe killers of both Thompson and Kirk had each meticulously planned the timing of their atrocities. \n\nMangione, 25 at the time, 26 now, apparently knew exactly when the United Healthcare boss would be entering the New York Hilton hotel to give a speech to investors.\n\nHe waited outside and gunned him down from behind in cold blood – a murder captured by CCTV.\n\nHe then promptly jumped on his bike and faded into the early-morning crowds in midtown Manhattan before fleeing town. \n\nHe was eventually caught at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after Thompson's death.\n\nAlthough not all the details of Kirk's murder are known, Robinson, 22, is said to have driven into Orem, Utah, positioned himself on a roof with his long gun and waited for Kirk to appear.\n\nTwo questions into Kirk's give and take with the 3,000-strong crowd, the killer fired from 200 yards, jumped down from the Losee Center at the Utah Valley University and melted into the countryside.\n\nRobinson then drove his gray Dodge Challenger back to his parents' home.\n\nCoincidentally the 270 miles between New York and Altoona is almost identical to the distance between Orem, where Kirk was killed, and Washington, where Robinson handed himself in.\n\nNow, as justice grinds on for both Mangione and Robinson, even the court proceedings are likely to be similar with federal and state courts vying over where the high-profile cases should be heard.\n\nOn the face of it both are simple murder trials, normally the purview of the state courts.\n\nBut the Department of Justice has made it clear it is building a federal case against Mangione – partly because New York does not have the death penalty. \n\nIt says he stalked Thompson across state lines.\n\nUtah does carry out executions – famously it was the first state to use the death penalty after the Supreme Court re-instated it in 1976, when Gary Gilmore faced a firing squad. It last used it in August last year.","summary":"They are two 20-something suspects in notorious targeted murders - both white, good-looking, having everything to live for and from solid families.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15093329/Twisted-parallels-Luigi-Mangione-Tyler-Robinson.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/13/00/102097425-0-image-a-75_1757718251126.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:04:29","author":"Editor,Martin Gould","authors":["Editor","Martin Gould"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":360048060,"title":"Israels Doha strike has destroyed American credibility","text":"It is unclear whether, and how much, the US knew about Israel’s airstrike against Hamas negotiators in the Qatari capital of Doha. But there can no longer be any doubt that Israel has assumed carte blanche.\nAfter decades of enjoying impunity for its violations of international law and norms, it no longer even hesitates to do whatever it wants. Aside from the individual victims, the main casualty of Israel’s escalation is US credibility.\nIsrael – the beneficiary of billions of dollars worth of annual US aid – openly celebrated the strike. Even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s archrival, opposition leader Yair Lapid, publicly congratulated the “Air Force, IDF, Shin Bet, and all security forces on an exceptional operation to thwart our enemies”.\nWhile Israel roams freely around the region, bombing other countries at will, America’s own influence has waned. Not since the invasion of Iraq has its credibility been so low. The most troubling element of the Doha strike was its target.\nIsrael’s goal was to assassinate the negotiators who have been meeting to discuss America’s own ceasefire proposal. In doing so, it not only sabotaged the ceasefire talks but also sullied America’s word.\nSadly, there is some precedent for Israel’s strike. In Jerusalem 77 years ago, a United Nations peace mediator, the Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte, was murdered by Jewish extremists who were acting on the authority of Yitzhak Shamir, among others. Shamir would later become Israel’s prime minister, appointing Netanyahu as his spokesman. Even if violence against peace envoys is not new, it is always corrosive.\nMeanwhile, Palestinians have watched the US repeatedly shield Israel from accountability. Successive US administrations, Joe Biden’s no less than Donald Trump’s, have covered for Israel’s bombing of hospitals and targeting of journalists and aid workers in Gaza.\nThey have looked away as Israel violated ceasefires and laid siege to the enclave. They have even punished Palestinians by shutting their diplomatic mission in Washington and denying visas to Palestinian officials who were invited to the UN General Assembly in New York.\nThe now-scuttled US ceasefire proposal was biased in Israel’s favour. It called for the release of all remaining Israeli hostages on day one, in exchange for the US guaranteeing that it would press Israel to withdraw from Gaza and end the war. Clearly, Israel had something else in mind. When you kill negotiators, you destroy the only avenue that is available to bring your own people back safely.\nMoreover, Israeli assassination policies have never succeeded in ending resistance. Israel has killed one Hamas leader after another, only for new – usually even more radical – figures to take their place.\nThat is exactly what happened after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Hamas Political Bureau, in 2024, in violation of the sovereignty of another UN member state, Iran.\nAmerica’s credibility in offering ceasefire proposals rested solely on the belief that it could and would follow through on whatever was agreed. But its lack of control over its ally has now been laid bare.\nBy targeting the Hamas negotiators who were assessing the validity of US guarantees, Israel slammed the door shut on this proposal and any future dealmaking. That is arguably exactly what Netanyahu intended. Wanted internationally for war crimes, and having been indicted in Israel on charges of corruption, he has concluded that ending the war would also end his career.\nTrust, once broken, is hard to restore. Qatar, home to the largest US military base in the region, has already threatened to suspend its mediation role. But if the US and its regional allies can no longer act as mediators, no one can. There is no other power with the leverage to deliver an agreement that Netanyahu opposes.\nGiven his own strained relationship with the truth, Trump may believe that credibility doesn’t matter. But in Middle East peacemaking, it is everything. Without it, negotiations will collapse before they have even begun.\nThe Trump administration is now learning this the hard way, in real time. American influence is rapidly waning not just in Gaza but globally, as demonstrated by the embarrassing failure to end the war in Ukraine on “day one”.\nAs former US president Ronald Reagan understood, making a deal with an adversary requires one to “trust, but verify”. With Trump and Netanyahu, there can be no trust.\nThe only path forward is through concrete action: a full, verified withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners (many of whom are held indefinitely without charges). Anything less will be dismissed as empty words.\nIsrael and its American patron have dug themselves into a deep hole. Climbing out will take more than rhetoric. It will require verifiable action, because in this conflict, trust in America is gone.\n\nDaoud Kuttab is a former professor of journalism at Princeton University.\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.","summary":"America’s credibility in offering ceasefire proposals rested solely on the belief that it could and would follow through on whatever was agreed, but its lack of control over its ally has now been laid bare.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/opinion/2025/09/13/israels-doha-strike-has-destroyed-american-credibility","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/53991bc4-serangan-doha-qatar.-ap-pic-10925.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 23:00:05","author":"Daoud Kuttab","authors":["Daoud Kuttab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.288},{"id":360051484,"title":"Microsoft resolves European Union probe into Teams","text":"By KELVIN CHAN\n\nLONDON (AP) — European Union regulators have accepted Microsoft’s proposed changes to Teams, resolving a long-running antitrust investigation that targeted the company’s messaging and videoconferencing app.\n\nThe European Commission said in a statement Friday that Microsoft’s final commitments to unbundle Teams from its Office software suite, including further tweaks following a market test in May and June, are enough to satisfy competition concerns.\n\nThe legally binding commitments will remain in force for up to 10 years and allow the company to avoid a potentially hefty fine.\n\n“We appreciate the dialogue with the Commission that led to this agreement, and we turn now to implementing these new obligations promptly and fully,” Microsoft’s vice president of European government affairs, Nanna-Louise Linde, said in a statement.\n\nThe Commission, acting on a complaint filed by Slack Technologies, accused Microsoft of “possibly abusive” practices after an investigation, saying that it was tying the Teams app to its widely used Office business software suite, which includes Word, Excel and Outlook.\n\nSlack, now owned by Salesforce, makes popular workplace messaging software.

He's enamored with her story of overcoming adversity - she's lost two children. He's enamored with her faith,' one source explained.\n\nThe source claims Paxton has a 'sincere' affection for her and believes she could be the second major relationship in his life.\n\nDespite their best efforts to keep their relationship under wraps, Paxton's wife learned her husband was cheating again earlier this year, another source said.\n\nEven though the Paxtons had not lived together since the summer of 2024, learning about Duhon made the arrangement between Angela and Paxton untenable, sources explained.\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his wife Angela married in 1986 after meeting at Baylor University, a Baptist university located in Waco, Texas\n\nAs a self-described woman of faith, Tracy Duhon has led marriage retreats for couples \n\nThe Duhons finalized their divorce three weeks ago, a source confirmed to the Daily Mail, adding that Tracy met Paxton at the Kentucky Derby in May 2024.\n\nThey stayed under the same roof at the home of a mutual friend who hosted them for the event.\n\nIn July, two months after the Derby, Tracy filed for divorce, the informant stated.\n\nIn an epic tweet, Texas State Senator Angela announced the end of her 38-year marriage in July, dumping her husband, who has renewed political aspirations. \n\n'Today, after 38 years of marriage, I filed for divorce on biblical grounds,' she announced to the world on X July 10.\n\n'...in light of recent discoveries, I do not believe that it honors God or is loving to myself, my children, or Ken to remain in the marriage.'\n\nA public official in her own right, Angela, represents the Dallas suburb of McKinney in the Texas Senate.\n\nShe accused Ken of 'adultery' in court filings according to KUT News, however their divorce records have now been sealed. \n\nOn her website, Tracy Duhon shares a personal story about two of her children dying at birth\n\nIn an emotional post to X, Angela, 62, announced the end of their 38-year marriage\n\nKen Paxton, a staunch ally of Donald Trump, has hitched his wagon to the MAGA movement, becoming one of the fiercest defenders of the President. \n\nLast year, he decided to try and unseat long-time Senator John Cornyn, considered a more establishment Republican. \n\nNow both office holders are desperately trying to convince conservative voters they are the purest incarnation of the GOP.\n\nBoth Paxton and Cornyn are appealing to conservatives who rank Christianity and family values as top priorities.\n\nPrior to news of the Paxton divorce, the MAGA Attorney General was ahead by as many as 16 points with conservative voters in the Lone Star State.\n\nPolling in the weeks after Angela announced the affair shows Cornyn and Paxton in a dead heat. \n\nCornyn certainly believes the Duhon affair is a game changer, repeatedly attacking Paxton on the issue.\n\nTexas State Sen.

He was fined $1million and sentenced to five years' supervised release.\n\nWhen Paxton's affair with Olson became known, Paxton asked Paul to hire her at one of his Austin companies, lawmakers accused the attorney general.\n\nThe allegation of the quid pro quo is what resulted in Paxton's historic impeachment, with bi-partisan votes. \n\nThe two Texas Republicans running for US Senate in Texas in 2026\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks as he tours the U.S. border with Mexico at the Rio Grande on the southern border, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019, in McAllen, Texas, as Sen.

Charlie Geren said during the proceedings.\n\nPaxton was eventually acquitted after a trial in the state senate and returned to his office. If he had been found guilty, he would have lost his job as attorney general.\n\nAngela sat through his trial at the senate every day, listening to details of his affair with Olson, even on the days her husband did not show up. She recused herself from voting. \n\nOlson was called to the State Capitol to testify, but never actually took the stand.\n\nWhen asked about Duhon being his mistress, Paxton did not address the claim but attacked the Daily Mail and vowed to take on the 'deranged radical Left' with Trump.\n\nWhen the Daily Mail reached out to Duhon, she hung up after learning she was on the phone with a reporter.\n\nShe did not respond to text messages seeking further comment.

The US President attended the men's singles final at the US Open in New York last weekend , with the surrounding area swarming with secret service operatives, who were positioned at strategic locations in order to keep Trump safe. One agent was deployed at the 545-bed Elmhurst Hospital Centre in Queens, also known as NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst. It was here that hospital staff initiated a group text conversation to discuss the enhanced security arrangements and procedures, reports the Express . However, a hospital administrator mistakenly included a random member of the public in the chat, who had no connection to the medical facility. The opening message, from a senior hospital administrator stated: \"Happy Sunday...just updating.. a Secret Service agent from White House Medical Unit just called..will be posted by the hospital until around 6pm for usual precaution when #1 is passing via. \"We will get him situated per the usual plan. But no reason for action on your part..just awareness.\" Three hospital administrators replied to the message, with one responding: \"Noted. Thank you.\" When the civilian - who prefers to stay anonymous - cottoned on that they had been mistakenly added to the discussion, they messaged: \"Ummmm I am certainly not a part of this convo\". A hospital administrator replied with the words \"OK thanks\". The civilian subsequently told reporters: \"I could not believe it - I thought it was a prank. I looked up the numbers, and I could see how they were all medical officials in New York City.\" Officials firmly rejected claims that any significant security breach had occurred which might have put the US President's life at risk. A representative from NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst stated: \"It's no secret that NYC Health + Hospitals serves as the designated medical entity for US Presidents and other visiting dignitaries. \"As the largest municipal hospital system in the country, our mission is to care for all without exception.\" A United States Secret Service Official commented: \"The U.S. Secret Service has a long-standing practice of assigning agents to medical facilities in support of protective visits. There was no security impact to this event and pre-event communication between the Secret Service and our partners is standard.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"Security details for Donald Trump were leaked to an unsuspecting member of the public in a major blunder - however officials have denied that it could have endangered the president's life","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/huge-donald-trump-security-blunder-35896558","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35896557.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_DONALD-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 22:43:25","author":"John Varga,Phoebe Tonks","authors":["John Varga","Phoebe Tonks"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.012},{"id":360044976,"title":"Law Enforcement Officials Testify About Aftermath Of Discovering Alleged Attempted Trump Assassin","text":"FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Several law enforcement officials took the stand Friday to detail how they responded on the day they discovered Ryan Routh’s alleged attempt to assassinate President Donald Trump.\n\nThe trial, which wrapped up early on its fifth day, is moving along faster than anticipated, as Routh takes little time to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nRouth is representing himself as he faces five charges for allegedly attempting to assassinate Trump at his Florida golf course. The jury heard Friday from two officials — Sergeant Kenneth Mays and Lt. William Gale of the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office — who responded to the situation on Sept. 15, 2024, along with several FBI agents who recovered evidence from the scene.\n\nMays, who was helping with protection that day, explained how he sprang into action after hearing “shots fired!” over the sheriff’s office communications channel. With no access to the Secret Service channel and no further information provided over his own, he began trying to figure out what was happening. (RELATED: Ryan Routh Mounts Confusing Self-Defense As Witnesses Expose His ‘Deadly Serious’ Plot To Allegedly Kill Trump)\n\nAfter a Secret Service agent at the golf course clubhouse was unable to provide him with any information, Mays parked on Summit Boulevard, where he heard another agent and found a spot in the bushes cleared away like “somebody had been in there.” In that spot — which was Routh’s hiding place — Mays found a rifle leaned against the fence and two bags clipped to it, which he asked Gale to examine using X-ray.\n\nWhen Gale arrived on the scene after hearing “shots fired!” over the radio, he encountered a citizen, Tommy McGee, with information about a man he spotted fleeing.\n\nMcGee, a mental health counselor, testified Thursday that he followed Routh after hearing the gunshots. He said he did so to record Routh’s license plate number and to take a photo.\n\nProsecutor John Shipley said on Thursday that McGee is “the reason the defendant didn’t get away.” Shipley credited Secret Service agent Robert Fercano with stopping Routh from “getting away with it.” Fercano also testified Thursday about spotting Routh hiding in the bushes.\n\n I’m back this morning in Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom for @DailyCaller News Foundation as the Ryan Routh trial continues. — Katelynn Richardson (@katesrichardson) September 12, 2025 \n\n Before lunch, the jury also heard from FBI laboratory operational media specialist Erin Casey and FBI Special Agent Kathryn Rose.\n\nRose displayed items recovered from the scene to the jury, including the rifle, a GoPro camera, the bags strapped to the fence and the metal plates contained inside. Casey testified that Routh was positioned just around 126 feet from the flag on the sixth hole, where Trump would have been heading next.\n\n“Seems like we got nowhere,” Routh said after asking Rose a question about tape on the rifle’s scope. “Thank you for your useful testimony.”\n\nRouth spoke little for most of the day, asking few questions during cross examination and forgoing his opportunity entirely for two witnesses.\n\nIn the afternoon, FBI Special Agent Kristin Bailey told the jury how she took DNA evidence using a mouth swab and collected Routh’s fingerprints.\n\n“You left out the hair,” Routh criticized in his only question during cross examination. “You pulled all my hair out, and it’s not even in the evidence?”\n\nBailey replied she wasn’t asked about the hair. (RELATED: Judge Cuts Off Ryan Routh Minutes Into Opening Statement)\n\nOther afternoon testimony came from FBI digital forensic examiner Elizabeth Riddell, who extracted several videos from Routh’s GoPro camera, FBI Special Agent David Gilbert, who cleared Routh’s firearm of ammo; and FBI Special Agent Jose Loureiro, who photographed Routh and his clothing once he was in custody.\n\nWitness testimony began Thursday following opening statements, where prosecutor John Shipley told the jury that Routh had a “carefully crafted and deadly serious plot” to ensure the public could not re-elect President Donald Trump. Routh’s rambling opening statement, featuring remarks about human history and international relations, was quickly ended by the judge after he failed to heed her warning about making a “mockery” of the courtroom.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon directed Routh and his standby council to have defense witnesses ready to testify on Sept. 19, as prosecutors intend to rest their case on Sept. 18.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He denied it was a sexual remark but was later sacked by the BBC. \nIn 2023, Amanda Abbington, 51, complained about Giovanni Pernice, 34, being 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. \nWhilst he was cleared of the 'overwhelming majority' of allegations, a probe did uphold some of her complaints of verbal bullying and harassment. \nThe same year, former Love Island contestant Zara McDermott, 28, was left 'incredibly distressed' following her experience in the training room with Graziano Di Prima, 31, who admitted to kicking the documentary maker, resulting in his axing. \n\nThis year's rules for the dancers are believed to include 'no swearing, drinking alcohol to excess or inappropriate clothing' in order to protect the show \n\nThe broadcaster has already launched an inquiry into the family show amid claims two of its stars had used cocaine.\nOne of the stars involved in the drugs probe was also suspected of drinking while working on the show after crew smelt alcohol on their breath. \n\n The real curse of Strictly: How scandals continue to plague the BBC show \nThe Sun alleged that it was widely known that the pair, who have not been named, took the Class A substance, and that one of these Strictly performers was known for being a drinker.\nA BBC spokesperson told Daily Mail: 'We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. \n'We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns.

with Alberta, oil companies: minister","text":"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, in a statement Friday, said the emissions cap was one of the \"biggest problems\" facing her province and the oil industry, the success of which is joined at the hip of her government's annual budgets.\n\nReferencing the \"exceptionally productive\" meeting she had with Carney earlier in the week, Smith said she told him there's a \"chicken and egg\" issue the cap presents when it comes to the feasibility of a new oil pipeline.\n\nA new pipeline could happen as part of Carney's major projects strategy, the prime minister said Thursday, since one project up for future referral to the new Major Projects Office is the Alberta-based Pathways Alliance carbon capture and storage proposal. \n\nHe said once that project is done, it could lead to a new \"decarbonized\" pipeline, though he noted that no proponents have stepped up.\n\nSmith, in her statement Friday, said she told the prime minister that he \"won't have proponents willing to step up and pledge barrels to a new pipeline if you have an emissions cap that makes them shut it in the ground.\"\n\n\"I think this is resonating with him and I’m confident we’ll see real progress on this well before the end of the year.”\n\nSmith, speaking on CBC's \"Power and Politics\" show Friday, also provided few details on what scenarios were being discussed when it comes to changing or scrapping the emissions cap, but said she thinks Carney understands that the proposed 2030 implementation timeline behind it isn't manageable.\n\n\"We're having some very constructive conversations about being able to reorient around that timeline,\" she said.\n\n\"You can't just put a policy in place with no plan on how to achieve it, because then the only way to achieve it is to shut in production or shut down the development of new energy, and that doesn't make sense for any of us.\"\n\nOil and gas production accounts for about one-quarter of Canada's total greenhouse gas emissions — and Canada can't hit its emissions reduction target without lowering emissions in this key sector.\n\nThe federal government last year announced it would impose an emissions cap on oil and gas production to lower emissions by 35 per cent compared with 2019 levels.\n\nSmith and the federal Conservatives have insisted the policy is a barrier to investments and economic growth and have demanded its cancellation.\n\nFederal Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin, speaking alongside Hodgson at the press conference, said the government is still focused on the issue of climate change and is reviewing feedback on the emission cap regulations.\n\n\"We're in a very special moment right now, and that includes making sure that we are fighting climate change and we're moving to net zero,\" Dabrusin said.\n\nThe Carney government has already scaled back or cancelled some climate policies introduced under former prime minister Justin Trudeau. It killed the consumer carbon price and delayed a mandate for electric vehicle sales by at least a year.\n\nReacting to the news that the future of the emissions cap is up for negotiations, a senior energy strategist with Greenpeace Canada said backpedalling on climate policy to appease U.S. President Donald Trump is not what Canadians voted for.\n\n\"It would be a tragic mistake for the Liberal government to back off on climate action while wildfires are still burning across this country,\" Keith Stewart said in a media statement.\n\n\"Oil and gas production is the largest and fastest rising source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and there is no way we can meet our international climate commitments without tackling that sector, which is what the emissions cap was designed to do.\n\n\"Mark Carney talks of striking a 'grand bargain' with the oil industry where they reduce emissions per barrel while producing more barrels, but that is at best a recipe for maintaining the status quo.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2025.","summary":"At a news conference in Winnipeg, Hodgson didn't say if Ottawa plans to scrap the emissions cap, but said Alberta and industry agree with the federal government that there needs to be a \"fundamental change in the emissions intensity of the oilsands.\"","url":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/09/12/news/ottawa-emissions-cap-alberta-oil","image":"https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/09/12/hodgson-0912125-amberbrackencp.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 22:34:55","author":"Alessia Passafiume,Jack Farrell,The Canadian Press","authors":["Alessia Passafiume","Jack Farrell","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":360053376,"title":"New Documents Appear To Refute Lisa Cook Mortgage Fraud Claims: Report","text":"Newly unearthed documents appear to challenge the Trump administration's accusations that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook committed mortgage fraud, Reuters reports.Why It MattersThe dispute bears on two consequential issues: whether a federal housing regulator's referral to the Justice Department was supported by documents that demonstrate criminal intent, and whether President Donald Trump lawfully can remove a Fed governor — an action that critics say threatens the Federal Reserve's independence amid political pressure to lower interest rates.What To KnowA loan estimate for an Atlanta property purchased by Cook, first obtained by Reuters, shows that she told the lender she planned to use it as a \"vacation home.\"Trump administration officials, led by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, have accused Cook of claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan properties as her primary residence, which would have potentially granted her better mortgage and tax rates.Citing mortgage documents, Pulte referred Cook to the Department of Justice, which began a federal investigation. President Trump also referenced the allegations as he attempted to fire her.The declaration on the May 28, 2021, estimate, issued by Cook's credit union, appears to refute those allegations, Reuters notes.Cook has sued to block her removal after Trump announced her firing, and a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction allowing her to remain on the Fed while the suit proceeds.What Happens NextCook's lawsuit challenging her removal is set to proceed, as she has refuted any allegations of wrongdoing about her properties, Reuters notes.Update 9/12/25 6:50 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.","summary":"Newly unearthed documents appear to challenge the Trump administration's accusations that Lisa Cook committed mortgage fraud, Reuters reports.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/new-documents-appear-refute-lisa-cook-mortgage-fraud-claims-report-2129248","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2721748/fed-governor-lisa-cook-file.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=e8395f03c5b221dcf84a37a6bee3bdb9","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-12 22:33:16","author":"Anna Commander,Hannah Parry","authors":["Anna Commander","Hannah Parry"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.328}]}
