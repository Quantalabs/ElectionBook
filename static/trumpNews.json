Great, great soundtrack,” Jason Kelce told his brother while discussing the singer’s 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Wednesday’s episode of New Heights.\nThe question sent Travis into a fit of laughter as he agreed that “it’s a great song.”\nJason, who couldn’t keep a straight face, asked, “Do you feel — not confident — do you feel cocky about the song Wood?”\n“No,” Travis replied. “Any song, you know, that she references me in is very … I love that girl, what do you mean? Any song that she would reference me in any way …”\n\nJason Kelce asked his younger brother Travis Kelce if he felt “cocky” after listening to the song Wood, which is about his manhood.\nMORE: Travis Kelce caught up in $5.3m homeless scandal\nHe trailed off as Jason, 37, pointed out that the track is not about Travis but more specifically about his “appendage.”\nThe tight end denied this, insisting, “What? I think you’re not understanding the song. No way!”\nThe former Philadelphia Eagles centre then teased Travis by quoting the lyrics, “Redwood tree / Ain’t hard to see.”\n\n“I thought redwood was a little … it was a generous word. If somebody wrote a song about me, it would be like ‘Japanese maple / sometimes can see,’” Jason continued, which sent everyone in the studio into hysterics.\n\nTravis’ fiancee Taylor Swift released the song in her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.\n\nTravis said he’s happy in any song he’s referenced by Taylor.\nMORE: Inside Taylor Swift’s $230m property empire\nIn her latest album, Swift entered her most cheeky era by releasing a song about her and Travis’ sex life, called “Wood.”\nIn it, she shockingly sings, “Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He (ah!)matised me / And opened my eyes / Redwood tree / It ain’t hard to see / His love was the key / That opened my thighs.\n“Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way / […] / The curse on me was broken by your magic wand,” she continues before specifically calling out Travis’ “New Heights of manhood.”\nDespite the clear double entendres throughout the song, Swift coyly said on The Official Release Party of a Showgirl movie that the song is about superstitions.\n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nTravis Kelce breaks silence on Taylor Swift engagement\n\nNFL star Travis kelce has spoken publicly for the first time about popping the...\n\nShe later clarified during an interview with Jimmy Fallon that she was initially inspired by “all these superstitions,” like knocking on wood, when writing the song.\n“It really started out in a very innocent place,” the musical icon, 35, claimed during Monday’s episode of The Tonight Show. “I don’t know what happened, man.”\nShe said that once she “got in there” and “started vibing,” the song shifted.\n“I don’t know how we got here, but I love the song so much,” the songwriter quipped, later adding that “the spice level on this album is high.”\nJason and Travis kicked off Wednesday’s most recent podcast episode by applauding Swift for “[doing] it again.\n\nIn the raunchy song, Taylor sings, “Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He (ah!)matised me / And opened my eyes / Redwood tree / It ain’t hard to see / His love was the key / That opened my thighs.”\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end said, “Give it up for Taylor, she’s done it again. Put the world on tilt, it’s been fun seeing everyone’s reaction and we’ve had an absolute blast watching her go through her press tour and radios and all these talk shows coming up this week that’ll air after this recording right here.”\nHe continued to gush that the “Fate of Ophelia” singer has “looked amazing, sounded amazing and this album is absolutely amazing.”\nTravis also said that he listened to The Life of a Showgirl “wholeheartedly because it’s her creation and you want to appreciate it for what it is.”\n“I think that’s the best thing, that the person you’re in the room with — being open to what they’re creating. But yeah, it was fun to hear all of these [songs] come together knowing some of them, as she’s mentioned, have been about our life together,” he added.\n\nTaylor also continues to call out Travis’ “New Heights of manhood”.

I’m excited, I’m happy for her, everything seems to have gone perfectly — and you see it from start to finish,” he continued before concluding. “I’m just happy as hell because she’s happy, she’s proud of this and I’m proud of her for going through the hoops to live out her dreams.”\nThe podcast co-host also mentioned that Actually Romantic, which Swifties think is about Charli XCX, is a song he has been listening to non-stop.\nIn August, when Swift announced her 12th studio album on his New Heights podcast, Kelce also shared that Opalite was his top song.\n\nMore Coverage\nNicole’s sad interview: ‘How many times?’\n\nDolly speaks out amid panic over her health\n\nAside from Opalite and Wood, the songstress also penned Wish List, The Life of Ophelia and Honey about the NFL star.\nFollowing the filming of that August podcast episode, the A-list couple got engaged after two years of dating.\nThis article originally appeared in Page Six and was reproduced with permission\n\nJoin the conversation (2 Comments)\n\nAdd your comment to this story\n\nTo join the conversation, please\n log in.

Then Rubio passed the president a note.An AP photographer covering the event zoomed in on the handwriting on White House stationery that read, “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” Trump said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”The influencer event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.The note's urgent tone came as Trump’s top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort Wednesday — a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of an American plan to end the war in Gaza.Trump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East “toward the end of the week” and could even “make the rounds” in the region to Egypt and possibly the Gaza Strip as U.S. negotiators closed in on a deal.Still, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.Nearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: “I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East — although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.”“We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that,” Trump added.He then suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without Cabinet members remaining behind.“We’re gonna get peace in the Middle East,” Trump wrapped up by saying. “That’s what we want to do.”The public didn't have to wait all too long for the formal confirmation. At 6:51 p.m. — just about two hours after Rubio initially passed Trump the note — the president triumphantly took to his social media platform for the announcement.“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, saying that means all hostages will be released “very soon” while Israel will withdraw their troops “to an agreed upon line.”Trump added: “This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen.

The letter, signed a group of 19 US lawmakers, spearheaded by Deborah K Ross, Ro Khanna, Brad Sherman, and several others, explained the critical importance of the US-India partnership and warned that recent tariff measures have damaged the bilateral relationship.The tariff hikes, imposed in late August 2025, have raised duties on Indian goods to as high as 50%. The move has not only hurt Indian manufacturers but also raised prices for American consumers and damaged the intricate supply chains that American companies depend on. The lawmakers argued that these punitive measures have strained relations with the world's largest democracy, creating negative consequences for both countries.The lawmakers stressed that the US-India economic relationship is exceptionally important, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in both countries. They pointed out that the American manufacturers rely on India for key inputs in sectors ranging from semiconductors to healthcare and energy. Furthermore, the Indian investments in the US have created new employment opportunities across American communities. The lawmakers asserted that cooperation between the two nations showed how free and open societies can prosper through mutual respect.The letter warned that the tariff escalation could push India closer to regimes hostile to the US, including China and Russia, undermining Washington's strategic interests. India is described as a stabilising force in the Indo-Pacific and a vital partner in defence cooperation, citing its role in the QUAD alliance alongside the US, Australia, and Japan.The lawmakers urged Trump to reaffirm America's resolve to India, calling for a recalibration, not confrontation, in the relationship. They recommended that the administration begin by reviewing the current tariff policy and continuing dialogue with Indian leadership. \"We urge you to take immediate steps to reset and repair this critical partnership,\" the lawmakers wrote.The letter outlined the shared democratic traditions between the US and India, which set them apart from authoritarian competitors. The partnership between the two nations is crucial for regional stability and global prosperity. The lawmakers stressed that the US and India must work together to address their differences and strengthen their relationship.The US-India relationship is at a critical juncture, with the recent tariff measures threatening to damage the partnership. The lawmakers' letter outlined the importance of cooperation between the two nations and the need for a recalibration of the relationship.The QUAD alliance, which includes the US, India, Australia, and Japan, plays a crucial role in regional security and stability. The partnership between the US and India is vital for countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.","summary":"US lawmakers urge President Trump to mend ties with India amid tariff row, warning that strained relations are hurting both economies and risk pushing India closer to China and Russia.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/tariffs-hurt-americans-us-lawmakers-push-trump-to-mend-india-ties-citing-tariff-damage","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/india-us-trade-deal-agriculture-likely-to-be-exempted-from-tariffs-interim-deal-expected-by-july-8-1751566486347-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 00:40:04","author":"Abhishek Tiwari","authors":["Abhishek Tiwari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":367506234,"title":"Trump Announces Historic Gaza Breakthrough: Israel And Hamas Agree To Ceasefire Deal","text":"Gaza: US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, paving the way for a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners. The crucial breakthrough comes after months of intense negotiations, with Trump's administration presenting a proposal for a peace deal. According to the agreement, Hamas will release all 20 living hostages this weekend, while the Israeli military will begin withdrawing from the majority of Gaza. The agreement also ensures the entry of aid and the exchange of hostages and prisoners. Trump announced the agreement on Wednesday, saying it marks the first phase of his peace plan. \"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed-upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,\" Trump wrote on social media.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his gratitude to Trump and his team for their efforts, saying, \"With God's help, we will bring them all home.\" Hamas has also welcomed the deal, calling on Trump and the mediators to ensure Israel's compliance with the agreement.The peace deal news was met with excitement and anticipation by the Hostages Families Forum, an organisation representing many of the hostage families. \"We received the news of a ceasefire with excitement, anticipation, and apprehension,\" the Forum said, calling on the Israeli government to immediately convene and approve the deal. Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, announced that the agreement \"will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.\"However, the future governance of Gaza is still a contentious issue. The Hostages Families Forum welcomed the news with \"excitement, anticipation, and apprehension,\" urging the Israeli government to immediately approve the deal. Benjamin Netanyahu has convened the government to discuss the agreement, thanking Trump and his team for their efforts. However, challenges lie ahead, including the future governance of Gaza and whether Hamas will demilitarize, as Trump has demanded.Moreover, it is unclear which Palestinian prisoners will be released in the first phase of the deal, with Israeli officials pushing back on the inclusion of Marwan Barghouti, a prominent Palestinian prisoner serving five life sentences in an Israeli jail. It is being stated that the release of Barghouti could possibly destabilise Netanyahu's coalition government.Further details regarding the peace deal are awaited.","summary":"Israel and Hamas agree to a US-brokered peace deal, paving the way for a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-announces-historic-gaza-breakthrough-israel-and-hamas-agree-to-ceasefire-deal","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/donald-trump-gaza-peace-plan-with-netanyahu-gives-warning-to-hamas-in-20-proposal-1759197360693-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-09 00:07:27","author":"Abhishek Tiwari","authors":["Abhishek Tiwari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":367502746,"title":"Trump announces Gaza peace deal as Israel and Hamas sign off on 'first phase' of landmark plan","text":"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday night that both Israel and Hamas had signed off on the 'first phase' of his proposed peace deal - a substantial step in ending the war in Gaza. \n\n'This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. \n\n'All Parties will be treated fairly!

Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n'I thank the heroic soldiers of the IDF and all the security forces — thanks to their courage and sacrifice we have reached this day. I thank from the bottom of my heart President Trump and his team for mobilizing for this sacred mission of freeing our hostages.\n\n'With God's help, together we will continue to achieve all our objectives and expand peace with our neighbors.' \n\nHamas thanked Trump, as well as mediators in Qatar, Egypt and Turkey for the peace deal which they say provides 'the withdrawal of the occupation, allows the entry of aid and implements a prisoner exchange.'\n\n'We call on President Trump, the guarantor states of the agreement, and all Arab, Islamic and international parties to oblige the government of the occupation to fulfill all the agreement's commitments, and not to allow it to evade or delay implementation of the accords.'\n\nNetanyahu's office said that he and Trump spoke and congratulated each other on the agreement to release all hostages, which Netanyahu's office described as a 'historic achievement.'\n\nAccording to a statement from the prime minister's office, the conversation was 'warm and moving.' Netanyahu thanked Trump for his 'efforts and global leadership,' while Trump praised Netanyahu's 'determined leadership and the actions he led.'\n\nHamas plans to release all 20 living hostages this weekend, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press, while the Israeli military will begin a withdrawal from the majority of Gaza. \n\nEarlier in the day, Secretary of State Marco Rubio had interrupted a roundtable Trump was having in the State Dining Room to deliver him an urgent note on the Gaza peace deal. \n\n'I was just given a note by the Secretary of State saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly,' Trump told attendees. \n\nThe frantically scrawled note was caught on camera. \n\nIt read: 'Very close. We need you to approve a post on Truth Social soon, so you can announce the deal first.'\n\nAt the same event, Trump confirmed reports that he would head to the Middle East as soon as this weekend. \n\nHe told reporters he would likely travel to Egypt , where negotiations are happening, but expressed an openness to traveling to Gaza as well.\n\nTrump also has yet to travel to Israel during his second term.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the trip in a statement, saying that Trump would visit Walter Reed on Friday to meet with the troops and receive his annual physical as he's 'considering going to the Middle East shortly thereafter.'\n\nThere, he would join special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who have been attending the talks. \n\nPrior to Trump's announcement, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that he had received 'encouraging' signs and hailed the support of Trump, whose 20-point peace proposal formed the basis of the talks.\n\nHamas too expressed 'optimism' over the indirect discussions with its foe Israel.\n\nTrump's plan calls for a ceasefire, the release of all the hostages held in Gaza, Hamas' disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.\n\n'The mediators are making great efforts to remove any obstacles to the implementation of the ceasefire, and a spirit of optimism prevails among all parties,' senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu said from the resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, where talks kicked off on Monday. \n\nThe terror group submitted a list of prisoners it wants to be released in the first phase of the truce 'in accordance with the agreed-upon criteria and numbers,' Nunu added. \n\nIn exchange, Hamas is set to release 47 hostages, both alive and dead, that the group had seized during the October 7, 2023 attack in Israel, when 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken into Gaza as hostages. \n\nTwenty are believed to still be alive. \n\nOnce the hostages are returned, Israel will free 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences, plus 1,700 Gazans arrested since October 7, including all the women and children. \n\nFor every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 dead Gazans, the Trump plan says. \n\nTrump's announcement of a deal comes one day after the second anniversary of that grim day, which kickstarted the present war. \n\nThis will be the third ceasefire reached since the start of the war. \n\nThe first, in November 2023, saw more than 100 hostages, mainly women and children, freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners before it broke down.\n\nThe second, in January and February of this year, saw Palestinian militants release 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel ended that ceasefire in March with a surprise bombardment.","summary":"President Donald Trump announced Wednesday night that both Israel and Hamas had signed off on his proposed peace deal - a substantial step in ending the war in Gaza.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15175479/trump-gaza-plan-israel-hamas.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/08/23/102825107-0-Secretary_of_State_Marco_Rubio_interrupts_a_summit_held_by_Donal-a-77_1759964303573.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/08/3840533622790114455/1024x576_MP4_3840533622790114455.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-09 00:07:16","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab,Ross Ibbetson,Stephen M.

Indian firms have submitted end-user certificates stating that magnets will not be used for manufacturing any weapons of mass destruction. Dominance in Supply Chain But Beijing has sought export control guarantees on the lines of the Wassenaar Arrangement, people directly aware of the matter told ET. China is not a signatory to the agreement, which promotes transparency and responsibility in the transfer of dual-use technologies and goods among the 42 member states for the purposes of international security. India is a signatory. “China wants to ensure that the heavy rare earth magnets supplied to India do not reach the US,” a person aware of the matter said on the condition of anonymity. The Indian government has not agreed to such a request yet, he said. “Our understanding is that China is looking at some deal with the US on heavy rare earth magnets and is unwilling to release supplies without a guarantee that there will not be any diversion,” a second person in the know said. China controls 90% of the global production of heavy rare earth magnets and has stopped making public country-specific data on exports of these materials. Beijing is seeking to leverage its dominance in the rare earth supply chain in its trade talks with Washington.Live Events “There have been requests for end-use certification,” a senior government official told ET. “Our understanding is that it is mostly companies that are providing the assurances, possibly with certification by the commerce ministry also.” In India, electric vehicle makers are the largest consumers of these powerful magnets, which are key components also for other high-tech industries such as renewable energy, electronics manufacturing, and aerospace and defence. China has resumed supplies of light rare earth magnets to India after the August 31–September 1 Shanghai Cooperation Summit. But the shortage in supplies of heavy rare earth magnets continues, hurting development of motors for larger electric three-wheelers, cars, trucks, and buses in India. These materials are used in about a dozen critical components that go into electric vehicle motors as well as vehicle speed detection and automatic gear shifting systems. ‘Not Much Progress Made’ “There has not been any movement so far as regards to supplies of heavy rare earth magnets despite high-level talks between India and China,” a senior auto industry executive said. “Two-wheeler makers have resorted to solutions utilising heavy rare earth-free magnets, but for larger electric vehicles, supplies are still a constraint. Using ferrite magnets or light rare earth magnets ends up impacting efficiency of the vehicles.” China on April 4 announced export controls on medium and heavy rare earth-related items with a view to “safeguarding national security”, in response to US President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on Beijing. The April notification mandated exporters that ship such items to seek a licence from China’s commerce department after getting an EUC from the buyer. The EUC requires buyers to guarantee these items will not be used for storing, manufacturing, producing, or processing weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. While China has over the past couple of months resumed supplies of rare earth magnets to companies in Europe and Southeast Asia, export licences are yet to be issued to vendors supplying to India. India imported 870 tonnes of rare earth magnets valued at ₹306 crore in FY25.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onrare earth magnets supply chainheavy rare earth magnetsCommerce MinistryShanghai Cooperation SummitWassenaar Arrangement\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

The families said they received the news of the deal “with excitement, anticipation, and concern.” “The headquarters welcomes the signing of an agreement meant to bring all the hostages home — the living, for rehabilitation among their families, and the fallen, for proper burial in their homeland,” the statement read. “This is an important and significant step on the path to returning everyone, but our struggle is not over and will not end until the last hostage returns.” They urged the government to convene immediately and approve the deal. “Any delay could come at a heavy price for the hostages and the soldiers,” they warned. “We are confident that the prime minister will ensure an overwhelming majority for implementing the agreement reached.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far issued only a brief response, writing: “With God’s help — we are bringing them all home.” The families expressed gratitude to President Trump and his team “for the leadership and determination that led to a historic breakthrough: ending the war and reaching a comprehensive agreement for the return of all hostages.” They emphasized that the mission was not yet complete: “There are still 48 hostages, including one woman, in Hamas captivity. Our moral and national obligation is to bring them all home, both the living and the dead. Their return is a condition for the recovery and renewal of Israeli society as a whole.

And on Wednesday the ‘God Bless the USA’ singer told TMZ he would relish the opportunity.\n\nGreenwood said that, given Bad Bunny is already confirmed for halftime, he could fire up fans before the game instead. \n\nBad Bunny – who was born Benito Antonio Martinez – previously cited ICE agents as a reason he did not include any mainland US dates for his upcoming tour. And, on Tuesday, Johnson branded the Puerto Rican a ‘terrible’ choice. \n\nBad Bunny is among the most streamed artists on Spotify but Johnson claimed ‘it sounds like he’s not someone who appeals to a broader audience.’\n\nThe house speaker told Migrant Insider: ‘I didn’t even know who Bad Bunny was.

Not somebody like this.’ \n\nGreenwood recently appeared on stage with Trump at the memorial service for Charlie Kirk. The 82-year-old is no stranger to NFL games, having performed the national anthem or ‘God Bless the USA’ at stadiums across the country.\n\nGreenwood is reportedly set to play a halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys’ Monday Night Football clash against the Arizona Cardinals on November 3.\n\nThe country singer’s team told TMZ he has no ill-feelings towards Bad Bunny. But Greenwood is nevertheless reportedly frustrated at how divided the country has become over the halftime show. \n\nTrump addressed the Bad Bunny controversy earlier this week, telling Newsmax: ‘I have never heard of him, I don’t know who he is, I don’t know why they’re doing it, it’s crazy… I think it’s absolutely ridiculous.’\n\nThe president’s ally Corey Lewandowski, meanwhile, previously called it ‘so shameful’ that ‘they picked someone who seems to hate America.’\n\nLewandowski also confirmed that ICE agents will be patrolling San Francisco during the Super Bowl. \n\n‘There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally,’ he said. ‘Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find and deport you. That is a very real situation.’ \n\nBad Bunny was the host of ‘Saturday Night Live’ over the weekend and, during his opening monologue, the Puerto Rican addressed his haters.\n\n‘You might not know this but I’m doing the Super Bowl halftime show and I’m very happy and I think everyone is happy about it – even Fox News,’ Bad Bunny said.\n\nA heavily-edited clip then played, stitching together the comments of various Fox anchors and pundits so that they said: ‘Bad Bunny is my favorite musician and he should be the next president.’\n\nHe continued: ‘Thank you. Wow, thank you. But really, I am very excited to be doing the Super Bowl and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy.’\n\nThe rapper than spoke in Spanish for several seconds before finishing his monologue by saying: ‘If you did not understand what I just said… you have four months to learn!’\n\nIn the Spanish portion of his monologue, Bad Bunny took another shot at his critics and thanked those who paved the way for him. \n\n‘Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors,’ he said.\n\n‘It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us.

Yaghi built on Robson and Kitagawa’s discoveries by creating a stable MOF that could be modified to have new properties: Imagine a porous filter programmed to selectively remove any atom or molecule at the command of a scientist.\n\nSince the trio’s discoveries, “chemists have built tens of thousands of different MOFs,” the academy wrote in its award announcement, noting that some may be key to solving humanity’s greatest challenges.\n\n“Metal–organic frameworks have enormous potential, bringing previously unforeseen opportunities for custom-made materials with new functions,” said Heiner Linke, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.\n\nOn Wednesday, Yaghi spoke with reporters via Zoom from Brussels, Belgium, to discuss the award. He described the moment he was exiting a plane in Frankfurt, Germany, when his phone buzzed with a call from Sweden. On the line was the secretary of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry with the news that he had won.\n\n“It was absolutely thrilling. You cannot prepare for a moment like that,” Yaghi said. “Since then, my phone hasn’t stopped ringing, buzzing, receiving emails, hundreds and hundreds of emails. I have no idea how I’m going to respond to all of them.”\n\nYaghi said his two biggest influences were his father and his Ph.D. adviser, Walter Klemperer, who each pushed him to challenge the status quo and accept failure as an inevitable part of progress, and also instilled in him his belief in the power of the experiment. His father’s belief in Yaghi’s academic potential pushed him to send his son alone to Troy, New York for school.\n\n“That takes incredible commitment … We didn’t have a lot of the conveniences that many others do, but we had a lot of love and a lot of care,” Yaghi said. “I’m quite emotional to see my refugee parents spend every minute of their time dedicated to their kids and to their kids’ education, because they saw that as a way to lift themselves and their kids out of challenging situations.”\n\nYaghi addressed the challenges facing the scientific community as President Donald Trump’s administration cuts funding for research and discovery. Public funding from his first grant from the National Science Foundation was crucial to securing the resources and funding that laid the foundation for his research, he said. The grant allowed Yaghi to take creative risks and explore new directions in chemistry, ultimately leading to the discoveries that earned him the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Jordanian refugee turned Nobel Prize winner said that scientists face a “crisis of our times” today as public support for science fades. He called on scientists to renew their historical commitment to the pursuit of knowledge, exploring the frontiers of science without fear. Only when scientists can explore their curiosities, he said, does that lead to building the industries of tomorrow, improving public health and securing the future.\n\n“Science is an absolute essential part of an enlightened society and building a robust society that improves the quality of life for its people,” Yaghi said. “Our science is a jewel in the crown of our country, so we cannot allow that to slip.”","summary":"With his Nobel Prize win, he called on the scientific community to renew their commitment to discovery amid funding cuts to science.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/08/uc-berkeley-professor-omar-yaghi-wins-nobel-prize-in-chemistry/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EBT-L-NOBELCHEM-100925-01.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:42:56","author":"Chase Hunter","authors":["Chase Hunter"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":367507630,"title":"Trump’s tariffs on India ‘incredibly unfortunate’, says Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove (IANS Exclusive)","text":"Washington, Oct 9 (SocialNews.XYZ) Sydney Kamlager-Dove, the Democratic Congresswoman from California and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, has termed the Trump administration's tariffs on India \"incredibly unfortunate\" and advocated deeper ties with New Delhi.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with IANS, Kamlager-Dove said that \"tariffs are playing a disproportionate role in how we are able to move together\".\n\n\"I think that's incredibly unfortunate, mostly because there was so much work that happened under the Biden administration to really move this bilateral relationship along in a positive way,\" she added.\n\nShe also criticised the silence of Republican lawmakers even as India-US relations continued to worsen.\n\n\"The Republicans are either staying silent or supporting, either way, (they are) being complicit with policies that are creating major setbacks,\" she added.\n\nKamlager-Dove, along with her 18 Democratic House members, co-signed a letter to US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) urging him to \"reset and repair\" the India-US \"critical partnership\".\n\nThe letter was also signed by several prominent Democratic leaders, including Deborah Ross, Ro Khanna, Brad Sherman, Raja Krishnamoorthi, and Pramila Jayapal.\n\nThe lawmakers called on Trump to \"review\" his tariff policy and continue \"dialogue with the Indian leadership\", stressing that the path forward \"demands recalibration, not confrontation\".\n\nKamlager-Dove said she was \"disappointed\" that not a single Republican lawmaker signed onto the letter, but not \"surprised\".\n\n\"Republicans in Congress are afraid to speak truth to Trump. And where were those voices during the Biden administration, when Republicans were also lauding the importance of the US-India relationship and asking us to do more,\" she told IANS.\n\nShe added that now Democrats have an \"outsized responsibility to remind the American people and also our international audiences that we in fact are the ones that care deeply about international relationships\".\n\nThe Congress member also revealed that she has \"authored an amendment through congressional process,\" demanding Trump attend the \"incredibly important\" Quad summit.\n\n\"Why do you have to tell a president to participate in and to attend a Quad Leadership Summit? That's about unity with our partners across the Indo-Pacific,\" she said.\n\nThe Quad Leaders' Summit, initially scheduled to be held in India later this year, is now expected to take place early next year.\n\nOn September 10, in a speech on the floor of the House, Kamlager-Dove had targeted the Trump administration's policy towards India, calling it \"reckless\".\n\n\"This partnership is too important to be sacrificed by Trump's ego and Republican complicity. Trump must reverse course, make a deal and fix the damage that he has caused. He needs to get his act together on behalf of this country and our relationship with India,\" she stressed.\n\nWhile speaking to IANS, the Congresswoman said that it was her responsibility as a ranking member of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia to \"speak up\" about the region and \"one of the most important relationships\" with India.\n\n\"I know that one of the most important relationships we have had in the past has been with India. I feel I have an obligation to talk about the strategic power coming from the region, and also the strategic possibilities that can continue with a strong bilateral relationship with India. So that is why I gave the speech; I continue to speak out on behalf of the US-India relationship. That's why I signed on to the letter,\" she emphasised.\n\nKamlager-Dove believed that India has the \"brain power\" to partner with the United States on critical technologies, but \"arbitrary policies\" like the crackdown on H-1B visas would \"hurt the US.\"\n\n\"We know that India has the innovation and the brain power that we're hopeful will help us in figuring out the innovations that come with AI. We have a president who has essentially turned the H-1B visa process into an arbitrary lottery, or it's almost like a bribe. It is going to do nothing but hurt the United States, which is continuing to try to be competitive and still needs international, global talent to help us do so. Because they are so highly skilled and incredibly desirable,\" she noted.\n\nThe Congresswoman warned that curtailing the visa program would drive Indian talent away from the US, undermining both American innovation and competitiveness.\n\n\"We could see fewer folks coming here to help us in the areas of medicine, entertainment and business. Those industries are incredibly important to my district, but also to the country, and we need to have more voices talking about this,\" she noted.\n\nOn September 19, US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation to significantly curtail the H-1B visa programme and imposed a hefty $100,000 visa application fee.\n\nKamlager-Dove also spoke about India's improving ties with China and its relations with Russia, calling it a consequence of a hostile US stance.\n\n\"I think it exemplifies what happens when you are soft on your adversaries and cruel to your partners. I cannot get upset with India for taking steps to remind the United States what we could lose. It pains me to say this, but I think India has a responsibility to its own people to make sure that it remains resilient, and sometimes that means going to other places that may not be our friends and creating relationships. I cannot fault India for taking steps that it needs to ensure its growth,\" she added.\n\nOn Trump's attempt to regain control of the strategic Bagram airbase in Afghanistan and the recent joint opposition of India, Pakistan and China to that effort, Kamlager-Dove argued that the Trump administration is \"actively continuing to isolate ourselves from partners that would normally want to work with us\".\n\nShe hoped that the US President \"can see the setbacks that he is causing\".\n\n\"Donald Trump was really handed a really good thing on a silver platter, and instead, he has chosen erratic, xenophobic, arbitrary, punitive measures and policies that are scaring our allies, and I have never seen a president who is cruel to his partners and sweet to his adversaries,\" she concluded.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Oct 9 (SocialNews.XYZ) Sydney Kamlager-Dove, the Democratic Congresswoman from California and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, has termed the Trump administration's tariffs on India \"incredibly unfortunate\" and advocated...\n\n\nThe post Trump&#8217;s tariffs on India &#8216;incredibly unfortunate&#8217;, says Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove (IANS Exclusive) appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/10/08/trumps-tariffs-on-india-incredibly-unfortunate-says-congresswoman-kamlager-dove-ians-exclusive/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09/202510093534564.jpg?fit=384%2C480&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1759971609","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:42:36","author":"Gopi","authors":["Gopi"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":367501252,"title":"Republican Rep.

Carlos Gimenez claimed the end of Nicolas Maduro's authoritarian rule in Venezuela is close to an end despite initiatives in the U.S. Congress to block the Trump administration from conducting strikes in the Caribbean.\n\n\"The narco terrorist Cartel de los Soles regime is on its knees. Dictator Nicolas Maduro is not going to get very far with his Marxist & apologist allies. Ignore the noise. The inevitable is near,\" said Gimenez, who has been vocally calling for the end of Maduro's rule since the Trump administration began its deployment of troops and assets off the Venezuelan coast.\n\nHowever, the deployment could face obstacles soon, as the deployment is facing opposition in Congress. On Tuesday, Republican Sen. Rand Paul said he will join Democratic colleagues in sponsoring a bill seeking to prevent the administration from conducting strikes on suspected drug boats in the region, a move officials say seeks to end a drug-trafficking route for the cartel linked to the Venezuelan regime.\n\n\"We can't have a policy where we just blow up ships where we don't even know the people's names,\" Paul said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \"It can't be the policy for drug interdiction, either in the country or outside the country,\" he added.\n\nPaul went on to say that previous Coast Guard interdictions didn't yield drugs about 25% of the time. \"So they have made an error, but they don't kill them. But we've blown up four boats now, and if the percentages hold true, did one of those four boats not have drug dealers on it?\" he wondered.\n\nIn this context, Paul will cosponsor a resolution invoking the 1973 War Powers Act, noting that the Trump administration can't launch strikes without approval from Congress. The resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing troops into hostilities and limits their duration to 60 days unless Congress authorizes further action.\n\nAt the same time, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff anticipated that he, along with colleague Tim Kaine, will force a vote to block the strikes. \"Congress has not authorized these strikes. They are illegal and risk dragging America into another war,\" Schiff said in a social media publication.\n\nDemocrats are increasingly voicing their opposition to the strikes in the public discourse.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said shortly after, “With God’s help, we’re bringing everyone home.” In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I am very proud to announce that both Israel and Hamas have signed the first stage of our peace plan. This means that all hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw its forces to the agreed line as a first step toward a strong, stable and lasting peace. All sides will be treated fairly! This is a great day for the Arab and Muslim world, for Israel, for all surrounding nations, and for the United States of America. We thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey who worked with us to make this historic and unprecedented event possible. Blessed are the peacemakers!” Before the announcement, Trump held a White House press conference where Secretary of State Marco Rubio handed him a note and whispered in his ear. Trump told reporters, “I just got a note saying we’re close to a deal in the Middle East. I’ll take a few more questions and then go—there are a few things I need to solve in the Middle East.” According to reports by the Associated Press and Sky News, the note referred to a request for Trump to approve a Truth Social post so that he could be the first to announce the Gaza deal. The Hezbollah-affiliated Lebanese network Al Mayadeen reported that Hamas agreed to the deal, citing “Palestinian resistance sources” who said the signing is expected Thursday in Egypt. A Hamas-linked source told Sky News Arabia that “the Gaza agreement is fully ready.” Saudi channel Al Hadath quoted sources saying Israel and Hamas will sign a cease-fire at noon, while Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that Palestinian factions approved the final text after revisions discussed in Sharm el-Sheikh. A Palestinian source told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that “the Sharm el-Sheikh meeting is still underway to finalize the wording before the official announcement. The remaining issues regarding Gaza have been resolved, and Trump will soon announce the agreement. Five crossings will immediately open to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and there are adjustments to Israel’s withdrawal map.” According to the same source, the agreement stipulates the release of 20 Israeli hostages alive in the first phase. It includes guarantees from the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that neither side will return to fighting as long as the terms are upheld. Trump is expected to declare it a permanent cease-fire to the war. “The agreement is in its final drafting stage before the announcement,” the source added. Israeli officials also expressed cautious optimism about a breakthrough that could end the war after more than two years. “We’re very close to a deal,” one source said. “It could happen tonight.” Footage shared by Arab media showed members of the Israeli, Hamas, Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish delegations smiling, shaking hands and embracing. A senior Israeli official estimated that the announcement could come Thursday or Friday as a gesture to Trump, who confirmed Ynet’s earlier report that he might visit the Middle East next week. If an agreement is reached in the coming days, hostage releases could begin early next week. White House spokesperson Caroline Levitt said Trump will undergo routine medical tests Thursday and is considering traveling to the Middle East shortly afterward. “Maybe I’ll go to the Middle East this week, maybe Sunday—to Egypt and other countries,” Trump told reporters before leaving the briefing room. A senior White House official told CNN that Trump is expected to post soon about the deal on Truth Social. “There’s great optimism,” an Israeli official told Ynet ahead of the possible announcement. “At this point, Hamas doesn’t have many options. There are still details to finalize, but we’re very optimistic—cautiously. We’re dealing with a terror organization that could backtrack at the last minute.” An Egyptian source close to the talks told Sky News Arabia that mediators gave both sides until Friday morning to sign the first phase of the agreement. Earlier Wednesday, before the note was passed to Trump, Rubio told reporters at the Capitol that “good progress” was being made in the Cairo negotiations.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas signed the first stage of his peace plan, saying all hostages will soon be freed and Israel will withdraw its forces as a first step toward lasting peace","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hj2krwe6xg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/09/HkN2hSvEaee/HkN2hSvEaee_0_0_1200_667_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:37:56","author":"Itamar Eichner, Lior Ben Ari, Einav Halabi","authors":["Itamar Eichner, Lior Ben Ari, Einav Halabi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.132},{"id":367500360,"title":"Trump Unveils Peace Agreement Between Israel and Hamas for Gaza","text":"President Donald Trump declared on Wednesday night that both Israel and Hamas had agreed to the ‘first phase’ of his suggested peace agreement – a significant move towards resolving the conflict in Gaza.\n\n‘This agreement indicates that ALL Hostages will be liberated shortly, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to a mutually decided line as initial steps towards a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,’ Trump announced on Truth Social.\n\n‘All Parties will be treated fairly!

I might do that,” Trump said in response to a reporter asking if he would consider going to Gaza to see what things are like on the ground. The president added, “I’ll be going to Egypt, most likely, that’s where everybody is gathered right now.” Trump will visit Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday for his routine yearly checkup, according to a statement from the White House, which noted the president will “consider going to the Middle East shortly thereafter.”\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nAssociated Press photographer Evan Vucci appeared to capture an image of the note Rubio handed to Trump. “Very close. We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first,” the note appeared to read.\n\nWhat Have Other Officials Said About Israel-Hamas Peace Talks?\n\nA senior Hamas official told AFP, “A spirit of optimism prevails among all,” making the comment after the militant group submitted a list of prisoners it wants released in the truce’s first phase. Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi said messages he has received about the peace deal were “very encouraging,” NBC News reported, noting Israel has not commented on Hamas’ statement.\n\nKey Background\n\nTrump’s 20-point peace plan has been mostly agreed to by Israel and partially agreed to by Hamas, with some disagreements materializing on the matters of disarmament and the future of Gaza’s governance and borders. The plan calls for Hamas to be disarmed, though the group has not indicated it intends to agree to disarmament, something it has said it would only do if a Palestinian state is established. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently said \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way.” Gaza will be transitionally governed by a “technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee” made up of “qualified Palestinians and international experts,” according to the plan. However, the committee will be overseen by a “Board of Peace” headed and chaired by Trump.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nRead Trump’s 20-point proposal to end the war in Gaza (AP)\n\nGot a tip?

The president made the announcement in a post to Truth Social Wednesday evening. \n\n“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan. This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” the president said. \n\n“All Parties will be treated fairly! This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”\n\nSoon after Trump’s post, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “With God's help we will bring them all home.” A spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry has affirmed Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement in the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump was handed a note by Secretary of State Marco Rubio during an event at the White House.\n\nTrump was taking questions from reporters during a roundtable with right-wing influencers when Rubio entered the room.\n\nAfter Trump invited him to sit at the table alongside several other White House staff, the ex-Florida senator approached the president and whispered something in his ear. He then sat down and wrote a note which he had passed to the president.\n\nTrump read the note, then told the assembled journalists and influencers that Rubio had informed him of new progress in talks that have been taking place in Egypt.\n\n“I was just given a note by the Secretary of State saying that we're very close to a deal in the Middle East, and they're going to need me pretty quickly,” Trump said.\n\nAccording to a photograph of the note, it read: “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”\n\nTrump had said an earlier delay in starting the event was caused by him “dealing with people from the Middle East” regarding talks over the 20-point proposal which Hamas had partly accepted on Friday, just days after he unveiled it alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week.\n\nHe said the peace talks, which are being attended by representatives of Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and other Arab states as well as Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law and former adviser Jared Kushner, were “very close” to resulting in a deal “sometime towards the end of the week.”\n\nWitkoff and Kushner both arrived in Egypt on Wednesday as Israel and Hamas exchanged lists of prisoners and hostages to be released as part of a potential agreement.\n\n“We have a great team over there, great negotiators, and they're, unfortunately, great negotiators on the other side also, but it's something I think that will happen,” Trump said. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday, actually, and we'll see. But there's a very good chance negotiations are going along very well.”\n\nThe president later teased the possibility of traveling to Gaza to view the damage wrought there by two years of Israeli bombardment when asked if he’d consider visiting the war-torn territory.\n\n“Yeah, I would. I might do that. I may do that. We haven't decided exactly,” he said. \n\n“I'll be going to Egypt ... that's where everybody is gathered right now ... but I'll be making the rounds as the expression goes. I probably will,” he added. \n\nShortly afterwards, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put out a statement reading: “On Friday morning, President Trump will visit Walter Reed Medical Center for a planned meeting and remarks with the troops. While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly check up. He will then return to the White House. President Trump is considering going to the Middle East shortly thereafter.”\n\nIsrael launched its military attack on Gaza two years ago this week, following the Hamas terror attacks on October 7, 2023, which left nearly 1,200 Israelis dead and some 250 kidnapped. Since then, the Israeli military has killed more than 67,000 people, including at least 19,000 children, according to local officials, and destroyed much of the enclave.\n\nAccording to Hamas representatives, the indirect talks thus far have been focused on their demands for halting the conflict, withdrawing Israeli forces from Gaza and the proposed prisoner swap with Israel. \n\nThe group has so far refused to discuss one of the biggest sticking points: Israel's demand that Hamas give up its weapons, which the Palestinian source said Hamas would reject as long as Israeli troops occupy Palestinian land.\n\nThe list of Palestinians Hamas wants freed is expected to include some of the most prominent prisoners jailed by Israel, whose release had been off limits in previous ceasefires.\n\nAccording to a Palestinian source close to the talks, the list includes Marwan al-Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah movement, and Ahmed Saadat, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. \n\nBoth are serving multiple life sentences for attacks that killed Israelis.\n\nDespite Trump’s demand that Israel stop bombing Gaza last week, Israeli Defense Forces have only turned down the intensity of their campaign. \n\nGaza medical authorities reported eight people killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, the lowest toll for weeks.\n\nSamantha Beech and Sam Rkaina contributed reporting.","summary":"President says he could visit Gaza as part of a trip to seal the peace deal this weekend","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-israel-gaza-deal-b2842111.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/08/23/54/SEI269526590.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FCccVbkZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:27:18","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":367497350,"title":"IPO: India's record-setting fundraising spree is raising thorny questions","text":"Besides high demand for new investment opportunities, the market is on fire also because India's growth over the past decade has birthed a strong pipeline of companies across diverse industries that have reached a certain scale and maturity, according to Abhinav Bharti, head of India equity capital markets at US investment banking giant JP Morgan.\n\n\"This is just the start of the trend, and we should see India to be a regular $20bn IPO market on an ongoing basis, if not higher,\" Mr Bharti said on the company's YouTube channel.\n\nBut while this wave of new share offerings signals a maturing of India's investing landscape, the euphoria also demands caution, experts say.\n\n\"There's a lot of exuberance.

Now, more than 40 school board members from districts across the state have now openly supported complying with the DOE as the deadline nears. The school board members penned a letter to state leaders in Saint Paul earlier this week – Education Commissioner Willie Jett, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and executive director of the Minnesota State High School League Erich Martens – urging them to comply with President Donald Trump's administration on the issue. \"How are we protecting all students in our district. So, whether it’s in the locker rooms or on the playing field,\" wrote Lisa Atkinson, a member of the Prior Lake Savage Area Schools Board. \"As school districts, we cannot risk the loss in funding. It’s really that important to us. This is an opportunity for our state to figure out a way to put in policies that really protect all students.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The board members also expressed anxiety over federal funding cuts \"that would adversely affect educational programs, extracurricular activities and resources for over 875,000 students statewide.\" Trump's Feb. 5 \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order states that schools who allow biological males to compete in girls' sports will be subject to federal funding freezes. Ellison, who has been a staunch supporter of trans athletes in girls' sports and has even filed a lawsuit against Trump and the U.S. Department of Justice for its recent Title IX enforcement efforts, responded to the letter in a statement. \"School sports aren’t just a good way to get exercise, they help kids build friendships, make them feel like they belong, and teach them important life lessons, like how to work as a team, how to treat their competition with respect, and how to win with grace and lose with dignity. Letting the very small number of transgender students in Minnesota play on their school sports teams doesn't harm anyone, but segregating them does. Exclusion is a violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which has protected the rights of trans kids to participate in all extracurricular activities for decades,\" Ellison said, via Fox 9. \"I too am concerned about the Trump Administration’s threats to cut education funding for kids across Minnesota, but this matter is before the court right now. The federal government's threats violate the U.S. Constitution, Minnesota law, and Title IX itself. I’m fighting to prevent these harmful cuts, stop the Administration's bullying of transgender kids who just want to live their lives in peace, and protect the rights and freedoms of all our students in Minnesota.\" INSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS Meanwhile, multiple girls' athletes have taken action to try and push their state to change its policies as well. Three anonymous girls' softball players have filed a lawsuit against state agencies after having to face a trans pitcher from Champlin Park High School last season. The trans pitcher, Marissa Rothenberger, led Champlin Park to a state championship in the spring, with one of the best playoff stat lines in all of Minnesota. \"It’s really upsetting to know that [Ellison] isn’t taking rights of girls and women seriously. He is allowing boys to compete with girls, and it is not safe and completely unfair. To know that AG Ellison is in complete support of letting boys and men take advantage of females in sports is absolutely disgusting and wrong,\" one anonymous player previously told Fox News Digital. Meanwhile, former White Bear Lake High School softball player Kendall Kotzmacher has publicly spoken out against the state and Gov. Tim Walz for letting males play in girls' sports, especially after Walz himself coached high school football decades ago, and saw the physical prowess of male athletes up-close. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"As a coach, you should see the differences and the vast difference that there are between biological males and biological females,\" Kotzmacher told Fox News Digital. The state legislature failed to pass a bill that would have banned trans athletes from girls' sports, the \"Preserving Girls' Sports Act,\" back in March. It fell one vote shy of advancing to Walz's desk. Meanwhile, state lawmaker Rep. Liish Kozlowski, who identifies as \"non-binary,\" called the bill \"another version of state-sanctioned bullying and genocide.\" Follow Fox News Digital’s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.","summary":"School board members across Minnesota warn of federal funding loss affecting 875,000 students if state doesn&apos;t comply with Trump&apos;s trans sports executive order.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/minnesota-leadership-faces-calls-from-schools-protect-girls-sports-trumps-title-ix-deadline-looms","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/tim-walz-kendall-kotzmacher-donald-trump1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:20:54","author":"Jackson Thompson","authors":["Jackson Thompson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.094},{"id":367502320,"title":"Israel and Hamas agree to ‘first phase’ of plan to end fighting and release hostages, Trump says","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of his peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners.\n\n“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” Trump wrote late Wednesday.\n\nThe war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians.

The president said Wednesday that Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for failing to support federal agents, and continued to paint a dark and violent picture of both Chicago and Portland, Ore., where Trump is trying to send federal troops but has so far been stonewalled by the courts. \"It's so bad,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday. \"It's so crazy. It's like the movies ... where you have these bombed-out cities and these bombed-out people. It's worse than that. I don't think they can make a movie as bad.\" Pritzker this week characterized Trump's depiction of Chicago as \"deranged\" and untrue. Federal agents are making the community \"less safe,\" the governor said, noting that residents do not want \"Donald Trump to occupy their communities\" and that people of color are fearful of being profiled during immigration crackdowns. Trump has taken issue with Democrats in Illinois and Oregon who are fighting his efforts, and has twice said this week that he is willing to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 if local leaders and the courts try to stop him. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also contended this week that a court ruling blocking Trump's deployments to Portland amounted to a \"legal insurrection\" as well as \"an insurrection against the laws and Constitution of the United States.\" In a televised interview Monday, Miller was asked about his remarks and asked whether the administration would abide by court rulings that stop the deployment of troops to Illinois and Portland. Miller responded by saying the president has \"plenary authority\" before going silent midsentence — a moment that the host said may have been a technical issue. \"Plenary authority\" is a legal term that indicates someone has limitless power. The legality of deployments to Portland and Chicago will face scrutiny in two federal courts Thursday. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear an appeal by the Trump administration in the Portland matter. A Trump-appointed judge, Karin Immergut, found the White House had not only violated the law in activating the Oregon National Guard, but it also had further defied the law by attempting to circumvent her order, sending the California National Guard in its place. That three-judge appellate panel consists of two Trump appointees and one Clinton appointee. Meanwhile, in Illinois, U.S. District Judge April Perry declined Monday to block the deployment of National Guard members on an emergency basis, allowing a buildup of forces to proceed. She will hear arguments Thursday on the legality of the operation. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of Trump's top political foes, has joined the fight against the president's deployment efforts. The Trump administration sent 14 members of California's National Guard to Illinois to train troops from other states, according to court records filed Tuesday. Federal officials have also told California they intend to extend Trump's federalization of 300 members of the state's Guard through next year. “Trump is going on a cross-country crusade to sow chaos and division,\" Newsom said Wednesday. “His actions — and those of his Cabinet — are against our deeply held American values. He needs to stop this illegal charade now.” By Wednesday evening, there were few signs of National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago. But troops from other states, including Texas' National Guard, were waiting on the sidelines at an Army Reserve Center in Illinois as early as Tuesday. In anticipation of the deployment, Pritzker warned that if the president's efforts went unchecked, it would put the United States on a \"the path to full-blown authoritarianism.\" The Democratic governor also said the president's calls to jail him were \"unhinged\" and said Trump was a \"wannabe dictator.\" \"There is one thing I really want to say to Donald Trump: If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me,\" Pritzker said in an interview with MSNBC. As tensions grew in Chicago, Trump hosted an event at the White House to address how he intends to crack down on antifa, a nebulous left-wing anti-facist movement that he recently designated as a domestic terrorist organization.

And on Wednesday the 'God Bless the USA' singer told TMZ he would relish the opportunity.\n\nGreenwood said that, given Bad Bunny is already confirmed for halftime, he could fire up fans before the game instead. \n\nCountry legend Lee Greenwood has said he would love to perform at the Super Bowl\n\nHouse speaker Mike Johnson called for Greenwood to replace Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LX\n\n'It sounds like a terrible decision in my view,' Johnson said about the choice of Bad Bunny\n\nBad Bunny - who was born Benito Antonio Martinez - previously cited ICE agents as a reason he did not include any mainland US dates for his upcoming tour. And, on Tuesday, Johnson branded the Puerto Rican a 'terrible' choice. \n\nBad Bunny is among the most streamed artists on Spotify but Johnson claimed 'it sounds like he's not someone who appeals to a broader audience.'\n\nThe house speaker told Migrant Insider: 'I didn't even know who Bad Bunny was. But it sounds like a terrible decision in my view from what I'm hearing.'\n\n'It sounds like he's not someone who appeals to a broader audience and there are so many eyes on the Super Bowl - a lot of young, impressionable children. \n\n'And, in my view, you would have Lee Greenwood or Role Models doing that. Not somebody like this.' \n\nGreenwood recently appeared on stage with Trump at the memorial service for Charlie Kirk. The 82-year-old is no stranger to NFL games, having performed the national anthem or 'God Bless the USA' at stadiums across the country.\n\nGreenwood is reportedly set to play a halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys' Monday Night Football clash against the Arizona Cardinals on November 3.\n\nThe country singer's team told TMZ he has no ill-feelings towards Bad Bunny. But Greenwood is nevertheless reportedly frustrated at how divided the country has become over the halftime show. \n\nDonald Trump called the decision to give the show to the Puerto Rican rapper 'crazy'\n\nThe president told Newsmax that he was unfamiliar with the 31-year-old musician (right)\n\nTrump addressed the Bad Bunny controversy earlier this week, telling Newsmax: 'I have never heard of him, I don't know who he is, I don't know why they're doing it, it's crazy... I think it's absolutely ridiculous.'\n\nThe president's ally Corey Lewandowski, meanwhile, previously called it 'so shameful' that 'they picked someone who seems to hate America.'\n\nLewandowski also confirmed that ICE agents will be patrolling San Francisco during the Super Bowl. \n\n'There is nowhere you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally,' he said. 'Not the Super Bowl and nowhere else. We will find and deport you. That is a very real situation.' \n\nBad Bunny was the host of 'Saturday Night Live' over the weekend and, during his opening monologue, the Puerto Rican addressed his haters.\n\n'You might not know this but I'm doing the Super Bowl halftime show and I'm very happy and I think everyone is happy about it - even Fox News,' Bad Bunny said.\n\nA heavily-edited clip then played, stitching together the comments of various Fox anchors and pundits so that they said: 'Bad Bunny is my favorite musician and he should be the next president.'\n\nHe continued: 'Thank you. Wow, thank you. But really, I am very excited to be doing the Super Bowl and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy.'\n\nGreenwood is reportedly set to play a halftime show at the Dallas Cowboys on November 3\n\nThe rapper than spoke in Spanish for several seconds before finishing his monologue by saying: 'If you did not understand what I just said... you have four months to learn!'\n\nIn the Spanish portion of his monologue, Bad Bunny took another shot at his critics and thanked those who paved the way for him. \n\n'Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors,' he said.\n\n'It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.'\n\nMike JohnsonBad Bunny\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nLee Greenwood speaks out after being tipped to replace Bad Bunny for Super Bowl halftime show\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Puerto Rican artist is set to perform at next year's end-of-season showpiece at Levi's Stadium - despite a backlash from Donald Trump and his allies.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15175465/Lee-Greenwood-speaks-replace-Bad-Bunny-Super-Bowl-halftime-show.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/08/23/102826241-0-image-m-9_1759963127649.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:09:17","author":"Daniel Matthews,Editor","authors":["Daniel Matthews","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":367500352,"title":"Trump confirms peace deal in Israel: ‘ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon’","text":"One day after the two year anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack against Israel, President Donald Trump announced a peace deal to free the remaining hostages has finally been accepted.\n\n“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on Truth Social.\n\n“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.

But the agreement nonetheless marked the most momentous development since a deal in January and February that involved the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe deal was solidified in Egypt after days of negotiations centered on a Trump-backed peace plan that he hopes will ultimately result in a permanent end to the war and bring about a sustainable peace in the region.\n\nThe war began with Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, many of them civilians, and took 251 hostage.

During a roundtable discussion on antifa, Trump said flag burnings often provoke chaos and violence. “We took the freedom of speech away, because that’s been through the courts, and the courts said you have freedom of speech, but what has happened is when they burn the flag it agitates and irritates crowds,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like it, on both sides, and you end up with riots,” he said. Trump made the remarks after referencing conservative influencer Nick Sortor, who he said was attacked while trying to stop a flag burning at a protest. He also cited his August 25 executive order, which directed federal authorities to prosecute those involved in flag burnings. The order described the American flag as “our most sacred and cherished symbol” and said its desecration is “uniquely offensive and provocative.” The Supreme Court first ruled that flag burning is protected symbolic speech in the 1989 Texas v. Johnson case, when activist Gregory Lee Johnson burned the flag to protest then-President Ronald Reagan’s policies. The court said the First Amendment covers not only spoken or written words but also expressive acts, including flag burning. Despite that ruling, Trump reiterated his long-held stance that burning the U.S. flag should not be protected speech. “When you burn an American flag, you incite tremendous violence,” he said, arguing that such acts risk public safety. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson later clarified that Trump “will always protect the First Amendment” but also intends to “prevent violence and chaos.” She said the president “will not allow the American flag, a symbol of our country’s greatness, to be used as a tool to incite violence.” Attorney General Pam Bondi supported the president’s view, claiming that the administration could still prosecute flag burnings “without running afoul of the First Amendment.” Hours after Trump signed the executive order in August, a man was arrested outside the White House for burning a flag. The U.S. Park Police said the arrest was for violating fire safety rules under the National Park Service’s regulations, not for speech itself.

While there, President Trump will stop by for his routine yearly checkup,\" Leavitt said Wednesday.\nThe doctor's visit will mark the second such annual medical appointment this year for Trump - who reported feeling \"in very good shape\" after his annual visit in April.\nAt the time of that checkup, Leavitt said all of Trump's test results \"were within normal limits,\" and he had a \"normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness\".\nAt 79, Trump is the oldest serving US president, and has frequently boasted of his vigor, especially in comparison to his adversary, former president Joe Biden.\nTrump has repeatedly been accused of a lack of openness about his health despite huge interest in the well-being of America's commander-in-chief.\nIn September, he dismissed social media rumors swirling about his health - including false posts that he had died.\nIn July, the White House said Trump was diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition - chronic venous insufficiency - following speculation about his bruised hand and swollen legs.\nThe hand issue, Leavitt has previously said, was linked to the aspirin he takes as part of a \"standard\" cardiovascular health program.","summary":"The doctor's visit will mark the second such annual medical appointment for the US president this year.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/10/09/trump-to-have-routine-medical-check-on-friday","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/e84471c1-donald-trump-epa-images-pic-240625-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:02:07","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.507},{"id":367496132,"title":"Israel and Hamas agree to ‘first phase’ of plan to end Gaza fighting, says Trump","text":"Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of Donald Trump’s peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, the US president said.\n\n“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” Mr Trump wrote.","summary":"Israel and Hamas have agreed to the “first phase” of Donald Trump’s peace plan to pause fighting and release at least some hostages and prisoners, ...","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41720562.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9626/4813491_1_seoimage1x1_234ff479f43843708cf4b90348d90793.jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-08 23:02:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Samy Magdy, Associated Press","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Samy Magdy, Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.643}]}
