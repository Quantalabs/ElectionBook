While he acknowledged that Donald Trump’s plan could act as a starting point for future negotiations, he coupled that openness with explicit military threats against Ukraine.,Russia has also confirmed that Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to visit Moscow next week.,Speaking at a press conference in Kyrgyzstan, Putin was asked about Trump’s proposal, portions of which have been leaked or circulated.,He confirmed that a “variant” of the plan discussed by the United States and Ukraine in Geneva had been passed on to Moscow and noted that Washington had, to some extent, factored in Russia’s position.,Also Read| Meet Steve Witkoff: The Gaza Peace Deal Architect Now Pushing for Ukraine Ceasefire,“In principle, we agree that this could serve as a basis for future agreements,” he said, while emphasising that several key points still require negotiation. He added that he is prepared to engage in talks with the United States at any time.,But Putin quickly coupled this with an ultimatum for Ukraine. He insisted that “Ukrainian troops must withdraw from the territories they currently hold” for the fighting to stop. If Kyiv refuses, he warned, Russia will pursue its objectives “by armed means.”,He went so far as to label Ukraine’s leadership illegitimate, pointing to Kyiv’s decision not to hold elections after President Volodymyr Zelensky’s term expired. Putin argued that this made it “legally impossible to sign any agreement with Ukraine.”,He also stressed that the international community must acknowledge Russia’s territorial gains in Ukraine.,The US-backed proposal -- which Trump recently touted as making “tremendous progress” -- has faced sharp criticism for being “tilted toward Russian demands.” Opponents, including figures in both Trump’s Republican Party and the Democratic opposition, have dismissed the leaked plan as little more than a “Russian wish list.”,Reports suggest the plan has since been moderated. The earlier version called for significant territorial concessions by Ukraine -- including surrendering the entire Donbas region to Russia and recognising Moscow’s effective control over Crimea -- effectively freezing the conflict along current frontlines in areas such as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.,(With inputs from Reuters),Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"Vladimir Putin responded cautiously to a US-backed peace initiative for Ukraine, acknowledging it as a potential starting point but coupling his acceptance with military threats.","url":"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/putin-warms-to-trumps-peace-plan-but-is-his-ultimatum-a-dealbreaker-for-ukraine-article-153215496","image":"https://images.timesnownews.com/thumb/msid-153215505,thumbsize-37850,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-3/153215505.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 01:01:34","author":"Megha Rawat","authors":["Megha Rawat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":382901238,"title":"US-South African relations deteriorating for long: Former Polish Ambassador on Trump's G20 ban","text":"Warsaw [Poland], November 28 (ANI): Adam Burakowski, Associate Professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences and Former Ambassador of Poland to India and South Africa, said that the relations between South Africa and the United States (US) have been deteriorating for a long time and were not initiated during Donald Trump's tenure. Speaking to ANI, Burakowski argued that Trump merely continued on the line of the previous administration, but with additional points given his accusations of South Africa \"disrespecting human rights\" of the white minority population residing there.\"The US-South African relations have been deteriorating for a long time. It didn't just start during Trump's term. When he became President, he continued the previous administration's line but added some very important points. First is the accusation of Donald Trump against South Africa of not respecting the human rights of the white minority population in South Africa, the associate professor said.He held Billionaire Elon Musk responsible for Trump's \"harsh\" statement against South Africa's current government. Musk hails from South Africa and has been critical of the regime there.One South African person has played an important role in the Donald Trump administration. Elon Musk. He was born in South Africa, and he is interested in South African politics. He's very critical of South Africa's current government, and he influenced Donald Trump to make even more severe statements about this relationship,\" Burakowski said.He further argued that India continues to play a key role in the Group of 20, where it has presented itself as a \"dynamic country\" during its G20 presidency.Burakowski said that India's proposal for the African Union to be a permanent member of the G20 was accepted in 2023, which allowed the latter full rights. He added that India's initiative reflected its desire to be the voice of the global south in the G20.\"India continues to play a very important role in the G20. We should remember that when India held the G20 presidency, it was a major event. India presented itself to the world as a very dynamic country. India proposed that the African Union be a permanent member of the G20, a proposal that was finally accepted. So in the G20 summit in Johannesburg, we had the African Union as a full member with full rights. This was the initiative of India because India wants to play the role of the voice of the global south in the G20,\" the Professor said.During this Johannesburg summit of G20, we saw that the PM Narendra Modi was very active, meeting many people, and also meeting with the Indian community in South Africa and playing one of the major roles in this whole summit,\" he added.

More than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled in the US under both Operation Allies Welcome and the program that replaced it, known as Enduring Welcome, according to the State Department.\n\nMost Afghans who arrived under Operation Allies Welcome were allowed to enter and remain in the US for two years without permanent immigration status. More than 40 per cent of those admitted to the program were eligible for Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) because they took great risks to help the US, or were related to someone who did, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a statement to Fox News Wednesday, Ratcliffe said, \"The Biden administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the US government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Aussie scientists find bizarre construction use for coffee grounds\n\nA senior US official told CNN Lakanwal began working with the CIA around 2011 and, at the time, the agency would have conducted extensive vetting through a variety of databases – including the National Counterterrorism Centre database – to determine if Lakanwal had any known ties to terrorist groups.\n\nAfghans admitted to the US under Operation Allies Welcome underwent extensive vetting, despite claims to the contrary by Trump and his allies at the time. The official told CNN Lakanwal would have been among those vetted again in 2021 before being allowed to enter the US under the program.\n\n\"In terms of vetting, nothing came up,\" the senior US official said. \"He was clean on all checks.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Hong Kong fire death toll hits 83, flames still burn in buildings\n\nNational Guard members identified\n\nA small memorial now marks the spot where two West Virginia National Guard members were shot on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) near the White House.\n\nPirro said, as it stands, Lakanwal will be charged with assault with intent to kill and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. He faces 15 years in prison under the assault with the intent to kill charge, she said.\n\nHowever, she added, those charges could change depending on the wellbeing and recovery of the injured Guard members.\n\n\"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,\" she said.\n\nAt a separate news conference on Thursday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the administration will do \"everything in our power\" to seek the death penalty following the shooting.\n\nShe added at a minimum, the alleged suspect could face \"life in prison with terrorism charges.\"\n\nGuard members ambushed, officials say\n\nSince the shooting, Pirro said, investigators across multiple agencies have worked around the clock to learn more about the alleged gunman.\n\nShe said Lakanwal resided in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and children.\n\n\"What we know about him is that he drove his vehicle across country from the state of Washington with the intended target of coming to our nation's capital,\" Pirro said.\n\n\"A lone gunman opened fire without provocation, ambush-style, armed with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver.\"\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel said the motive for the attack remains under investigation, but the shooting is being treated as an act of terrorism.\n\nWednesday's attack took place around 2.15pm (US Eastern Time) in Farragut Square, a tourist-heavy area near the White House.\n\nThe two National Guard members were performing \"high visibility patrols\" when the suspect approached, raised a gun and started shooting at them, Executive Assistant Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department Jeffery Carroll said at a news conference following the attack.\n\nCarroll said after \"some back and forth,\" fellow Guard members were \"able to subdue\" the suspect and take him into custody. Emergency services responded to provide first aid, Carroll said. The suspect and the wounded National Guard members were taken to local hospitals, he added.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Trump asked for 500 more National Guard troops to be deployed to the nation's capital, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said.\n\nTrump ramps up anti-immigration rhetoric\n\nAs a multi-agency investigation into the shooting begins, Trump and his administration have begun ramping up the anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nIn a video address from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump blamed the Biden administration for bringing the alleged shooter to the US and argued the attack \"underscores the single greatest national security threat facing our nation.\"\n\nTrump lamented what he described as \"20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners\" who entered the US during his predecessor's administration, casting it \"a risk to our very survival.\"\n\nTrump vowed to \"re-examine every single alien who has entered our country under Biden,\" a process that has already begun, as CNN reported earlier this week.\n\nShortly after Trump's address, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it had stopped processing immigration cases related to Afghan immigrants \"pending further review of security and vetting protocols.\"\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

As with any building, there is a conversation between the principal and the architect.\"\n\n \"All parties are excited to execute on the President’s vision on what will be the greatest addition to the [White House] since the Oval Office,\" they add.\n\n McCrery previously called the project a \"beautiful and necessary renovation to The People's House.\"\n\n The building of the ballroom was first announced in a July press release. At the time, it was called a \"much-needed and exquisite addition\" that would rest on top of the now-demolished East Wing.\n\n White House officials previously said Trump wanted the larger space because guests had to use a \"large and unsightly tent\" at events that were held outside the White House building.\n\n \"The White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, its theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical,\" the release said.\n\n Trump’s plan for the multi-million-dollar undertaking includes a sprawling great room and elaborate gold details. \n\n The ballroom will also feature gold chandeliers, an ornate coffered ceiling, Greek Corinthian columns and tall, arched windows on each wall, in addition to room for a number of round tables and gold chairs.\n\n During a Nov. 4 appearance on the Today show, former first lady Michelle Obama and host Jenna Bush Hager, the daughter of former president George W.

As part of a Thanksgiving call to US troops, Trump said he had just learned that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had died, while Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, 24, was fighting for his life. \"She&apos;s just passed away,\" Trump said. \"She&apos;s no longer with us. She&apos;s looking down at us right now. Her parents are with her.\" The president called Beckstrom an \"incredible person, outstanding in every single way\". Trump used the announcement to say the shooting allegedly by Rahmanullah Lakanwal was a terrorist attack as he criticised the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with US forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the US without, in his opinion, sufficient vetting. \"This atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country,\" Trump said. \"For the most part, we don&apos;t want them.\" Trump also suggested the shooter was mentally unstable after the war and departure from Afghanistan. \"He went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts,\" the president said. \"It happens too often with these people.\" Earlier, US officials said Afghan national Lakanwal, 29, who worked with the CIA in his native country and immigrated to the US in 2021, drove from Washington state to the nation&apos;s capital before the shooting. The suspect had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to two sources, and #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the US during the two-decade war. Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for Columbia, said Lakanwal launched an \"ambush-style\" attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver on Wednesday local time. The suspect currently faces charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Pirro said it&apos;s too soon to say what the suspect&apos;s motives were. \"We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree. But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge.\" The suspect who was in custody also was shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement official. A resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal&apos;s cousin said Lakanwal and his brother had worked in a special Afghan Army unit known as Zero Units in the southern province of Kandahar. CIA director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Lakanwal&apos;s relationship with the US government ended shortly following the chaotic evacuation of American troops from Afghanistan. Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord. In a video message released on social media, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who entered under the Biden administration. Director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow said in a social media post Trump had directed him to review the green cards of people from countries \"of concern\". Edlow didn&apos;t name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the US by citizens of 12 nations and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.

He was in hospital under heavy guard on Thursday, and Trump said he was in serious condition.The alleged assailant, who lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, appeared to have acted alone, said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.

If they can't love our country, we don't want them,\" the President said.\n\nScrutiny on immigration status of every permanent resident or “Green Card” \n\nJoseph Edlow, Trump's director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said on Thursday that he had ordered a \"full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.\"\n\nHis agency later pointed to a list of 19 countries -- including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar -- facing U.S. travel restrictions under a previous order from Mr. Trump in June.\n\nThe incident brings together three politically explosive issues: Trump's controversial use of the military at home, immigration, and the legacy of the U.S. war in Afghanistan.\n\nGunned down in 'brazen' attack \n\nSarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard members shot in Washington on Wednesday, has died, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday (November 27, 2025).\n\nThe U.S. attorney for Washington DC, Jeanine Pirro, said the suspected assailant -- identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal -- had been living in the western state of Washington and had driven across the country to the nation's capital.\n\nIn what she called a \"brazen and targeted\" attack, Ms. Pirro said the gunman opened fire with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver on a group of guardsmen on patrol on Wednesday just a few blocks shy of the White House.\n\nThe suspect was charged with three counts of assault with intent to kill -- charges that Ms. Pirro said would immediately be upgraded to first-degree murder if any of the guardsmen died.\n\nOfficials said they still had no clear understanding of the motive behind the shooting.\n\nCIA director John Ratcliffe said the suspect had been part of a CIA-backed \"partner force\" fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, and had been brought to the United States as part of a program to evacuate Afghans who had worked with the agency.\n\nMr. Trump has deployed troops to several cities, all run by Democrats, including Washington, Los Angeles and Memphis. The move has prompted multiple lawsuits and allegations of authoritarian overreach by the White House.\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday's shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced 500 more troops would deploy to Washington, bringing the total to 2,500. This despite a federal judge last week ordering a temporary suspension of the deployment on the grounds that it was likely illegal.\n\n Afghan legacy \n\nThe heads of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and other senior Trump appointees all insisted that Lakanwal had been granted unvetted access to the United States because of lax asylum policies in the wake of the chaotic final U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan under former president Joe Biden.\n\nBut AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the United States after the military withdrawal, said they undergo \"some of the most extensive security vetting\" of any migrants.\n\nThe group noted Lakanwal had been granted asylum in April 2025, under the Trump administration, and would be eligible to request permanent residency a year later.\n\n\"This individual's isolated and violent act should not be used as an excuse to define or diminish an entire community,\" said its president, Shawn VanDiver.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-orders-review-of-immigrant-visas-after-national-guard-attack/article70333187.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/afxinc/article70333188.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-11-28T001128Z_151950780_RC2B5IAXXMR0_RTRMADP_3_USA-THANKSGIVING-TRUMP.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28

and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the president had directed him to conduct “a full-scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern”.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the agency pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of an Afghan national allegedly shooting two National Guard troops in Washington DC on Wednesday, gravely injuring them both.\n\nThe suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021 under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans in the wake of America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the shooting underlined a major national security threat.\n\nEdlow’s social media post on Thursday about the sweeping green card review did not explictly mention that attack.\n\n“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” said Edlow.\n\nThere were no further details about what the re-examination would look like.\n\nThe June proclamation his agency highlighted to the BBC set out an aim to restrict foreign nationals from entering the US to protect from “foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”.\n\nThe administration said security concerns and the overstay rate of business, student and tourists visas were among the reasons for a country to make the list.\n\n“The Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) group, controls Afghanistan,” the proclamation said. “Afghanistan lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and it does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures.”\n\nOther countries whose green card holders will undergo this examination include Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo and Libya.\n\nThe Wednesday attack on members of the US military prompted a forceful response from Trump.\n\n“This attack underscores the greatest national security threat facing our nation,” the president said. “The last administration let in 20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world, from places that you don’t even want to know about. No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival.”\n\nLast week, the same agency behind the green card review, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced a review of all refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, with Citizenship and Immigration Services saying the decision was made pending a review of “security and vetting protocols”.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.","summary":"The Trump administration has said it will re-examine green cards issued to individuals who immigrated to the US from 19 countries.

'terror attack.'\n\nThe 20-year-old was ambushed alongside fellow West Virginia National Guard member Andrew Wolfe while on duty near the White House on Wednesday night.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Trump told reporters she had tragically succumbed to her injuries. \n\n'Just seconds before I went on, right now, I heard that Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we were talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person... outstanding in every way, she's just passed away,' he said.\n\n'She's no longer with us. She's looking down on us right now. Her parents are with her. It's just happened. She was savagely attacked, she's dead.'\n\nTrump went on to say Beckstrom was 'an incredible person. Outstanding in every single way, department. 'Just horrible,' he added.\n\nAfghan suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, is currently in custody while hospitalized with non-life-threatening wounds allegedly sustained in the shootout. \n\nBeckstrom's devastated father, Gary, had earlier revealed she would not survive her injuries.\n\n'She has a mortal wound, it's not going to be a recovery,' he told The New York Times, speaking from her bedside. 'I'm holding her hand right now.' \n\nWest Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey said Beckstrom's death was 'not the result we hoped for, but it is the result we all feared. \n\n'Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation,' he wrote in a moving tribute to X.\n\n'She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard. \n\n'Today, we honor her bravery and her sacrifice as we mourn the loss of a young woman who gave everything she had in defense of others.'\n\nHe vowed to 'forever hold her family, her friends, and her fellow Guardsmen in our prayers as they grieve what no family should ever have to bear.'\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth also offered condolences to the family on Thanksgiving, writing: 'An American hero, at home with the LORD. RIP, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. May our nation kneel in prayer for her family.' \n\nSuspect Lakanwal arrived in America in 2021 as part of the disastrous US withdrawal in Afghanistan after serving as an ally of Special Forces troops in his CIA-backed 'Zero Unit.' \n\nHe applied for asylum in 2024 after his temporary visa lapsed, and in April 2025, it was granted by the Trump administration.\n\nOn Thursday, a longtime friend shared details about his mental health battle struggling with the horrors he saw and violence he carried out as part of his duty within the unit.\n\n'When he saw blood, bodies, and the wounded, he could not tolerate it,' the childhood friend told The New York Times.\n\n'It put a lot of pressure on his mind.'\n\nThe father-of-five was part of the elite paramilitary outfit which engaged in combat with the Taliban during the war in Afghanistan, often referred to as a 'death squad.'\n\nLakanwal allegedly shot the National Guard soldiers just 800 yards from the White House on Wednesday. \n\nThe suspect drove across the country from his home in Bellingham, Washington state, where he lived with his wife and five children near the Canadian border, authorities said.\n\nThe soldiers were shot by a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver. \n\nDC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said that she believed the two 'were sworn in' to National Guard duty 'less than 24 hours before they were shot on the street.'\n\nLakanwal initially faced charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.\n\nBut Pirro vowed those charges would be upgraded to murder in the first degree if either of his alleged victims did not survive.\n\n'We are praying that they survive and that the highest charge will not have to be murder in the first degree,' she said prior to Beckstrom's death.\n\n'But make no mistake, if they do not, that will certainly be the charge.","summary":"The 20-year-old was 'ambushed' alongside fellow West Virginia National Guard member Andrew Wolfe while on duty near the White House on Wednesday night.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15333463/national-guard-sarah-beckstrom-dead-washington-dc.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/27/23/104247707-0-image-m-156_1764287767207.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/27/4514660270682259423/1024x576_MP4_4514660270682259423.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:27:09","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":382897262,"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio, 51, rings in Thanksgiving with girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 27 and BFF Tobey Maguire","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Nov 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBritish father, 28, died in front of his partner and four-month-old baby in Dubai when 'speeding' jetski crashed into him, inquest hears\n\nHoliday lodges mysteriously burn to the ground after owners 'complained about traveller site on BBC Panorama'\n\nMan is jailed for murder after the 77-year-old he stabbed 100 times named him with her final words\n\nMy wife was blindsided when I asked for a divorce.

No country can tolerate such a risk to our very survival.\"\n\nLast week, the same agency behind the green card review, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced a review of all refugees admitted under former President Joe Biden.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, with Citizenship and Immigration Services saying the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".","summary":"The Trump administration has said it will re-examine green cards issued to individuals who immigrated to the US from 19 countries.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/trump-administration-will-re-examine-green-card-holders-from-19-countries/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-2486.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:14:46","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 14am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 14am"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":0.088},{"id":382897096,"title":"Trump Bluntly Confirms National Guard Death in Call With Service Members","text":"The 20-year-old National Guard member shot near the White House on Wednesday has died, President Donald Trump announced during a live speech on Thursday evening.\n\nTrump, who is spending Thanksgiving in Mar-a-Lago, announced Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom’s death during a call with service members. \n\n“She’s no longer with us.

They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.\n\nIn a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.\n\n\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.\n\n\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.\n\nThe state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.\n\nEarlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not doing more to get his son out of jail.\n\nTwenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.\n\nMr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.\n\nHe had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.\n\nMohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.\n\nThere are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.\n\nMany have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.\n\nFollowing Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was beaten to death by Israeli settlers during a confrontation in July. \n\nAt the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.\n\nMohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.\n\n\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.","url":"https://www.classfmonline.com/world/Palestinian-US-teen-freed-after-9-months-in-Israeli-jail-68152","image":"https://cdn.classfmonline.com/imagelib/thumbs/87318490.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:12:16","author":"Bbc.com","authors":["Bbc.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.514},{"id":382894392,"title":"Trump Says National Guard Member Dies After Shooting, As Ambush Becomes Political Flashpoint","text":"WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a National Guard member had died after being shot in an ambush by an Afghan national near the White House, an attack that drew accusations from his administration of Biden-era immigration vetting failures and prompted a sweeping review of asylum cases.\n\nSarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism investigation after Wednesday’s shooting.\n\nThe FBI searched multiple properties in a widening probe, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. in 2021 under a resettlement program.\n\nAgents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.\n\nU.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n“I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation’s capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,” Trump said in a Thanksgiving call for U.S. military service members.\n\nTrump said the suspect’s “atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country.”\n\nArmed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot one member who fell and then shot again before firing multiple times at the second member. The gunman was wounded in an exchange of fire with Guard members before he was arrested. He was in hospital under heavy guard on Thursday, and Trump said he was in serious condition.\n\nThe alleged assailant, who lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, appeared to have acted alone, said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.\n\n(Reporting by Leah Douglas, Jana Winter, Phil Stewart, Ted Hesson, Lucia Mutikani, Jasper Ward and Tim Reid; Additional reporting by Idrees Ali, Jeff Mason, Steve Gorman; Writing by Julia Harte, Rod Nickel and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Ross Colvin, Deepa Babington and Diane Craft)","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-national-guard-member-dead_n_6928e79fe4b0237ded13a080","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6928e7e6190000c5026a044e.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:09:15","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":382893710,"title":"Trump Orders 'Rigorous Reexamination' of Green Cards From Afghan Nationals After DC Shooting","text":"The Afghan national suspected of shooting two security personnel near Washington DC on Wednesday could be putting his fellow Afghans' future in fulfilling their dream life in America at risk. According to a new report, all immigration applications from Afghan nationals are on hold following the suspected terror attack.Trump Wants 'Rigorous' Reviews Of Afghan Nationals' Green CardsJoseph Edlow, the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, took to X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday. He gave an update about the recent order he received from President Donald Trump following the shooting incident on Wednesday.'At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,' he wrote.Although he did not specify which country, it was obvious he was referring to Afghanistan. Per USA Today, the USCIS has already 'paused all immigration requests from Afghan nationals after the shooting.'The Trump administration is taking immediate action. The outlet added that most international travel from Afghanistan to the USA had already been put on hold.Trump issued a travel ban to 12 countries, including Afghanistan, in June 2025, for security reasons. The POTUS questioned Afghanistan's authority in issuing reliable passports since it is under the control of the Taliban.However, some Afghan nationals were exempted. Those who arrived in the U.S. on Special Immigrant Visas for aiding the US military or serving as translators were among the exemptions.Afghan Nationals Waiting to Settle In the USA Are Devastated by the NewsThousands of Afghans fled to Pakistan to escape the Taliban. They have been waiting for their US visas to allow them to eventually settle in the United States. So, the recent news from the USCIS director broke their hearts as they felt that the Land of the Free had closed its doors on them.Ahmad Samim Naimi, 34, a broadcaster and press officer, is among those who applied for resettlement in the USA. He left Afghanistan and moved to Pakistan when the Taliban started detaining journalists. The news that their application was on hold was like a nightmare for Naimi.'I was deeply distressed when I heard this news. We have completed all the required review procedures,' he said (via Reuters).Naimi said that he had no plans to return to his home country because if he did so, the next news the people would hear about him was probably his 'arrest' or 'death.'Meanwhile, they have also struggled to remain in Pakistan due to the flood of Afghans seeking refuge in the country without proper documentation. Even Afghan nationals with proper visas and UNCHR papers have been blocked at checkpoints, forcibly evicted, or subjected to extortion.Niami hopes the administration will reconsider those with P1 and P2 status. P1 applies to individuals who worked directly for the US government, and P2 is for individuals who were engaged in US-funded projects or served with media outlets, aid organisations, or civil society institutions.Another Afghan from Kabul, who declined to share their name, was devastated about the freezing of their immigration applications. According to them, it diminished everything they had planned for their family. And just like Naimi, they don't feel going back to Afghanistan is an option, noting that they couldn't take that 'risk of destruction' for their family.Why Did Trump Halt Afghan Nationals' Immigration Requests?Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was accused of shooting two National Guard members on Wednesday. He is an Afghan national who entered the United States in 2021 under the Biden administration.He used to work for the US government and applied for asylum in 2024. Trump granted his request in April 2025.However, the shooting incident raised alarms as he was suspected of being an asset of a terrorist group. The FBI has been investigating the shooting and treating it as a potential act of international terrorism.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-orders-rigorous-reexamination-green-cards-afghan-nationals-after-dc-shooting-1758613","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1770779/us-president-donald-trump-podium.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=48d2170480b2f9d7c4f6a1963388fdbb","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:08:05","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":382901648,"title":"Trump announces death of one National Guard member shot near White House","text":"Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard members shot in Washington on Wednesday, has died, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday (November 27, 2025).\n\n\"Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected, young, magnificent person ...

The 29-year-old attacker, who critically wounded two National Guard members just blocks from the White House, is now at the center of a spiraling security scandal. Explosive revelations suggest Lakanwal was not just an ordinary evacuee from Kabul but a U.S.-trained operative, allegedly part of the elite 01 Unit under the former Afghan Republic — a force reportedly established and trained by U.S. intelligence agencies. In a stunning admission, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed on Fox News that Lakanwal had previously worked with the CIA as part of a partner military unit in Kandahar.

Could be almost completely cutting it because the money we're taking in is going to be so large,\" Reuters quoted Trump's remarks to US military service members on Thursday.The US President, who has often defended whopping tariffs on trading partners, proposed a tariff dividend to Americans earlier this month. He called out people who criticised tariffs and pledged a dividend of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income individuals.In a post on Truth Social, President Trump wrote, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER.”He promised dividends to Americans and said, “We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”Trump's $2,000 tariff dividend proposal followed the Supreme Court's arguments on November 5, during which several justices expressed scepticism about the tariffs. This suggested that many tariffs could be overturned, potentially resulting in refunds exceeding $100 billion, Bloomberg reported.","url":"https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/no-income-tax-in-us-heres-what-donald-trump-proposes-amid-his-tariff-push-11764287509224.html","image":"https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2025/11/27/1600x900/logo/USA-TRUMP-UKRAINE-DOCUMENT-1_1764173834931_1764173845944_1764287604927.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 23:59:56","author":"Riya R Alex","authors":["Riya R Alex"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.427},{"id":382896786,"title":"Trump orders review of Green Cards from 19 countries after National Guard shooting","text":"US President Donald Trump has ordered a broad review of asylum cases approved under former President Joe Biden and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries, Department of Homeland Security officials said on Thursday.The move came as US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced new guidance tightening screening standards in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021.USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said the new policy will allow officers to treat an applicant’s home country as a significant negative factor when assessing immigration benefits. “My primary responsibility is to ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” Edlow said. “American lives come first.”.preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}Officials said the 19 affected countries match those listed in a June presidential proclamation imposing full or partial entry suspensions: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.Edlow said the new guidance responds directly to yesterday’s horrific events and argued the Biden administration had spent four years dismantling basic vetting and screening standards while prioritizing rapid resettlement from high-risk countries.The 29-year-old suspect, an Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the US in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration programme that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the US withdrawal from the country.The updated policy instructs USCIS officers to consider issues such as the applicant’s country’s ability to issue secure identity documents or support background checks. Officials say the change strengthens enforcement of Trump’s national security proclamation, PP 10949, which restricts entry for foreign nationals deemed potential threats.The guidance takes effect immediately and applies to all requests pending or filed on or after November 27, 2025.The rare shooting of National Guard members, on the day before Thanksgiving, comes as the presence of the troops in the nation’s capital and other cities around the country has been a flashpoint issue for months, fueling court fights and a broader public policy debate about the Trump administration’s use of the military to combat what officials cast as an out-of-control crime problem, according to The Associated Press.- EndsPublished By: Aashish VashisthaPublished On: Nov 28, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/trump-orders-review-of-green-cards-from-19-countries-after-national-guard-shooting-glbs-2827236-2025-11-28","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/in-a-strongly-worded-statement--south-africas-presidency-criticised-trumps-comments--asserting-tha-275138347-16x9.png?VersionId=kp2nIbK.No4wgWzqLiKO3yH.dNG4j7fo?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 23:58:57","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":382895900,"title":"Sarah Beckstrom, National Guard member shot near White House, dies; shooter in serious condition","text":"A day after the shooting near the White House, US President Donald Trump confirmed the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard members who were shot.

The incident is being investigated by the FBI as an act of terror. \n\nAccording to NY Post, Lakanwal was allegedly lying in wait before he rounded the corner near the Farragut West Metro Station in Northwest DC around 2.15pm on Wednesday, November 26 then opened fire, striking a Sarah in the chest before shooting her in the head, according to law enforcement sources.\n\n Following the gunshots the suspect was reportedly shot four times before being taken away nearly naked in an ambulance. West Virginia governor Patrick Morrisey initially said the two guards had died, but later made a correction clarifying that his office was “receiving conflicting reports” about their condition. The guards were reportedly taken to two separate hospitals and were in critical condition. \n\n\"They answered the call, they volunteered, they put their lives on the line for people they don’t even know - and that is becoming a reality more and more for members of law enforcement,\" US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said.\n\nA suspect who was in custody was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening, according to a law enforcement source. Trump has offered his love to the families of those impacted and in a statement to the nation launched a scathing attack at Joe Biden's presidency and immigration laws. \n\nThe US President labelled the former president the 'worst in the history of our country' for letting in '20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners'. \n\nJeffery Carroll, executive assistant Washington police chief said the assailant “came around the corner” and immediately started firing at the troops roughly two blocks northwest of the White House. After hearing gunfire, other troops in the area ran over and held down the gunman. \n\nTrump added that the suspected shooter \"will pay a very steep price\" for his actions. A post on X from US Citizenship and Immigration Services read: \"Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols. The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission.\"\n\nAn Afghan advocacy group also condemned the attack but said it should not be used to \"isolate or harm\" Afghans who came to resettle in America.","summary":"Officials have confirmed that one of the guards shot in the targeted attack, now being investigated by the FBI as an act of terror","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-national-guard-member-dies-36314280","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article36314260.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_National-Guard-Shooting-25330734165622.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 23:56:19","author":"Olivia Beeson","authors":["Olivia Beeson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":382900644,"title":"National Guard troop shot near White House dies; second victim critical, Trump says","text":"US president Donald Trump said on Thursday that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard soldiers shot near the White House a day earlier, had died of her injuries.

Ashley Wahler is responsible for Keith's (in)famous highlights and for Nicole's strawberry blonde hair.\n\nIt's not clear whether they both also still attend the same local church where they used to worship.\n\nThey are sharing time with their children, who continue at the same school in Nashville.\n\nAs per a custody agreement which was signed by Urban in August this year, Kidman gets 306 days of the year with the children and he gets them for just 59, including Thanksgiving.\n\nHis mandated time with the girls is from 10am on a Saturday to 6pm on a Sunday every other weekend. Over the past few weeks, Urban has been to Palm Beach in Florida, to perform at a charity event at President Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago resort, and also popped up in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nLast week he was on stage at the Country Music Awards in Nashville.\n\nThe couple's split emerged earlier this year, with Kidman filing for divorce on September 30, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe custody agreement said that Urban had 'pre paid' all his financial obligations towards the children, and all matters seemed to be swiftly settled.\n\nOf course, normal couples might expect to 'share out' their friends and hope they don't bump into each other in the street. Friends of Kidman confirm she isn't upping sticks any time soon and remains very committed to her life in Nashville where her social circle includes the actress Reese Witherspoon.\n\nIn spring next year Kidman will start filming a new series of Scarpetta – the drama based on Patrica Cornwell's novels featuring pathologist Dr Kay Scarpetta. The first series has already been made and will be out on in March next year, also starring Jamie Lee Curtis as Scarpetta's sister, Dorothy.\n\nKidman and Urban were married in June 2006 and were last seen together in June this year. Not long after, fans began to notice subtle changes in their behaviour: though Urban previously referred to his wife as 'babygirl', for example, and spoke about her frequently, he stopped mentioning Kidman at all while on tour over the summer.\n\nWhen news of the split finally emerged, one source told People magazine: 'Nicole's hurt and feels betrayed. It's devastating to her. She's shocked.' The insider also claimed that Nicole 'didn't want this and has been fighting to save the marriage.'\n\nTMZ – which broke the story of their separation – went further, with a Kidman source saying: 'All the signs point to the fact Keith is with another woman.\n\n'Let's just say, Nicole doesn't dispute that. But she's still shocked over it.'\n\nKidman's team declined to comment on the rumours, as did Urban's. \n\nGossip linked him briefly with singer Maggie Baugh, who he has duetted with on tour. However country singer Alexandra Kay said: 'I know that's absolutely not true. Honestly I was heartbroken for them because the media scrutiny is insane and the things that people say. I've met her boyfriend. She's very happy.'\n\nUrban was also linked to singer Karley Scott Collins, who also performs on his tour. Both she and Urban were at the Country Music Awards in Nashville last week – but separately.\n\nScott Collins, 25, has toured with Urban and other country stars like Willie Nelson. 'It's amazing being on the road with Keith,' she said earlier this year. 'He's an incredible entertainer, and I respect him so much... and I've learned a lot watching him.'\n\nIn a video posted on Instagram to mark her tour with him, they couldn't appear to be more delighted and giggly in each other's company. A photo posted on Instagram on July 16 this year, meanwhile, shows them with their arms around each other, heads resting on each other's shoulders. 'Somebody pinch me,' writes Scott Collins. 'I feel like I'm dreamin'.'\n\nSince the split, Urban has appeared in a TV talent show, The Road, for CBS. He is also fronting a 'Castin' the Cowboy' campaign for Mexican food makers Old El Paso, in which he helped choose a new 'singing cowboy' mascot to represent the brand.\n\nThe winner, a performer named Elroy, was crowned by Urban in July 2025 and will be featured in future Old El Paso advertisements.","summary":"Divorcing couple Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban have both put down deep roots in Nashville, Tennessee.

They abducted 24 people, including a pregnant woman, from a rice farm and chopped off the hand of a blind man. \n\nHowever, the Police said 10 people were kidnapped.\n\nThe bandits also attacked a community in Abuja, and kidnapped six girls and a boy.\n\nThis happened as the Diocese of Kaduna, Anglican Communion, announced that Venerable Edwin Achi, Priest-in-Charge of Ebenezer Anglican Church, Ungwan Maijero, who was abducted on October 28, had died in kidnappers. The incident prompted the cancellation of the much-anticipated ‘Stand Up for Jesus 2025’ event.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Defence, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, yesterday, declared that the armed forces were closing in on eliminating bandits terrorising parts of the country, despite the recent resurgence of school abductions.\n\nComing on a day that the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, disclosed that 11,566 Police personnel withdrawn from VIP duties had been redeployed to under-served communities, Catholic Cardinal John Onaiyekan, urged the Federal Government to ensure quick solution to internal insecurity by adequately equipping officers on ground rather than relying on recruiting 20,000 policemen.\n\nHow bandits kidnapped 24 in Niger\n\nA source in the community said the attackers struck at about 2:00pm on Wednesday while residents were harvesting their crops.\n\nDespite Palaita being only five kilometres from a military base in Erena, the bandits reportedly escaped with the victims before security personnel could respond.\n\nIn a separate incident earlier that day, another group of armed men invaded the Kakuru community, also in Erena Ward, brutalised a blind resident and severed his right hand after taking a mobile phone from him.\n\nVanguard gathered that the bandits invaded a farmland in Palaita community, Erena Ward in Shiroro LGA where farmers were harvesting their rice and whisked the workers and pregnant woman away.\n\nThe invasion and abduction of the farmers happened at 2pm without any hindrance.\n\nThe bandits were said to have driven straight to the farm, started shooting sporadically, rounded up the victims and fled before the arrival of the military to the scene.\n\n“From all indications, it seems the bandits had a mission and the mission was to dislodge the farmers and take them away. They were said to have driven straight to the farm, started shooting and by the time the farmers knew what was happening, they had been rounded up and led to mount waiting motorcycles and taken away.\n\n“We are not sure the exact destination they were taken to and no communication has been opened up between the bandits, and the immediate families of those affected or any other contacts,” a community source, who wanted anonymity, declared.\n\nAlso in another community called Kakuru in the same Erena ward, bandits were said to have chopped off the right hand of a blind man for not “cooperating” with them when asked some “vital” questions.It was learned that the bandits met the blind man at home and wanted to collect the mobile phone they saw with him.\n\n“The bandits arrived at the community at about 8:00am, met only the blind man at home because other residents of the community had gone to their farms.\n\n“Not knowing who they are because of his sight, he explained to the gunmen that the mobile phone does not belong to him, saying the owner had gone to the farm.\n\n“This refusal did not go down well with them. After collecting the phone forcefully from him, one of the bandits ordered that his right hand be chopped off for refusing to cooperate with them, and it was done immediately,” the source disclosed.\n\nAccording to him, the victim was immediately given first aid treatment in the town but added that his whereabouts is unknown yet.\n\nConfirming the attacks, the state police command said 10 persons were reportedly abducted in the area.\n\n10 persons were abducted — Police\n\nSpokesman of the Command, Superintendent of Police, Wasiu Abiodun in a terse statement said:“On November 26, 2025 at about 8pm, report received indicated that suspected armed men abducted about 10 persons from Angwan-Kawo and Kuchipa villages of Shiroro Local Govt Area and effort is being made to rescue the victims,”\n\nBandits kidnap six girls, a boy in FCT\n\nIn Abuja, exactly one week after a police officer was shot dead in the Guto area of Bwari, bandits launched yet another violent attack, abducting six young girls and a 16-year-old boy during a night raid on Gidan-Bijimi, a settlement in Kawu ward on the fringes of Bwari Area Council.\n\nKawu shares a boundary with Kaduna State and lies close to the Gidan Dogo and Kweti forests – areas long regarded as transit routes and hideouts for criminal gangs operating along the FCT–Kaduna corridor.Gidan-Bijimi itself sits near Marke village on the same boundary, a zone that has witnessed renewed criminal activity in recent months.\n\nThe latest assault occurred around 9:47pm on Wednesday, throwing the quiet community into chaos as the gunmen, armed with AK-47 rifles, invaded two homes and fired repeatedly into the air before escaping with their captives.\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of last Wednesday’s attack on Guto, another boundary community in Bwari, where the Federal Capital Territory Police Command reported that 30 armed men stormed the area to kidnap a resident and his family. Two terrorists were reportedly neutralized in the Guto incident while a policeman lost his life.\n\nIn the latest attacks, a resident of Kawu, Suleiman Shuaibu, who confirmed the Gidan-Bijimi abductions, said the girls taken were between 17 and 23 years old.\n\nHe said he got a call around 9:53pm from Gidan-Bijimi that bandits had invaded the village. “They abducted six young girls. Unfortunately, my cousin-sister is among the victims,” he explained, adding that a teenage boy was also seized.\n\nShuaibu said members of the local vigilance group attempted to confront the attackers but were forced to retreat due to the bandits’ superior firepower.\n\nHe added that several residents fled into surrounding bushes, while others remained indoors until daylight. As of Thursday morning, there had been no contact from the kidnappers, and the police had yet to officially confirm the incident.\n\nThe abduction deepens concerns over the steadily deteriorating security situation in Bwari Area Council. The attacks have triggered renewed calls for strengthened security across communities bordering Kaduna and Niger states – long considered soft entry points for armed groups creeping toward the capital.In response to rising anxieties, the Federal Capital Territory Administration FCTA on Wednesday announced fresh security measures following an expanded meeting of the FCT Security Council chaired by the Minister, Nyesom Wike.\n\nFCT Commissioner of Police, Miller Dantawaye, who briefed journalists after the meeting, said the council had fully activated Operation Sweep, a multi-agency security operation recently reorganised to respond more effectively to emerging threats.\n\nAccording to him, the operation has been restructured into four major sectors covering Gwagwalada, Bwari, and two wide corridors across the city centre—stretching from Berger and Wuse through Karu, Mararaba, Karshi, and Orozo. He added that the minister has provided “adequate logistics” to enable the joint deployment of personnel from the police, military, DSS, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, FRSC, Immigration Service, Correctional Service and other FCT-based agencies.\n\nDespite these measures, Wednesday night’s abduction underscores the persistent vulnerability of remote communities and the growing boldness of armed groups testing the limits of the government’s security response.\n\nResidents say they now live under constant fear, pleading for swift action to rescue the victims and halt what many describe as a descent into daily terror.\n\nKaduna Anglican priest dies in kidnappers’ den\n\nMeanwhile, the Diocese of Kaduna, Anglican Communion, has announced the death of Venerable Edwin Achi, Priest-in-Charge of Ebenezer Anglican Church, Ungwan Maijero.\n\nThe incident prompted the cancellation of the much-anticipated ‘Stand Up for Jesus 2025’ event.\n\nThe announcement was made via the Diocese’s official Facebook page. Ven. Edwin Achi was kidnapped alongside his wife and daughter on October 28, 2025 from their residence in Nissi Village, near the Kaduna Refinery, and taken to an unknown location. A few days after the abduction, the kidnappers contacted the family to demand for a N600m ransom before they would release the victims.\n\nHowever, the Diocese of Kaduna, Anglican Communion, said the cleric is now dead. In a statement, they described the death of Reverend Achi as a painful loss to the entire Diocese, the clergy, the Church family, and all who were blessed by his faithful ministry.\n\nHis passing has been described as a profound loss to the Diocese, the clergy, and all members of the Church community who benefited from his ministry.\n\n“His faithful service, humble spirit, and unwavering devotion to God leave a lasting legacy,” the Diocese stated.\n\nAuthorities and church members continue to pray for the safe release of his wife and daughter, who remain in the hands of the kidnappers.\n\nIn honour of the late priest, the Diocese confirmed that the ‘Stand Up for Jesus 2025’ programme has been cancelled.\n\nThe statement by the Diocese of Kaduna Anglican Communion read: “With heavy hearts and deep sorrow, the Diocese of Kaduna, Anglican Communion, announces the passing unto glory of The Venerable Edwin Achi, Priest-in-Charge of Ebenezer Anglican Church, Ungwan Maijero.\n\n“Ven. Edwin Achi, who was kidnapped alongside his wife on 28th October, 2025, has been confirmed dead.“His transition is a painful loss to the entire Diocese, the clergy, the Church family, and all who were blessed by his faithful ministry, humble spirit, and unwavering devotion to the service of God.\n\n“We continue to pray for the release of his wife and daughter who are still in the hands of kidnappers.“On this note, the Standup for Jesus 2025 is hereby cancelled in honour of the late Venerable Edwin Achi. The Lord be with you.”\n\nWe’re inches away from crushing banditry — Defence Minister, Badaru\n\nHowever, Minister of Defence, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar, yesterday, declared that the armed forces were closing in on eliminating bandits terrorising parts of the country, despite the recent resurgence of school abductions.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with the BBC Hausa Service, the minister admitted that security challenges persist but described the current situation as typical of guerrilla warfare, where criminal elements strike intermittently to create fear.\n\n“This is how guerrilla warfare works,” Badaru said, “there will be periods of calm, and then they launch an attack that shakes the nation. Yes, we know their locations, but these are areas where direct strikes could harm civilians, or forests where our bombs cannot penetrate.”\n\nHe insisted that Nigerian troops are working “day and night” to root out the criminals, assuring citizens that the military is nearing a decisive breakthrough.”\n\nBadaru expressed concern over the return of mass abductions of students, saying the government has launched a full investigation.\n\n“We never said the problem was completely over. But this renewed kidnapping of schoolchildren worries us. We are studying what went wrong and how to prevent a recurrence.”\n\nAccording to him, the government has an established framework for school security, which significantly reduced incidents in the past two years.\n\nThe minister confirmed an ongoing investigation into allegations that security personnel were withdrawn minutes before bandits invaded a girls’ school in Maga, Kebbi State.\n\n“We will uncover what happened. If anyone is found culpable, they will be sanctioned,” he vowed.Badaru also noted that some bandit groups have been extorting rural communities, but the military avoids carrying out airstrikes in those locations to prevent civilian casualties.\n\nResponding to the U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to take military measures against Nigeria over alleged genocide against Christians, Badaru said Nigerian officials have been engaging with the U.S. government.\n\n“Our leaders have been there and discussions are ongoing. By God’s grace, there will be understanding,” he said, adding that Nigeria sources arms from multiple countries.\n\nIGP redeploys 11, 566 withdrawn police personnel to underserved communities\n\nTo strengthen internal security, the Inspector-General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, has disclosed that 11,566 Police personnel ordered to report back from VIP duties have reported back to the Force and revealed that they have been redeployed to underserved and vulnerable communities across the country.\n\nIGP Egbetokun said the move aligns with ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening internal security, enhancing community policing, and ensuring a more equitable distribution of manpower nationwide.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with Police Strategic Officers in Abuja, yesterday, the IGP said the redeployed officers will boost security presence in rural and high-risk areas that have long suffered from inadequate policing.\n\nHe reaffirmed the Nigeria Police Force’s commitment to professional service delivery, stressing that the redeployment is part of a broader strategy to enhance public safety and ensure that every community, regardless of size or location, receives adequate security coverage.\n\nCardinal Onaiyekan tasks Tinubu on Police effective equipment\n\nCatholic Cardinal John Onaiyekan, yesterday, said there is no need for the Federal Government to deploy 20,000 additional policemen, insisting that Nigeria should equip the officers already on ground to effectively confront insecurity.\n\nThe president recently announced he would be recruiting 20,000 additional police officers.Speaking at the 9th International Conference on Love and Tolerance in Abuja, the Cardinal warned that the nation cannot afford delays in tackling insecurity.\n\nHis words: “Right now in Nigeria, we have to build bridges so that all of us, Christians and Muslims, can jointly face our common enemy… Those who are killing us.\n\n“We have finally agreed that we shall join hands and face them. And if we join hands, we can deal with them now. We should be able to deal with them.\n\n“With all these wonderful soldiers and police, we should be able to deal with them. I’m not even sure we need 20,000 more policemen. I believe they are the ones we have right now. Arm them well, treat them well, and they will do their job.”\n\n“There is no need to deploy 20,000 policemen. We could use the policemen we have. I’m not an expert, but to train them and then deploy them, for an emergency. Let the experts tell me how long it takes to deploy 20,000 people. I guess we are talking of one year, In one month, this country can be destroyed.”\n\n“So I’m saying we should look at a strategy that will address the issue right now. We should equip the policemen we have now, who are already trained though, but they are carrying bags for madams. It’s good that they have been withdrawn; Let them start working. And let there be the political will to flush the terrorists out of the forest. And we are glad over the language that our president spoke, yesterday; but we’ve been listening to that since two years ago.\n\n“What do you have police for? That’s their job. It’s not even the job of the army. It’s the job of the police.”\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Cardinal Onaiyekan also reflected on global religious harmony, warning that Nigeria faces increasing local polarisation despite global unity efforts, referencing the “Abu Dhabi document” signed by Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al Azhar.\n\nFormer Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani, highlighted the root causes of intolerance and conflict, noting that human differences in wealth, power, race, and religion often drive dominance and resistance.He emphasized that differences are natural and unavoidable, and that peace and tolerance begin with recognizing and accepting human diversity.\n\nSani also expressed concern over shrinking freedom of speech, pointing out that arrests and social media scrutiny threaten open dialogue, and urged that love, understanding, and respect for differing opinions are essential for building a harmonious society.\n\nPresident of UFUK Dialogue Foundation, Emrah Ilgen, whose organisation convened the international conference, said the gathering was created to address the urgent need for healing in a deeply divided world.\n\nHe said the theme “Bridging Divides: Building Trust in a Polarized World” was chosen to confront rising global and local tensions, emphasising that the world is experiencing dangerous levels of mistrust driven by misinformation, fear, ethnic divisions, and religious misconceptions.","url":"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/11/bandits-kidnap-pregnant-woman-30-others-in-niger-fct/","image":"https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-213.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 23:37:55","author":"Idowu Bankole","authors":["Idowu Bankole"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.167}]}
