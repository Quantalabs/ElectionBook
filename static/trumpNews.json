Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy GETHIN HICKS \n Published:02:20 BST, 28 May 2025 |Updated:02:20 BST, 28 May 2025 \n\nThe child actors set to follow in the footsteps of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint in the new Harry Potter series have at last been announced - after the iconic trio turned their backs on JK Rowling.\nFollowing the incredible success of the original eight Potter films, fans had long been calling for the spellbinding franchise to make a return.\nThey at last got their wish with the announcement that Hogwarts would be back on our screens in a JK Rowling produced HBO series aiming to 'lead a new generation of fandom'.\nBut hopes of Radcliffe, Watson and Grint reuniting were all but crushed after their very public feud with Rowling.\nThe actors 'turned their backs' on the author who made them their riches - Radcliffe a reported £85 million, Watson a whopping £62 million and Grint £37 million - following a row over trans rights in 2020. \nFrom A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail's new Showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. \n\nThe three stars of the new HBO Harry Potter series have at last been announced. Arabella Stanton (left) will play Hermione Granger, Dominic McLaughlin (centre) will play Harry Potter and Alastair Stout (right) will play Ron Weasley\n\nArabella, who is believed to be between nine and 11 years old, has previously starred as Matilda in the West End production Matilda The Musical\n\nJK Rowling said she will never forgive Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint after their feud over trans rights in 2020\nThe trio spoke out publicly against the author after she stated her belief that women are defined by their biological sex and not their gender identity. \nRowling later insisted she would never forgive the Harry Potter stars, with the 59-year-old again taking aim at them just last month.\nReplying to a tweet asking: 'What actor/ actress instantly ruins a movie for you?', Rowling wrote: 'Three guesses. Sorry, but that was irresistible.'\nBut while cast members of the films have publicly criticised the books' author, HBO have backed Rowling saying she has a 'right to express her personal views'. \nSo after catapulting Radcliffe, Watson and Grint to stardom almost 25 years ago with the first Potter film, who exactly are Rowling's chosen ones this time around? \nDirectors trawled through more than 32,000 audition tapes before deciding on the lucky three - Dominic Laughlin as Harry Potter, Arabella Stanton as Hermione Granger and Alastair Stour as Ron Weasley. \nWith every single episode of the much-anticipated production expected to cost a staggering £75 million, landing a lead role in the series has been described as like 'winning the lottery'.\nBrand expert Nick Ede told MailOnline: 'From a child actor's point of view to be cast in Harry Potter it is completely like winning the jackpot. It's going to completely change their lives.\n\nEmma Watson (left) played Hermione in the original films, Daniel Radcliffe (centre) starred as Harry Potter and Rupert Grint (right) featured as Ron Weasley [Pictured in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]\n\nRupert is estimated to have earnt £37 million during his time on Harry Potter, Daniel around £85 million and Emma £62 million [Pictured in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]\n'Daniel Radcliffe was paid £1 million for his first film and that went up to £50 million for the last two. It's not just the financial gain but the global fame will also bring endorsements and deals for them.\n'It's the best start to an acting career they could ever want, I can only see it going up for them. But it is a lot of pressure to be cast in such a big show, I mean they're going to be superstars globally.\n'I can imagine them at least being paid £1 million per series to begin with and then you could even see them commanding £10 to £20 million each by the end of the seventh season - or even more.' \nArabella Stanton - Hermione Granger\nCast as the much-loved character of Hermione Granger is Arabella Stanton, who goes by Bella. \nFollowing in the footsteps of Watson, who first played Hermione in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when she was just 11, the British actress is believed to be between nine and 11 years old. \nBut she's already featured both on television and in theatre after studying at some of the country's most well respected acting schools. \nBella began began honing her skills at Aldance, a studio in Bracknell offering dancing classes for children from 18 months through to adults. \nShe too trained at the prestigious British Theatre Academy and the Guildford School of Acting, which has produced stars such as Kobna Holdbrook-Smith and Chris Geere. \n\nArabella, who goes by Bella, has featured both on television and in theatre having studied at some of the country's most prestigious acting schools\n\nBella will play Hermione Granger in the new HBO series - a character who was initially played by Emma Watson\n\nShe landed her first role in 2023 when she was cast as star character Matilda in the West End production Matilda The Musical. \nMaking her West End debut, Bella, who was the production's youngest cast member, performed in the show for around a six month period beginning in September 2023 and even featured on BBC's The One Show for World Book Day as Matilda. \nAfter impressing on stage, Arabella bagged the part of Control in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 2024 London revival of Starlight Express. \nAway from the spotlight, she enjoys 'playing hockey for her local club, skiing and horse riding. She loves competing in swimming galas and triathlons and she also plays the clarinet.'\nHermione however will undoubtedly be Bella's biggest part yet and following in the footsteps of Emma Watson, she certainly has big boots to fill. \nDominic McLaughlin - Harry Potter\nPlaying the main character in the upcoming HBO remake of JK Rowling's iconic series is Dominic McLaughlin, a young Scottish actor with experience in film and theatre. \nHaving beaten off tens of thousands of children during auditions, Harry Potter lovers will no doubt be chomping at the bit to see what Dominic has to offer. \nAnd the young actor boasts an impressive CV, having appeared in a production of William Shakespeare's Macbeth where he featured alongside Luther actress Indira Varma.\n\nPlaying the main character in the upcoming HBO remake of JK Rowling's iconic series is Dominic McLaughlin, a young Scottish actor with experience in film and theatre\n\nThe Scot will follow in the footsteps of Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter film collection [Pictured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]\nNoticeably, the Scot even has prior experience of playing a wizard after starring as Oliver Gregory in the 2024 film Grow.\nDominic is also believed to have been lined up for a role in an upcoming BBC adventure series titled Gifted after beating more than 3,000 budding Scottish children to the part. \nHis 'magical' casting as Harry Potter has left those back home in Dominic's native Scotland incredibly proud, with his old acting school taking to Facebook to express their pride on Wednesday, \nThe Performance Academy Scotland posted: 'The news is out and this one is MAGICAL!!\n'Our amazing young performer has been cast as Harry Potter in the upcoming HBO series.

Shame on HBO for going near this. It's just going to ruin something that should be left well alone.'\nAnother typed, 'Paapa Essiedu shouldn't take this role for his own benefit. He could be the best actor in the world but he doesn't fit the characteristics of Snape from the book.'\n'I don't understand the push to change everything from the original context,' they added.\nAnother wrote, 'Paapa Essiedu is being eyed for the role of Professor Severus Snape in the upcoming 'Harry Potter' TV series. Another classic that goes woke.'\n\nWhile when John Lithgow was cast as Albus Dumbledore, some fans were not happy about the casting of an American actor to play the British character, particularly given JK Rowling's insistence that the cast of the original films be British \n\nThe character, played by Michael Gambon in the final six of eight Harry Potter films, is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts and a mentor to the title character\nWhile when John Lithgow was cast as Albus Dumbledore, some fans were not happy about the casting of an American actor to play the British character, particularly given JK Rowling's insistance that the cast of the original films be British.\nTaking to X, fans wrote: 'I can't understand why John Lithgow is the new Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter HBO series. Dumbledore is British, Lithgow is from the USA.'\n'Nothing against John Lithgow, but Dumbledore and the whole Harry Potter franchise is British.'\nThe young trio will join A-listers John Lithgow, 79, as Albus Dumbledore, Paul Whitehouse, 67, as Argus Filch, and Nick Frost, 53, as Rubeus Hagrid as they film at Warner Bros's 200-acre studio in Leavesden Herts.\nHarry PotterHBO\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nPotter gold!

Beneath it, he wrote: \"PRAISE GOD!!!! Thank you Mr President for bringing my family back\"\n\n In a second post, Grayson reposted another clip of Trump on the phone with his family, relaying the news of Todd and Julie's pardon. Underneath the clip, he wrote, \"Trump knows best\"\n\n On May 27, Trump told Todd and Julie's children that he would be granting their parents full pardons through a phone call and said he believed the two were \"given a pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\"\n\n \"It's a terrible thing, but it's a great thing, because your parents are going to be free and clean,\" he continued. \"I hope we can do it by tomorrow. ... I don't know them, but give them my regards and wish them a good luck.\"\n\n In August 2019, the Chrisleys were indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts of bank and wire fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, all of which they have denied.\n\n The reality stars began their prison sentences on Jan. 17, 2023. Todd was scheduled to be released on Jan. 22, 2033, from the Federal Prison Camp Pensacola. Julie, on the other hand, was scheduled to be released from the Federal Correctional Institution Marianna on Oct. 19, 2028. Their original sentences, which were 12 years and seven years, respectively, were reduced in September 2023.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In June 2024, a judge granted Julie’s appeal and vacated her seven-year sentence due to insufficient evidence. However, in September 2024, a separate judge ruled that Julie's original punishment was sufficient and resentenced her to the same 84 months in prison.\n\n Amid their imprisonment, the couple's daughter, Savannah Chrisley, had become the sole caretaker of Grayson and Chloe, 12, at just 25 years old. (The couple also shares son Chase, 28, while Todd also had children Lindsie, 35, and Kyle, 33, during a previous marriage.)\n\n After the pardons were announced, Savannah reacted to the news on Instagram Live, saying, \"My parents get to start their lives over! My phone is going bananas right now, but President Trump gave them a full, unconditional pardon and for that, I am forever grateful. Thank you, President Trump.\"\n\n She also celebrated the news of her parents' imminent release in a statement, saying: \"For the past two and a half years, I’ve done everything in my power to fight for my parents’ freedom and bring them home. This moment is the answer to countless prayers, and I am beyond grateful to President Trump for seeing the truth and restoring my family.\"\n\n \"Today is a victory for our family, but the fight against wrongful convictions and injustice within our prison system is far from over. I will continue to use my voice and platform to advocate for those who do not have one,\" she added. \"Family is everything to me, and I will never stop fighting for what is right.\"","summary":"On May 27, Trump told Todd and Julie's children that he would be granting their parents full pardons in a phone call","url":"https://people.com/grayson-chrisley-speaks-out-after-president-trump-pardons-parents-todd-and-julie-chrisley-11742849","image":"https://people.com/thmb/zjqpu0v0msRJVB9pqRuZ0Q8yTsI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(740x198:742x200)/grayson-chrisley-todd-julie-052725-4bb7cad3498046f48c8211f3f2bfdd9b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 01:03:41","author":"Esther Kang","authors":["Esther Kang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.1},{"id":325569702,"title":"King Charles expresses love for ‘strong and free’ Canada","text":"OTTAWA: King Charles, speaking during a symbolic visit to show support for Canada at a time it has faced annexation threats from US President Donald Trump, on Tuesday expressed his love for the country, which he described as “strong and free”.

Charles then inspected an honor guard, all clad in bright red uniforms. \n\nAn Ipsos Reid poll released Tuesday for Global News found that 66% of respondents believed Canada’s relationship with the monarchy was useful because it helped set the nation apart from the United States, up from 54% in April 2023. \n\nIn the speech, the government reiterated its belief that Canada needs to agree a new relationship with the US and look for more reliable trading partners. \n\nThe warm welcome for the royal couple contrasted with a visit to Australia last October, when an Indigenous senator heckled Charles in Parliament House, accusing him of “genocide”.

The Palm Beach Post first reported that first lady spokesperson Nicholas Clemens said, \"Barron did not apply to Harvard, and any assertion that he, or that anyone on his behalf, applied is completely false.\" This comes amid online rumors that President Donald Trump is targeting Harvard with federal funding cuts because Barron, who just finished his freshman year at New York University, was supposedly rejected by the school. The Trump administration is asking all federal agencies to find ways to terminate all federal contracts with Harvard amid an ongoing standoff over foreign students’ records at the Ivy League school. Harvard has already sued in federal court seeking the restoration of about $3.2 billion in federal grant funding frozen by the administration since last month. HARVARD FOREIGN STUDENTS FACE UNCERTAIN FUTURE AMID TRUMP CAMPUS CRACKDOWNS In a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump accused Harvard of being \"very antisemitic\" and said he was considering giving the school’s federal funding to trade schools \"all across our land.\" \"What a great investment that would be for the USA, and so badly needed!!!\" he wrote. In a letter Thursday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem informed Harvard's leadership that the university had lost its \"privilege\" of enrolling foreign students as a result of the institution's \"refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security with pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity and inclusion' policies.\" On Friday, Judge Allison Burroughs, a President Barack Obama appointee, granted Harvard a temporary restraining order, preventing the government from revoking the Ivy League school's certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. The program permits the university to host international students with F-1 or J-1 visas to study in the U.S. TRUMP RAMPS UP HEAT ON HARVARD: HERE ARE 5 REASONS FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN INVESTIGATION Trump said this week that Harvard is being \"very slow\" to turn over information on foreign students.

(WLS) — Removing and deporting the “worst first”: That’s what President Donald Trump and his administration have consistently promoted about their plans for mass deportations since the start of his second term.\n\nBut in a case closely monitored by the ABC 7 I-Team, a father who has resided in the Chicago area for decades without any criminal record is caught in a legal limbo, incarcerated while his immigration case experiences continuations and delays, leaving his family awaiting answers.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\nBusiness owner Abel Orozco Ortega was taken into custody by immigration agents right outside his suburban Lyons home during U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in late January. Orozco Ortega’s attorney stated that he was a collateral arrest.\n\nSince then, Orozco Ortega has remained behind bars in an ICE detention center in Indiana for nearly four months.\n\n“Detention is a very grueling and difficult process, and he’s very, very worried,” Orozco Ortega’s attorney Colleen Ward with the National Immigrant Justice Center said. “He’s worried about his wife. He’s worried about his children, his grandchildren, his employees.”\n\nOn Tuesday morning, for the second time this month, Orozco Ortega’s case went before a federal immigration judge, only to find out the case would be continued again with no action taken until next month.\n\n“ICE said that they haven’t come to a decision,” Ward said. “So unfortunately, that meant that the case was delayed a further two weeks.”\n\nOrozco Ortega’s attorneys have argued nearly two dozen people arrested by ICE this year, including Orozco, were detained in violation of a past legally binding agreement — called the “Castañon Nava” settlement — surrounding how agents conduct immigration enforcement.\n\nOrozco Ortega is a Mexican immigrant who’s lived in the U.S. for nearly 30 years. He does not have permanent legal status.\n\nOrozco Ortega’s family and attorney say he had no criminal record, only a removal order after returning from a visit to Mexico in 2004.\n\nWard is arguing for Orozco Ortega’s due process rights in the case.\n\n“It’s a fundamental question of due process and allowing Mr. Orozco to be able to present all the evidence in his case,” Ward explained.\n\nImmigration enforcement has been a top policy priority during President Trump’s second term. He shared his renewed focus on enforcement at a West Point commencement address over the weekend.\n\n“They’ve allowed people to come into our country that shouldn’t be, that shouldn’t be here,” Trump said. “We’re getting them out and bringing them back where they came from.”\n\nWhile the president and his Department of Homeland Security officials continue to boast about mass deportations, data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, reflect what they call the reality of removals.\n\nResearcher Susan Long is the co-founder of TRAC.\n\n“(The administration has) just sort of made up numbers and said, ‘Oh, everything’s skyrocketing,’ and it simply doesn’t accord with what another branch is publishing that is required by Congress,” Long said.\n\nFor instance, Homeland Security officials claimed to have arrested 151,000 migrants and deported 135,000 in their first 100 days. It is more, they claimed, than the Biden administration in all of 2024.\n\nBut TRAC analyzed Homeland Security reports to Congress and found the Trump administration actually arrested roughly half that many migrants – 76,212 people — and removed or deported fewer than half of what they claimed — 72,179.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration said it has made serious headway on illegal border crossings.\n\nIllegal border crossings have plummeted since President Trump returned to the White House, leading to “its lowest southwest border crossings in history,” according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection figures published last month.\n\nWard believes ICE arrests like Orozco’s are more about hitting a quota versus public safety.\n\n“He’s a grandfather. He’s a small business owner,” Ward said. “And whether or not a 20-plus-year-old expedited removal order is going to be utilized to try to hit what appears to be a quota — not to enforce any kind of public safety or any other priority.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLYONS, Ill.

Now China is number 1 and we are close to number 17,” Dees said. “We lost the leadership.”\n\nChina can use 5G networks to capture Americans’ sensitive data, making it easier to conduct global surveillance operations, former senior military and intelligence officials warned in an April 2019 statement.\n\n“Chinese-designed 5G networks will provide near-persistent data transfer back to China that the Chinese government could capture at will,” the former officials warned. “This is not our opinion or even that of our intelligence community, but the directive of China’s 2017 Intelligence Law, which legally requires that ‘any organization or citizen shall support, assist, and cooperate with’ the security services of China’s One-Party State.”\n\nChina Mobile, the world’s largest mobile carrier by subscribers, is set to deploy 340,000 new 5G base stations in 2025, which will bring its total to nearly 2.8 million, according to an industry report from GSMA Intelligence, which provides analytics on the mobile data space.\n\nThat rapid growth gives China the ability to export popular platforms like TikTok and shield itself domestically from western competitors, according to a recent report in War On The Rocks, a national security outlet. In addition to giving Chinese companies an edge over their western counterparts, expanded spectrum capabilities also open the door for military applications that counter U.S. stealth weapons like the F-35.\n\nThe U.S. has plenty of spectrum available, it just is not being used efficiently, Dees told the DCNF. The Department of Defense could auction off billions of dollars of spectrum and still have enough to cover all of the military’s current and future needs.\n\n“We don’t have to rob Peter to pay Paul. We have more than enough spectrum for all our military needs, including Golden Dome,” Dees said. “This is extra spectrum that we should be making available to American companies who want to compete with China.”\n\nIt’s of paramount importance that the U.S. open up more spectrum for auction, Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, wrote in a 2024 op-ed.\n\n“If the Chinese government and its autocratic allies dominate 5G and 6G with superior spectrum infrastructure, there is no defense system or mitigation measure that can protect the Americans or U.S. interests,” Carr said.\n\nThe wish for spectrum expansions extends all the way to the White House, with Trump urging Congress on May 20 to identify 600 megahertz of wireless spectrum and make it available for commercial use through the OBBB. The bill narrowly passed the House on May 22, receiving zero votes from Democrats.\n\n“We must maintain our status as the Worldwide Leader in WiFi, 5G, and 6G, connecting every American to the World’s BEST Networks, while also keeping everyone safe. We can do both at the same time,” the president wrote. “Bottom line, I am going to free up plenty of SPECTRUM for auction, so Congress must put 600 MHz in ‘THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.'”\n\nTrump “spearheaded one of the most successful spectrum auctions in U.S. history” during his first term, selling more than $80 billion of spectrum for commercial use, Dees said. But that all stopped during the Biden administration, for reasons that aren’t totally clear. (RELATED China’s Economy Stumbles As It Fails To Shake Off Trump’s Tariff Gut Punch)\n\nExpanding spectrum availability for American companies has been hotly debated in Washington. The policy drew opposition during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in late March 2023 from former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley and former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who both argued that it would be “devastating” for national security to auction off spectrum without studying the matter further.\n\nThe remarks made during the late March hearing were an about face for Austin.\n\nOnly weeks before, Austin and former Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo endorsed a plan to auction more commercial spectrum, writing that doing so “protects critical national security missions, enables cutting-edge innovation, and ensures that the international community sees the United States as a leader on spectrum issues,” Politico reported.\n\nTheir endorsement triggered internal pushback from Milley, who was cited in a Pentagon memo arguing against the policy, according to Politico. Sen. Mike Rounds, who currently serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, told Politico at the time that he’d never seen such a policy rift between the Pentagon and joint chiefs before.\n\n“The joint chiefs nonconcurred with [Austin’s] recommendation — I’ve never heard of that ever happening before,” Rounds told the outlet “I have spoken not just to General Milley but to a number of other uniformed individuals who have real concerns with this even as late as yesterday.”\n\nMilley’s opposition could be explained by several factors, Dees told the DCNF.\n\n“It may have just been a controlling bureaucratic approach without realizing the broader implications,” he said. “But there were plenty of people pulling his sleeves, probably some people within the Pentagon.”\n\nMilley did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They are considering the offer!\".\n\nThis bold statement emerged just hours after King Charles inaugurated the Canadian Parliament, appearing to firmly underscore Canada's autonomy amid growing U.S. pressure.\n\nThe Royal couple's brief yet significant visit featured a majestic ceremonial march and conveyed diplomacy alongside genuine sympathy for the Commonwealth nation.\n\n Although most of the content in the King's thirty-minute oration was crafted by Canadian officials, Charles brought personal elements to the fore and aft, paying homage to Canada's distinctiveness and prominence globally, reports the Mirror. \n\n\"It is with a sense of deep pride and pleasure that my wife and I join you here today, as we witness Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride, unity, and hope,\" Charles said.\n\nKing Charles expressed his deep affection for Canada, saying: \"As I have said before, 'Every time I come to Canada... a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart.' I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada's unique identity.\"\n\nMany saw this as a subtle nod to Canada's autonomy. The King continued, \"Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect.\"\n\nHe reiterated the government's firm stance, stating: \"The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.\"\n\nConcluding his speech on a quintessentially Canadian note, he referenced the national anthem: \"The True North is indeed strong and free!\".\n\nThe grandeur of the Royal arrival matched the tone of his address. Thousands lined the streets as 28 majestic horses escorted the Royal procession through Ottawa.\n\nAs part of the procession, the King and Queen Consort rode in the historic 130 year old State landau, prompting cheers and affectionate shouts of \"we love you King Charles\" from enthusiastic onlookers waving flags. \n\nUpon his arrival at the Senate, King Charles was warmly greeted by Prime Minister Mark Carney and his wife Diana, marking his 20th official trip to Canada—a visit that strongly underscored his resolve to stand with the country amid growing global strains.\n\nYet questions linger around whether Charles' scrupulous diplomacy will continue to foster goodwill with Washington.\n\nSpeculation is rife about how the King's carefully chosen words will sit with President Trump's camp, not least since Charles extended a rare second state visit invitation to Trump personally.\n\n A Royal insider confided to ITV : \"He is thoughtful, has mastery of that diplomatic tight rope and has become even more acutely aware of how to walk it since he acceded to the throne.\"\n\nThe same source added: \"People will understand the King's distinct, constitutional roles as Head of State for Canada and Head of State for the UK – and if anyone can fulfil those two separate roles adroitly, without favouring one over another, it's him.\"\n\nWith ongoing tensions over tariffs and sovereignty issues between Ottawa and Washington simmering, Royal aides are confident that Charles is well-prepared to navigate any 'regional challenges'.\n\nCanadians are juxtaposing an important proposal from the Americans against the reassurance provided by their Monarch, who finished his speech with profound thanks for the warm welcome and a poignant reminder of Canada’s enduring strength, unity, and freedom.","summary":"King Charles' state visit to Canada was seen as a symbol of unity with the Commonwealth realm, but Donald Trump has demanded the country become part of the US","url":"https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trump-demands-canada-becomes-31736297","image":"https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article31736296.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Canada-Royal-Visit-25146783398224.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 00:29:29","author":"Michael D.

Addressing a press briefing, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that the country will continue to vet whether a student or a tourist needs a visa.

We're going to continue to vet. Whether you're a student or a tourist who needs a visa, or whoever you are, we're going to be looking at you. Why would it seem to be such a controversial thing that's going on? But it shouldn't be,\" Tammy Bruce said.\nThis development comes after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered US embassies and consular offices to stop scheduling new visa interviews for student applicants as the Donald Trump administration is considering strict vetting of applicants' social media profiles, according to a diplomatic cable obtained by Politico. Also Read | India Will Not Tolerate Any Nuclear Blackmail and Will Strike Decisively at Terrorist Hideouts: All-Party Delegations.\nTammy Bruce further mentioned that the steps taken by the Trump administration might come off as \"counterproductive\" but she emphasised it is essential to make sure people coming to US understand its law.\n\"We're not going to lay out here with the media, the nature of the steps that are taken, the methods that we use that would seem to be a little bit counterproductive, perhaps, but it is a goal, as stated by President Trump and Secretary Rubio to make sure that people who are here and understand what the law is, that they don't have any criminal intent, that they are going to be contributors to the experience here, whether however short or long their stay is, and so the details of which I won't reveal. But it's one that will hopefully achieve our understanding of who deserves to visit this country and who does not,\" she said. Earlier in the day, Politico reported that the order to pause the new visa interviews for student applicants was given to mark a broader application of existing vetting procedures to restrict foreign students' entry to American schools and colleges.\nHowever, the cable does not detail what social media activity will be reviewed, it refers to executive orders focused on counterterrorism and antisemitism, Politico reported.\nPrevious guidance from administration included social media checks for returning students who had participated in protests related to Gaza. Many State Department officials have complained privately for months that past guidance, for, say, vetting students who may have participated in campus protests, has been vague.\nThe administration has previously criticised some universities, especially Harvard, over issues related to campus protests and antisemitism. It has also increased immigration enforcement efforts that have included student visa holders.

The announcement comes as the United States faces growing threats from adversaries around the world who are making significant inroads in artificial intelligence and drone technology. North Korea, China and Russia denounced Trump’s missile shield plan following its announcement. The system is estimated to cost roughly $175 billion and will use space-based sensors, interceptors and other advanced missile defense technologies. LASERS, SPACE RADARS, MISSILE INTERCEPTORS: DEFENSE LEADERS LAY OUT VISION FOR TRUMP'S 'GOLDEN DOME' PROJECT Approximately $25 billion dollars for the Golden Dome missile defense system is included in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill, which was narrowly passed by the U.S. House late last week. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in a May report that the space-based interceptors could cost between $161 billion and $542 billion over 20 years. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, touted Trump’s announcement as a \"game-changing\" security investment for generations of Americans. \"The Golden Dome will progressively protect our nation from aerial attacks from any foe. Within the last four decades, our adversaries have developed more advanced and lethal long-range weapons than ever before, including ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles capable of striking the homeland with either conventional or nuclear warheads,\" he said in a statement.

There's no attempt to reduce head acceleration, so I do not support it,' she told the NZ Herald.\nProfessor Patria Hume, an expert in sports science and injury prevention, said the sport is 'a step backwards'.\n'This is a reckless and dangerous spectacle,' she said.\n\nManawatū Police Inspector Ross Grantham confirmed the young man was playing an impromptu tackle game with friends when the injury occurred and he couldn't be saved\n'The science is clear – repeated head impacts increase risk of long-term brain damage.'\nRun It Straight's founder, Christian Lesa, said community support remains strong despite backlash and stated the game should only be played under strict conditions. \nSports star Burgess defended the concept, calling it a safe simulation of past combat.\nEvent spokesperson Billy Coffey said organised competitions involve waivers, pre- and post-medicals, and on-site ambulances.\nHe claimed it gives former athletes a chance to 'get off the couch' and reconnect with their competitive spirit.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBritish youths warned not to take part in trend after Kiwi teenager is killed in controversial game - but UK stars 'support it'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

China is ASEAN’s top trading partner, and has sought to present itself as a reliable ally to the region amid its rivalry with the U.S. The GCC supplies over a third of China’s crude oil imports.\n\n“China will join ASEAN and the GCC in forging synergies that multiply rather than simply at our own strength,” he said.\n\nBrunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, one of the world’s wealthiest men and longest-reigning current monarch, was missing from the three-party summit. He attended ASEAN summits on Monday and the ASEAN-GCC meeting earlier yesterday.\n\nAnwar later told reporters that the sultan, 78, was hospitalized due to fatigue. “He is feeling a little tired, so he’s just resting” at the National Heart Institute, Anwar said. Brunei officials couldn’t immediately be reached for details.\n\nMalaysia is the current chair of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nEarlier, Anwar told a separate ASEAN-GCC forum that partnership between the two blocs would be key to navigate an increasingly complex global economy and geopolitical challenges. He later said the two sides planned to launch talks to establish a free trade area.\n\nKuwait’s Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Khalid Al Sabah said the two blocs, which held their first summit in Riyadh in 2023, would build on their momentum to deepen cooperation and “improve our ability to face crisis.” He said the GCC is ASEAN’s seventh-largest trade partner, with total trade reaching $130.7 billion in 2023.\n\nThe GCC comprises the oil-producing nations of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Anwar said last week the GCC already has strong links with the U.S. and “wants to be close to China too.”\n\nASEAN has maintained a policy of neutrality, engaging both Beijing and the United States, but U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats of sweeping tariffs came as a blow. Six of the bloc’s members were among the worst hit, with tariffs between 32% and 49%.\n\nTrump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs in April for most of the world, and this month struck a similar deal with key rival China, easing trade war tensions. ASEAN is seeking a summit with Trump on the tariffs, while moving to expand trade ties with China and others.\n\nAnwar told a news conference at the end of the summit that ASEAN wasn’t pivoting towards China but it works with both Beijing and Washington because it makes economic sense.\n\n“I don’t think (ASEAN) is tilting in anyway,” he said.\n\nCollins Chong Yew Keat, a foreign affairs, strategy and security analyst with Universiti Malaya, said the ASEAN-GCC-China summit underscored Beijing’s efforts to strengthen support during its trade battle with the U.S. He noted it came on the heels of Trump’s recent charm offensive in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhile relying on U.S. defense support, ASEAN is increasing reliance and partnership with China and other U.S. rivals, Chong said. The bloc has failed to take strong action against Beijing’s aggression in the disputed South China Sea, he said. ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims with China, which asserts sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea.\n\n“If this continues under the current Trump administration, it will create further room for Washington to distance itself from the region, which will spell disaster and create an even deeper Chinese presence,” he said. \n\nThis story has been corrected to show that combined ASEAN-GCC-China GDP is nearly $25 trillion, not $25 billion.

weapons","text":"Australia should be looking to expand its defence capabilities in space due to threats posed by nuclear-armed foes, Scott Morrison says.\n\nThe former prime minister is now the chairman of Space Centre Australia, which plans to set up a major space hub in Cape York.\n\nMr Morrison said on Wednesday that while the West still had “quite a significant advantage over potential adversaries”, foes were swiftly progressing technologically.\n\n“Space is increasingly part of what we must now do in defence,” he told Sky News.\n\n“Back in 2020 we actually defined space as a war fighting domain and set our defence forces on the path to be able to participate.”\n\nMr Morrison said there was “not a thing you do almost today, whether it’s on land or in sea or in air, that doesn’t depend on the assets and capabilities that you have in space”.\n\n“Currently, the US and its allies (have) a quite a significant advantage over potential adversaries, but you know that is changing,” he said.\n\n“We’re seeing what the Chinese and Russians are doing.\n\n“There’s reports of even Russia having a nuclear anti-satellite weapon that they’ve been developing.\n\n“China has increasingly more manoeuverable satellites and developing much more sophisticated technologies, which enables them to use that to target movement of forces and other assets around the globe, through their missiles and other offensive weapons.\n\n“So space, whether we like it or not, is part of modern warfare.”\n\nMr Morrison’s comments came after Donald Trump announced his plan for a “Golden Dome” to protect the US from potential nuclear attacks.\n\nThe system, which the US President said he wanted built before the end of his term, would use ground-based interceptors and satellites to protect against hi-tech threats, including hypersonic missiles.\n\nMr Morrison said he could see Australia playing a role in the dome’s development and even adopting the tech down the line.\n\n“It’s very possible that it could be extended to other allies and partners,” he said.\n\n“But I imagine the price on that would be pretty strong, certainly in the early phases.\n\n“But we can play a role, and that’s important because we’re allies.”\n\nThe Trump administration has attached a $US175bn ($271.4bn) price-tag to the Golden Dome.\n\nThough, the US Congressional Budget Office has calculated it could cost $US831bn ($1.3 trillion) over two decades.\n\nMr Morrison, a founder of AUKUS, also used a speech on Tuesday to call for space to be part of the defence pact’s third pillar.\n\nAUKUS Pillar I focused on submarines, with the US and UK sharing technology to build nuclear-powered boats in Australia.\n\nAUKUS Pillar II focused on enhancing trilateral co-operation on cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and quantum technologies.\n\nMr Morrison said a “strong argument can also be made that such initiatives could form the basis of Australia’s contribution to a new Pillar III for AUKUS which, as its founder, I would strongly support”.","summary":"A former prime minister is urging Australia to look to space, warning the country’s

27 (UPI) -- The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is increasing its oversight of states to prevent misuse of Medicaid funding to provide services for those who unlawfully entered the United States.\n\nFederal Medicaid funding is only available for emergency medical services for \"non-citizens with unsatisfactory immigration status\" when they otherwise would qualify for Medicaid coverage, the Health and Human Services Department said in a news release shared with UPI.\n\nSome states, though, \"have pushed the boundaries\" and made taxpayers liable for benefits that are not allowed by federal law.\n\n\"Medicaid is not and cannot be a backdoor pathway to subsidize open borders,\" CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said.\n\n\"States have a duty to uphold the law and protect taxpayer funds,\" Oz added. \"We are putting them on notice - CMS will not allow federal dollars to be diverted to cover those who are not lawfully eligible.\"\n\nCMS is increasing federal oversight of Medicaid at the state level to identify and stop unlawful spending through:\n\nFocused evaluations of state Medicaid spending reports.In-depth reviews of states' financial management systems.Assessments of eligibility rules and policies to close loopholes.\n\n\"Medicaid funds must serve American citizens in need and those legally entitled to benefits,\" said Drew Snyder, deputy administrator and director of the Center for Medicaid & CHIP Services.\n\n\"If states cannot or will not comply, CMS will step in,\" Snyder said.\n\nAny unlawful spending of Medicaid dollars by states on \"non-citizens\" is subject to recoupment of the federal share of such expenses, according to the HHS Department.\n\nSnyder on Tuesday notified respective state officials of the increased oversight in a letter with the subject, \"Ending taxpayer subsidization of open borders.\"\n\nHe cited President Donald Trump's Feb. 19 executive order requiring federal agencies to uphold the rule of law, thwart the waste of taxpayer dollars and protect benefits for U.S. citizens.\n\nCMS \"is committed to faithfully implementing the president's executive order,\" Snyder said.\n\n\"The plain text of federal law ... generally prohibits illegal aliens from obtaining most taxpayer-funded benefits,\" he wrote.\n\nFederal law makes it national policy that \"'aliens within the nation's borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs,'\" and \"'it is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits,'\" Snyder said.\n\nHe encouraged all states to review their policies, systems and internal controls to ensure each legally complies with federal law when claiming medical assistance and administrative expenditures.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office in October reported that the Biden administration's open-border policy cost taxpayers more than $16.2 billion to provide Medicaid-funded emergency services for \"illegal aliens\" after President Joe Biden took office.","summary":"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is increasing its oversight of states to prevent misuse of Medicaid

More first term.\nGetty Images\n\nTrump’s Approach to Pardons\n\nDuring his first term, President Donald Trump issued a total of 238 pardons and commutations (143 pardons and 85 commutations). Like presidents before him, the majority of those receiving commutations had served a significant part of their prison term while most all of those pardoned had completed their sentence years ago. In fact, most executive orders for commutations come in the final days of the administration, not at the beginning.\n\nIn terms of raw numbers, Trump’s 238 clemency actions in his first term rank lower compared to other recent presidents, particularly Barack Obama. However, his total number of pardons was higher than those of Bush and Clinton in their respective first terms. In terms of total clemency actions, Trump’s record is relatively modest compared to some of his predecessors. Here's a rough comparison:\n\nBarack Obama: Issued 1,927 clemency actions, including 1,715 commutations, the most of any president in U.S. history. The vast majority of whom were serving time for crimes related to distribution or production of narcotics.\n\nGeorge W. Bush: Issued 200 pardons and 11 commutations during his two terms.\n\nBill Clinton: Issued 456 pardons and 61 commutations during his presidency.\n\nRonald Reagan: Issued 406 pardons and 58 commutations.\n\nOut With The Old\n\nIn March 2025, President Donald Trump dismissed Liz Oyer, the head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of the Pardon Attorney. Oyer had held the position since 2022, overseeing the review of federal clemency requests and advising the president on potential pardons. Following Oyer's departure, Ed Martin Jr., a former interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, was appointed as the new pardon attorney. Martin has indicated plans to scrutinize pardons issued by the previous administration, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability in the clemency process.\n\nNow, Trump has turned his attention to granting commutations and pardons to high profile prisoners. He is even issuing pardons to those convicted but have not even started their prison sentence, something extremely rare.\n\nHigh Profile Pardons\n\nOn January 20, 2025, Trump issued a sweeping series of pardons and commutations for individuals involved in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. This action was one of his first acts upon returning to the White House. In addition to granting pardons, President Trump directed the Department of Justice to seek the dismissal of all pending cases related to the Capitol riot. Since then, he has started to look at individual cases that he believes represent overreach by both the US Attorney’s Offices and federal judges.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSpotlighting Venture’s Rising Stars: The 2025 Forbes Midas Brink List\n\nGoogle’s Gmail Upgrade—Why You Need This New Email Address\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, May 27\n\nOn May 27, Trump announced that he would grant full pardons to reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been convicted in 2022 on charges of tax evasion and bank fraud. The Chrisleys were sentenced to 12 and 7 years in federal prison, respectively, and began serving their sentences in January 2023. Julie won an appeal for a resentencing but U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross sentenced her again to 7 years, then ending her chance at freedom. Their convictions stemmed from allegations that they used false documents to secure over $30 million in loans, which they used to fund a lavish lifestyle.\n\nLast week, Trump issued a pardon to a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted on fraud and bribery charges and had yet to even enter prison. Jenkins, a long-time supporter of Trump, was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison. \"Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL,\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.\n\nThe Future of Pardons\n\nThe New York Times has reported that individuals are lining up contacts in Trump’s inner-circle to lobby for them. Former U.S. Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer stated in an interview on NBC News that Trump’s actions on pardons are troubling. “Granting pardons to people in this manner threatens to upend ongoing prosecutions by the Department of Justice. It also threatens to delegitimize the prosecutorial institutions that we have historically relied on.”\n\nThere is no shortage of people to pardon and Trump will most certainly consider more in the future including that of his long time confidant Steve Bannon and Trump’s current adviser on economic issues Peter Navarro. Both Navarro and Bannon completed their prison terms last year.\n\nWith Trump’s newly found penchant for crypto currency, he could look to pardon someone like FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried. There are also big names in politics like former congressman George Santos and former senator Robert Menendez who are both heading to prison soon. In business he could look to someone like Elizabeth Holmes to make a statement about aggressive prosecutions as she serves over 11 years in prison.\n\nOthers have speculated that with a former convicted felon pardoned by Trump during his first term and now activist, Alice Johnson, as Pardon Czar, that the pardons will keep on coming. Trump seems to be using his executive powers to reshape prosecutions brought by US Attorneys and sentences handed down by federal judges. Trump has wasted no time in calling out prosecutors and judges appointed by Joe Biden.\n\nSome are thinking that Trump, keen to do govern by executive order, has found that pardons can set the agenda for a Department of Justice and judiciary that he wants.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"President Donald Trump continued with an aggressive approach to issuing pardons and commutations.

The school filed a lawsuit April 21 over the administration's calls for changes to the university's leadership, governance and admissions policies. Since then, the administration has slashed the school's federal funding, moved to cut off enrollment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.\n\n Contracts include scientific research, executive training \n\nThe administration has identified about 30 contracts across nine agencies to be reviewed for cancellation, according to an administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly and provided details on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe contracts total roughly $100 million, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations. The contracts include executive training for Department of Homeland Security officials, research on health outcomes related to energy drinks and a contract for graduate student research services.\n\nAgencies with contracts that are deemed critical are being directed not to halt them immediately, but to devise a plan to transition to a vendor other than Harvard.\n\nThe letter applies only to federal contracts with Harvard and not its remaining research grants.\n\n Trump threatens to give Harvard's funding to trade schools \n\nTrump laid into Harvard on social media over the weekend, threatening to cut an additional $3 billion in federal grants and give it to trade schools across the United States. He did not explain which grants he was referring to or how they could be reallocated.\n\nThe president also accused Harvard of refusing to release the names of its foreign students. In a new line of attack, he argued that students' home countries pay nothing toward their education and that some of the countries are “not at all friendly to the United States.\"\n\nInternational students are not eligible for federal financial aid, but Harvard offers its own aid to foreign and domestic students alike.\n\n“We are still waiting for the Foreign Student Lists from Harvard so that we can determine, after a ridiculous expenditure of BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, how many radicalized lunatics, troublemakers all, should not be let back into our Country,” Trump said on social media.\n\nIt was not clear exactly what the president was referring to. The federal government already has access to visa information and other records on foreign students at Harvard and other universities.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has demanded that Harvard turn over a trove of files related to its foreign students, including disciplinary records and records related to “dangerous or violent activity.”\n\nHarvard says it complied, but the agency said its response fell short and moved to revoke the university's ability to enroll foreign students. A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the move after Harvard sued.\n\n Harvard rallies against Trump administration \n\nTrump administration officials have said some of Harvard's international students are promoting antisemitism on campus. But the ban on international students has “nothing to do with combating antisemitism,” said Jacob Miller, a former president of Harvard Hillel, who is graduating this week with math and economics concentrations. \n\n“Antisemitism is a real problem. It’s a problem at Harvard. It’s a problem in our country,\" Miller said Tuesday at a rally outside Harvard's gates. \"These policies will do nothing to combat this age-old hatred. Instead, they are designed to divide us. ... The Jewish community rejects this administration’s narrative. We will not allow our identities to be invoked to destroy Harvard.\"\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism. He said Harvard would not budge on its “its core, legally-protected principles” over fears of retaliation. \n\nHarvard's international students await further court rulings to find out whether they can enroll in summer or fall classes. Some say they're discussing backup plans. \n\nThe government's ban would not apply to students graduating this week, such as Jemma Liu, a Chinese student who studied landscape architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design.\n\n“I hope the situation will resolve,” she said Tuesday. “We’ll have to see what happens next. But I do feel a privilege that I can actually graduate tomorrow.”\n\n“What the international students are caught in right now is just a limbo,” said Leo Gerdén, a graduating senior from Sweden.\n\n Other nations respond \n\nJapan's government said Tuesday that it's looking for ways to help Harvard's foreign students. Education Minister Toshiko Abe told reporters she planned to ask Japanese universities to compile measures to support international students.\n\nThe University of Tokyo, Japan’s top school, is considering temporarily accepting some Harvard students hit by the Trump sanctions.\n\nUniversities in other countries have made similar moves, including two in Hong Kong that recently extended invitations to Harvard students.\n\nOn Harvard's campus, law student Carson Durdel said he was proud of the university for standing up to Trump. He said intellectual independence has historically made the United States strong.\n\n“It’s the reason we are like a beacon for the rest of the world,” he said. “I think that undermining those things, cutting those things is not only a bad short-term view but a horrendous long-term view.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The 71-metre first-stage booster will not attempt a return to its launch pad but target the Gulf of Mexico for a controlled splashdown.\n\nFederal regulators granted SpaceX a license for Starship's latest flight attempt just four days ago, capping a mishap investigation that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.\n\nIts last two test flights - in January and March - were cut short moments after lift-off as the vehicle blew to pieces on its ascent, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and disrupting scores of commercial airline flights in the region.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones around the ascent path for Tuesday's launch, the ninth full test flight of the Starship campaign.\n\nThe previous back-to-back failures occurred in early test-flight phases that SpaceX had easily achieved before, dealing a striking setback to a program that Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the rocket company in 2002, had sought to accelerate this year.\n\nMusk, the world's wealthiest individual and a key supporter of US President Donald Trump, was especially eager for a success after vowing in recent days to refocus his attention on his various business ventures, including SpaceX, following a tumultuous foray into national politics and his attempts at cutting government bureaucracy.\n\nMusk is counting on Starship to fulfil his goal of producing a large, multipurpose next-generation spacecraft capable of sending people and cargo to the moon later this decade and ultimately flying to Mars.\n\nCloser to home, Musk also sees Starship as eventually replacing the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as the workhorse in the company's commercial launch business, which already lofts most of the world's satellites and other payloads to low-Earth orbit.\n\nMusk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight, to be livestreamed under the banner slogan The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary.\n\nHe was expected to offer new timelines and development plans for sending cargo and potentially astronauts aboard Starship on voyages to Mars, a tantalising but still-distant future destination for human spaceflight that poses major technical hurdles for SpaceX and NASA.","summary":"SpaceX has launched its Starship mega rocket following

independence plea","text":"In an apparent swipe at King Charles' symbolic show of solidarity with Canada, Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Tuesday to stoke the flames for unification with North America under the Stars and Stripes. Trump declared: \"I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!\". The proclamation came just hours after King Charles had solemnly opened the Canadian Parliament, a move interpreted as a robust endorsement of the country's sovereignty amidst mounting U.S. influence. The Royal couple's visit was fleeting yet laden with significance, marked by a grand ceremonial procession and an address merging diplomatic tact with sincere warmth. Though the bulk of the King's half-hour speech was prepared by the Canadian government, Charles infused it with personal touchstones at the beginning and end, invoking an emotional tribute to Canada's identity and stature on the world stage. \"It is with a sense of deep pride and pleasure that my wife and I join you here today, as we witness Canadians coming together in a renewed sense of national pride, unity, and hope,\" Charles imparted. \"As I have said before, 'Every time I come to Canada... a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart.' I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada's unique identity.\" Interpreted by many as a tacit endorsement of Canada's sovereignty, the King added, \"Today, Canada faces another critical moment. Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the Government is determined to protect.\" Delivering the government's committed stance, Charles emphasised: \"The Government will discharge its duty to protect Canadians and their sovereign rights, from wherever challenges may come at home or abroad.\" Wrapping up his speech in a decidedly Canadian manner, he invoked the words of the national anthem: \"The True North is indeed strong and free!\" The grandeur of the Royal arrival paralleled his address. Throngs of people crowded the streets as 28 regal horses escorted the Royal cortege through Ottawa. Amidst the procession, the King and Queen Consort made their way in the historic State landau that dates back 130 years, eliciting cheers and shouts of affection like \"we love you King Charles\" from enthusiastic spectators brandishing flags. Greeted by Prime Minister Mark Carney and his wife Diana upon reaching the Senate, this was the King's 20th official visit to Canada, with this occasion clearly signalling an unwavering show of support amidst escalating global tensions. But can Charles' meticulous diplomacy be sufficient to maintain amity with Washington? Observers are already pondering if the King's pointed remarks will rankle Trump's entourage, especially after Charles offered Trump a special personal invitation for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK. A Royal informant disclosed to ITV : \"He is thoughtful, has mastery of that diplomatic tight rope and has become even more acutely aware of how to walk it since he acceded to the throne.\" The insider further remarked: \"People will understand the King's distinct, constitutional roles as Head of State for Canada and Head of State for the UK – and if anyone can fulfil those two separate roles adroitly, without favouring one over another, it's him.\" As strains over tariffs and autonomy keep brewing between Ottawa and Washington, palace staff affirm that Charles is primed to 'rise above' any 'regional challenges' that may surface. In the meantime, Canadians are measuring a significant American proposition against the solace brought by their King, who concluded his address with \"heartfelt gratitude\" for their reception and a strong reminder of Canada's strength, unity, and freedom.","summary":"Donald Trump has renewed his push for Canada to become the 51st State of the United States, just hours after King Charles III delivered a powerful speech to the Canadian Parliament.","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/donald-trump-demands-canada-becomes-35296777","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35296767.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_BESTPIX-President-Trump-Visits-Arlington-National-Cemetery-On-Memorial-Day.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 00:02:44","author":"Michael D.

According to Devin Nunes, chair of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, it’s because bitcoin is “an apex instrument of financial freedom” and will protect TMTG from “harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.”\n\nTMTG isn’t the same as Trump’s other private crypto company, World Liberty Financial. That’s the one behind the spectacularly corrupt dinner, where people spent millions on Trump’s dumb memecoin to get access to the president. The dinner included crypto bro Justin Sun, who spent $40 million to attend because he owed Trump for dropping an SEC lawsuit against him.\n\nWhen the Financial Times first reported on TMTG’s crypto deal, the company derided it as “fake news,” but then officially announced the deal the very next day. Though the Financial Times initially got the amount of the investment wrong, its reporting was otherwise spot on. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump said that the United States will establish a bitcoin reserve, meaning that Trump’s private company is making major moves in the same bitcoin market in which the administration wants to spend taxpayer dollars.\n\nTrump is already deep into crypto corruption. Besides dropping the SEC suit against Sun, he also pardoned the crypto bros who ran BitMEX, a cryptocurrency exchange that served as a great way to launder money. For good measure, he also pardoned the company of BitMEX, which wasn’t really a thing anyone thought a president could do. \n\nBut for anyone who might feel squeamish about getting into crypto, there are other ways to bribe the president. \n\nTrevor Milton, founder of Nikola, a company that was supposed to make electric semitrucks but instead just took people’s money, got a pardon after donating about $920,000 to a Trump-affiliated political action committee during the 2024 election. \n\nAnd when Paul Walczak’s mother attended the $1 million-per-head dinner at Mar-a-Lago in April, Walczak got a pardon a few weeks later. He had pleaded guilty to tax crimes after spending years withholding employment taxes from his employees, which he then used to live a lavish lifestyle, including buying a $2 million yacht. \n\nTrump is openly selling access to the presidency, and he’s not going to stop anytime soon. His private companies function not just as a way to get money in his pocket, but also as a vehicle to influence presidential policy, just by writing the biggest check. \n\nAll of this is deeply corrupt, but since Congress has abandoned oversight of Trump, it’s unstoppable.","summary":"Good news for anyone who hasn’t yet had the opportunity to shower money on President Donald Trump’s private companies: Trump Media &amp; Technology Group is going to raise $2.5 billion to invest in bitcoin, giving big-money investors another chance to buy influence. \n\n\n\nAnnouncing the investment, TMTG, the parent company of Truth Social, filed a report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stating that it already has subscription agreements from about 50 institutional investors. \n\n\n\nBut don’t expect the SEC, which Trump says is only subject to his authority and is not an independent regulator, to step in anytime soon. \n\n\n\nWhy is TMTG, which is ostensibly a media company, spending $2.5 billion on crypto?

Sir Keir managed to lower tariffs in a deal with the US but failed to cut the 10 per cent baseline rate.\n\nWhile Lord Mandelson said he could understand Mr Trump's 'frustration' that led him to introduce tariffs, he said they were not 'welcome'. \n\n'We need to address [reciprocal tariffs] and we're agreed to do so,' he said, adding that the UK and US could use 'non-tariff barriers'.\n\nWarning that Europe must no longer rely on the US for security, he said that Mr Trump had done the bloc 'a favour' in saying he would no longer be responsible for protecting allies. \n\nHe said the world had lived in a 'fantasy' that a 'friendly heavyweight across the water would be there when the going gets tough'.\n\nLord Mandelson's remarks came after Pedro Serrano, the EU Ambassador to the UK, said the UK and EU were 'old friends entering an era of new beginnings'. \n\nWriting in the i newspaper, he said that their respective economies were 'joined at the hip' and that more would be done to strengthen ties.","summary":"The Ambassador to the US failed to rule out rejoining the bloc in the future as he spoke about the agreement yesterday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14755415/US-ambassador-Lord-Mendelson-says-UKs-reset-EU-just-beginning-fails-rule-rejoining-bloc.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/28/00/98805863-0-image-m-24_1748387644955.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 00:00:16","author":"Claire Ellicot,Editor","authors":["Claire Ellicot","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":325571584,"title":"Tariffs, tailwinds &amp; trade talk: India bets on a US deal to turbocharge exports","text":"The finance ministry said a successful India-US trade deal could “flip current headwinds into tailwinds,” opening up access to new markets and bolstering exports. The ministry flagged potential trade barriers in the wake of the additional 26% tariffs proposed by the US as a “key external vulnerability” in its monthly economic review for April that was issued on Tuesday. Private capital expenditure could lag, with firms adopting a more cautious stance amid global uncertainty and tighter financial conditions, it said, underscoring importance of a balanced trade agreement with the US. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal recently met US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington DC, their second meeting within a week, to carry forward negotiations on a trade deal. Some experts expect the accord to be in place by early July, before expiry of the 90-day pause on tariffs that US President Donald Trump announced in April. The US remained India's top trading partner for a fourth straight year.121448069 Growth Momentum Bilateral goods trade amounted to $132 billion in FY25. India had a merchandise trade surplus of $41 billion with the US last fiscal year. The Indian economy remains resilient, the ministry stressed, with FY26 growth possibly hitting the upper end of the 6.3-6.8% range projected in February’s Economic Survey. Although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected India’s FY26 growth rate at 6.2%, others have pegged it at 6.3-6.7%. Sustained government capital expenditure, income tax relief unveiled in the February budget and interest rate cuts by the central bank will likely stimulate consumption and investment further, aiding growth amid easing inflation, the finance ministry said in its review. The economy is marked by robust domestic fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic management, and a capacity to withstand external shocks, according to the finance ministry document. “Strong private consumption, especially the rural rebound, and robust services exports remain the primary engines of growth,” it said. The services sector remains firmly in the expansionary zone, offsetting some of the softness in merchandise exports. The rupee has remained relatively stable, and foreign exchange reserves continue to provide a cushion against external shocks, the ministry said in the review","summary":"The finance ministry expects that a potential India-US trade deal will significantly boost exports and transform economic challenges into opportunities.

According to the Energy Information Agency (EIA), it’s the second-largest natural gas producing state, “the third-largest coal-producing state,” and the second-largest generator of electricity from nuclear power (in 2023). “Pennsylvania is the second-largest net supplier, after Texas, of total energy to other states,” EIA reported.\n\nHydrogen key to domestic energy - Clean Air Task Force screenshot - May 8-2025\nClean Air Task Force screenshot\n\nTwo new hydrogen hubs are being developed there too, courtesy of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), though they are on the chopping block in the new GOP bill.

As I have said before, every time I come… a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart. \n\n'I have always had the greatest admiration for Canada's unique identity, which is recognised across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defence of national values, and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.'\n\nHe added: 'It has been nearly 70 years since the sovereign first opened Parliament. In the time since, Canada has dramatically changed – repatriating its constitution, achieving full independence and witnessing immense growth. \n\n'Canada has embraced its British, French and indigenous roots, and become a bold, ambitious, innovative country that is bilingual, truly multicultural and committed to reconciliation.'\n\nHe concluded: 'The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada. It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present. When my dear late mother addressed your predecessors seven decades ago, she said that in that age, and against the backdrop of international affairs, no nation could live unto itself. \n\n'It is a source of great pride that, in the following decades, Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.'\n\nCharles was met with a standing ovation from all in parliament yesterday. But former prime minister Justin Trudeau raised eyebrows after wearing green and red Adidas Gazelle trainers to the event.\n\nAfterwards, Charles and the Queen embarked on a brief walkabout before conducting a solemn wreath-laying ceremony at the National War Memorial, then flying out of the country just 24 hours after they had arrived.","summary":"In a 'Speech from the Throne' (made of wood from a Windsor oak, no less) King Charles, 76, spoke of his 'deep pride and pleasure' at witnessing 'Canadians coming together'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14755371/King-Charles-message-Trump-Canada-parliament.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/28/00/98805635-0-image-m-15_1748387820322.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:55:00","author":"Editor,Rebecca English","authors":["Editor","Rebecca English"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.26},{"id":325567200,"title":"World News | California Changes Competition Rules for Track and Field Finals Amid Row over Trans Athlete","text":"Sacramento (California), May 28 (AP) The governing board for California high school sports is changing its competition rules at this weekend's state track and field championships to allow more girls to take part amid a controversy over the participation of a trans student-athlete. The California Interscholastic Federation said it was extending access for more “biological female” athletes to participate in the championship meet. Also Read | Philippines Introduces 14-Day Visa-Free Entry for Indian Tourists, Check Eligibility Criteria and Other Details. The group announced the change Tuesday after President Donald Trump posted on his social media site about the participation of a trans athlete in the competition. “Under this pilot entry process, any biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their section's automatic qualifying entries in the CIF state meet, and did not achieve the CIF state at-large mark in the finals at their section meet, was extended an opportunity to participate in the 2025 CIF state track and field championships,” the federation said in a statement. Also Read | India Will Not Tolerate Any Nuclear Blackmail and Will Strike Decisively at Terrorist Hideouts: All-Party Delegations. “The CIF believes this pilot entry process achieves the participation opportunities we seek to afford our student-athletes.” The move comes amid a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have limited transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. At least 24 states have laws on the books barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain women's or girls sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court. A recent AP-NORC poll found that about 7 in 10 US adults think transgender female athletes should not be allowed to participate in girls and women's sports at the high school, college or professional level. That view was shared by about 9 in 10 Republicans and roughly half of Democrats. The federation didn't specify whether the change applies to all events or only events where a trans athlete has qualified for the final. The change only applies to this weekend's competition. The organisation didn't immediately answer a question about how many students it expects will be affected by the change. The rule change may be the first attempt nationally by a high school sports governing body to expand competition when trans athletes are participating, though the action is so far limited to a single meet. In a social media post Tuesday morning, Trump threatened to pull federal funding in California if the state did not bar trans students from participating in girls sports. The post referenced AB Hernandez, a trans athlete who competes in girls track and field. Hernandez is scheduled to compete in the girls varsity triple jump, high jump and long jump in the state finals this weekend. She won the Division 3 girls long jump and girls triple jump and placed seventh in the high jump at the Southern Section Division Finals on May 19, according to CIF results. “THIS IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump also criticised Maine's Democratic governor after she said the state would take the president to court over his effort to keep trans girls from competing in girls sports. The Trump administration launched an investigation earlier this year over a law that says districts can't force teachers and staff to notify parents if a student changes their gender identity at school.

But day in and day out in Washington, people who have been involved for years in the kind of – let’s call it normal pay-to-play politics – will tell you that this is completely outside anything that a president has ever been involved in. The sheer monetization of the White House is taking all kinds of forms.”\n\n“One of which is that government affairs executives in town are now quite aware of the fact that if you want to get a one-on-one conversation with the president, the price tag is $5 million.That may go to MAGA Inc. – the super PAC that is accumulating money for midterms – but the truth is, as one executive put it to me, we have no idea where that money goes, whether it’s in favor of your interests or against you. I think that what we’re seeing now is just a level of utter and shameless transaction.”\n\nTrump sparked a fervor in the news in May when he chose to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar as a gift to use as the new Air Force One. The news led to an outcry from many, concerns about safety from others, and jokes from many late night hosts. Stephen Colbert applauded the president’s baffling decision after it was announced.\n\n“After all these years, it’s nice that Donald Trump is still able to surprise us,” Colbert joked. “It’s kind of sweet how he keeps the nausea fresh!”\n\n“Because we all know he’s a sack of loose skin stuffed with greed, but I don’t think any of us expected him to accept a luxury 747 jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One,” he continued.\n\nWatch the full MSNBC clip above.","summary":"\"The sheer monetization of the White House is taking all kinds of forms\" Evan Osnos tells MSNBC\n\n\nThe post DC Politicos Know Trump Will Meet Anyone One-on-One for $5 Million, New Yorker Writer Says: ‘Shameless Transaction’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-meeting-5-million-evan-osnos-msnbc-new-yorker/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EvanOsnos.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:53:00","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":325559402,"title":"Trump To Pardon Reality TV Stars Doing Time For  Tax Evasion, Bank Fraud","text":"CHRISLEY KNOWS BEST — Season:6 — Pictured: (l-r) Chase Chrisley, Grayson Chrisley, Julie Chrisley, Todd Chrisley, Chloe Chrisley, Savannah Chrisley and Faye Chrisley.\nNBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pardoning reality television stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who are currently serving federal prison sentences for conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion. In a video that appeared today on X (formerly Twitter), Trump calls the Chrisleys’ daughter, Savannah Chrisley, who spoke at the Republican Convention last July and appeared on Lara Trump’s Fox News show early this month, to share the news. In the video, Trump says he hopes to push the paperwork through by tomorrow.\n\nThe Chrisleys rose to fame as stars of the reality television show “Chrisley Knows Best.” The successful series followed the Chrisley family, including adult children and Todd Chrisley’s mother, inspiring several spinoffs. Part of the appeal of the series was the family’s lavish lifestyle.\n\nIn 2019, the couple was indicted by a federal grand jury on multiple charges. The Chrisleys’ accountant, Peter Tarantino, was also indicted on tax-related offenses.\n\nAt the time, Todd declared his innocence on Instagram, blaming a former employee, claiming:\n\n“Needless to say, we fired the guy and took him to court — and that’s when the real trouble started. To get revenge, he took a bunch of his phony documents to the U.S. Attorney’s office and told them we had committed all kinds of financial crimes, like tax evasion and bank fraud. That got their attention all right, but once we had a chance to explain who he was and what he’d done to us, they realized it was all a bunch of nonsense and they sent him on his way.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office also released a statement at the time—it was very different. U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak said about the indictment, “Todd and Julie Chrisley are charged not only with defrauding a number of banks by fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in loans, but also with allegedly cheating taxpayers by actively evading paying federal taxes on the money they earned. Celebrities face the same justice that everyone does. These are serious federal charges and they will have their day in court.”\n\nAccording to Pak, the charges and other information suggested that Todd and Julie Chrisley conspired to defraud multiple banks by providing false information, including personal financial statements and forged bank statements, while applying for and receiving millions of dollars in loans. After fraudulently obtaining these loans, the Chrisleys allegedly spent much of the proceeds for their personal benefit.\n\nThe government also claimed that, in 2014, two years after the purported bank fraud scheme ended, Todd and Julie Chrisley utilized altered bank statements and a falsified credit report that had been physically modified through cutting, taping, or gluing when applying for and securing a lease for a home in California.\n\nThe couple was also charged with conspiring with their accountant, Peter Tarantino, to defraud the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). According to the Department of Justice, in February 2017, Todd Chrisley claimed on a national radio program that “obviously the federal government likes my tax returns because I pay 750,000 to 1 million dollars just about every year so the federal government doesn’t have a problem with my taxes.” However, according to the original indictment, the Chrisleys allegedly failed to file income tax returns for the 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years in a timely manner or pay federal income taxes for any of those years on time.\n\nThe Chrisleys and Tarantino were also accused of taking steps to obstruct IRS collection efforts, which included hiding income and lying to third parties about their tax returns. Tarantino was hit with a separate charge of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Special Agents.\n\n(Notwithstanding Chrisley's claims that it was a set-up, it isn't the first time the Chrisleys faced tax troubles. A bankruptcy petition from 2012 claiming tens of millions of dollars in debt listed several local tax collectors listed as debtors. In 2017, a local TV station, Nashville's WSB-TV, reported that the Chrisleys were slapped with nearly $800,000 in liens by the Georgia Department of Revenue.)\n\nConvictions and Appeals\n\nOn June 7, 2022, a jury convicted the Chrisleys on all counts of a superseding indictment, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit tax evasion. Julie was convicted of an additional charge of obstruction of justice because she submitted a fraudulent document in response to a grand jury subpoena. Tarantino was also convicted of multiple tax-related violations. In November, the couple was sentenced: Todd received a 12-year prison term and Julie received a seven-year sentence. (Tarantino received a three-year sentence.)\n\nKeri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, said about the outcome of the trial, “In the end, when driven by greed, the verdict of guilty on all counts for these three defendants proves once again that financial crimes do not pay.”\n\nThe couple maintained their innocence and appealed their sentences. Todd’s appeal was rejected, but Julie’s case was returned for resentencing due to a discrepancy in calculations. In 2024, a federal judge declined to reduce Julie’s sentence. At the time, she expressed remorse for her actions, saying, \"I would like to say I’ve had years to think about what I’ve wanted to say, and I’m sorry for my actions and situations that led us to where we are today.”\n\nBefore the pardon news, Julie had an expected release date of January 8, 2028, and Todd was expected to be released on April 7, 2032.\n\nSavannah Chrisley continued to be in the public eye, speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the presidential election, Savannah reportedly sought a pardon for her parents. She visited the White House in February 2025, and appeared on \"My View with Lara Trump\" on Fox News earlier this month. She also pitched a new reality TV show: According to The Hollywood Reporter, a newly greenlit docuseries, The Untitled Chrisleys Project, will premiere later this year on Lifetime television. Savannah is named as an executive producer on the show, which aims at “pulling back the curtain” with “unprecedented access to their lives in a deeply personal and dramatic new series.”\n\nTrump is expected to sign the pardons within 24 hours.

She definitely wants at least one more baby, maybe more, the Vogue writer shared. But Hailey plans to take it 'a kid at a time.'\nHailey also noted that Justin sees her as a 'superhero' after welcoming their child: 'At least that was the case for me,' she added.\nAnd Hailey added their baby made their marriage even stronger.\n'It’s been my biggest teacher so far,' she said, 'the biggest teacher in my relationship. You see your partner so differently.'\nJustin is an 'amazing dad,' she added: 'I think you empathize with your parents a lot more. There’s so much perspective that comes with it.'\nJustin also emailed the writer this note in support of his wife: 'She’s in the spotlight, and has the attention because of her effortless knack for style, business, art, and fashion. And the way she makes being a mom and wife look easy.'\nInstagramJustin Bieber\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJustin Bieber's latest social media stunt for wife Hailey is slammed by fans after viral Vogue 'disrespect'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 19\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

(AP pic)WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Canada could join his proposed “Golden Dome” missile defence system for free – but only if it becomes part of the US.Otherwise it would cost Canada US$61 billion to be part of the system, said Trump, who has repeatedly called for the US’ northern neighbour to become the 51st state.Canada has expressed interest in joining the missile system – plans for which Trump unveiled last week to defend against a wide array of enemy weapons – but has firmly rejected any loss of sovereignty.“I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network.“But (it) will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!”There was no immediate response from Canada to Trump’s claims.Trump announced plans for the “Golden Dome” system a week ago, saying it would eventually cost around US$175 billion and would be operational by the end of his term in 2029.Experts say the scheme faces huge technical and political challenges, and could cost far more than he has estimated to achieve its goals.Trump also said at the time that Canada was interested in joining the missile system. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney then confirmed that his country had held “high level” talks on the issue.Nato members Canada and the US are partners in continental defence through the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).But the scheme now seems set to add to the tensions that Trump has sparked with Canada.Carney politely but firmly dismissed Trump’s calls for Canada to become part of the US when he visited the White House earlier this month, saying his country was “never for sale.”The Canadian premier and Trump did however appear to smooth over some of the strains over the tariffs that the US president has slapped on Ottawa.","summary":"The US leader says the northern neighbour must pay US$61 billion to join the defence system if it stays separate.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/05/28/trump-says-golden-dome-free-for-canada-if-it-joins-us/","image":"https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4aa1aecc-trumps-golden-dome-20052025.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:48:13","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":325558048,"title":"Bush-appointed judge torches Trump with 27 exclamation points — and a gumbo recipe — in ruling against an executive order","text":"A conservative federal judge has ruled that Donald Trump’s executive order punishing a law firm tied to his political opponents “must be struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional,” dealing yet another blow to the president’s retaliatory campaign against lawyers and legal groups that opposed his agenda.\n\n“Indeed, to rule otherwise would be unfaithful to the judgment and vision of the founding fathers!” wrote Judge Richard Leon in Washington D.C.\n\nLeon’s colorful 73-page opinion uses 27 exclamation points — including in the very second sentence — and compares Trump’s executive order against the law firm WilmerHale to a gumbo that gives him “heartburn,” whose recipe he included.\n\n“The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting,” wrote Leon, who was appointed by George W. Bush.\n\n“The Founding Fathers knew this! Accordingly, they took pains to enshrine in the Constitution certain rights that would serve as the foundation for that independence,” he added.\n\nBut nearly 250 years later, “several executive orders have been issued directly challenging these rights and that independence” within the last few months, Leon wrote.\n\nTrump’s executive orders single out individual firms that worked for prominent Democratic officials or represented causes he opposed while imposing punitive measures on the law firms like banning their employees from federal buildings and stripping their security clearances.\n\nSeveral firms arranged deals with the Trump administration — including agreeing to perform millions of dollars in pro-bono work — to avoid the president’s sanctions.\n\nWilmerHale had previously employed former special counsel Robert Mueller, who returned to the firm after leading the investigation into whether Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election to boost Trump’s chances of winning.\n\nThe firm also represented Democrats against Trump’s 2020 election challenges, members of Congress seeking his tax records, and inspectors general who sued Trump after they were abruptly terminated at the start of his administration, among others.\n\nIn his order on March 27, Trump claimed the firm “abandoned the profession’s highest ideals and abused its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States.”\n\nThe order accuses so-called “Big Law” firms of actions that “threaten public safety and national security, limit constitutional freedoms, degrade the quality of American elections, or undermine bedrock American principles.”\n\nIn his order, Judge Leon slammed the administration for throwing “a kitchen sink of severe sanctions on WilmerHale for this protected conduct!”\n\n He added: “Taken together, the provisions constitute a staggering punishment for the firm’s protected speech! It both threatens and imposes sanctions and uses other means of coercion to suppress WilmerHale’s representation of disfavored causes and clients.”\n\nLeon said Trump’s executive order is clearly “motivated by the president’s desire to retaliate against WilmerHale for its protected activity.”\n\nThis is “not a legitimate government interest, and the order’s unsupported assertion of national security will not save it!” he wrote.\n\nIn a footnote in his ruling, Leon said Trump’s executive order is “akin to a gumbo.”\n\nSections of the order outlining sanctions against the firm “are the meaty ingredients—e.g., the Andouille, the okra, the tomatoes, the crab, the oysters,” Leon wrote.\n\n“But it is the roux … which holds everything together,” he added, pointing to the president’s justification for attacking the firm.\n\n“A gumbo is served and eaten with all the ingredients together, and so too must the sections of the Order be addressed together,” Leon wrote. “This gumbo gives the Court heartburn.”\n\nSeveral federal judges in recent days have struck down similar orders.\n\nLast week, District Judge John Bates, another Bush appointee, blocked a near-identical order targeting the firm Jenner Block after finding it was clear retaliation for the firm’s employment of Andrew Weissmann, whom Trump accused of making a career out of “weaponized government and abuse of power.”\n\n“Like the others in the series, this order … makes no bones about why it chose its target: it picked Jenner because of the causes Jenner champions, the clients Jenner represents and a lawyer Jenner once employed,” Bates wrote.\n\nAnother federal judge is currently weighing a decision in a similar case against Trump’s order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey.","summary":"The president’s executive orders punishing law firms that clash with his agenda face a wave of legal actions","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-richard-leon-wilmerhale-executive-order-b2758881.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/27/23/56/Trump-ret3eopf.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Mj3GoYH6-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:41:22","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":325560052,"title":"Judge Delivers Strong Rebuke Against Trump’s Executive Order","text":"In the past two weeks, a federal judge has, for the second time, ruled against one of President Donald Trump’s executive orders. These orders targeted certain law firms he disfavored and were deemed unconstitutional.\n\nOn March 27, Trump, who served as both the 45th and 47th president, issued an Executive Order called “Addressing Risks from WilmerHale.” This directive, similar to others, accused the Los Angeles-based legal firm, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP—known as WilmerHale—of engaging in activities harmful to significant American interests. The order aimed to exclude its employees from federal government positions.\n\nThe very next day, WilmerHale filed a 64-page complaint asking the court to enjoin Trump’s executive order as “unconstitutional.” The government, in turn, moved to dismiss the lawsuit entirely, turning the dispute into a battle over motions for summary judgment.\n\nNow, Senior U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, largely ruled for the plaintiffs, while dismissing three of the eleven counts as moot, in a 73-page memorandum opinion.\n\nLove true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.\n\nThe court immediately gets to the heart of the matter by animatedly opining on the integral and time-honored role lawyers have played in American history and politics.\n\n“The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting,” Leon begins. “The Founding Fathers knew this! Accordingly, they took pains to enshrine in the Constitution certain rights that would serve as the foundation for that independence. Little wonder that in the nearly 250 years since the Constitution was adopted no Executive Order has been issued challenging these fundamental rights.”\n\nThe quick history lesson immediately ends in the present, with the judge castigating Trump‘s attacks on WilmerHale and other law firms.\n\n“I have concluded that this Order must be struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional,” Leon writes. “Indeed, to rule otherwise would be unfaithful to the judgment and vision of the Founding Fathers!”\n\nNotably, Leon uses a grand total of 27 exclamation points in his opinion — an apparent attempt to underscore what the judge views as the severity of the constitutional violations in Trump’s order.\n\nIn strikingly similar fashion to the order targeting the Chicago-based law firm of Jenner & Block LLP — enjoined in full last week — Trump’s order chides WilmerHale for employing onetime special counsel Robert Mueller and lawyers who worked with him during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nNoting that the order is “replete” with references to Mueller and his investigation, the judge finds these complaints clear evidence of an attempt to violate the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee.\n\n“Trump disfavors WilmerHale’s representation of certain causes and the firm’s statements regarding Mueller,” the opinion goes on. “The Order suppresses that disfavored speech by imposing severe sanctions on WilmerHale both directly and indirectly. This viewpoint discrimination is ‘an egregious’ violation of the First Amendment!”\n\nTrump’s Mueller fixation is of a piece with broader viewpoint discrimination in the context of attacks on law firms, Leon explains.\n\nFrom the opinion, at length:\n\nWilmerHale’s representation of clients in litigation is speech. The Order attacks the viewpoints WilmerHale expressed over the course of these representations, describing WilmerHale’s work as “partisan” and “political,” and maligning WilmerHale’s advocacy on behalf of causes disfavored by President Trump. The Order is also motivated by WilmerHale’s decision to “welcom[e]” Mueller to the firm and its statements that Mueller “embodies the highest value of our firm and profession.”\n\nThe First Amendment bars the Government “from relying on the ‘threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion … to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored speech.” Yet that is exactly what the Order here does: It both threatens and imposes sanctions and uses other means of coercion to suppress WilmerHale’s representation of disfavored causes and clients.\n\nThe court also found the order violated the First Amendment right to petition the government.\n\n“Filing and pursuing lawsuits are forms of protected petitioning,” the judge observes.\n\nIn making its case, WilmerHale “has both alleged and shown” that Trump’s order punished the firm for past litigation on immigration and electoral issues. Additionally, the order has undermined the firm’s ability to “pursue litigation in the future” by revoking security clearances and by limiting “employees’ access to federal buildings and ability to engage with federal employees,” the opinion explains.\n\nWhen pressed to account for limiting such access, the government only offered a “national security” justification, which the law firm conceded might have been sufficient. But, the judge notes, was merely conclusory.\n\nHere, the court is withering.\n\n“[T]he Order does not explain how WilmerHale’s conduct has threatened national security or how restricting its access to federal buildings or federal employees would remedy those threats,” the opinion goes on. “Instead, and as I have already found, the Order is plainly motivated by the President’s desire to retaliate against WilmerHale for its protected activity. This is not a legitimate Government interest, and the Order’s unsupported assertion of national security will not save it!”\n\nThe court also found that a section of the order purporting to mandate that all government contractors must disclose “any business” with the law firm violated WilmerHale’s right to free association.\n\nIn this area, the court professes puzzlement as to how such disclosures and revocations relate to what the government claims is an effort to prevent “racial discrimination,” finding no link between the contracting section and the offered justification.\n\n“[T]he Order is an unconstitutional impairment on the firm’s and federal contractors’ freedom of association,” Leon writes.\n\nWhile the court rejected three of the law firm’s claims — largely for procedural reasons — with prejudice, the upshot renders those rejections largely irrelevant because the entire order is enjoined.\n\n“The Order is unconstitutional, and thus defendants do not have a legitimate interest in enforcing the Order,” Leon summarizes. “In fact, it is ‘obvious’ that the ‘enforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.’ Enjoining the Order serves the public interest by, for example, eliminating an obstacle to free speech and preserving the independent and adversarial nature of our judicial system.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump is pictured attentively listening during the ceremonial swearing-in of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Judge Delivers Strong Rebuke Against Trump&#8217;s Executive Order first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/judge-delivers-strong-rebuke-against-trumps-executive-order/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Judge-warns-Trump-against-end-run-around-injunction.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:40:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":325563702,"title":"Trump tax cheat pardoned after his mom attended ritzy $1million dinner","text":"President Donald Trump has issued a pardon for a man who defrauded millions of dollars to fund his lavish lifestyle after his MAGA donor mom attended a ritzy $1million-per-head Mar-a-Lago gala.\n\nPaul Walczak was due turn hand himself over to authorities to begin his 18 month sentence and pay $4.4million in restitution for his crimes when Trump issued the pardon.\n\nIn an application to be shown mercy, Walczak claimed that prosecutors targeted him due his his mother, Elizabeth Fago's political activity.\n\nFago had raised millions of dollars for Trump's campaigns and was involved in leaking Joe Biden's daughter Ashley's addiction diary ahead of the 2020 election in an effort to sabotage his chances.\n\nInitially, the pardon plea went ignored. Walczak was convicted of 13 counts of tax crimes, stealing more than $10million to fund his lavish lifestyle.\n\nBut then Fago received an invitation to Trump's exclusive $1million-per-head fundraising event at Mar-a-Lago in April.\n\nThe invitation promised unprecedented face-to-face access to the president as part of an intimate, candlelit dinner.\n\nLess than three weeks later, Trump issued Walczak a full and unconditional pardon, sparing him from paying the hefty restitution fee or turning himself over to authorities to be taken into custody.\n\nThe White House told the New York Times that Walczak had been 'targeted by the Biden administration over his family’s conservative politics' - echoing the same sentiment he himself had used in his pardon request.\n\nWalczak had joined his mother's nursing home business after dropping out of college, climbing the ranks to become chief executive.\n\nShe sold the business in 2007 and the pair invested $18million into another healthcare venture in South Florida.\n\nBut prosecutors said that by 2011, Walczak had stopped paying his own taxes, and then between 2016-2019 he withheld more than $10million from his employees' pay checks.\n\nHe had insisted this money was being used for his employees' social secutity, Medicare and federal income taxes, when in reality it was funding the lavish lifestyle he had grown accustomed to.\n\nThis money was used to purchase a $2million yacht, travel the world in luxury and go on shopping trips at Cartier and Bergdorf Goodman. \n\nBy February 2023, he had been found and charged for his crimes. Walczak pleaded guilty in November 2024 - days after Trump was re-elected to the White House.\n\nThen, days after Trump's inauguration, he submitted his pardon request.\n\nHis family had been in Trump's orbit for years prior.\n\nFago and other relatives had spent the 2020 election night at a White House watch party.\n\nAfter Trump's defeat, they were invited back to the White House a month later to attend a Christmas party.\n\nFago has been pictured alongside the president and attended his 2017 inauguration. \n\nMs. Fago and other family members spent election night 2020 at a White House watch party. After Mr. Trump lost, they were invited back the next month to attend a White House Christmas party. \n\nTrump has been on a pardoning spree since returning to the White House.\n\nMost recently, he vowed to issue pardons for reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were found guilty of defrauding banks out of $30 million.\n\nOn Monday he issued a pardon for a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted last year of federal bribery charges, averting prison time for the officer while also blasting Biden's 'corrupt' Justice Department.\n\n'Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL,' Trump posted.\n\n'He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.'\n\nJenkins, a former Virginia sheriff who served an area about two hours outside Washington, D.C., was convicted by a jury in December 2024 for accepting more than $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointments as auxiliary deputy sheriffs.\n\nIn March, Jenkins was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison.\n\nUpon returning to the White House, Trump swiftly issued pardons for all January 6 rioters.","summary":"Paul Walczak was due to hand himself over to authorities to begin his 18 month sentence and pay $4.4million in restitution for his crimes when Trump issued the pardon.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14755159/paul-walczak-pardoned-trump-maga-mom-1million-gala.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/27/23/98804019-0-image-m-48_1748385808560.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-27 23:35:02","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":325558280,"title":"Letters: The Delta tunnels should never be built","text":"Delta tunnel project\nshouldn’t be built\n\nRe: “Newsom tries Hail Mary for Delta tunnel” (Page A7, May 23).\n\nTom Philp laments the fact that Gov.

She was about nine weeks pregnant with a boy in February when her boyfriend woke up to her gasping for air in her sleep and gurgling.\n\nHer mother told the media that her daughter had sought treatment at Northside Hospital the previous night and was released after being administered medication, but no CT scans or other tests.\n\nSmith was taken to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta \"with severe head pains,\" according to MSNBC. \"A CT scan showed blood clots in her brain, and soon physicians declared Smith to be brain-dead.\" She has now been on life support for over 90 days.\n\nThe murky legality around this centers on Georgia's LIFE Act, a law banning most abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy once \"fetal cardiac activity can be detected\" — aka Georgia's heartbeat law. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law in 2019, but it was only invoked once Roe v. Wade was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022.\n\nOfficials seem to be in disagreement about the interpretation of the law, though. The office of the Georgia Attorney General issued a statement reading, \"There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death. Removing life support is not an action with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy.\" However, Ed Setzler, a Republican state senator who sponsored the 2019 bill, said he thinks it's \"completely appropriate that the hospital do what they can to save the life of the child [...] I think this is an unusual circumstance, but I think it highlights the value of innocent human life. I think the hospital is acting appropriately.\"\n\nMedical staff at Emory, where Adriana Smith worked, have been ignoring the wishes of her family in favor of the law, which leaves a glaring gray area in the case of a legally dead mother.\n\nBrain death is \"the legal and medical standard for death in the United States.\"\n\nSmith's mother and family have expressed that they've had virtually no say in her medical care or that of her fetus. \"She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,\" her mother said. \"It's torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son — I bring him to see her.\"\n\nThe family has reportedly been by her side every day since she was admitted to the hospital. Smith's young son reportedly thinks his mother is just sleeping.\n\nAccording to Atlanta television station WXIA-TV, \"The plan now is to keep Smith alive until doctors believe the baby can survive outside the womb — likely at 32 weeks gestation.\" That would mean 10 more weeks on life support; Smith's family said doctors have told them there are no other legal ways to proceed. \"This decision should’ve been left to us. Now we're left wondering what kind of life he'll have — and we're going to be the ones raising him,\" Smith's mother said.\n\nShe told WXIA-TV that the family is concerned about the health of Smith's baby, as doctors have told them he has fluid on the brain. \"[Adriana] is pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,\" Smith's mother said.\n\nMany people have taken to social media to express their outrage over the anti-abortion legal and medical system that has allowed Adriana Smith to be kept alive by machines for the sake of preserving her pregnancy.\n\nRelated: This Reporter's Reaction To Donald Trump Talking About The Declaration Of Independence Is Going Viral\n\n\"I'm the mother of a brain-dead son whose organs were donated,\" said TikTok user Jennifer Comstock (@positivejen) in a video earlier this week. \"People need to understand what it's like to keep a brain-dead body alive.\" She goes on to explain that it took time for the hospital to stabilize and prepare his organs for donation and to find suitable recipients because of his blood type.\n\n\"So I sat in that hospital bed with him for two days, because despite the fact that he was legally dead, that was my baby, and I wasn't leaving him in that hospital alone,\" she says.\n\n\"During that two days, the amount of interventions they had to do to keep my son's body was unbelievable,\" Comstock says. \"Obviously, he was on a ventilator, but you also can't regulate your own heartbeat. You can't maintain your own blood pressure. They're giving you all kinds of medications [...] His kidneys were failing. They had to give him medication to fix that.\"\n\nShe goes on: \"They would fix one thing, and another thing would go wrong. And sitting there watching it felt wrong. It was horrible watching what they were doing to him.\"\n\nBut, as Comstock says, there's one major difference between the case of her 30-year-old son and that of Adriana Smith: \"My son wanted to be an organ donor, and that is why we continued to do it. And my son saved lives,\" she said. \"But I don't think you guys understand. This woman is not in a vegetative state; she's not in a coma. She's dead.\"\n\n\"Her body is not functioning. Her brain is not producing the hormones required to sustain a pregnancy.\"\n\n\"This family is being put to torture. I did this of my own free will, and I am still traumatized,\" she concludes.\n\nRelated: A Clip Of Donald Trump Getting Angry After Being Fact-Checked Is Going Mega Viral, And It Sums Up His Entire Presidency In A Nutshell\n\nPeople replied to the video in droves. This person wrote about how having a body that is technically \"alive\" is only one part of the equation in a healthy pregnancy.\n\nSomeone else echoed what Jennifer said in the video about the crucial difference in having the choice to be kept on life support; she replied, \"Pregnant Georgia women seem to belong to the state not to them selves.\"\n\nA lot of other folks just said that what's happening to Adriana Smith is wrong:\n\nAnother creator, Grace Wells (@0fficial.c0wgirl on TikTok), made a video with the heading, \"What does it mean to be born of a corpse?\"\n\n\"Adriana smith deserves to rest. Her family deserves peace. Humanity deserves safety from birth by corpse,\" she captioned the video.\n\n\"You think that a brain-dead person just isn't conscious anymore and their body's all working and so their body's just gonna grow the baby either way?\" she says. \"That's not what's happening.\"\n\n\"It is not pro-life to force a child to be born of a corpse,\" Grace repeats twice. \"And what are the medical implications of a fetus gestating in the chemical environment of a corpse, of a brain-dead person who has to be on medication to regulate every single bodily function because their brain cannot do it because they are dead?\"\n\n\"You can't even eat lunch meat when you are pregnant. But you think it's pro-life to force a brain-dead person, a corpse, to be medically kept some semblance of alive to force the birth of a 9-week-old fetus?\" Wells says.\n\n\"If that's something that you can justify, we have very different interpretations of what is sacred,\" Wells says. \"What does it mean for us as a society that we are attempting to do this as a political stunt? Force a child to be born of a corpse.\"\n\nShe also says that if Smith's child is born healthy enough to grow up, they will \"live with the public political fear of keeping their dead mother on life support [...] following them for the rest of their life. That's not pro-life. That's not compassionate. It's not Christian. It's not healthy. It's disgusting. It's desecration of a corpse. It's horrific.\"\n\nThe comments resoundingly agreed. Some pointed out how Adriana Smith's case joins the long history of medical abuse and racism toward Black women.\n\n\"It's so sick. I also think about trauma and medical debt they are laying on her poor family,\" this person wrote.\n\nOne user pointed out the hypocrisy of this case within the \"pro-life\" movement.\n\nAnd finally, someone shared the haunting reality that may await Adriana Smith's unborn child:\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

A US official said Tuesday the suspension is intended to be temporary and does not apply to applicants who already had scheduled their visa interviews.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an internal administration document. A cable signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press says the State Department plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting.

Asked about the suspension at a briefing Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the US uses every available resource to vet people applying for visas. “We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that's coming here, whether they are students or otherwise,” Bruce said. The move, first reported by Politico, is the latest in the Donald Trump administration's crackdown on international students. Last week, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University's ability to enrol international students, removing the college from the programme that allows schools to sponsor foreign students for visas. That effort was quickly challenged in court and for now is blocked by a federal judge. This spring, the administration also revoked the legal status of thousands of international students already in the country, leading some to leave the US out of fear of deportation. After many students filed successful legal challenges, the administration said it was restoring the students' legal status. But the government also expanded the grounds for terminating international students' legal status going forward. Trump's previous administration stepped up scrutiny of all visa applicants, introducing reviews of their social media accounts. The policy remained during former president Joe Biden's administration. An extended pause in scheduling student visas could lead to delays that may disrupt college, boarding-school or exchange students' plans to enrol in summer and fall terms. A downturn in enrolment of international students could hurt university budgets. To make up for cuts in federal research funding, some colleges shifted to enrolling more international students, who often pay full tuition.
