Ahead of a July 9 deadline, US officials are deep in talks with major trading partners in Asia and Europe.New agreements pushedWashington is pushing for new agreements that would include restrictions on Chinese content, or secure commitments to counter what Washington sees as China’s unfair trade practices..China, US tariff de-escalation: By the numbers.White House says July deadline for higher tariffs may be extended.Fed's Powell repeats warning about tariffs as some GOP senators accuse him of bias.Trump's tariff drive faces major legal setback, what happens next .In the first such deal, President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a tiered tariff agreement with Vietnam..Exports to the US from the Southeast Asian nation will be charged a 20% rate, Trump said in a social-media post, with 40% levied on any goods deemed to be transshipped through the country. .White House says July deadline for higher tariffs may be extended.That will hit products with components from China and possibly other nations, which are routed through Vietnam or subject to only minimal final assembly before being exported to the US. The approach mirrors provisions in an existing US trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.No detailsAlthough Trump shared the broad contours of the agreement, the White House has not yet released further details and some of the agreement could be in development, so it’s unknown yet how damaging this could be for China’s growing exports to Vietnam. China’s Ministry of Commerce didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment. .India, another nation seen as close to a deal, has also been negotiating over “rules of origin.” Washington wants at least 60% of a product’s value added locally to qualify as “Made in India” and benefit from the deal, Bloomberg News previously reported. India has pushed to bring that down to around 35%, according to the report. .Dilemma“Asia’s dilemma when it comes to Trump’s trade war is all about dependence on US final demand while relying heavily on China’s value added in domestic production,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Natixis SA, said in a recent report, adding that Vietnam, Cambodia and Taiwan were among the most exposed..China, a larger trade partner than the US for most Asian economies, has warned of consequences if its interests are threatened, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is likely to raise that again on his visit to Europe this week for talks in Brussels, Germany and France..“China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of Chinese interests in exchange for so-called tariff reductions,” the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Saturday, repeating earlier warnings. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”.RetaliationThe Vietnam deal risks provoking retaliatory steps from China, according to Bloomberg Economics..“Beijing has made clear that it would respond to deals that came at the expense of Chinese interests and the decision to agree to a higher tariff on goods deemed to be “transshipped” through Vietnam may fall in that category,” Bloomberg’s Rana Sajedi wrote in a research note. .Trump’s 90-day pause on what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of America’s trading partners ends on July 9. Unless those countries reach trade deals with the US, they could potentially face much higher tariffs..Some governments are making moves to stay on the right side of Washington. Vietnam, Thailand and South Korea have all put in place measures to stop goods from being rerouted through their countries to the US since Trump’s tariffs were unveiled in April..South Korean customs announced a crackdown on transshipments, citing a rise in the practice. Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te also flagged the issue and followed up with new rules requiring all US-bound exports to carry a legal declaration they were made on the island..Export controls.Another concern for Beijing is whether the US could convince others to impose or tighten export controls on high-tech equipment, which would further hamper Chinese efforts to buy the tools it needs to produce advanced semiconductors..Taiwan in June added Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to its so-called entity list, barring Taiwanese firms from doing business with them without government approval. .Europe in delicate positionThe pressure isn’t limited to Asia. Europe, too, finds itself in a delicate position. The EU is China’s largest export destination for electric vehicles, and investment from Chinese firms into the bloc plus the UK hit 10 billion euros ($12 billion) last year, according to recent research from Rhodium Group. .Yet trade tensions are rising. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently accused Beijing of “weaponizing” rare earths and magnets and warned of the risks posed by Chinese overcapacity..Beijing is particularly concerned that the EU might sign up to provisions similar to those in the UK’s deal with the US, which included commitments around supply chain security, export controls, and ownership rules in sectors like steel, aluminum and pharmaceuticals. While the language did not name China, Beijing criticized the agreement in a rare public statement, interpreting it as a direct challenge, the Financial Times reported..“China is clearly worried that the EU will accept the same wording as the UK did on export controls,” said Joerg Wuttke, a partner at the Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington and former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China. “They are pushing the EU not to do this, and the US is pushing the EU to do it.”.Brussels and Washington are aiming to reach some form of an agreement before July 9, when Washington is set to impose a 50% tariff on nearly all EU products. With European exports to the US worth more than double the amount to China, the bloc sees Washington as the more important partner, giving the US leverage in the talks..China’s weekend statement is “obviously aimed entirely at Brussels,” said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels, who was recently in Beijing for meetings ahead of an EU-China summit this month. “China is concerned what the EU might agree with the US.”.Long-term riskThe long-term risk for Beijing is that these efforts coalesce into a broader shift — not just a US-led campaign to curb Chinese exports, but a reshaping of global trade around “trusted” supply chains, with China increasingly on the outside. In a visit to Southeast Asia earlier this year, President Xi Jinping urged the region to stand together as an “Asian family,” warning against trade fragmentation..Beijing has often responded to actions it opposes with targeted trade measures. When the EU imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles last year, China launched anti-dumping probes into European brandy, dairy and pork. It halted Japanese seafood imports in 2023 after Group of Seven meetings in Japan were seen as critical of China. A spat with Australia in 2020 led to trade restrictions on billions of dollars’ worth of goods, including lobsters, wine and barley..“If some agreements explicitly list China as a target and show that some countries are cooperating or collaborating with the US to ‘contain China,’ then China will definitely respond,” said Tu Xinquan, dean of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing and a former adviser to the Chinese Commerce Ministry.","summary":"Beijing Braces for US Trade Deals That Seek to Shut Out China","url":"https://gulfnews.com/business/markets/beijing-braces-for-us-trade-deals-that-seek-to-shut-out-china-1.500184535","image":"https://media.assettype.com/gulfnews/import/2024/11/07/TRUMP-XI_19305e24169_large.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 01:16:46","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ae","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":337656762,"title":"Gold prices slide after ahead of Fed-watched jobs data","text":"Gold eased after a three-day gain, before pivotal US jobs data due later Thursday that may shape the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing path..Bullion traded near $3,345 an ounce after gaining more than 2% earlier this week, as markets shifted focus to the incoming payrolls report that’s forecast to show 106,000 jobs were added to the economy in June, which would mark the fewest in four months.

It invoked emergency presidential powers to expel migrants before allowing them to apply for asylum. A coalition of immigrants and immigrant rights groups then sued the administration in February.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss has now granted the plaintiffs a partial summary judgment, finding that Trump's proclamation and implementation guidance from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nIn his proclamation, Trump had said that the screenings of asylum seekers under the INA -- enacted by Congress -- can be \"wholly ineffective\" but that the law grants the president \"certain emergency tools\" if he were to find that the entry of any class of immigrants would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\n\n\"The court recognizes that the Executive Branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,\" Moss wrote.\n\nBut he added that the Immigration and Nationality Act \"provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country.\"\n\nBut Moss found that the INA \"provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country\" and that the government lacked the statutory or constitutional authority to adopt an \"alternative immigration system\" to the one outlined by Congress.\n\nHe stayed his ruling for 14 days in anticipation of a likely appeal from the Trump administration, and deferred judgment on whether the government should grant relief to plaintiffs who are no longer in the United States and other aspects of the lawsuit.The judge's ruling also did not include an injunction at this stage and ordered the parties to submit a joint status report proposing a briefing schedule on unresolved issues.\n\nIt comes after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last week in the case of Trump v.

In his media statement shortly after the talks, Prime Minister Modi said both sides have set a target of doubling the two-way trade in the next five years and that India is not just a partner but a co-traveller in Ghana’s development journey.

But he put the ruling on hold for two weeks to give the government time to appeal. In an order January 20, Mr. Trump declared that the situation at the southern border constitutes an invasion of America and that he was “suspending the physical entry” of migrants and their ability to seek asylum until he decides it is over.\n\nTrump announces trade deal with Vietnam that will let U.S. goods into country duty-free\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam on Wednesday that would allow U.S. goods to enter the country duty-free.

For example, the United States, under the leadership of Donald Trump, has been withdrawing from various multilateral cooperation efforts. This includes the World Health Organization (WHO), the Paris Agreement, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).Trump has also implemented a series of measures to protect the domestic market through high tariffs on imported goods, sparking a trade war with China and disrupting global supply chains. Armed conflicts continue without resolution, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine entering its third year and the escalating tensions between Israel and Palestine in Gaza and the West Bank. The situation has become even more complex as Iran and Israel have been involved in a series of attacks since mid-June 2025, raising concerns of open war in the Middle East. In Asia, anxiety is on the rise as American and Chinese warships stalk each other in the contested waters of the South China Sea.MIKTA Countries Banding TogetherAmidst such global chaos, a group of middle-power countries is seeking to unite. Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Australia - part of the informal forum called MIKTA - are working to come together and define their position. They are reiterating the importance of multilateralism and building a more inclusive global order.\"MIKTA can strengthen the collective voice and become a stabilizing force in global affairs. The role of middle-power countries has now become more crucial than ever before,\" said Park Soo-deok, Charge d'Affaires of the South Korean Embassy in Indonesia, during a discussion at the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia (FPCI) office in Jakarta on Thursday, June 26, 2025.Three Agendas under South Korea's LeadershipMIKTA was formed in 2013 during the 68th UN General Assembly in New York. This forum aims to strengthen inclusive international cooperation, advance the principles of multilateralism, and bridge the interests of both developed and developing countries.South Korea currently holds the chairmanship of MIKTA. During its leadership, South Korea has set three main agendas: building global peace, promoting youth engagement, and accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\"This not only reflects South Korea's policy direction but also represents our collective aspirations and our position as a middle-power country,\" added Park. To South Korea, MIKTA countries are considered capable of bridging the interests of developed and developing countries in building a more inclusive global system.The year before, Mexico held the leadership of MIKTA. They advocated for democratic values, international law, and inclusive development. Alonso Martin, Charge d'Affaires of the Mexican Embassy in Indonesia, referred to MIKTA as a bridge between developed and developing countries.\"MIKTA must continue to uphold multilateralism, provide creative solutions to global challenges, climate change, finance, economy, and act as a bridge between developing and developed countries,\" he said. Alonso also mentioned MIKTA as a complement to other global forums such as BRICS. Mexico also initiated the strengthening of development cooperation through the 4th MIKTA Development Cooperation Network Joint Statement. This commitment will continue under South Korea's leadership.MIKTA's Void as an OpportunityFor Indonesia, MIKTA is a strategic forum to strengthen multilateral diplomacy amidst the increasing vulnerability of global cooperation principles. \"We believe that MIKTA is a strategic forum to discuss strategic issues. MIKTA should not only cover political dimensions but also economic, social, and other issues,\" said Tri Purnajaya, Director of Development, Economy, and Environment at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Despite MIKTA's grand vision, the realization of its cooperation is still considered limited. For more than a decade since its formation, MIKTA has yet to establish a business forum, and there have been no initiatives for local currency transactions among member countries in economic cooperation.\"That's why I think there needs to be something more concrete,\" said Tri. However, he sees this void as an opportunity. \"I hope MIKTA will have a greater desire, including in economic cooperation, trade, and investment,\" he added.FPCI Chairman, Dino Patti Djalal, also highlighted the importance of shared goals in every international forum, so that they do not merely become discussion platforms without influence. \"With shared goals, movements become faster and more meaningful, because there is a strong foundation to remain united and move forward,\" said Dino. The former Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister compared this with ASEAN, the European Union, and the G7, which are strong because they have clear shared goals.Dino added that following the withdrawal of the United States from various international forums during Donald Trump's leadership, there has emerged a void that can be filled by middle-power countries. \"Middle-power countries have the capacity to play a role in advancement,\" he added.Editor's Choice: DPR Holds Meeting with Foreign Minister Sugiono on Citizen Protection, GeopoliticsClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"Middle-power countries, including Indonesia, are uniting to strengthen their cooperation as part of MIKTA.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2023969/3-mikta-agendas-amidst-global-chaos-indonesia-involved","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2024/11/19/id_1354679/1354679_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-03 00:33:52","author":"Adinda Jasmine","authors":["Adinda Jasmine"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"id","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":337656730,"title":"Startups aim for over Rs 18,000 crore in D-Sreet dhamaka","text":"A dozen new-age companies that have filed their draft IPO (initial public offering) papers this year will collectively raise over Rs 18,000 crore (more than $2 billion) through fresh issuances of shares, signalling growing confidence in public markets as a fundraising avenue even for mid-to-small startups.Ecommerce platform Meesho, expected to file its draft prospectus confidentially soon, is targeting Rs 4,250 crore, the largest fresh issue in this cohort.It is followed by edtech firm PhysicsWallah at Rs 4,000 crore. ETtech\n Fintech companies Pine Labs and Groww are looking to raise Rs 2,600 crore and Rs 1,735 crore, respectively. Others including Boat, Wakefit, Capillary Technologies and Urban Company are planning smaller primary issues — each under Rs 1,000 crore. These figures exclude the offer-for-sale component, which will push the overall IPO sizes higher. ETtech\n Analysts and investment bankers said Indian startups are increasingly eyeing local stock exchanges for their listings, driven by robust valuation multiples in the public markets and growing maturity of the domestic startup ecosystem.This has particularly led to smaller companies coming to the public markets to not only raise capital but also to provide exit to their investors.By comparison, a group of five new-economy companies that went public in 2021 and 2022 — Zomato, Paytm, Delhivery, PB Fintech and Nykaa — raised more than Rs 25,000 crore in fresh capital with Zomato (now Eternal) and Paytm accounting for over Rs 17,000 crore.Following this, 2023 and 2024 saw the emergence of smaller sized public issues with companies such as Ixigo, Awfis, Blackbuck, Mobikwik and Honasa Consumer raising less than Rs 1,000 crore.“Not surprisingly India has become the third largest IPO hub after the US and China for internet companies. Most tech startups/internet companies now appear to want to list in India versus in the US as they tend to get better multiples when listed in India,” analysts at Bank of America Global Research said in a June note.“Indeed, multiple internet companies with foreign domiciles have moved back their base to India to be listed in India,” the report added.Of the 12 companies, half are taking Sebi’s confidential route to file their draft prospectuses, which allows them more time to finalise the size of their IPO as well as to keep their financials under wraps until such a time they decide to go ahead with their public issue. These include Groww, PhysicsWallah, Shiprocket, Boat, Shadowfax, and Meesho, which is yet to file.For other companies, the reasons to mop up fresh capital vary from meeting working capital requirements and repaying loans to funding expansion and investing in research and development.Metrics in focusInvestment bankers said valuations for companies will depend on market conditions as well as their business performance, including profitability and cash flows.Bengaluru-based wealth management firm Groww reported over threefold jump in its net profit to Rs 1,819 crore and a 31% rise in revenue to Rs 4,056 crore for fiscal 2025. Similarly, at-home services platform Urban Company turned profitable in FY25 posting a net profit of Rs 240 crore against a loss of Rs 93 crore in the previous financial year. Hyperlocal logistics firm Shadowfax also saw its net loss narrowing in FY24 significantly, while posting an operating-level profit.“For many of these companies, going public is an option not only because the markets are buoyant but also because they have reached a certain maturity. Broadly, the benchmarks are in place and the companies are either market leaders or profitable and are likely to notch up better multiples,” an investment banker said on the condition of anonymity. He highlighted that barring a few high-growth sectors such as quick commerce and some segments in fintech, private market funding continued to be subdued.“Even for loss-making companies, public market investors will look for some level of predictability in metrics, whether it is profitability or cash flows,” he added.ET reported in April — following the imposition of “reciprocal tariffs” by US President Donald Trump — that new-age companies could take a hard look at their plans to go public given the volatility in the broader markets. However, even at the time, investors said that companies might file for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and wait for a conducive window to secure the desired IPO pricing.","summary":"Indian startups are increasingly eyeing local stock exchanges for their listings, driven by robust valuation multiples in the public markets and growing maturity of the domestic startup ecosystem, analyst and investment bankers pointed out.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has backing from the U.S. and Israel, has taken the lead on food distribution in the area.\n\nThe foundation’s president, Johnnie Moore, told some of the group’s local aid workers have been killed and taken hostage, and claimed Hamas has put bounties on aid workers’ heads.\n\n“We’ve got to get food into the Gaza Strip, and we’ve got to get it in now, so one more time to the international community: let’s work together. The food insecurity is real. It’s a serious situation. It’s an emergency situation,” Moore said. “We’re not a political organization. We have one mission: to show up and keep feeding Gazans. We’re going to keep doing it.”\n\nThe international community does not support the foundation including key U.S. allies like Great Britain and the United Nations. They contend that aid distribution sites have been made too dangerous.\n\n“People are being killed simply trying to feed their families. The search for food must never be a death sentence … Any operation that channels desperate civilians into militarized zones is inherently unsafe,” said U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.\n\nMore than 56,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It said more than half of the dead were women and children.\n\nThe Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war killed approximately 1,200, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage.

Since that time, the signs have been used by the Democratic party as a political statement. The Idaho Democratic Party even sells these signs as part of its fundraising efforts,” the office’s statement said.\n\nInama made headlines last winter when the West Ada School District ordered her to remove her “Everyone is Welcome Here” sign featuring cartoon hands in various skin tones.\n\nInama originally took the poster down, but had a change of heart and put it back up over the weekend. \n\nThe district administration asserted that Inama needed to take it down because the message “is not something that everybody believes,” she told KTVB.\n\nAccording to emails from the district obtained by the Idaho Statesman, the district took issue with the different skin-toned hands, which apparently violated the state’s requirement that all displayed content be “neutral and conducive to a positive learning environment.”\n\nThe Idaho Democratic Party started to sell the merchandise inspired by the posters on March 25 “after hearing from Idahoans who wanted a way to show support for Ms. Inama,” the party’s communications director Avery Roberts wrote in an email to The Post. \n\n“Across the state, parents and teachers, regardless of their political affiliations, want children to have a fair shot. They’re working hard to build strong public schools where every student feels welcome and has the support they need to succeed,” Roberts wrote. \n\n“We’re not doing this to make money. The signs and stickers barely cover costs. What matters is the message. Taking a stand against discrimination shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and we hope leaders in every party see it that way.” \n\nThe office’s opinion goes on to note that Inama began displaying the signs in her classroom shortly after Trump’s first term in 2017 and accused her of hanging it to “share her personal, ideological beliefs.”\n\nPer the office’s opinion, certain types of student artwork could also be prohibited from being hung in schools.","summary":"According to emails from the district obtained by the Idaho Statesman, it took issue with the different skin-toned hands, which apparently violated the state's requirement that all displayed content be \"neutral and conducive to a positive learning environment.”   ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/idaho-ag-bans-everyone-is-welcome-here-signs-at-public-schools/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Untitled-1-78.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0xVoYXHb-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-03 00:22:31","author":"Caitlin McCormack","authors":["Caitlin McCormack"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":337650392,"title":"US judge says Huawei Technologies must face criminal case for racketeering","text":"A U.S. judge has ruled that Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly yesterday [Macau time] rejected Huawei’s request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature.\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there.\n\nDuring President Donald Trump’s first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks.\n\nIn its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company’s business dealings in Iran.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.\n\nChinese officials have accused the U.S. government of “economic bullying” and of improperly using national security as a pretext for “oppressing Chinese companies.” In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei’s lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were “impermissibly extraterritorial,” and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud.\n\nThe biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology.

Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine voted “no.” While discussing Democrats’ pushing back against the bill, Jones called out their “stunts” and said they’ve now become “the party of lame.”\n\n“I’m looking at all these, I guess we can call them stunts now, from the Democrats. Never did I think that the Democratic Party would be the party of lame. It used to be that the Republicans were right on the ideas. They were kind of corny. The Democrats have replaced it, so they’re wrong and corny now. I just look at them — look, I have my problems with some portions of the bill,” Jones said.\n\n“I want more spending cuts there. But I don’t live in this fantasy island. I understand what we’re dealing with. But this is a party that lacks creativity,” Jones added. “Take Murkowski. I can’t stand the way that she votes, but she got something out of it. She went in and says, ‘I want you to put a car back for me.’ Any Democrat could have went to the president and said ‘If you want my vote, put this in the bill.’ And they could have ran on it. I got this from my state. But they don’t want to work with them.”\n\nSince May, Republican lawmakers have pushed to get Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” to the president’s desk, with its first approval on May 22 after narrowly passing the House in a 215-214-1 vote. While some congressional Republicans like Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson voted “no,” the Senate also faced resistance from GOP lawmakers. (RELATED: Schumer Says Democrats Will Read ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Out Loud To Slow Down Passage)\n\nLeading up to the Senate vote, Republicans such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson voiced concerns over parts of the bill, including provisions tied to the debt ceiling, Medicaid reforms and Biden-era green energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nDemocrats have pushed back in media appearances and online, with Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal claiming Wednesday that people have been “sobbing” on her shoulder over their hatred of the bill. Others, like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, took to Instagram, posting a photo of himself holding a bat and writing “House Democrats will keep the pressure on Trump’s One Big Ugly Bill.”\n\n“They don’t want any wins. They just want to be the party of resistance,” Jones said.\n\n“The Five” co-host Dana Perino joined in, adding to Jones’ argument that Democrats could have included “Dreamers,” illegal migrant students, in the bill — to which Jones responded, “Exactly.”\n\n“So the next election, when it comes all down, they’re going to run on the same things, no wins, and they’re going to get the same result,” Jones said.\n\nThe Senate’s bill is expected to head back to the House in hopes of getting the final legislation to Trump’s desk by its unofficial July 4 deadline. However, some GOP House lawmakers have vowed to push back on the bill over its pairing of tax cuts with dollar-for-dollar spending reductions and aggressive Medicaid reforms.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The company aims to build an overall renewable capacity of 4 GW.Actis and BluPine Energy declined to comment.Actis had infused $468 million into BluPine Energy by February, out of its total $800 million commitment from its Actis Energy 5 fund, according to Care Ratings.BluPine Energy is led by Neerav Nanavaty, former India CEO of French utility Engie, who has built the platform from the ground up—initially through acquisitions, later moving to greenfield development.Solar projects dominate the company’s 3 GW portfolio, accounting for 76% of capacity, while wind and hybrid assets make up 13% and 12%, respectively. The average tariff for its operational portfolio is Rs 3.91 per unit, per Care Ratings.An increasing number of renewable energy platforms in India are looking for buyers, even as investor appetite has cooled compared to the previous financial year, when some large deals were closed.

It finds fault with a 2017 intelligence assessment that concluded the Russian government, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin, waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump win.\n\nIt does not address that multiple investigations since then, including a report from the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee in 2020, reached the same conclusion about Russia’s influence and motives.\n\nThe eight-page document is part of an ongoing effort by Trump and close allies who now lead key government agencies to revisit the history of the long-concluded Russia investigation, which resulted in criminal indictments and shadowed most of his first term but also produced unresolved grievances and contributed to the Republican president’s deep-rooted suspicions of the intelligence community.\n\nThe report is also the latest effort by Ratcliffe to challenge the decision-making and actions of intelligence agencies during the course of the Russia investigation.\n\nA vocal Trump supporter in Congress who aggressively questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller during his 2019 testimony on Russian election interference, Ratcliffe later used his position as director of national intelligence to declassify Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 election even as he acknowledged that it might not be true.\n\nThe new, “lessons-learned” review ordered by Ratcliffe in May was meant to examine the tradecraft that went into the intelligence community’s 2017 assessment on Russian interference and to scrutinize in particular the conclusion that Putin “aspired” to help Trump win.\n\nThe report cited several “anomalies” that the authors wrote could have affected that conclusion, including a rushed timeline and a reliance on unconfirmed information, such as Democratic-funded opposition research about Trump’s ties to Russia compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele.\n\nThe report takes particular aim at the inclusion of a two-page summary of the Steele dossier, which included salacious and uncorroborated rumors about Trump’s ties to Russia, in an annex of the intelligence community assessment. It said that decision, championed by the FBI, “implicitly elevated unsubstantiated claims to the status of credible supporting evidence, compromising the analytical integrity of the judgment.”\n\nBut even as Ratcliffe faulted top intelligence officials for a “politically charged environment that triggered an atypical analytic process,” his agency’s report does not directly contradict any previous intelligence.\n\nRussia’s support for Trump has been outlined in a number of intelligence reports and the August 2020 conclusions of the Senate Intelligence Committee, then chaired by Sen. Marco Rubio, who now serves as Trump’s secretary of state. It also was backed by Mueller, who in his 2019 report said that Russia interfered on Trump’s behalf and that the campaign welcomed the aid even if there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy.\n\n“This report doesn’t change any of the underlying evidence — in fact it doesn’t even address any of that evidence,” said Brian Taylor, a Russia expert who directs the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\nTaylor suggested the report may have been intended to reinforce Trump’s claims that investigations into his ties to Russia are part of a Democratic hoax.\n\n“Good intelligence analysts will tell you their job is to speak truth to power,” Taylor said. “If they tell the leader what he wants to hear, you often get flawed intelligence.”\n\nIntelligence agencies regularly perform after-action reports to learn from past operations and investigations, but it’s uncommon for the evaluations to be declassified and released to the public.\n\nRatcliffe has said he wants to release material on a number of topics of public debate and has already declassified records relating to the assassinations of President John Kennedy and his brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the origins of COVID-19.","summary":"The memo challenges the work agencies did to conclude that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/07/02/cia-2016-election-russia/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mideast_Wars_Congress_44314.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:56:02","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.265},{"id":337649094,"title":"New legal filing details graphic ‘torture and abuse’ of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador prison","text":"Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have detailed the “severe mistreatment” and “torture” he experienced during his month-long detention inside a notorious El Salvador prison, in a renewed lawsuit challenging his wrongful removal from the United States.\n\nHis attorneys say the 29-year-old Salvadoran immigrant was subject to “severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture” at the facility, where lawyers for President Donald Trump’s administration have admitted he was mistakenly sent in March before a weeks-long legal battle to keep him imprisoned there.\n\nAbrego Garcia was abruptly returned to the U.S. to face a federal criminal indictment accusing him of smuggling undocumented migrants across the country, allegations that were only raised after he was removed.

The new CIA head ordered an internal review of the report in May.\n\nObama ordered the ICA just six weeks before leaving office. According to the CIA review of its drafting and rushed release, declassified on Wednesday, then-CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper were unusually and “excessively involved” in the process.\n\n“The rushed timeline to publish both classified and unclassified versions before the presidential transition raised questions about a potential political motive behind the White House tasking and timeline,” the review said, calling the work on the report “chaotic,” “atypical,” and “markedly unconventional.”\n\nThe CIA review found that Brennan effectively directed the compilation of the ICA and particularly insisted on including the later discredited Steele dossier. The dossier – a compilation of unverified rumors about Trump and his alleged links to Russia – was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and reportedly funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\n“This was Obama, Comey, Clapper, and Brennan deciding, ‘We’re going to screw Trump,’” Ratcliffe said, commenting on his agency’s findings. “It was, ‘We’re going to create this and put the imprimatur of an IC assessment in a way that nobody can question it.’ They stamped it as Russian collusion and then classified it so nobody could see it.”\n\n“Brennan and Clapper and Comey manipulated [and] silenced all the career professionals and railroaded the process,” the CIA director added.\n\nAmerican public opinion was further manipulated by constant media leaks and unnamed officials cited by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and other mainstream outlets.\n\n“Before work on the assessment even began, media leaks suggesting that the IC had already reached definitive conclusions risked creating an anchoring bias,” the review noted.\n\nThe ICA, as well as the FBI’s 2016 ‘Crossfire Hurricane’ investigation and the subsequent Mueller inquiry, cast a long shadow over Trump’s first term, with allegations of “Russian collusion” persisting in the media even after Mueller’s report found no evidence to support them.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the NCAA inquiring if and when it plans to make any changes to Thomas' 2022 championship finishes but has not received a response.

(AP) — The first group of immigrants were scheduled to arrive Wednesday night at a new detention center deep in the Florida Everglades that officials have dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” the state’s attorney general said.\n\n“Alligator Alcatraz will be checking in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens tonight,” Florida Republican Attorney General James Uthmeier said on the X social media platform. “Next stop: back to where they came from.”\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear precisely when the detainees would arrive or where they were coming from. They were being brought to the facility on buses, officials said.\n\nThe facility, at an airport used for training, will have a capacity of about 3,000 detainees when fully operational, according to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said. The center was built in eight days over 10 miles of Everglades. It features more than 200 security cameras, 28,000-plus feet of barbed wire and 400 security personnel.\n\nEnvironmental groups and Native American tribes have protested against the center, contending it is a threat to the fragile Everglades system, would be cruel to detainees because of heat and mosquitoes, and is on land the tribes consider sacred.\n\nIt’s also located at a place prone to frequent heavy rains, which caused some flooding in the tents Tuesday during a visit by President Donald Trump to mark its opening. State officials say the complex can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, which packs winds of between 96 and 110 mph, and that contractors worked overnight to shore up areas where flooding occurred.\n\nDeSantis and other state officials say locating the facility in the rugged and remote Florida Everglades is meant as a deterrent, and naming it after the notorious federal prison of Alcatraz, an island fortress known for its brutal conditions, is meant to send a message. It’s another sign of how the Trump administration and its allies are relying on scare tactics to try to persuade people in the country illegally to leave voluntarily.\n\nState and federal officials have touted the plans on social media and conservative airwaves, sharing a meme of a compound ringed with barbed wire and “guarded” by alligators wearing hats labeled “ICE” for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Prosecutors, who previously withdrew their intent to seek the death penalty, said Saenz deserves to live out his days in prison for his “senseless” and “sadistic” crimes.\n\nJudge Gary Brown, in handing down the sentence, said the reduction of two years from the maximum recognized Saenz’s role in pleading guilty and avoiding a painful and costly trial, as well as his efforts in convincing his younger brother, the gang’s second-in-command, to do the same.\n\n“This small adjustment is more than what was afforded to his victims,“ the judge said, “none of whom will ever enjoy another day on this planet.“\n\nSaenz, addressing the court, asked for forgiveness from God, his family and the relatives of the victims.\n\n“I know my apology will not repair the harm and the pain that I have caused,” the now 30-year-old said in Spanish through a translator. “I know many of you do not accept my apology, but I want to say from the bottom of my heart that these words are sincere.”\n\nSaenz’s lawyers said he suffers from intellectual disabilities and lasting trauma from a difficult upbringing in his native El Salvador that allowed him to be recruited and unwittingly “groomed” into MS-13.\n\nBut Saenz said he did not want to use his “hard life” as an excuse. “I do not recognize the person who committed these crimes,” he said in court.\n\nProsecutor Paul Scotti rejected Saenz’s comments as “self-serving” and “not sincere.”\n\nHe argued that Saenz remains committed to MS-13, citing his “extensive disciplinary record” while in custody at a federal lockup in New York City.\n\nProsecutors have cited photos of him posing with other gang members behind bars and displaying gang signs and gang paraphernalia. They also said Saenz was disciplined for assaulting other inmates, refusing staff orders and possessing sharpened metal shanks, cellphones and other contraband.\n\n“Actions speak, louder than words,” Scotti said in court.\n\nSaenz, also known as “Blasty” and “Big Homie,” was the leader of an MS-13 clique operating in Brentwood and Central Islip known as Sailors Locos Salvatruchas Westside.\n\nHe admitted last July that he’d authorized the eight killings and three other attempted killings of perceived rivals and others who had disrespected or feuded with the clique.\n\nAmong the killings were those of Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15, lifelong friends and classmates at Brentwood High School who were slain with a machete and a baseball bat. Authorities said there had been a dispute weeks earlier between one of the girls and gang members.\n\nOther victims included Javier Castillo, 15, of Central Islip, who was befriended by gang members only to be cut down with a machete in an isolated marsh.\n\nAnother victim, Oscar Acosta, 19, was found dead in a wooded area near railroad tracks nearly five months after he left his Brentwood home to play soccer.\n\nSaenz also admitted to arson, firearms offenses and drug trafficking — the proceeds of which went toward buying firearms, more drugs and providing contributions to the wider MS-13 gang.\n\nMS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, is a transnational criminal organization believed to have been founded as a neighborhood street gang in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s by people fleeing civil war in El Salvador.","summary":"Alexi Saenz pleaded guilty last year for his role in ordering and approving the killings as well as other crimes during a rash of bloody violence.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/ms-13-leader-sentenced-to-68-years-in-federal-case-involving-8-long-island-murders/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107522147.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/INvzO6QI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:33:42","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":337645996,"title":"20 negeri di AS saman Trump","text":"LOS ANGELES: California, yang mengetuai gabungan beberapa negeri memfailkan saman terhadap pentadbiran Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump, berhubung kebocoran maklumat peribadi rakyat, lapor Xinhua.\n\nPentadbiran Trump didakwa secara haram berkongsi data kesihatan penerima Medicaid dengan agensi penguatkuasaan imigresen. \n\nSaman setebal 59 muka surat itu difailkan di Mahkamah Daerah AS bagi Daerah Utara California, dengan Setiausaha Kesihatan dan Perkhidmatan Kemanusiaan Robert F Kennedy Jr, Setiausaha Keselamatan Dalam Negeri Kristi Noem dan jabatan mereka dinamakan sebagai defendan.\n\nPeguam Negara California Rob Bonta, mengetuai peguam negara dari 19 negeri lain dalam memfailkan tindakan undang-undang itu.\n\nNegeri terbabit ialah Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont dan Washington \n\nPlaintif mencabar tindakan Jabatan Kesihatan dan Perkhidmatan Kemanusiaan AS (HHS) yang memberikan 'akses tanpa had' rekod kesihatan individu kepada Jabatan Keselamatan Dalam Negeri (DHS), yang menaungi Penguatkuasaan Imigresen dan Kastam (ICE).\n\nPlaintif mendakwa keputusan itu melanggar undang-undang kerahsiaan peribadi dan amalan lama yang memisahkan maklumat Medicaid daripada pihak penguatkuasaan.\n\nMereka menegaskan yang tindakan haram pentadbiran Trump mencetuskan ketakutan dan kekeliruan dalam kalangan komuniti, yang boleh menyebabkan bukan warganegara dan ahli keluarga mereka menarik diri atau enggan mendaftar untuk Medicaid kecemasan. \n\nKeadaan ini boleh menyebabkan pesakit tidak mendapat rawatan kesihatan penting dan membawa kepada akibat kesihatan yang boleh membawa maut.\n\n\"Pentadbiran Trump mencabuli perlindungan kerahsiaan peribadi yang telah lama wujud dengan keputusan untuk secara haram berkongsi data kesihatan peribadi yang sensitif dengan ICE. \n\nTindakan ini mewujudkan suasana ketakutan yang akan menghalang orang ramai daripada mendapatkan rawatan perubatan kecemasan yang penting,\" kata Bonta dalam kenyataan media yang dikeluarkan oleh pejabatnya.\n\nBeliau turut menegaskan bahawa saman itu bertujuan memastikan data Medicaid tidak digunakan untuk tujuan penguatkuasaan imigresen.\n\n\"Saya kecewa dengan serangan terbaru Presiden dalam kempen antimigran ini.

The emergency appeal asks the High Court to allow the Trump administration to fire three members of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), a five-member independent regulatory board that sets standards and oversees safety for thousands of consumer products. The appeal comes after the Supreme Court, in May, granted a separate emergency appeal request from the Trump administration pertaining to the firing of two Biden-appointed agency officials from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). \"It's outrageous that we must once again seek Supreme Court intervention because rogue leftist judges in lower courts continue to defy the high court's clear rulings,\" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS TERMINATION OF INDEPENDENT AGENCY BOARD MEMBERS FOR NOW \"The Supreme Court decisively upheld the president's constitutional authority to fire and remove executive officers exercising his power, yet this ongoing assault by activist judges undermines that victory,\" he continued. \"President Trump remains committed to fulfilling the American people's mandate by effectively leading the executive branch, despite these relentless obstructions.\" Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr. were appointed to serve seven-year terms on the independent government agency by former President Joe Biden. Their positions have historically been protected from retribution, as they can only be terminated for neglect or malfeasance. After Trump attempted to fire the three Democratic regulators, they sued, arguing the president sought to remove them without due cause. Eventually, a federal judge in Maryland agreed with them, and this week an appeals court upheld that ruling. However, according to the emergency appeal from the Trump administration, submitted to the High Court on Wednesday morning, the three regulators in question have shown \"hostility to the President's agenda\" and taken actions that have \"thrown the agency into chaos.\" OBAMA-APPOINTED JUDGE STRIKES DOWN TRUMP ORDER PREVENTING ASYLUM REQUESTS, PROTECTIONS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS The emergency appeal to the Supreme Court added that \"none of this should be possible\" after the High Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration's decision to fire two executive branch labor relations officials. \"None of this should be possible after Wilcox, which squarely controls this case. Like the NLRB and MSPB in Wilcox, the CPSC exercises 'considerable executive power,' 145 S. Ct. at 1415—for instance, by issuing rules, adjudicating administrative proceedings, issuing subpoenas, bringing enforcement suits seeking civil penalties, and (with the concurrence of the Attorney General) even prosecuting criminal cases,\" Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court.

Email: poppy.gibson@mailonline.co.uk \nBy POPPY ATKINSON GIBSON \n Published:00:28 BST, 3 July 2025 |Updated:00:30 BST, 3 July 2025 \n\nThe first newly branded WH Smith has been unveiled after it was revealed the iconic name of the iconic British high street chain would be changed as part of its sale. \nJust days after the finalisation of a multi-million pound deal, residents in Bromley, south east London saw the new branding taking effect. \nThe 233-year-old brand has been a staple in Britain's town centres for centuries, having been founded by Henry Walton Smith in London in the Georgian era.\nBut at the end of June, the retailer completed the sale of its business for less than initially agreed after a demand slowdown forced the renegotiation of terms.\nThe group agreed a £76million sale of the high street business to Hobbycraft owner Modella in May as it transitions to a 'pure play' travel retailer, focusing efforts on its stores in train stations and airports.\nAs part of the sale, the iconic WH Smith brand name was replaced with the TGJones brand.\nA WH Smith store on High Street in West Wickham, was spotted with a simple bright blue sign with white writing spelling out TG Jones.\nNew owners Modella said TGJones 'carries the same sense of family and reflects these stores being at the heart of everyone's high street', but does not refer to a 'specific person'.\n\nThe first newly branded WH Smith has been unveiled in Bromley after it was revealed the new owners of the iconic British high street chain planned to change its name\n\nAt the end of June, the retailer completed the sale of its business for less than initially agreed after a demand slowdown forced the renegotiation of terms\n\nThe group agreed a £76million sale of the high street business to Hobbycraft owner Modella (pictured: A WH Smith stall in London at the time of the Hindenburg airship disaster in the US in 1937)\nModella - which is also looking at buying Lakeland - took over the 480 stores and 5,000 staff working in retail parks, shopping centres and on the high street last week.\nWhile stores are already seeing new signs going up, the renaming of shops does not extend to WH Smith's travel locations in airports and train stations, which will stay as 'WH Smith'.\nThe travel division, which has become the key focus of the group in recent years and also includes shops in hospitals, will not be changing. That makes up the bulk of its sales and profits, and has grown to more than 1,200 stores across 32 countries.\nModella Capital specialises in investing in retailers. It has previously put money into chains including Paperchase and Tie Rack.\nLast August, it snapped up arts and crafts retailer Hobbycraft for an undisclosed sum. It then bought The Original Factory Shop last month.\nSean Toal, chief executive of the new TGJones business, said: 'Selling the High Street business has been a significant milestone for the WHSmith Group, and I am delighted that we have agreed a sale with Modella Capital who, I know, will be supportive new owners.\n'I'm incredibly proud of everything we've achieved as a high street team and this next chapter presents exciting opportunities for growth, innovation, and continued success for the business and our talented colleagues.\n'I have every confidence that under Modella's leadership, the business will go from strength to strength, and I look forward to all that we can achieve together in the future.'\n\nBroadcaster Richard Dimbleby (left) at a WH Smith branch at London Victoria station in 1956\n\nWH Smith's previous branding included a brown and orange hexagon logo, which was introduced in 1973 before switching to its now well-known blue and white signs (Wh Smith pictured in 1986)\n\nThe WH Smith branch at London King's Cross railway station is pictured in 1998 - Modella is now focusing on shops in travel locations in airports and train stations\n\n WH Smith completes sale of high street business - after cutting the price \nThe WH Smith sale follows a period of uncertainty where a number of potential buyers were believed to be in the running to snap up the historic chain.\nIt is understood that private equity groups Hilco and Alteri were among parties to raise interest over a possible takeover move, after WH Smith launched the process late last year.\nThe original sale was completed for a reduced fee after its owners said 'the future of the high street business under a change of ownership has led to a more cautious outlook amongst stakeholders', and demand had softened.\nThis has 'resulted in a reduction in the ongoing cash flow of the business', the group said, leading to Modella seeking amendments to the transaction.\nWH Smith will now receive an up-front consideration of £10million at completion, and up to £20million of deferred consideration whereby the retailer and Modella equally share in the cash flow generation of the business to August 2026.\nIt will also receive up to £10m of additional proceeds based on 'timing and realisation of certain tax assets within the high street business', WH Smith said.\nThe group added: 'WHSmith expects gross cash proceeds of up to £40million.\n'This compares to the previous announcement of £52million of gross cash proceeds. Transaction and separation costs remain unchanged at £27million.\nWH Smith shares sank 5.5 per cent to 1,067p in early trading.\nThe retailer also told shareholders it now expects headline net debt as at 31 August 2025 to be around £425million.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFirst newly branded WHSmith is unveiled after it was revealed iconic name would vanish from British high streets\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

However, with the addition of around 900 temporary shelter beds and permanent homeless housing units over the last two years, the number of unsheltered residents fell by 35% to 1,278.\n\nElsewhere in the Bay Area, Santa Clara County — home to the region’s largest urban center, San Jose — last month reported an 8% increase in its homeless population, reaching a record 10,711 people.\n\nThe county attributed the rise to an increase in shelter capacity, which made it easier to identify homeless residents during its count. Local officials stress that point-in-time counts are only estimates and acknowledge it can be challenging to pinpoint the number of people living in encampments or vehicles.\n\nHomelessness also increased across most of the Bay Area, according to counts taken in 2024. That includes a 15% rise in San Mateo County and a 10% increase in San Francisco. The number of homeless residents declined 3% in Alameda County, but its largest city, Oakland, saw a 9% increase.\n\nOver the past decade, the nine-county Bay Area’s total homeless population has soared 44% to more than 38,000, despite unprecedented billions of dollars spent to bring people off the streets, stoking growing public frustration over the crisis.\n\nIn Contra Costa County, the drop in the homeless population followed a 15% spike the previous year. Dating back to 2015, the local unhoused population is up about 4%.\n\nThe latest count also found the unsheltered population fell in most cities across the county. Antioch, the local city with the most unsheltered people in 2024, saw that population decline from 413 to 236 this year. Richmond’s unsheltered population dropped from 388 to 208. Concord’s population dipped from 173 to 131.\n\nAs in the rest of the Bay Area, people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized groups are overrepresented in the county’s unhoused population, according to the count. It found 34% of homeless residents are Black, despite that racial group making up only 9% of the county’s total population. About 36% of local unhoused people are White, 14% are Latino, 6% are multiracial, 5% are Native American and 5% are other races.\n\nAt last week’s board meeting, Saxton warned the county’s progress on homelessness could be short-lived, pointing to impending state and federal funding cuts.\n\nLast week, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new state budget that allocated only half the amount set aside last year to help local governments combat homelessness. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has proposed massive cuts to homelessness programs and housing vouchers for low-income renters, though any potential reductions were still being determined as lawmakers scrambled to finalize a federal budget by the Fourth of July weekend.\n\n“We’re really concerned,” Saxton said.","summary":"Officials credited the decline to increases in rental assistance, shelter beds and supportive housing.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/02/contra-costa-county-homeless-count/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SJM-L-POLL-0308-1.jpg?w=1024&h=648","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:26:39","author":"Ethan Varian,Katie Lauer","authors":["Ethan Varian","Katie Lauer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.088},{"id":337646124,"title":"Hamas still won’t do a cease-fire unless it’s handed a fundamental victory","text":"President Donald Trump says he’s hoping Hamas will accept his team’s latest proposal for a 60-day cease-fire with Israel as soon as next week — but the terror group’s immediate counter-offer shows why he’s in for disappointment.\n\nTrump reported that Israel has accepted the deal, which would include a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a surge in humanitarian aid.\n\nA Hamas official says his group, too, is “ready and serious regarding reaching an agreement” — but only one that “leads to the complete end of the war.” \n\nSame old, same old: That’s been the terror group’s chief demand from the start. \n\nIt wants Israel to permanently halt its operations in Gaza with Hamas left free to rebuild — to eventually attack the Jewish state again.\n\nIsrael can let Hamas’ leaders live — but not in Gaza. \n\nBefore the war ends, “there will not be a Hamas,” declared Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. “We’re not going back to that.”\n\nIsrael cannot allow any repeat of Hamas’ Oct. 7 slaughterfest.\n\nAnd with the group’s benefactor, Iran, now severely weakened, there’s no reason for Jerusalem not to finish the job: Force these monsters to cry uncle . . . or destroy them.\n\nTrump warns that if Hamas rejects the deal, “IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE” for the group, but that hasn’t budged the terrorists before.\n\nThese bitter-enders may even prefer death.\n\nIf they refuse to disarm, that’s exactly what they deserve.\n\nDeal or not.","summary":"President Donald Trump says he’s hoping Hamas will accept his team’s latest proposal for a 60-day cease-fire with Israel as soon as next week — but if the past is any guide, he (and everyone else) is in for disappointment.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/opinion/expect-hamas-to-scuttle-trumps-cease-fire-deal-but-either-way-israel-must-still-destroy-it/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-7evvg456q-1751496789193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1751482401&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:22:33","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":337642878,"title":"Trump is not like other presidents – but can he beat the ‘second term curse’ that haunts the White House?","text":"While he likes to provoke opponents with the possibility of serving a third term, Donald Trump faces a more immediate historical burden that has plagued so many presidents: the “second term curse”.\n\nTwenty-one US presidents have served second terms, but none has reached the same level of success they achieved in their first. \n\nSecond term performances have ranged from the lacklustre and uninspiring to the disastrous and deadly. Voter dissatisfaction and frustration, presidential fatigue and a lack of sustainable vision for the future are all explanations. \n\nBut Trump doesn’t quite fit the mould. Only one other president, Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century, has served a second nonconsecutive term, making Trump 2.0 difficult to measure against other second-term leaders. \n\nTrump will certainly be hoping history doesn’t repeat Cleveland’s second-term curse. Shortly after taking office he imposed 50% tariffs, triggering global market volatility that culminated in the “Panic of 1893”.\n\nAt the time, this was the worst depression in US history: 19% unemployment, a run on gold from the US Treasury, a stock market crash and widespread poverty.\n\nMore than a century on, Trump’s “move fast and break things” approach in a nonconsecutive second term might appeal to voters demanding action above all else. But he risks being drawn into areas he campaigned against. \n\nSo far, he has gone from fighting a trade war and a culture war to contemplating a shooting war in the Middle East. His “big beautiful bill” will add trillions to the national debt and potentially force poorer voters – including many Republicans – off Medicaid.\n\nWhether his radical approach will defy or conform to the second term curse seems very much an open question.\n\nThe two-term limit was enacted by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution in 1951. Without a maximum term, it was feared, an authoritarian could try to take control for life – like a king (hence the recent “No Kings” protests in the US). \n\nGeorge Washington, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson all declined to serve a third term. Jefferson was suspicious of any president who would try to be re-elected a third time, writing: \n\nshould a President consent to be a candidate for a 3d. election, I trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views.\n\nThere is a myth that after Franklin Delano Roosevelt broke the de facto limit of two terms set by the early presidents, the ghost of George Washington placed a curse on anyone serving more than four years.\n\nAt best, second-term presidencies have been tepid compared to the achievements in the previous four years. After the second world war, some two-term presidents (Eisenhower, Reagan and Obama) started out strong but faltered after reelection.\n\nEisenhower extricated the US from the Korean War in his first term, but faced domestic backlash and race riots in his second. He had to send 500 paratroopers to escort nine Black high school students in Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce a federal desegregation order. \n\nReagan made significant tax and spending cuts, and saw the Soviet Union crumble in term one. But the Iran-Contra scandal and watered down tax reform defined term two. \n\nObama started strongly, introducing health care reform and uniting the Democratic voter base. After reelection, however, the Democrats lost the House, the Senate, a Supreme Court nomination, and faced scandals over the Snowden security leaks and Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups. \n\nTruly disastrous examples of second term presidencies include Abraham Lincoln (assassination), Woodrow Wilson (first world war, failure of the League of Nations, a stroke), Richard Nixon (Watergate, impeachment and resignation), and Bill Clinton (Lewinsky scandal and impeachment).\n\nMonumental honours\n\nIt may be too early to predict how Trump will feature in this pantheon of less-than-greatness. But his approval ratings recently hit an all-time low as Americans reacted to the bombing of Iran and deployment of troops in Los Angeles. \n\nA recent YouGov poll showed voters giving negative approval ratings for his handling of inflation, jobs, immigration, national security and foreign policy. While there has been plenty of action, it may be the levels of uncertainty, drastic change and market volatility are more extreme than some bargained for.\n\nAn uncooperative Congress or opposition from the judiciary can be obstacles to successful second terms. But Trump has used executive orders, on the grounds of confronting “national emergencies”, to bypass normal checks and balances.\n\nAs well, favourable rulings by the Supreme Court have edged closer to expanding the boundaries of executive power. But they have not yet supported Trump’s claim from his first term that “I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as President”.\n\nSome supporters say Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. And he was only half joking when he asked if there is room for one more face on Mount Rushmore. But such monumental honours may only amount to speculation unless Trump’s radical approach and redefinition of executive power defy the second-term curse.","summary":"According to myth, the ghost of George Washington cursed anyone serving more than four years.

Thanks to its unusual structure with the additional money supplied by Ellison and not current management, the Paramount board and Redstone can sidestep one of their main roadblocks to settling the lawsuit: Fear of bribery charges. \n\nParamount denied any knowledge of a “side deal.”\n\n“Paramount knows nothing about the alleged side deal between Trump\\Ellison, had absolutely nothing to do with it, nor was it a part of what the board approved, and the mediator sanctioned.” a spokesperson told On The Money.A Skydance spokeswoman had no comment on the matter.\n\nLate Tuesday, current management agreed to pay $16 million to settle the Trump suit claiming the president’s 2024 presidential campaign was damaged by biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris. \n\nAs On The Money reported last week, the younger Ellison was bragging that a settlement was in the cards, allowing him to take over Paramount this summer.\n\nThe bribery issues arose because Redstone is in desperate need of cash since inheriting the Paramount media empire from her late father, the media mogul Sumner Redstone and the settlement of the lawsuit is inextricably tied to the deal getting completed since Trump’s regulators must approve the merger.\n\nSince Redstone would receive around $2 billion once the deal is done, any sizable payment could be seen as a bribe to get the Federal Communications Commission’s green light.Now, any bribery charges become nearly impossible to prove because Paramount is not party to any side deal between Ellison and Trump. In fact, Ellison isn’t party to the suit in any way. Rather there is just an “expectation” that he will make good on his promise for the PSAs, people close to the deal say.\n\nTrump administration officials have denied that there was a quid pro quo between the lawsuit and FCC approval. \n\nWhile the agency opened an investigation into CBS over the same issues, namely that the “60 Minutes” violated the FCC’s public interest rules demanding unbiased new programming over public airwaves, as opposed to cable, Trump officials say the inquiry was prompted by a separate complaint filed with regulators.\n\nCord cutting and other industry changes has decimated Paramount’s bottom line, and Redstone’s once formidable fortune, which she sought to preserve by selling the company to Skydance in an $8 billion deal. Then came the controversy over the lawsuit – and the possibility of a settlement with Trump and its ties to Redstone’s pending big payday– that has roiled CBS. \n\nIn May, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon resigned, saying, “It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” The month before, “60 Minutes” boss Bill Owens quit, citing increased pressure from senior management over his programming.\n\nMedia watchdogs have condemned the network for allegedly selling its journalism for money. \n\nCongressional Democrats were threatening hearings on the matter and the Paramount board could have faced investigations from Trump-hating Democratic state AGs. Conservatives have complained about news bias at CBS for decades.\n\n That said, giving such investigations teeth is the dubious nature of the Trump lawsuit, namely that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited the Harris interview to make her sound smarter during the height of the 2024 campaign, and he was damaged in the process.\n\nSince Trump won the election, there are no damages, legal experts countered.Trump initially sued for $20 billion but his legal team signaled it was looking to settle for far less.\n\n“With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,” a legal spokesman for Trump told On The Money. \n\n“CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.

Nearly two years later, Kelley made plans with another man to attack the FBI office in Knoxville, Tennessee, using improvised explosive devices attached to vehicles and drones, according to prosecutors.\n\nLast November, a jury convicted Kelley of conspiring to murder federal employees, solicitation to commit a crime of violence and influencing federal officials by threat.\n\nKelley, 36, received a pardon from President Donald Trump for his Jan. 6 convictions, but a judge agreed with prosecutors that Trump’s action did not extend to Kelley’s Tennessee case. That makes Kelley, who is from Maryvale, Tennessee, one of only a few Capitol riot defendants remaining in prison after the Republican president’s sweeping act of clemency.\n\nUS District Judge Thomas Varlan handed down Kelley’s life sentence during a hearing in Knoxville, according to court records. The judge denied a request for Kelley to be released pending the outcome of an appeal.\n\nProsecutors had recommended a life sentence for Kelley, saying he was remorseless and incapable of rehabilitation.\n\n“On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled ‘patriot’ compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination,” they wrote.\n\nKelley served in the Marine Corps for eight years. He was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan before his 2015 discharge from the military.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Kelley was captured on video helping two other rioters throw a Capitol Police officer onto the ground and using a piece of wood to damage a window, according to the FBI. He was the fourth person to enter the Capitol through a broken window, the FBI said.\n\nAfter a trial without a jury, a federal judge in Washington convicted Kelley last November of 11 counts stemming from the riot. Before Kelley could be sentenced, Trump pardoned him and hundreds of other convicted Capitol rioters.\n\nKelley argued that his pardon was broad enough to cover his conduct in the Tennessee case, but the judge disagreed. Varlan said Kelley’s crimes in the Tennessee case were separated from Kelley’s conduct on Jan. 6 “by years and miles.” Prosecutors reached the same conclusion.\n\nIn other Jan. 6 cases, however, Trump’s Justice Department has argued that the pardons apply to separate convictions. For instance, prosecutors concluded that a Kentucky man’s pardon for storming the Capitol also covered his conviction for illegally possessing guns when FBI agents searched his home for the Jan. 6 investigation.\n\nKelley has been jailed since December 2022. His lawyer, Mark Brown, said Kelley did not hurt anybody or directly threaten anybody with violence. Brown urged the judge to reject prosecutors’ request to apply a “terrorism enhancement” in calculating his client’s sentence.\n\n“Kelley does not deserve the same sentence as an actual ‘terrorist’ who injured or killed hundreds or thousands of America citizens,” Brown wrote.\n\nKelley’s co-defendant, Austin Carter, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in January 2024. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 4.\n\nKelley created a list of 36 law-enforcement officers to target for assassination and shared it with Carter, calling it their first “mission,” according to prosecutors. All the officers were involved in Kelley’s May 2022 arrest on Capitol riot charges and the FBI’s search of his home.\n\n“The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nKelley, Carter and a third man used an encrypted messaging platform to discuss plans, prosecutors said. Carter testified that he met with Kelley to conduct military-style training in November 2022.\n\n“Carter’s testimony was unequivocal — he had no doubts that, had he and Kelley not been arrested, the law enforcement personnel included on Kelley’s list would have been murdered,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nKelley’s attorney said the case involved “little to no planning.”\n\n“Discussions did not lead to action,” Brown wrote. “And while people may not like what Mr. Kelley had to say, he stands behind his position that he has a First Amendment right to free speech.”","summary":"Edward Kelley, 36, was one of the first rioters to breach the Capitol.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/us-news/military-veteran-gets-a-life-sentence-for-plotting-an-fbi-attack-after-his-jan-6-arrest/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107523958.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/INvzO6QI-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:04:12","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":337646392,"title":"Trump says Israel accepted US proposal on 60-day ceasefire with Hamas (Video)","text":"U.S. President Donald Trump says Israel has agreed on terms for a new 60-day ceasefire with Hamas and that Washington would work with both sides during that time to try to end more than 20 months of war in Gaza.\n\nSubscribe: http://smarturl.it/AssociatedPress\nRead more: https://apnews.com\n\nThis video may be available for archive licensing via https://newsroom.ap.org/home","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump says Israel has agreed on terms for a new 60-day ceasefire with Hamas and that Washington would work with both sides during that time to try to end more than 20...\n\n\nThe post Trump says Israel accepted US proposal on 60-day ceasefire with Hamas (Video) appeared first on Social News XYZ.","url":"https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/07/02/trump-says-israel-accepted-us-proposal-on-60-day-ceasefire-with-hamas-video/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.socialnews.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/02/maxresdefault-55.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&quality=80&zoom=1&ssl=1?v=1751499243","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:04:03","author":"Social News XYZ","authors":["Social News XYZ"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":337638614,"title":"While California burns, it has to beg Trump for its own troops","text":"It’s tough to believe it has been almost a month since President Donald Trump illegally commandeered thousands of California National Guard troops to help with his nativist assault on Los Angeles. Now, as the state’s wildfire season kicks into high gear, the state has to rely on the whims of the Trump administration to see if it could possibly, just maybe, have its own troops back so that the state doesn’t burn down. \n\nDefinitely what the Founding Fathers intended, right?\n\nAfter first demanding the deployment of 2,000 members of the California National Guard, Trump doubled that to 4,100 in mid-June. Why, pray tell? Well, it’s not all that clear. Sure, Trump had all the generic statements about protecting federal personnel and such, but what it really looks like is that the administration now sees these troops as their own personal force to be deployed wherever they feel like it, for whatever they want. How else to explain the deployment of over 300 National Guard members to the Coachella Valley—more than 100 miles from Los Angeles—to help the Drug Enforcement Agency raid cannabis growers?\n\nOn June 24, as multiple wildfires started across the state, the governor’s office reported that the California National Guard crews were operating at only 40% of capacity. More than 300 Guard members who are specially trained to work with CAL FIRE on firefighting and prevention were instead being used for whatever Trump felt like. \n\nThe weekend saw the state’s wildfire season start swiftly, and it’s expected to be an especially bad summer. On Monday, the Associated Press reported that the commander in charge of the Los Angeles task force had asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth if 200 California National Guard members could be sent back to fighting wildfires—you know, their actual jobs. The next day, the Department of Defense magnanimously announced that it was releasing 150 Guard members. \n\nIt’s great to see this happen, both in terms of necessity and in terms of seeing the administration buckle, but the entire affair highlights what is so very wrong, so warped, about what is happening now. \n\nWhen the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked a lower court’s ruling requiring Trump to return control of the Guard to the state, they essentially endorsed the administration’s argument that the statutory requirement that orders to federalize Guard members occur “through the governors of the States” didn’t mean you needed consent from the governor, but that you just needed to say, This was issued through the state. Which, sure. Additionally, the administration’s stance goes even further, stating that no court can review its determination at all. \n\nThere are many reasons it’s a constitutional crisis that Trump is being allowed to deploy active-duty troops on domestic soil to perform domestic law enforcement duties. It’s a thing so profoundly antifederalist, so intrusive on the authority of states, that it’s unbelievable to think there’s even a debate. \n\nBut what’s going on in California shows an additional problem: If the president can take any amount of a state’s National Guard troops for any reason, how can a state meaningfully control the use of its Guard? How can a state rely on having enough personnel for critical state-level challenges if the president can yank those troops away?\n\nWhen Trump was in power last time, he deliberately delayed wildfire aid from Washington state because he was mad at Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. Trump also initially refused to provide FEMA wildfire aid to California in 2018 until being told that the areas affected were in Orange County, which had largely supported him. \n\nTrump has figured out a way to weaponize funding to hinder state wildfire efforts, and he now has a way to weaponize personnel to do so as well. There’s no reason to think he won’t use it to harm blue states, just like he always promises to do.","summary":"It’s tough to believe it has been almost a month since President Donald Trump illegally commandeered thousands of California National Guard troops to help with his nativist assault on Los Angeles.

For the Islamic Republic, that declaration came quickly, and centred on the fact that the regime is still standing. Despite heavy losses and widespread damage, there was no collapse, no revolt, and no regime change.To many Iranians, especially among the opposition abroad (some of whom – from the exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, to the former armed group Mojahedin-e-Khalq – openly cheered the strikes), the scale of the onslaught suggested an intent to topple the government.But a revolt was always unlikely, given who was calling for it. The urban middle class – the backbone of Iran’s civic and professional life – was not going to rise up on behalf of the two foreign powers most associated with decades of coercion and violence in the region.Thus, whether ordinary Iranians “won” or not will depend on what comes next: how the government responds, how quickly it can rebuild civilian infrastructure, and whether it offers concessions to a middle class that rallied around the flag in the face of a brutal bombing campaign.Some change was already coming well before Israel attacked. Since mid-2023, the Islamic Republic has been showing signs of a strategic shift inward. It did not directly enter the fray after Hamas’s Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, nor in response to its allies in Lebanon and Syria coming under pressure.Owing to mass protests in 2022, following the death of a young woman, Mahsa Amini, in police custody, the regime curtailed street-level enforcement of the unwritten dress code.When I visited Tehran and a few smaller cities last April, I was struck by how much the urban scene had changed. Many women (though not most) went out with their hair uncovered, and mingled freely with young men in the coffee shops that have mushroomed across urban Iran.Then came Masoud Pezeshkian’s surprising election to the presidency in June 2024. A more reform-minded figure, he succeeded the conservative Ebrahim Raisi, who had made hijab enforcement a priority and cracked down violently on protests. (Raisi died in a helicopter crash the previous month.) By contrast, when a new hijab law was passed, Pezeshkian refused to enforce it, allowing a new social norm to take hold.Moreover, the Iranian economy is not as weak as foreign media coverage often suggests. The data does not paint a rosy picture, but nor does it point to an imminent collapse. Despite the draconian US sanctions imposed in 2018 (after Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal), the economy has been slowly recovering.By 2024, the gross domestic product had surpassed its 2018 peak, and growth averaged around 3% per year – aided by oil exports that benefitted from the Joe Biden administration’s lax sanctions enforcement. Moreover, survey data shows rising real (inflation-adjusted) per capita expenditures in recent years.Pezeshkian’s appointments – including a progressive minister of welfare and labour and a young Chicago-educated economy minister – signalled a turn towards better economic management.Internally, there has been a major debate over whether Iran can meet the 8% growth target that is regularly listed in annual budgets and five-year plans. The consensus among economists was “not without sanctions relief,” which in turn would require diplomacy, not missiles.Still, the Pezeshkian administration’s economic reforms – including the restoration of an innovative 2010 cash-transfer programme – likely bolstered the urban middle class’s willingness to stand with the government in the face of Israeli air strikes.Iran’s rather measured response to the US attack on its nuclear sites shows where its leaders’ priorities lie. They see renewed conflict as a distraction from their development mission, originally laid out in the 2005 Twenty-Year Vision Plan to place Iran among the region’s top economies by 2025.The immediate question is whether the recent war will push Iran further towards militarisation and an expanded role for the state in the economy, or towards greater freedom for civil society and the private sector.Many will remember how the bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s led to entrenched rationing, central planning, and dominance by state-linked institutions. It took nearly two decades of reform to reintroduce market principles and revive the private sector.Iran may be better positioned today, because the war was limited in scope, and the private sector and market institutions are more firmly established. Just as the Iran-Iraq War led to vast development investments that acknowledged the contribution of rural communities, this one may catalyse a similar gesture of recognition for the urban middle class. If so, that would go far towards achieving the kind of social consensus (vefagh) that Pezeshkian is seeking.Two decades ago, the joke in Iran was that the Islamic Republic had a consistent Korea strategy, except that sometimes it resembled the North, and sometimes the South. Now Iran faces a similar choice. The North Korean model may seem attractive to some, with its nuclear deterrence, stifling of dissent, and closed borders.But most observers familiar with Iran’s culture, religion, history, and temperament would not regard this as a viable option – even after a war that has exposed Iran’s vulnerability in the absence of nuclear weapons.Undoubtedly, there will be tensions between rebuilding the military and addressing civilian needs – from shoring up the water supply to distributing gasoline and dealing with youth employment.Fortunately, unlike a military buildup, economic reconstruction can be advanced through broadly felt policies that attract private-sector engagement and reduce the budgetary trade-off between defense and development.Assuming the ceasefire holds, the real question will not be who won or lost. It will be whether Iran uses the pause to double down on economic development, or whether the trauma of war will provoke an ideological hardening.The pro-development option may be constrained by the nature of the regime; but the alternative – a permanent wartime posture – is economically and socially untenable.

Trump has threatened to arrest Mamdani, to deport him and even to take over the country’s largest city if he wins the general election in November.\n “As President of the United States, I’m not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York. Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards,” Trump wrote in an ominous message on his Truth Social site Wednesday morning. “I’ll save New York City, and make it ‘Hot’ and ‘Great’ again, just like I did with the Good Ol’ USA!” Mamdani’s surprise victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has given Republicans a new target as they seek to paint the entire Democratic Party as extreme and out of touch with voters heading into elections this fall in New Jersey and Virginia and next year’s high-stakes midterm elections.\n Since Mamdani’s win, they have repeatedly highlighted his most controversial past comments and positions, casting him as dangerous, a communist, and an antisemite, and trying to tie him to all other Democratic officials.\n That has included intense criticism of his platform, as well as blatantly xenophobic and Islamophobic attacks.\n If Mamdani wins, he would become the city’s furthest-left mayor in modern history. He ran on a platform that included opening city-run grocery stores, making buses free, freezing rent on rent-stabilized apartments, and raising property taxes on “richer and whiter neighborhoods.” Though he softened his stance as he campaigned, he called the New York Police Department “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety” in a 2020 social media post, and in others, called for abolishing the entire prison system.\n He has also drawn intense criticism from members of both parties over his pro-Palestinian advocacy. That has included describing Israel’s war in Gaza as “genocide,” his refusal to disavow use of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which is seen as a call to violence for many Jews. Also, for his refusal to support the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state.\n His rise has sparked infighting and highlighted divisions among national Democratic officials, donors and political operatives. While many progressives have celebrated, seeing him as the future of a party aligned with leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, moderates have bemoaned the election’s outcome as a setback in their quest to broaden Democrats’ appeal and move past the more controversial policies that appears to have alienated some voters in recent elections.\n Trump threatens Mamdani’s citizenship Trump unleashed some of his sharpest threats against Mamdani Tuesday, during a visit to a new migrant detention centre in the Florida Everglades.\n If Mamdani blocks ICE agents from making arrests in the city, “Well, then we’ll have to arrest him,” he said. “Look, we don’t need a communist in this country. But if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation.” Trump also amplified a false allegation that Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to Indian parents and came to New York when he was 7, is in the country illegally.\n “A lot of people are saying he’s here illegally. We’re going to look at everything,” he said.\n Mamdani, who is Muslim, became a naturalised American citizen a few years after he graduated from college. If elected, he would be the city’s first Muslim and Indian American mayor.\n Mamdani addressed the criticism during an appearance Wednesday, telling reporters that Trump is focusing on him to distract the public from the Republican mega tax and spending cuts bill that is moving through Congress.\n “Donald Trump said that I should be arrested. He said that I should be deported. He said that I should be denaturalised. And he said those things about me … because he wants to distract from what I fight for,” he said.\n “I fight for the same people that he said he was fighting for. This is the same president who ran on a campaign of cheaper groceries, who ran on a campaign about easing the suffocating cost of living crisis. And ultimately, it is easier for him to fan the flames of division than to acknowledge the ways in which he has betrayed those working-class Americans.” Conservatives have turned their focus on Mamdani Until Mamdani’s win, Trump and other Republicans had struggled to find a compelling foil. He frequently invokes his predecessor, Joe Biden. But with Democrats out of power and without a clear party leader, Trump has bounced from one official to the next, recently focusing his ire on Texas progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett.\n Since Mamdani’s national rise and toppling of Cuomo, conservative politicians and commentators have turned their focus on him.\n That effort was on display Wednesday, when Republicans blasted House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries for defending Mamdani.\n “Leader’ Jeffries Just Bent the Knee to Commie Mamdani,” the National Republican Congressional Committee wrote in an email blast, adding: “This radical platform is the future of the Democrat Party, and voters should be terrified.” The attacks have been brewing.\n Weeks before the primary, Vickie Paladino, a Republican member of the New York City Council, called for Mamdani to be deported. After Mamdani declared victory over Cuomo last week, Rep. Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, wrote on X that “If Mamdani has his way, NYC classrooms won’t be teaching the Constitution in civics class. They’ll be teaching Sharia Law.” Another Republican congressman, Rep. Brandon Gill of Texas, circulated a video of Mamdani eating a rice dish with his hands on X and wrote, “Civilised people in America don’t eat like this. If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the Third World.” Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, has referred to Mamdani as “little muhammad” and late last month wrote a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for the Justice Department to investigate whether Mamdani should be denaturalised as a citizen.

What was expected to spark strategic debate and diplomatic traction has instead met a grounded fate as a British F-35B remains parked at an Indian airbase, out of action for over two weeks. The aircraft, assigned to the Royal Navy’s HMS Prince of Wales, was forced to land in India on June 14 after struggling to return to its carrier due to weather and fuel constraints. A hydraulic failure sealed its fate on the tarmac. Despite a multinational effort to get the jet airborne again, including a technical team from the UK and assistance from US personnel, the stealth fighter remains grounded, and discussions are now veering toward logistical extraction via transport aircraft. Indian authorities, meanwhile, are reportedly considering levying parking charges for the jet’s extended, unscheduled stay. One Aircraft, Many Questions For Indian defence planners, the incident has inadvertently offered a front-row seat to the challenges associated with the world’s most advanced fifth-generation combat aircraft. While the F-35 is lauded for its stealth profile, sensor fusion and digital warfare capabilities, its maintenance demands and complex logistical trail have often raised eyebrows even among its staunchest buyers. Now, India’s policymakers aren’t just looking at a sophisticated fighter on paper; they’re staring at one that has refused to get off Indian soil for two straight weeks. In a country where fleet serviceability is as critical as performance, the message has landed. Strategic Caution or Missed Opportunity? What complicates matters further is the growing fifth-generation capability of India’s adversaries. China already operates two stealth platforms, the J-20 and the carrier-capable J-35, with the J-20 deployed near the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. Meanwhile, Pakistan is reportedly fast-tracking its acquisition of 40 J-35s from China, aimed at restoring parity after suffering heavy aerial losses during the May skirmish with India. The shrinking squadron strength of the IAF has sparked urgency. Yet, urgency hasn’t translated to impulsive buying, at least not in the case of the F-35. Indian defence officials remain wary of overdependence on US hardware, especially given the F-35’s digital backbone, which allows for remote diagnostics and, in theory, remote control over critical systems. This fear isn't entirely unfounded. Denmark’s Defence Committee recently raised concerns over a potential “kill switch” in the F-35 program, triggered by worsening diplomatic ties with Washington. Canada, despite already paying for the first 16 of its 88 ordered jets, is reportedly reviewing whether the rest of the order aligns with its national interests. Portugal dropped its F-35 acquisition plans entirely in early 2025. Switzerland and the US are locked in a pricing dispute over the final bill for 36 aircraft. Even Germany is facing domestic backlash over its decision to procure the platform. The F-35’s stagnation in India now reflects a broader dilemma.

hangs over Mercosur summit","text":"The fate of a landmark trade deal with the European Union, which France is trying to block, looms large over a summit this week of South America's Mercosur bloc.\n\nBrussels in December struck a deal with Mercosur's founding members -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- which would allow the EU to sell more vehicles, machines and pharmaceuticals to South America in return for allowing in more meat, sugar, rice and soybeans from the region.\n\nThe agreement has been 25 years in the making, but still needs to be ratified by EU member states and the EU parliament.\n\nIt has faced stiff opposition from France, where farmers worry about being undercut by less-regulated Latin American peers, while enjoying backing from Germany, Spain and Portugal, among others.\n\n\"Today, the ball is in Europe's court,\" Ariel Gonzalez Levaggi, director of the Center for International Studies at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina, told AFP.\n\nBut \"there isn't much willingness on the part of Brussels to move forward, mainly because of the French resistance,\" he added.\n\nEU and South American backers of the deal had hoped Trump's tariffs blitz could breathe new life into a deal that would give exporters on either side of the Atlantic new outlets for their products in the event of punishing US duties.\n\nFor Florencia Rubiolo, a researcher at Conicet, Argentina's scientific and technical research council, it's \"of strategic interest for all Mercosur members, both individually, and as a bloc, to see this deal be ratified.\" \n\nAmong other things, she argued, it would show Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei that there is value in being part of the group, after his government has railed against Mercosur's constraints on members striking solo trade deals.\n\nMilei is gunning for a free trade deal with the United States, and he has suggested he could walk away from Mercosur if necessary to clinch an

has accused the Argentine of talking \"nonsense.\"\n\nThe contempt between the two was plain to see when Lula hosted Milei at a G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro last November.\n\nThe tensions could be exacerbated if Lula uses his trip to Buenos Aires to visit left-wing ex-president Cristina Kirchner, who is serving a six-year sentence for fraud under house arrest.\n\nKirchner on Tuesday requested permission for Lula to pay her a solidarity visit, in a move likely to anger her arch-nemesis Milei.\n\nIt was not clear, however, whether Lula would risk upsetting his Argentine counterpart at home.\n\n\"We may be experiencing the worst period in relations between Brazil and Argentina, in terms of political convergence,\" Juliana Peixoto, an expert in international relations at the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, told AFP.\n\nShe said she nonetheless expected Mercosur, which also includes Bolivia, to endure the tensions.\n\n\"It has a small but stable core of trade and has

Foe","text":"New York, Jun 3 (AP) President Donald Trump has a new political foil: New York's Democratic nominee for mayor, Zohran Mamdani. The president, who has a history of spewing sometimes vile insults at rivals, has in recent days escalated his attacks against the 33-year-old self-described democratic socialist. Trump has threatened to arrest Mamdani, to deport him and even to take over the country's largest city if he wins the general election in November. Also Read | Fact Check: Did Shahid Afridi Post Anti-India Instagram Story After Unblocking of Pakistan Social Media Accounts? Here’s The Truth. “As President of the United States, I'm not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York. Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards,” Trump wrote in an ominous message on his Truth Social site Wednesday morning. “I'll save New York City, and make it 'Hot' and 'Great' again, just like I did with the Good Ol' USA!” Mamdani's surprise victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has given Republicans a new target as they seek to paint the entire Democratic Party as extreme and out of touch with voters heading into elections this fall in New Jersey and Virginia and next year's high-stakes midterm elections. Also Read | Global Drug Cartel Busted Under Operation Med Max: NCB Dismantles International Drug Trafficking Syndicate Operating Across 4 Continents, Amit Shah Hails Agency. Since Mamdani's win, they have repeatedly highlighted his most controversial past comments and positions, casting him as dangerous, a communist, and an antisemite, and trying to tie him to all other Democratic officials. That has included intense criticism of his platform, as well as blatantly xenophobic and Islamophobic attacks. If Mamdani wins, he would become the city's furthest-left mayor in modern history. He ran on a platform that included opening city-run grocery stores, making buses free, freezing rent on rent-stabilized apartments, and raising property taxes on “richer and whiter neighborhoods.” Though he softened his stance as he campaigned, he called the New York Police Department “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety” in a 2020 social media post, and in others, called for abolishing the entire prison system. He has also drawn intense criticism from members of both parties over his pro-Palestinian advocacy. That has included describing Israel's war in Gaza as “genocide,” his refusal to disavow use of the phrase “globalize the intifada,” which is seen as a call to violence for many Jews. Also, for his refusal to support the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. His rise has sparked infighting and highlighted divisions among national Democratic officials, donors and political operatives. While many progressives have celebrated, seeing him as the future of a party aligned with leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, moderates have bemoaned the election's outcome as a setback in their quest to broaden Democrats' appeal and move past the more controversial policies that appears to have alienated some voters in recent elections. Trump threatens Mamdani's citizenship Trump unleashed some of his sharpest threats against Mamdani Tuesday, during a visit to a new migrant detention centre in the Florida Everglades. If Mamdani blocks ICE agents from making arrests in the city, “Well, then we'll have to arrest him,” he said. “Look, we don't need a communist in this country. But if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation.” Trump also amplified a false allegation that Mamdani, who was born in Uganda to Indian parents and came to New York when he was 7, is in the country illegally. “A lot of people are saying he's here illegally. We're going to look at everything,” he said. Mamdani, who is Muslim, became a naturalised American citizen a few years after he graduated from college. If elected, he would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor. Mamdani addressed the criticism during an appearance Wednesday, telling reporters that Trump is focusing on him to distract the public from the Republican mega tax and spending cuts bill that is moving through Congress. “Donald Trump said that I should be arrested. He said that I should be deported. He said that I should be denaturalised. And he said those things about me ... because he wants to distract from what I fight for,” he said. “I fight for the same people that he said he was fighting for. This is the same president who ran on a campaign of cheaper groceries, who ran on a campaign about easing the suffocating cost of living crisis. And ultimately, it is easier for him to fan the flames of division than to acknowledge the ways in which he has betrayed those working-class Americans.” Conservatives have turned their focus on Mamdani Until Mamdani's win, Trump and other Republicans had struggled to find a compelling foil. He frequently invokes his predecessor, Joe Biden. But with Democrats out of power and without a clear party leader, Trump has bounced from one official to the next, recently focusing his ire on Texas progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett. Since Mamdani's national rise and toppling of Cuomo, conservative politicians and commentators have turned their focus on him. That effort was on display Wednesday, when Republicans blasted House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries for defending Mamdani. “Leader' Jeffries Just Bent the Knee to Commie Mamdani,” the National Republican Congressional Committee wrote in an email blast, adding: “This radical platform is the future of the Democrat Party, and voters should be terrified.” The attacks have been brewing. Weeks before the primary, Vickie Paladino, a Republican member of the New York City Council, called for Mamdani to be deported. After Mamdani declared victory over Cuomo last week, Rep. Randy Fine, a Florida Republican, wrote on X that “If Mamdani has his way, NYC classrooms won't be teaching the Constitution in civics class. They'll be teaching Sharia Law.” Another Republican congressman, Rep. Brandon Gill of Texas, circulated a video of Mamdani eating a rice dish with his hands on X and wrote, “Civilised people in America don't eat like this. If you refuse to adopt Western customs, go back to the Third World.” Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, of Tennessee, has referred to Mamdani as “little muhammad” and late last month wrote a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for the Justice Department to investigate whether Mamdani should be denaturalised as a citizen.

The previous Democratic administration expanded the enrollment window for the coverage, which led to record enrollment.The Department of Health and Human Services rolled out a series of new restrictions for Obamacare late last month, just as Congress was weighing a major bill that will decrease enrollment in the health care program that Republican President Donald Trump has scorned for years. As many as 2 million people — nearly 10% — are expected to lose coverage from the health department's new rules.RELATED STORY | Trump’s extensive policy bill awaits procedural House votes after advancing from SenateThe mayors of Baltimore, Chicago and Columbus, Ohio sued the federal health department on Tuesday over the rules, saying they will result in more uninsured residents and overburden city services.“Cloaked in the pretense of government efficiency and fraud prevention, the 2025 Rule creates numerous barriers to affordable insurance coverage, negating the purpose of the ACA to extend affordable health coverage to all Americans, and instead increasing the population of underinsured and uninsured Americans,” the filing alleges.Two liberal advocacy groups — Doctors for America and Main Street Alliance — joined in on the complaint.The federal health department announced a series of changes late last month to the ACA. It will shorten the enrollment period for the federal marketplace by a month, limiting it to Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 in 2026. Income verification checks will become more stringent and a $5 fee will be tacked on for some people who automatically re-enroll in a free plan.Insurers will also be able to deny coverage to people who have not paid their premiums on past plans. The rules also bar roughly 100,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from signing up for the coverage.The new rules “safeguard the future of the marketplace,” and will lower premiums for those who remain in the program, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement.“The rule closes loopholes, strengthens oversight, and ensures taxpayer subsidies go to those who are truly eligible—that’s not controversial, it’s common sense,” Nixon said.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Justices preserve key part of Obamacare coverage requirementsBut the three mayors argue that the polices were introduced without an adequate public comment period on the policies.“This unlawful rule will force families off their health insurance and raise costs on millions of Americans. This does nothing to help people and instead harms Americans’ health and safety across our country,” said Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, which is representing the coalition of plaintiffs in the lawsuit.The lawsuit does not challenge the Trump administration’s restriction on immigrants signing up for the coverage.The Biden administration saw gains in Obamacare enrollment as a major success of the Democratic president's term, noting that a record 24 million people signed up for the coverage, thanks to generous tax breaks offered through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.But the program has been a target of Trump, who has said it is riddled with problems that make the coverage unaffordable for many without large subsidies.

So the mad dash, and the show she put on social media about it all, makes sense politically.\n\nBut while the audience of one in the White House will appreciate the effort, many constituents back home may be far less pleased. \n\nThat’s because the Trump megabill forces states to carry part of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, if they have high rates of overpaying or underpaying recipients. \n\nAnd Mace sounds ready to throw some pain in the direction of her home state in the name of fighting “waste, fraud and abuse.” \n\n“So under some of the provisions, our state may have to pay fines of upwards of $300 million if we don't get the fraudulent payments for SNAP under control,” she told The Independent. \n\nThe same goes for Medicaid.\n\n“But if you're talking about able-bodied workers,” she continued, “my policy is, if you're an able-bodied person and you want Medicaid? Get a f***ing job.” \n\nThe Trump bill also puts rural hospitals at risk due to changes in how states can raise money for Medicaid.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2024, South Carolina had a 9.25 percent error rate for SNAP, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, 64.7 percent of families in South Carolina on Medicaid have a full-time worker in their family. \n\n“We're gonna be fined $300 million a year if our government doesn't get its s*** together,” Mace said. “If I run for governor, you can be damn sure that's No. 1 on my list.” \n\nNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, who represents a district that Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris won in last year’s presidential election, echoed the sentiment. Like Mace, he is considering a run for governor and has long complained about the cap that the 2017 Trump tax cuts put on the State and Local Tax Deduction, commonly known as SALT \n\nBut Lawler said that the goal of the Trump legislation is to get states to run their programs properly. \n\n“That's the objective, to get the program fixed so they should be working towards it,” he told The Independent. New York has a 14.09 percent error rate for SNAP.\n\nRepublicans have long called for work requirements for social safety net programs, with some policy successes. But the current bill’s work- and cost-sharing provisions became a sticking point during the Senate debate. \n\nIn the Senate, Republicans cut a deal with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose state has an inordinately high error rate partially because of its rural population, to exempt it state from the cost-sharing part of the bill, which Democrats excoriated. \n\nBut Rep. Buddy Carter, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Jon Ossoff in Georgia, defended the change in policy. \n\n“We improved the program,” he told The Independent. ‘We made sure that people who are on there should be on there, they're going to be off of that. Now we're going to make it better for those who truly need it.”\n\nCarter is running to represent a state with a large error rate of 15.65 percent.\n\nBut Democrats say this will hurt states’ ability to provide SNAP benefits. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, specifically said it was unfair, “especially from a state that sends $70 billion more to the federal government than we get back. \n\n“If they're not going to run their programs, why are we paying taxes?” Sherrill told The Independent.","summary":"Republicans have no problem with the fact the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ could hurt people who vote for them and Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republicans-spending-bill-medicaid-snap-trump-mace-b2781493.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/20/30/GettyImages-2203348781.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pg8LmyWK-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-02 22:50:54","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":337654988,"title":"Breitbart Business Digest: The Vietnam Peace, Metternich, and Trump's Trade Strategy","text":"Trade War?

Instead, Donald Trump may have just ended one.\n\nOn Monday, the White House announced a trade agreement with Vietnam: a 20 percent tariff on goods imported to the United States, and in return, Vietnam will eliminate all tariffs on U.S. exports. A threatened 46 percent tariff—set to take effect July 9—has been shelved.\n\nThere was no retaliation. No collapse in talks. No spiral.

In The Forgotten Economic Theory Behind Trump’s Tariffs and its sequel, The Forgotten Economics Behind Trump’s Tariffs: Part II, we made the case that Trump was not launching a reckless trade war. He was applying textbook economic theory—specifically, optimal tariff theory—to a broken global system.\n\nThat theory holds that a large economy like the United States, by imposing tariffs, can shift some of the burden onto foreign exporters and improve its own terms of trade. And when wielded strategically, tariffs can do something more: they can force open foreign markets long closed to American goods. That’s exactly what happened this week.\n\nThe Metternich Method: How Trump’s Tariffs Delivered Trade Peace\n\nVietnam’s exports were set to face a 46 percent tariff under Trump’s Liberation Day schedule. The July 9 deadline loomed. And faced with real costs, Vietnam blinked. The deal they accepted—20 percent tariffs on their exports, zero tariffs on ours—is not a climbdown by the United States. It’s a concession. A proof of concept. A vindication of everything we argued this spring.\n\nWhat we are seeing now is not trade chaos, but a carefully constructed rebalancing. It recalls a much older model of diplomacy—one that Peter Viereck, the conservative historian and theorist, sought to reintroduce in his 1949 book Conservatism Revisited. In it, Viereck called for the revival of Prince Klemens von Metternich, the Austrian statesman who engineered the post-Napoleonic settlement at the Congress of Vienna. Metternich did not embrace revolution. He used power to restore order. He brought peace not by yielding and not by force but by recalibrating the European balance, by establishing that rule of law should govern in the affairs between nations.\n\nDonald Trump, in the realm of global trade, is performing the same function.\n\nFor decades, American trade policy was guided by a delusion. Opening the U.S. markets to more foreign products would bring peace, prosperity, and global harmony. Open our markets, and others would follow. That theory never matched reality. Instead, we opened while others closed. China deployed a predatory mercantilist strategy on a scale never before imagined. Our so-called “trade partners” erected non-tariff barriers. Europe protected its agriculture and its manufacturers. Countries like Vietnam engaged in trade-washing: running surpluses against the U.S. while running deficits with China, essentially recycling the purchasing power of the U.S. into an economic boon for China. Washington think tanks and Capitol Hill committees issued reports. Nothing changed.\n\nUntil Trump changed it.\n\nHe began the year by talking about a “ring around the collar” tariff—a universal declaration that trade would no longer be free without reciprocity. Then came the country-specific escalations of Liberation Day. Unlike the economists who treated U.S. power as something to apologize for, Trump used it. And in the case of Vietnam, it worked.\n\nCritics scoffed at the idea that tariffs could lead to anything but retaliation. But the retaliation never came. Vietnam negotiated instead. Even some of Trump’s harshest skeptics are beginning to admit that the strategy may have merit. On Wall Street, the realization that Trump has been underestimated is beginning to set in. As Apollo’s Torsten Sløk put it, “Trump may have outsmarted all of us.”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Trump didn’t do anything new. He simply reached into the toolkit of classical statecraft and applied it to the economic front. What the critics derided as “protectionism” for years turns out, in practice, to be the foreign policy of Metternichian diplomacy and realism applied to trade. What we dismissed as chaos looks more and more like strategy.\n\nVietnam as the Model: Watch the Trade Dominoes Fall\n\nThis agreement with Vietnam isn’t an anomaly. It’s a precedent. It demonstrates that the United States can—in the 21st century, under intense global scrutiny—still use its economic weight to reshape trade terms in its favor. It proves that tariffs can unlock concessions that our elite’s acceptance of foreign mercantilism has failed to produce.\n\nIn Conservatism Revisited, Viereck wrote that Metternich offered “the dignity of endurance.” Trump, through these deals, is offering something similar to the American worker and industrial base: the restoration of long-denied balance, the dignity of being treated fairly, and the end of the assumption that American market access is free and unconditional, some kind of right of foreigners to the purchasing power of our citizens.\n\nTrump’s tariffs did not collapse the global economy. They forced its participants to finally play fair.\n\nWe said this would happen. We said it in April, when the entire commentariat was still pretending the tariff era was a blunder waiting to be reversed. The Vietnam agreement is not a surprise. It’s a vindication.\n\nThis is not the start of a trade war. It is the end of one. And the settlement has been achieved by the most unlikely statesman of our time: the Metternich of trade.","summary":"The critics said tariffs would start a trade war.

Marco Rubio, who now serves as Trump's secretary of state.\n\n It also was backed by Mueller, who in his report said that Russia interfered on Trump's behalf and that the campaign welcomed the aid even if there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy.\n\n “This report doesn't change any of the underlying evidence — in fact it doesn't even address any of that evidence,” said Brian Taylor, a Russia expert who directs the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\n Mr. Taylor suggested the report may have been intended to reinforce Mr. Trump's claims that investigations into his ties to Russia are part of a Democratic hoax.\n\n “Good intelligence analysts will tell you their job is to speak truth to power,\" Taylor said. \"If they tell the leader what he wants to hear, you often get flawed intelligence.” \n\nIntelligence agencies regularly perform after-action reports to learn from past operations and investigations, but it's uncommon for the evaluations to be declassified and released to the public.\n\n Ratcliffe has said he wants to release material on a number of topics of public debate and has already declassified records relating to the assassinations of President John Kennedy and his brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, as well as the origins of COVID-19.","summary":"The memo was written on the orders of CIA Director John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who spoke out against the Russia investigation as a member of Congress.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-cia-report-criticises-investigation-into-russias-support-for-trump-in-2016/article69766106.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/347loh/article69766107.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2019-05-02T002708Z_766334581_RC1A2CECC730_RTRMADP_3_USA-CHINA-ESPIONAGE.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 22:50:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":337641346,"title":"Jim Cramer on two trends moving the market: Global trade and dollar weakness","text":"CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday discussed a couple broad ideas that he thinks are driving market action, saying it's important to understand trends and impactful current events.\n\n\"You know why I first got into this whacky business? Stories, stories that's why,\" Cramer said. \"Tremendous, intriguing stories, tales that could explain what's going to happen — and you could actually make a little money from them. That's what's happening right now, and the stories are driving much of this action.\"\n\nAccording to Cramer, Wall Street is at \"an inflection point.\" He said investors can focus on \"minutiae,\" like job losses in healthcare, moves in the 10-year Treasury or commentary from different members of the Federal Reserve. Or, he said, \"we can keep an eye on all of that but focus on some stories that can make us some money.\"\n\nCramer first pointed to developments in global trade regarding Vietnam. He described how President Donald Trump slapped Vietnam with a hefty tariff on his so-called \"Liberation Day\" back in April. The move came as a blow to many major companies who had rushed to move manufacturing from China to Vietnam to appease Trump, he said. Since then, Cramer continued, many apparel and furniture companies have seen their stocks take a hit as they face supply chain upset.\n\nHowever, Trump on Wednesday announced that the U.S. struck a trade deal with Vietnam that established a lower tariff on goods than he has initially threatened. A number of stocks jumped at the news, Cramer said, including Nike and Williams-Sonoma. He also named Gap, Levi Strauss and Kontoor Brands — which owns Lee, Wrangler and Helly Hansen — as potential winners.\n\nAnother notable trend Cramer identified is the weakness of the dollar, which reached a four-year low. Cramer said he thinks this weakness is positive for consumer packaged goods' companies like Procter & Gamble, because it makes their exports more competitive.\n\n\"Now, I don't like Procter & Gamble stock that much here, but it's pretty obvious they'll be able to beat the numbers thanks to the weaker dollar,\" he said.","summary":"CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors that it's important to understand impactful trends and current events, and he expanded on global trade and dollar weakness.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/jim-cramer-on-trends-moving-the-market-trade-and-dollar-weakness.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104979618-IMG_2870_2rr.jpg?v=1692140400","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 22:49:07","author":"Julie Coleman","authors":["Julie Coleman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":337637798,"title":"Trump 'suffers serious dementia' as he refers to himself as 'detainee' in Alligator Alcatraz gaffe","text":"Donald Trump's recent remarks have reignited concerns about his mental health as he seemingly referred to himself as a \"detainee\", stating that he would be spending \"a lot of time\" at the new \" Alligator Alcatraz \". On Tuesday, Trump visited the newly established immigration detention centre , located amidst alligator-infested swamps in the Florida Everglades . He declared that the facility would soon \"handle the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.\" However, in an awkward gaffe during a subsequent press conference, he seemed to categorise himself as one of those detainees. Fielding questions from the media, a Fox News journalist asked: \"Mr President, is there an expected time frame that detainees will here, days, weeks, months? And does that have anything to do with the immigration judges you just spoke about being trained and staffed here.\" Trump requested her to repeat the initial part of her query, to which she clearly replied: \"Is there a specific timeframe you expect the detainees to spend here?\" Despite this, the president appeared perplexed by the question and embarked on a strange, lengthy discourse about the amount of time he'd be spending in Florida. \"I'm gonna spend a lot. Look this is my home state, I love it, I love your government, I love all the people around,\" he stated. \"These are all friends of mine, they know them very well. I mean, I'm not surprised that they do so well, they're great people. Uhhh Ron has been a friend of mine a long time, I feel very comfortable in the state. I'll spend a lot of time here.\" The president then veered off topic, beginning to ramble about the Oval Office. He stated: \"I want to, you know for four years I've got to be in Washington, and I'm okay with it because I love the White House. I even fix up the little Oval Office. I make it, it's like a diamond, it's beautiful, it's so beautiful. It wasn't maintained properly, I will tell you that. But even when it wasn't, it was still the Oval Office so it meant a lot.\" Eventually, he returned to discussing his time in Florida, adding: \"But I'll spend as much time as I can here. You know, my vacation is generally here because it's convenient. I live in Palm Beach, it's my home and I have a very nice little place, nice little cottage to stay at, right? But we have a lot of fun and I'm a big contributor to Florida. You know, pay a lot of tax.\" He then went on to waffle about taxes in New York before finally concluded his response, stating: \"But thank you very much, I'll be here as much as I can.\" Video footage of the moment quickly spread like wildfire on social media, with many suggesting his answer was another indication of cognitive decline. One individual posted on X: \"Unreal. Asked about detainees - Trump answers like he's booking a vacation. This isn't a gaffe. It's cognitive collapse on live TV. Where's the media?\" \"Oh, he's so far gone mentally it's scary,\" another observed. A third commented: \"He has serious dementia. More and more of his moments seem insane, soon most all his moments will be this way.\" Others attributed the mistake to a hearing issue, reports the Irish Star . One person noted: \"He definitely has a hearing problem; you see it over and over again in his bizarre answers. Not addressing hearing issues can lead to early dementia. The media is quick to show Biden but slow to show these types of clips of trump.\" Another concurred, stating: \"Absolutely not a defense of his obvious mental decline, but he likely needs hearing aids, which he's too vain to use. He's given 'odd' answers to questions before.\" Some suggested that it wouldn't necessarily be a negative outcome if the president were to spend a considerable duration at the detention centre. One individual commented: \"Yes, please make him stay there for a long time,\" Another penned: \"Maybe he means he'll spend a lot of time there as an inmate.A third joked: \". A third quipped: \"Finally he's said something I can get behind.\" Yet another remarked: \"Correct answer. He will stay in Alcatraz for a long time.\"","summary":"Donald Trump has been accused of suffering from dementia after he referred to himself as a &quot;detainee&quot; during a bizarre and rambling answer to a question from a journalist","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/trump-suffers-serious-dementia-refers-35491117","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35491114.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Trump-Immigration-25182706574819.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 22:48:51","author":"Alexandra Snow,Reanna Smith","authors":["Alexandra Snow","Reanna Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.222}]}
