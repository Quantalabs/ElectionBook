North Carolina and Georgia both hold sixteen electoral votes, ranking second behind only Pennsylvania among all seven battleground states.\n\nMuch of the former president’s Friday night remarks focused on the economy, which has consistently polled as voters’ top issue ahead of Election Day, with Obama conceding that costs remain too high for many people.\n\n2024 ELECTIONS LIVE UPDATES: LATEST NEWS ON THE TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE\n\n“Many folks here in North Carolina and across the country are struggling to pay the bills, and now understand — it’s important. Wages are steadily growing, unemployment is low, inflation is finally slowing, but the price of everything, from healthcare to housing groceries, it’s still too high, and that hurts,” he stated.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has polled ahead of Harris for most of the election when it comes to economic stewardship, but Obama claimed that any economic progress ushered in during Trump’s first term was because of the progress Obama’s own administration made over his eight years in office.\n\n“Traveling around the country, I talked to some people. Some people say, ‘Well you know what? I remember the economy being pretty good when Donald Trump first came into office.’ Yes, it was pretty good because it was my economy,” he declared, earning raucous cheers from the crowd.\n\n“We had had 75 straight months of job growth and handed it over to Donald Trump, and all he did was give a tax cut to folks who didn’t need it and dried up the rest in the process. So do not give him credit for that,” Obama continued before attempting to head off people lauding Trump for sending direct relief checks. “Joe Biden sent you a check during the pandemic, just like I gave relief to the American people with the help of Congress during the Great Recession. “The difference is we didn’t put our name on the check because it wasn’t about feeding our egos or advancing our politics. It was about helping people get by during a crisis, so please do not give him credit for an economy he didn’t have anything to do with making work.”\n\nUltimately, Obama argued that, unlike Trump, Harris actually has “actual plans” for improving the economy, as opposed to “concepts of a plan” like the former president.\n\n“So if somebody tells you this election doesn’t matter, explain, no, it does matter. It makes a difference when you have a leader who sees you and cares about you and thinks about you. They don’t need to be perfect, but they need to try,” he closed. “If enough of us make our voices heard, we will leave no doubt about the outcome of this election, we will leave no doubt about who we are and what America stands for, and, together, we will keep building a country that’s more fair and more just and more equal and more free.”\n\nThe Tar Heel State hasn’t gone blue in a presidential election since 2008, during Obama’s first campaign for the White House, and the former president’s popularity in North Carolina was evident Friday night. Lines of awaiting attendees wrapped fully around the Charlotte Convention Center hours before Obama was scheduled to speak, and guests danced along to Harris’s campaign DJ before the program started.\n\nObama was preceded by a number of speakers, including Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison and former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nHolder specifically attacked House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-NC) for calling for the state’s 16 Electoral College votes to be awarded to former President Donald Trump early because of the damage to the western part of the state. The comment drew loud boos from the crowd and a shout of “Don’t boo — vote!”\n\n“That’s Barack’s line,” Holder responded, earning laughs. “Here’s the deal. You can vote. You can boo and vote. How about that?”\n\nObama’s speech itself wasn’t without hiccups. Just minutes after taking the stage, a group of pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted his remarks, chanting “Free Palestine!” and waving flags and signage. \n\nMeanwhile, at least three attendees required medical attention during the event. The Harris campaign did not say how many guests were in attendance Friday night, but the Grand Ballroom at the Charlotte Convention Center was filled to capacity.\n\nTrump leads Harris by less than appoint in North Carolina, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. He won the state in 2020 with a margin of 1.3%.\n\nHarris opted not to campaign in North Carolina this week, though her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), held a rally in Wilmington on Thursday.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, blanketed North Carolina this week, holding three campaign rallies on Monday and Tuesday along with a separate visit to storm-ravaged Asheville. Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), also held a rally in Charlotte on Friday evening.","summary":"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina — With less than two weeks to go before Election Day 2024, former President Barack Obama returned to North Carolina to make the case for Vice President Kamala Harris.

The officials say it’s part of “Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.”\n\nThe information was released in a joint statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nThis latest claim involving a key county is an example not only of attempts to influence voters in the final weeks of a contentious election, but of how election officials have learned to move swiftly to counter false narratives over the last four years.\n\nSince 2020, distrust in the voting process has taken hold among many Americans, creating an additional challenge for state and local officials who must not only administer elections but repeatedly explain and highlight the safeguards in place to protect the vote.\n\nElection officials around the country have spent recent years preparing for the onslaught of false claims, from running worst-case-scenario tabletop exercises to shoring up emergency procedures with law enforcement to publishing proactive fact checks on their websites. Many have also increased transparency with the public, opening their doors for all-access tours in hopes it will head off some of the most damaging conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Bucks County video isn’t the only case in which this work has paid off. When AI-generated robocalls targeted Democratic voters in New Hampshire days before its primary in January, state authorities quickly issued statements and began investigations, which ultimately led to criminal charges and fines for the person responsible.\n\nDisinformation experts say the Bucks County video signals a trend that’s likely to increase in the days leading up to Election Day — insidious disinformation, sometimes from foreign sources, that aims to undermine the public’s confidence in the electoral process.\n\nThis particular video is “almost certainly” connected to a Russian disinformation network known as Storm-1516 or CopyCop, according to Darren Linvill, the co-director of the Media Forensics Hub at Clemson University, who has closely studied the group.\n\nThe user who popularized the video on X had been an early amplifier of several other narratives from this network, he said. These included a fake video that spread earlier this month with unfounded allegations against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. The user also amplified the very first narrative Linvill’s team tracked from Storm-1516, back in August 2023.\n\nThe style and appearance of the latest video matches other videos from the network, including its use of a Black actor, Linvill said.\n\nThat’s long been a trend in fake videos originating in Russia, said Josephine Lukito, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Texas at Austin who has researched Russian disinformation. She said the video’s use of a Black actor with an accent is intentional as a way to inflame existing divisions on American soil.\n\n“It tends to amplify racism, right?” Lukito said. “There’s already this kind of groundswell of discussion about immigrants that are illegally voting or immigration broadly. Russian disinformation absolutely exploits that.”\n\nAfter the video had been debunked, the X user deleted their original post and shared multiple posts from other accounts decrying it as fake.\n\nAmerica PAC, a super political action committee launched by billionaire X owner Elon Musk to support Trump in his bid for a second term, was among those denouncing the video — a stark contrast to the misinformation that frequently spreads on X, often spurred by Musk himself. The PAC declined a request for further comment.\n\nThere were multiple clues that immediately indicated the Bucks County video was fabricated. For example, under Pennsylvania law, election officials must wait until 7 a.m. ET on Election Day before they can begin to process ballots cast by mail and prepare them to be counted.\n\nOther tip-offs included the dark green color on the left side of the outer envelopes — it is actually more of a kelly green — and the glossiness of the inner and outer envelopes, which in reality have a matte finish.

Ảnh: ANI/TTXVN\n\nTheo kênh CNN và tờ New York Times, bức thư từ bộ phận liêm chính công của Bộ Tư pháp, nơi điều tra các hành vi vi phạm luật liên quan đến bầu cử tiềm ẩn, đã được gửi tới PAC. Bộ Tư pháp và PAC chưa trả lời yêu cầu bình luận về sự việc.\n\nTrước đó, trong phát biểu trước cử tri ở Pennsylvania hôm 19/10, ông Musk tuyên bố sẽ thưởng1 triệu USD mỗi ngày cho cử tri ngẫu nhiên ký vào bản kiến ​​nghị trực tuyến - ủng hộ quyền tự do ngôn luận và sở hữu vũ khí, được công bố hồi đầu tháng bởi Siêu ủy ban hành động chính trị America PAC ủng hộ ứng viên đảng Cộng hòa Donald Trump. Phầ.n thưởn.g sẽ có hiệu lực cho đến ngày bầu cử 5/11.\n\nTheo trang web America PAC, để đủ điều kiện nhận 1 triệu USD, những người ký đơn kiến nghị phải là cử tri đã đăng ký và sống tại một trong 7 tiểu bang dao động - gồm Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania và Wisconsin.\n\nBằng cách yêu cầu cử tri ký tên vào bản kiến nghị, America PAC có thể thu thập thông tin liên lạc của các cử tri tiềm năng, từ đó vận động họ bỏ phiếu cho ông Trump, người mà ông Musk tuyên bố ủng hộ.\n\nPhầ.n thưởn.g này đã thu hút đông đảo người Mỹ ký tên vào bản kiến nghị, với hy vọng trở thành triệu phú chỉ sau một đêm.\n\nVào cuối tuần qua, ông Musk đã trao những tấm séc trị giá 1 triệu USD cho hai người được xướng tên là người chiến thắng - gồm một người đàn ông ở Harrisburg vào hôm 19/10 và một người phụ nữ khác ở Pittsburgh vào hôm 20/10. Một cử tri khác ở Bắc Carolina cũng đã nhận được 1 triệu USD.\n\nGiữa các sự kiện vận động tranh cử trực tiếp để ủng hộ ông Trump, ông Musk còn đăng dòng trạng thái chúc mừng những người chiến thắng và kêu gọi những cử tri đã đăng ký khác ở các tiểu bang dao động ký vào bản kiến ​​nghị của ông và tham gia nhận thưởng.\n\nTuy nhiên, chuyên gia về luật bầu cử cho biết các vụ trao thưởng này có khả năng là bất hợp pháp. Theo đó, hình thức thưởng tiề.n cho cử tri này có thể vi phạm luật liên bang vốn quy định cấm trả tiề.n cho người dân để họ đăng ký bỏ phiếu. Thống đốc Pennsylvania, ông Josh Shapiro, đã kêu gọi cơ quan thực thi pháp luật điều tra vụ việc.\n\nTheo tiết lộ của giới chức liên bang, ông Musk cho đến nay đã chi ít nhất 75 triệu USD cho America PAC, khiến nhóm này trở thành một phần quan trọng trong nỗ lực trở lại Nhà Trắng của ông Trump.\n\nTrong số hàng loạt các nhà tài trợ chính trị lớn, mức độ tham gia của ông Musk vào chiến dịch tranh cử của ông Trump cũng được coi là rất bất thường. Ông không chỉ chi hàng chục triệu USD để ủng hộ ứng cử viên tổng thống đảng Cộng hòa, mà còn đích thân vận động tranh cử, nhảy trên sân khấu tại một cuộc mít tinh của ông Trump, và xuất hiện trực tiếp trên khắp Pennsylvania với tư cách là người đại diện cho chiến dịch tranh cử nổi bật. Ông Musk còn tận dụng mạng xã hội X - nền tảng được tỷ phú này mua lại với giá 44 tỷ USD năm 2022 - để giúp đỡ ông Trump tranh cử.\n\n Cựu Tổng thống Mỹ Donald Trump tại Đại hội toàn quốc của đảng Cộng hòa ở bang Wisconsin ngày 17/7/2024. Ảnh: Kyodo/TTXVN\n\nCác nhà phân tích cho rằng lý do khiến ông Musk quan tâm đến việc đầu tư vào nỗ lực tranh cử của ông Trump là vì vị tỷ phú này từ lâu đã bất bình với các quy định của chính phủ. Ông Musk có thể coi ông Trump là người ủng hộ bãi bỏ quy định ở những lĩnh vực có lợi cho người ủng hộ tỷ phú.\n\nNhững người quan sát các động thái của người sáng lập SpaceX và Tesla nhấn mạnh ông Musk \"đã hoàn toàn từ bỏ sự thận trọng như một phương thức tham gia chính trị\", một lựa chọn đặc biệt bất thường đối với một người siêu giàu.\n\nTrước đây, ông Musk đã phải đối mặt với hậu quả pháp lý và tài chính vì đã làm những điều mà ông cho là sáng suốt . Năm 2018, ông Musk và Tesla đã đồng ý trả 40 triệu USD tiề.n phạt vì dòng tweet, nói rằng ông sẽ đưa Tesla lên sàn với giá 420 USD/cổ phiếu. Sau đó, ông Musk nói rằng ông không hối hận về dòng trạng thái đó và đó là khoản tiề.n phạt \"xứng đáng\".","summary":"Trong khi đó, nhóm hỗ trợ tranh cử của bà Harris huy động được nhiều tiề.n hơn nhưng cũng chi nhiều hơn ông Trump trong những tháng gần đây.

And given the pair’s past incendiary comments about each other, there are bound to be fireworks. \n\nTrump has made the rounds with several prominent podcasters in the final weeks of the campaign, but none as influential as Rogan, who draws over 14 million listeners on Spotify alone and 17.5 million subscribers on YouTube.\n\nEarlier this week, a campaign source confirmed to DailyMail.com that the long-awaited interview is being recorded in Rogan’s Austin, Texas, studio. \n\nRogan is known for hosting meandering hours-long interviews and probing guests about hot political, cultural and sometimes niche topics – think aliens or taking acid.\n\nThe interview taping on Friday is poised to be especially riveting since the pair have a complicated history.\n\nFor years, Trump has traded barbs with the popular podcaster, who once called the ex-president a ‘threat to democracy.’ \n\nRogan has also said in 2022 he did not want Trump on his show as it could influence the outcome of the election. \n\n‘I’m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form,’ Rogan said then. ‘I don’t want to help him, I’m not interested in helping him.’\n\nIn August, Rogan faced backlash from his MAGA followers after he seemingly endorsed RFK Jr. over Trump.\n\nSpeaking about the current state of the race with a guest, the host lamented how politicians manipulate their constituents. \n\n‘That’s just what they do. That’s politics,’ he said. ‘They do it on the left, they do it on the right.’ \n\n‘They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives, and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,’ he continued. \n\nTrump’s loyal following took this as an endorsement of the Independent presidential candidate.\n\nAnd Trump fired back at Rogan on Truth Social: ‘It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring.’\n\nRogan was then forced to walk back his comments, insisting it wasn’t an endorsement of Kennedy. \n\nHowever, the duo’s relationship hasn’t always been sour. \n\nThe podcaster – who doubles as a UFC Commentator – heaped praise on the former president after Trump attended a fight at Madison Square Garden in New York last November. \n\n‘He walks out of Maddison Square Garden, it was fu***ing bananas,’ the UFC host said of Trump’s walkout. ‘The whole place was cheering.’ \n\nHe likened the walkout alongside UFC CEO Dana White, Kid Rock and Tucker Carlson as the ‘Right-wing Avengers.’\n\n‘The cheers of the crowd was nuts, it was overwhelmingly in support of him,’ Rogan added. ‘It was long, it was a roar.’ \n\nRogan’s show has a massive audience and can prove as a smart vehicle for the former president to use to send out his message. \n\nOn Spotify the show has 14.5 million subscribers and on YouTube Rogan boasts 17.5 million. \n\nThis huge audience also skews younger, with a YouGov analysis finding that over 56 percent of listeners are between the ages of 18 – 34. \n\nThose youthful listeners are a valuable voting block in this election, one fought over by both candidates. \n\nThe appearance is another installment in the ex-president’s ‘bro’ podcast blitz. He has recently been on the Nelk Boys’ Full Send show, Patrick Bet-David’s podcast and sat down with comedian Theo Von. \n\nHe also appeared with live streamer Adin Ross, who his son Barron is a fan of.\n\nThe alternative-media heavy strategy is likely aimed to spread Trump’s message to younger male audience just ahead of Election Day.\n\nRumors have swirled over whether the former president would actually appear on the program for days.\n\nThe reports came just as Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ team planned an appearance too. \n\nBut suddenly on Thursday evening, Harris’ team said she would not be on Rogan’s show. \n\n‘We talked with Rogan and his team about the podcast. Unfortunately, it isn’t going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this period of the campaign,’ Harris spokesman Ian Sams said on MSNBC.\n\nThough Trump and Rogan are filming Friday, the release date for the highly-anticipated installment is still unclear.\n\nSpotify, which hosts the show, has yet to announce when the episode will air.","summary":"Donald Trump is expected to sit down with podcaster Joe Rogan on&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/understanding-the-feud-joe-rogans-podcast-interview-with-former-president-donald-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/25/15/91284925-14002105-Donald_Trump_is_set_to_go_on_the_Joe_Rogan_Experience_on_Friday_-a-12_1729866690144.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-26 00:31:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056},{"id":261136272,"title":"Mega-Donors Pour $8 Million Into Late Push Against N.Y.

Not only that, another accuser specifically talking about his twisted relationship with billionaire underage sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. We’d say we were shocked, but at this point it’s just… all too believable.\n\nThis time it’s a former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model named Stacey Williams. She came forward this week to tell the story of being sexually assaulted by Trump back in the ’90s — and the “twisted game” she realized she was a part of.\n\nStacey says she met Trump at a Christmas party in 1992 — after his good pal and wingman Epstein introduced them. See, she’d been casually seeing Epstein at the time (she was about 25 years old). But the way Jeffrey talked up his friend… She said on a Zoom call with the Survivors for Kamala group this week:\n\n“It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together.”\n\nA couple months later, around the early spring of 1993, she and Epstein were going for a walk when he suggested stopping by Trump Tower to visit his friend. Right when they got there, she recalls, Trump said hello and then immediately grabbed her and started groping. You know, how he bragged about doing in the Access Hollywood tape. She said he put his hands “all over my breasts” and butt. No asking. No consent. Just did it. She remembers freezing because she was so “deeply confused.” This was her lover’s buddy, after all.\n\nThen she saw it. The men were smiling at each other.\n\nIt wasn’t until later she began theorizing about what happened. At the time she was just upset and unable to wrap her head around it. But it got more confusing:\n\n“Jeffrey and I left and he didn’t look at me or speak to me and I felt this seething rage around me, and when we got down to the sidewalk, he looked at me and just berated me, and said: ‘Why did you let him do that?’ He made me feel so disgusting and I remember being so utterly confused.”\n\nThat didn’t match the look between the men. But as she kept dwelling on it, she put it together, telling the Guardian on Wednesday:\n\n“I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways, I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me. And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat.”\n\nA “twisted game” is how she put it. But considering what we now know about Epstein, it may have been more. He may have been delivering a girl on a platter for a high-powered friend. We know now that was his M.O.\n\nSee Stacey tell her own story (below):\n\nThe Trump campaign responded to the Guardian‘s story, saying:\n\n“These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign.”\n\nWilliams is certainly a Democratic supporter who has been stumping for Kamala Harris. But she’s been telling her story for years. And she’s not the only one.\n\nDonald was accused of rape by his own wife, Ivana Trump, in their divorce documents. She described him throwing her onto the bed in anger and ramming his penis inside her.\nDonald was accused in a court of law by E. Jean Carroll. There was a whole trial in which the jury decided he had committed sexual abuse against her — something the judge clarified a normal person would call “rape.” That’s a matter of legal record now.\nDonald was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl, along with Epstein. The accuser disappeared before coming forward, reportedly after being intimidated into silence.\n\nThere are so many more stories. But at this point… You either believe Trump alone or you believe everyone else. Just ask yourself this… If these stories were about Alec Baldwin, would it change how you see him? George Clooney? Jeff Bezos? Bill Clinton? John Elway? Arsenio Hall? Edward James Olmos? Any other famous man?\n\nAsk yourself if you think Donald Trump, failed casino owner and host of Celebrity Apprentice, has some special amount of integrity this kind of scandal can’t penetrate… And if so… WHY??\n\n[Image via Netflix/YouTube.]","summary":"[Warning: Potentially Triggering Content] Another Donald Trump misconduct accuser.

Saudi Arabia has yet to officially join, but is closely involved with the group, while a host of other countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Myanmar have formally submitted, or are considering, applications for membership.\nAnalysts caution that the West, and the United States in particular, should not attempt to dissuade nations from joining the bloc. Instead, they argue, a more constructive approach would involve addressing the grievances that have driven these countries towards a “search for alternatives”.\n\nAny attempt to sway nations away from Brics is likely to backfire, according to Sarang Shidore, director of the Global South programme at the Quincy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\nWestern nations “should examine where they are falling short on their policies, especially towards the Global South”, he said, referring to developing nations with lower economic and social development.\n“They need to accept the reality of hedging behaviour and work to win influence by focusing on mutual interests rather than trying to change the interests of other states.”\nShidore argued for a reinvigoration of US-backed international institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization, which have been increasingly sidelined amid rising tensions.\nWith Brics now accounting for 45 per cent of the world’s population and over one-third of the global economy, further expansion could herald a shift in the Western-led world order.\n\nYet this growth also complicates the bloc’s identity, said Jagannath Panda, head of the Institute for Security and Development Policy’s Stockholm Centre for South Asian and Indo-Pacific Affairs.\nBrics was transforming from a group of emerging economies to include developed and “not-so-emerging economies”, he said, creating “a geopolitical ring with the lead of China and the strong support of Russia … to challenge the American-led Western order”.\n“The expansion of Brics suggests that the divide between the West and the rest is only going to expand,” Panda said, cautioning that the bloc’s growth could lead to divisions in global governance.\nMeanwhile, US allies such as Japan appear increasingly uneasy as more Southeast Asian nations express interest in joining Brics – worried that the likes of Malaysia and fellow prospective member Thailand, historically known for their balanced diplomatic stances, may be drifting away from neutral positions, analysts say.\n\nThe involvement of 36 countries, including 20 heads of state, at this week’s Brics summit in Kazan made it “the largest foreign policy event ever held” on Russian soil, according to Yuri Ushakov, an aide to President Vladimir Putin.\nPutin himself lauded Russia-China cooperation as “one of the main stabilising factors” in global affairs, as he welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to a face-to-face meeting – their third this year – on the sidelines of the summit.\nThe two countries intended to work together more closely “to ensure global security and promote a fairer world order”, Putin said.\nIn his remarks, Xi emphasised that “the world is undergoing a major change that has not been seen in a century”, but said China and Russia had “explored a correct way for neighbouring major powers to coexist without forming alliances, engaging in confrontation or targeting third parties”.\nHe further articulated a need for urgent reform of the international financial architecture, calling on Brics nations to lead the way.\n\nThe summit’s 43-page final communique, while ambitious, was vague, outlining various projects to facilitate trade between Brics nations, including an alternative payment system to the US dollar, yet lacking specifics or timelines.\nAlthough it touched on pressing global issues, including geopolitics and artificial intelligence, the mention of Ukraine was limited, only once noting “with appreciation relevant proposals of mediation” aimed at a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nThe toughest language was reserved for the Middle East, calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and denouncing Israeli “attacks against humanitarian operations, facilities, personnel and distribution points”.\nRussia and China are keen to cement relationships in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, said Ja Ian Chong, an associate political-science professor at the National University of Singapore, noting that both are navigating geopolitical pressures and sanctions from the US and its allies.\nMoscow faces wide-ranging economic sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine while Beijing has claimed that Washington is seeking to “contain, encircle and suppress” it, Chong said.\n“Such ties enable [them] … to obtain key minerals and other raw materials and access markets,” he said.\n\n‘The race is on’\nRecent seismic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and intensifying US-China rivalry, have fuelled “a surge of interest among Global South states” in joining Brics, said the Quincy Institute’s Shidore.\nFor many in the Global South, these developments signalled a disintegration of the existing world order, prompting fears of a looming systemic crisis.\n“As by far the most important systemic power, the US is the lead manager of the global system, and when it begins to fail, states begin to lose confidence in this leadership. This motivates a search for alternatives,” Shidore said, noting that countries pursuing Brics membership were not necessarily looking to replace the current system, but rather to revive and strengthen its more equitable aspects.\nSoutheast Asia’s renewed interest in Brics reflects a broader shift towards multipolarity, said Anu Anwar, a non-resident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Centre for Chinese Studies.\nNations in the region view Brics as a platform to balance relationships, diversify economic ties, and amplify their voices in global governance, he said. The bloc’s focus on “South-South cooperation” and financial independence, particularly through the New Development Bank, adds to its allure.\n\nThe multilateral development bank established by Brics in 2014 “offers these states a way to hedge their strategic positions in an increasingly polarised world”, Anwar said.\nTo counter the momentum of countries flocking to the bloc, Anwar argued that the West “must confront the underlying grievances, including the collective frustrations of the non-Western world over exclusion from global decision-making processes”.\nA fairer redistribution of power and reforms in institutions such as the UN, World Bank and International Monetary Fund would be essential, he added.\nIn the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, aligning with a bloc in which Moscow plays a leading role might have appeared risky for US allies such as Thailand and the UAE, said geopolitical analyst Geoffrey Miller from the Victoria University of Wellington’s Democracy Project in New Zealand.\nHowever, as the conflict has evolved, US calls for solidarity with Ukraine have lost some of their potency, he said – particularly in light of the ongoing war in Gaza, which has “seen Washington cede much of the moral high ground over its near unconditional support for Israel”.\nFor the US and its allies and partners, the lesson of the Brics expansion has to be that the race is on\nGeoffrey Miller, geopolitical analyst\nAny group that includes both China and India “deserves to be taken seriously”, Miller said, adding: “for the US and its allies and partners, the lesson of the Brics expansion has to be that the race is on”.\nRather than attempting to undermine the bloc, Miller suggested that the West should focus on providing meaningful alternatives, noting that initiatives such as Apec and the G20 – groups that include pivotal Brics members – could serve as platforms for collaboration.\nWashington must also ensure that its initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework are “more about substance than rhetoric”, he said, criticising the US for past protectionist stances – particularly its withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017 under former President Donald Trump, which remains a sore point for many in the Asia-Pacific.\n“There is probably no bigger carrot than free trade access to the US, which remains the world’s biggest economy,” Miller said.\nGrowing interest in Brics is also tied to India’s rising stature as an autonomous geopolitical player, said Brian Wong, a geopolitical strategist and assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nIndia’s recent diplomatic manoeuvres, particularly its responses to tensions with Canada and its “remarkable ability to fence-sit when it comes to the war in Ukraine”, illustrate its increasing significance.\n“More countries view Brics-plus as a conducive platform and basis for accruing similar levels of political cachet and geopolitical versatility,” Wong added.\nNew Delhi’s assertiveness has been evident in its diplomatic fallout with Canada over accusations of assassination linked to Sikh separatists. India has also maintained its relationship with Russia despite the Ukraine war, continuing to purchase oil while engaging both Kyiv and Moscow.\nOn the eve of the Brics summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed to Putin his desire for peace in Ukraine, signalling his country’s willingness to help achieve a resolution to one of Europe’s deadliest conflicts since World War Two.\nAn even bigger Brics?\nDuring this week’s summit, Putin revealed that more than 30 states had expressed interest in joining Brics – as he also stressed the need to maintain balance in any expansion.\nWhile there is no fixed timeline for admitting new members, Quincy Institute’s Shidore said the consensus-based decision-making process of Brics would inevitably slow down as the group grows.\n“But a larger Brics also can be more influential,” he said, while cautioning that an expanded bloc might dilute the dominance of China and Russia, as each member state is likely to prioritise its own interests “and not simply kowtow to Moscow and Beijing”.\nYet the bloc’s true geopolitical power hinges on “the strategic alignment and leadership of its most powerful members”, Harvard University’s Anwar said, even if expanded membership could enhance the bloc’s legitimacy as a representative voice for the Global South.\nAll existing members … must watch out for the perils of an overexpanded, overstretched and insufficiently coherent Brics\nBrian Wong, geopolitical strategist\n“For Brics to evolve into a truly impactful entity capable of shaping the global order, it must develop two critical components: a unified threat perception and a coherent alternative vision of world order, both of which are currently absent,” he said.\n“Without these shared foundations, Brics will struggle to act as a decisive force in reshaping global governance.”\nThat said, Brics is still an “incredibly burgeoning and fledgling bloc at its core”, said the University of Hong Kong’s Wong, adding that simply increasing membership does not equate to strength.\n“All existing members, including China and Russia, must watch out for the perils of an overexpanded, overstretched and insufficiently coherent Brics,” he said.\n\nChina’s role\nThrough Brics and its expansion, China aims to reinforce ties with the Global South and diminish global reliance on the US dollar while promoting the use of its own currency, said Jagannath from the Institute for Security and Development Policy.\n“The intent is to polarise the world and make them stay connected and dependent on the Eurasian powers such as China, if not Russia,” he said, noting the limitations of this ambition as China’s image is “still far from solid” in much of the Global South.\nBeijing has sought to position itself as a champion of the Global South in recent years. A position paper released for last month’s annual session of the UN General Assembly highlighted China’s support for developing nations and called for greater representation for these countries in global forums, including the UN – a change Beijing has long urged.\nChina’s other goal of reducing dollar dependence has grown increasingly significant in light of its deepening economic ties with Russia since the onset of the Ukraine war in February 2022, Jagannath said.\nLast year, bilateral trade between Russia and China surged to a record high of US$240 billion, driven in part by sanctions imposed on Moscow. The share of Chinese yuan in Russia’s imports has skyrocketed from 5 per cent to between 20 to 25 per cent since the invasion, according to a paper by Elina Ribakova, a non-resident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, published in December.\n\nPutin urged Brics nations at the summit to collaborate on overhauling the global financial system and ending the dominance of the US dollar.\nAccording to a document prepared by Russia’s finance ministry and central bank, Moscow’s proposal for a new payments system would link commercial banks through the Brics countries’ central banks.\nWhile the practicality of achieving an alternative payment system or de-dollarisation remains to be seen, the Democracy Project’s Miller argued that the annual Brics summit itself served a valuable purpose.\n“Much in the same way that the Apec summit remains valuable, despite the bloc under-delivering in terms of hard outcomes,” he said.\n“While a growing Brics membership may make it harder to gain consensus on specific aims, its relevance and status as a Global South forum will continue to rise in the near term.”\nAdditional reporting by Reuters","summary":"The growing bloc, which seeks alternatives to Western-led institutions, is being leveraged by Beijing and Moscow to forge a multipolar world.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3283915/brics-grows-race-between-china-russia-and-west-global-influence","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/25/a46ecfea-0d5e-4590-b3e6-75a961fdc2a1_6c6bc14c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-26 00:30:13","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.126},{"id":261136172,"title":"“Army Report Reveals Findings on Incident Involving Trump Campaign at Arlington Cemetery”","text":"The U.S. Army on Friday released a heavily redacted copy of a police report stemming from an August incident in which a staffer from former President Donald Trump’s campaign allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery worker.\n\nThe report, which describes the incident as a “simple assault,” says that on Aug. 26 the campaign staffer used “both” hands while trying to move past the cemetery worker, who NBC News previously reported had attempted to stop the staffer from taking photos. The names of both people were redacted.\n\nAccording to the report, the cemetery employee didn’t need medical attention on scene “and later refused when offered.” The worker also did not want to press charges, the report said.\n\nA Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night on the Army documents.\n\nAn Army spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but told Politico in a statement: “The law enforcement investigation into the incident remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time.”\n\nThe internal documents were released by the Army after American Oversight, a government ethics and transparency group, sued to obtain the report.

He had taken part in a wreath-laying ceremony commemorating three years since 13 U.S. service members were killed during an attack by the Islamic State outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan.

We will take our streets back by being tough & smart on violent, & all other types, of Crime,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in September.\"In Florida, like so many other States that have already given their approval, personal amounts of marijuana will be legalized for adults with Amendment 3,\" Trump wrote. \"Whether people like it or not, this will happen through the approval of the Voters, so it should be done correctly.\"Vice President Kamala Harris announced on the All the Smoke podcast that she wants to legalize marijuana use, saying she feels \"strongly that people should not be going to jail for smoking weed.\"Pew Research Center in March released polling that found 57 percent of Republicans age 18 to 20 favor making marijuana legal for medical and recreational use. Older Republicans age 30 to 49 share a similar sentiment, with 52 percent support.Despite what would seem by and large support for legalization, the states with the three main efforts—Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota—remain far from slam dunks due to a number of circumstances.North Dakota voters passed a legalization measure for medical marijuana in 2016, but subsequent pushes for recreational legalization in 2018 and 2022 ended in failure, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government.South Dakota passed a recreational legalization measure in 2020, but the state's Supreme Court overturned the vote due to the state's requirement for ballot measures to address a single subject, and the legalization effort aimed to pass both medical and recreational use at the same time.Florida has spent years in a legal tussle over the validity of the measure since the state seeks to amend the state's constitution in order to legalize recreational use. Titled \"Amendment 3,\" the measure faced a legal challenge from the state attorney general, but the state Supreme Court deemed that the amendment met all requirements.Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has also actively campaigned against the measure, and his wife, Casey DeSantis, released a statement on X arguing that the amendment \"creates a permanent, constitutional right to possess over 100 joints at a time and SMOKE ANYWHERE in Florida—even public places where it could more easily fall into the hands of children.\"Newsweek reached out by email on Friday to the governors of Florida, South Dakota, North Dakota and Nebraska for comment.","summary":"Several states could approve either legal or medical marijuana, with lobbyists confident that the majority of cases are \"winnable.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/states-legal-weed-november-winnable-1975287","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2504926/florida-weed-marijuana-cannabis-legalization.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-26 00:12:57","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":261135310,"title":"Stephen King Cancels Washington Post Subscription as Paper Faces Backlash","text":"Author Stephen King announced on Friday that he canceled his subscription to The Washington Post as the newspaper faces backlash for declining to endorse a presidential candidate this election.In an op-ed published Friday morning, the Post's chief executive and publisher William Lewis wrote that the paper would not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris nor former President Donald Trump this election.

He added in the editorial that the job of the Post was to \"provide through the newsroom nonpartisan news for all Americans, and thought-provoking, reported views from our opinion team to help our readers make up their own minds.\"A few hours after Lewis' op-ed was published, the Post reported on the decision, and said that the paper's editorial page staffers had \"drafted\" an endorsement of Harris but was blocked from publishing it, according to two unnamed sources familiar with the matter.The same sources said that the decision to not publish Harris' endorsement \"was made by The Post's owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,\" according to the report.Bezos, a billionaire, purchased the Post in August 2013.

On Friday, Post publisher and CEO William Lewis announced the paper would not be making a presidential endorsement this year, nor in any future presidential election. \"We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,\" Lewis declared. Shortly after, the Washington Post Guild released a scathing statement condemning the decision. \"We are deeply concerned that The Washington Post – an American news institution in the nation’s capital – would make the decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election. The role of an Editorial Board is to do just this: to share opinions on the news impacting our society and culture and endorse candidates to help guide readers,\" the Guild said. THE WASHINGTON POST ANNOUNCES IT WON'T BE ENDORSING IN 2024 RACE OR 'IN ANY FUTURE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION' \"The message from our chief executive, Will Lewis – not from the Editorial Board itself – makes us concerned that management interfered with the work out of members in Editorial,\" the Guild continued. \"According to our own reporters and Guild members, an endorsement for Harris was already drafted, and the decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos.\" The Guild added: \"We are already seeing cancelations from once loyal readers. This decision undercuts the works of our members at a time when we should be building our readers’ trust, not losing it.\" The Guild put up a post with a link encouraging action, saying, \"Are you a Washington Post reader concerned with today’s decision for the Editorial Board to not endorse a candidate this election cycle? Send a letter to CEO and Publisher Will Lewis and Editorial Page Editor David Shipley.\" Post editor at large Robert Kagan resigned because of the decision, and former executive editor Martin \"Marty\" Baron denounced it as \"cowardice.\" \"This is cowardice, with democracy as its casualty. @realdonaldtrump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner @jeffbezos (and others). Disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage,\" Baron wrote on X. Washington Post columnist and associate editor Karen Tumulty reposted Baron's message. Post climate change reporter Brianna Sacks also retweeted Baron and wrote in reaction to the news of the decision, \"We won a Pulitzer for public service for our coverage of the Jan. 6 insurrection.\" A former high-level Washington Post employee also sided with Baron's sentiment, calling out the \"feckless\" decision. \"It very disingenuously draws falls equivalencies,\" they told Fox News Digital. \"This is not, for example, Kamala Harris vs. Mitt Romney. This is Kamala Harris against someone who tried to disenfranchise the electorate last time.\" \"And if you're going to decide that it's not the role of an editorial board to endorse, then don't endorse. Don't endorse for Senate. Don't endorse for House. Just don't endorse,\" they continued. The ex-staffer has been hearing from distressed former colleagues, saying they are \"shocked\" and \"deeply disappointed,\" and said current staffers think the explanation that was given is a \"fig leaf.\" \"I'm hearing that they are being absolutely flooded with subscription cancelations,\" the source said. They told Fox News Digital, \"I have never been honestly ashamed of The Post until today. ‘The first mission of a newspaper is to tell the truth as nearly as the truth can be ascertained.’ That's from Eugene Meyer's Principles of The Post. Today's decision is an abject abdication of those principles.\" The former Post employee warned of the \"chilling effect\" this could have on the newsroom as a result. \"You know this is an editorial issue. There really was a church/state divide. But I do know that there are people in editorial who have roots in the newsroom and so it stings,\" they said. \"And I think people in the newsroom are thinking ‘if they killed an endorsement, can a news story be far behind.’ And Lewis has certainly expressed willingness to at least try that. If Trump wins, who in their right mind would want you to cover that administration for The Post, looking over your shoulder all the time to see if the publisher or owner is going to to be miffed. There's a chilling effect on the mission of the place that this move sends.\" Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah took to X to scold her employer. \"Today has been an absolute stab in the back. What an insult to those of us who have literally put our careers and lives on the line, to call out threats to human rights and democracy,\" Attiah wrote. In its own coverage of the news in the Style section, The Post reported, \"The decision has roiled many on the editorial staff, which operates independently from The Post’s news staff, a long-standing tradition of American journalism designed to separate opinion writing from day-to-day news coverage.\" Health care reporter Fenit Nirappil tweeted of the report, \"Our news side continues to report fearlessly. Even when it’s about our own bosses.\" He included images of two particular quotes: \"An endorsement of Harris had been drafted by Post editorial page staffers but had yet to be published, according to two sources briefed on the sequence of events who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The decision not to publish was made by The Post’s owner — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — according to the same sources.\" \"This is cowardice, a moment of darkness that will leave democracy as a casualty. Donald Trump will celebrate this as an invitation to further intimidate The Post’s owner, Jeff Bezos (and other media owners),\" former Post executive editor Martin Baron, who led the paper while Trump was president, said in a text message to The Post. \"History will mark a disturbing chapter of spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\" A source close to Washington Post leadership claimed to Fox News Digital that Bezos was not involved in the decision. However, a separate source spoke with Fox News Digital and believes otherwise, citing The Post's own reporting claiming the billionaire directly intervened. \"A non-endorsement would have made sense if it had been announced before the nominees were known. But doing it 11 days before the election suggests Bezos is worried he’d lose government contracts if Trump wins. So it signals intimidation works,\" a current Post staffer told Fox News Digital. \"Trump certainly caused trouble for Bezos in his presidency by killing a big cloud computing contract and messing with the Amazon postal contract. So he knows how expensive a second term might be if Trump were mad at our coverage.\" The staffer also said Baron is \"regarded as a hero\" for his X post, adding \"he framed the stakes just right.\" As far the Post's current leader, Lewis, the source said he has \"lost the newsroom.\" \"I wouldn’t trust a word Will Lewis or any of his people say,\" the staffer told Fox News Digital. \"He lost the newsroom over the summer. He never shows his face anymore. We get weekly rah-rah emails. That’s it. He used to wander the newsroom but apparently knows he’s not welcome.\" A Post spokesperson declined to comment further but reiterated it was a \"Washington Post decision.\" 11 Post opinion columnists wrote a statement calling the decision a \"terrible mistake.\" \"The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake. It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 275 years. This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020,\" they said. \"There is no contradiction between The Post’s important role as an independent newspaper and its practice of making political endorsements, both as a matter of guidance to readers and as a statement of core beliefs. That has never been more true than in the current campaign. An independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn’t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution.\" It was signed by Perry Bacon Jr., E.J. Dionne Jr., Lee Hockstader, David Ignatius, Heather Long, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Catherine Rampell, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin and Karen Tumulty. In the political world, former Biden adviser Susan Rice wrote multiple posts expressing her outrage. \"As a DC native and lifelong subscriber to the Post, I’m disgusted. You have lost us,\" she wrote, then added, \"So much for ‘Democracy Dies in Darkness’. This is the most hypocritical, chicken s[---] move from a publication that is supposed to hold people in power to account.\" She responded to a report of a Washington Post editorial board member blasting the decision, saying, \"So what are they going to do about it? The whole Post editorial department should walk out.\" \"This is what Oligarchy is about. Jeff Bezos, the 2nd wealthiest person in the world and the owner of the Washington Post, overrides his editorial board and refuses to endorse Kamala.

The owner’s action unnecessarily made Editorial Board members vulnerable to harassment, impacting their ability to effectively perform their jobs.”\n\nThe letter demands that LA Times leadership “thoroughly cover this story so that readers fully understand what transpired,” explain to readers why the endorsement was canceled and provide “clarity about the broader endorsement process,” and retract the false statements made about the Editorial Board and make it clear they “wanted to write an endorsement and did not choose to remain silent.”\n\nEarlier Thursday, TheWrap exclusively that the editorial board had planned an editorial series laying out the case against Donald Trump ahead of the endorsement of Harris, both of which were quashed on Soon-Shiong’s orders.\n\nMore to come…","summary":"In an open letter Friday, staffers demand Patrick Soon-Shiong and top editor Terry Tang retract blame of editorial board and explain to readers what happened\n\n\nThe post LA Times Staff Says Paper &#8216;Undermined Trust,&#8217; Calls on Leadership to Stop Ignoring Canceled Endorsement Story appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-undermined-trust-staff-open-letter-kamala-endorsement/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/terry-tang-la-times.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-26 00:05:08","author":"Ross A.

Neither believes the state is competitive, but they are using it as a backdrop to drive a message about the issues they hope voters will have front of mind when they cast ballots.\nFor Trump, that’s border security. For Harris, it’s abortion rights.\nTrump’s trip to Texas, his second stop in a border state in two days, comes as the former US president escalates his already dark and apocalyptic rhetoric against illegal immigration.\n“We’re like a garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don’t want,” Trump told supporters Friday in Austin. Trump has continued to push the unfounded idea that foreign governments actively send criminals to the US.\n\nHarris said the remark is “just another example of how he really belittles our country”.\n“The president of the United States should be someone who elevates discourse and talks about the best of who we are, and invests in the best of who we are, not someone like Donald Trump, who is constantly demeaning and belittling who the American people are,” Harris told reporters in Houston.\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has routinely appeared with grieving relatives of people who were hurt or killed by people living in the country illegally. On Friday, he ceded the microphone to the mother of a 12-year-old Texas girl, Jocelyn Nungaray, whose body was found in June. Prosecutors have charged two Venezuelan men in the US illegally with capital murder.\n“She was just being a child, and due to the Biden-Harris policies we have here … she’s not here any more,” Alexis Nungaray said.\nDuring a rally Thursday in Arizona, Trump railed against Harris for the Biden administration’s record on the border, which he said had “unleashed” an “army of migrant gangs” that are “waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens.”\nAt an event in Las Vegas later in the day, Trump claimed towns had been “invaded and conquered” by violent immigrants, adding: “We have a lot of towns that haven’t yet been infected.” Trump has long echoed tropes about immigration in portraying migrants as disease carriers, dating back to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTrump views immigration as the issue that won him the White House in 2016. He accuses Harris of perpetrating “a wicked betrayal of America” and having “orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people,” even though crime is down.\nWhile migrants have been charged with some high-profile crimes that Trump repeatedly highlights, research has shown that immigrants – including those who entered the country illegally – are charged with fewer violent crimes than American citizens.\nHe has also spread false theories that Democrats are registering immigrants without legal status to vote.\nWhile in Austin, Trump also will sit down with Joe Rogan, the nation’s most listened-to podcaster, creating another opportunity for the Republican nominee to highlight the hypermasculine tone that has defined much of his 2024 White House bid. The interview is expected to be released Saturday.\nTrump has made masculinity a central theme of his campaign, appearing on podcasts targeting young male voters and tapping surrogates who sometimes use crude language.\n\nAt a Trump rally on Wednesday, former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson called the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Tim Walz, a “weak man” and compared Trump’s return to the White House to a dad who comes home ready to punish his misbehaved children.\n“When Dad gets home, you know what he says?” Carlson asked. “You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl, and you are getting a vigorous spanking right now.”\nRogan and Trump have a complicated relationship. Rogan had previously said that he declined to host Trump on his podcast before because he did not want to help him.\nEarlier this year, Trump criticised Rogan after the podcaster said that then-candidate Robert Kennedy Jnr was the only person running for president who made sense to him. Kennedy has since suspended his bid, endorsed Trump and joined him on the campaign trail.\n“It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???” Trump wrote on his social media site in August, referring to Rogan’s experience as a commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\nThe podcaster is known for his hourslong interviews on The Joe Rogan Experience, which is listed as No. 1 in the United States, according to Spotify’s charts. He calls women “chicks” and once laughed as a comedian friend described repeatedly coercing young women comics into sex.","summary":"The Republican nominee says the US is being treated like a ‘garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don’t want’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3283967/trump-visits-texas-tape-joe-rogans-podcast-and-attack-harris-immigration","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/26/ccc71da5-a4ca-4e6d-b5bb-c0120f57c77b_c46036e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:57:52","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.142},{"id":261134832,"title":"The paradox at the heart of Trump's popularity","text":"As the world's most enthralling recruitment process reaches its denouement, maybe it is worth carrying out a thought experiment.\n\nLet's imagine you are running a small business — a fast food franchise, for the sake of topicality — and recruiting a new manager. What would be the red flags in considering applicants for the job?\n\nMaybe the fact the candidate is a convicted felon, with three outstanding criminal cases still awaiting judgement, would be cause for concern. Perhaps a long history of racism would be a deal-breaker — including a recent false claim that members of a local immigrant community were eating cats and dogs.\n\nSurely the applicant's misogyny would count against him — especially the video which came to light showing him boasting about sexually molesting women, and the civil litigation which found him liable for sexual abuse. Calling his main rival for the job \"shit\", a \"dummy\" and \"mentally disabled\" speaks of his deficiencies rather than hers.\n\nAn applicant with that kind of record and resume would struggle to get offered a day shift overseeing the drive-thru, still less a low-ranking managerial position. Yet with little over a week to go before election day, Donald Trump stands a strong chance of being rehired for the most powerful job on the planet.\n\nHis role in the January 6 insurrection has not been disqualifying. His autocratic tendencies — General Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has called him \"fascist to the core\" and \"the most dangerous person in the country\" — are not disqualifying. His bizarre behaviour — such as dancing for 39 minutes at a recent town hall event in Pennsylvania, or rhapsodising about the dimensions of the golf great Arnold Palmer's genitalia — is not disqualifying.\n\nTrump is seen as a saviour, not a sinner\n\nOnce again, we are reminded of that Trumpian truism uttered in 2016 on the eve of that year's Iowa caucus: \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters.\"\n\nSince then, he has stood in the middle of Washington DC and implored his supporters to march on the US Capitol to block the certification of an election he clearly lost, without relinquishing his status as party lodestar and figurehead. Purged of strident internal critics — such as the former congresswoman Liz Cheney, who is campaigning for Kamala Harris — the Republican party has become even more of a personal movement.\n\nThat Trumpian truism from 2016 is often explained by what has become an analytical cliche. The former president's outlandishness is baked in. Voters have come to expect it. But that deflects the question of why Trump's candidacy comes coated in so many layers of teflon rather than answering it.\n\nHis political viability is worth re-examining, not least because \"the Fifth Avenue phenomenon\" is even stronger now than it was in 2016. Millions are ready to accept the terms and conditions of \"Trump 2.0\".\n\nFirst, it worth stating the obvious. For MAGA diehards, the very fact that Trump is prepared to say the unsayable, and to act in such a norm-busting manner, is central his appeal. To them, the prosecutions are a politically-motivated witch hunt. The events of January 6 have been blown up out of proportion. Polling at the start of this year showed that seven out of 10 Republicans thought too much was being made of the attack on the US Capitol, and that it was \"time to move on\".\n\nLikewise, what seem to be paradoxes aren't that paradoxical. Often the question is asked, for example, why Trump, a thrice-married divorcee alleged to have had an extra-marital affair with a porn star, enjoys the support of so many white evangelicals, 80 per cent of whom supported him in 2020.\n\nYet Trump pulled off what none of his three Republican presidential predecessors succeeded in doing: the holy grail of altering the ideological composition of the Supreme Court so that Roe v Wade could finally be overturned.\n\nAmerica's mega-churches, moreover, have for decades had a MAGA vibe. Anyone shocked that Trump should find a loyal congregation in their pews has not been watching Christian cable channels. Besides, some of America's most popular TV evangelists have been mired in scandal, including Jim Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart and Jerry Falwell Jr, without being permanently dislodged from their thrones of grace.\n\nBut again, many white evangelicals do not look upon Trump as a sinner. They see him as a saviour.\n\nNostalgic for the Trump economy\n\nThe backing of prosperous, college-educated Republicans, who often baulk at Trump's vulgar behaviour, is also easily explained. Many have been seduced by the tax cuts he is promising. Many are nostalgic for the Trump economy, when mortgage rates and gas prices were lower. Many have reconciled themselves to the fact, and rationalised it in their minds, that his policies come with his personality.\n\nAs for Trump's historically high levels of support among African-Americans and Hispanics, there are multiple rationales. The economy. The fact that many Hispanic and Black voters respond positively to Trump's hardline stance on immigration, despite his demonisation of Latino and Haitian immigrants. The sales pitch from Trump that Democrats have taken for granted the Black vote especially, and not repaid that loyalty by delivering significant gains in living standards.\n\nIt is also worth bearing in mind that around 10 million Latinos are evangelicals, many with a devoutly Christian nationalist bent — a reminder that ethnic voting blocs are by no means monolithic.\n\nFor historical explanations of Trump's continued political viability, there is a 250-year backstory to mine. Americans have long gone a little weak-kneed at a strongman as president. Figures such as the demagogic ultra-nationalist Andrew Jackson, who Trump came to regard as his presidential kindred spirit. Conspiratorialism, of the kind promulgated by Trump, was present at the creation, when George III was cast as the anti-Christ.\n\nOr we could travel back to the more recent past. President Bill Clinton, during his scandal-prone eight years in office, not only normalised presidential misconduct but produced the playbook on how to survive it.\n\nClinton cleverly reframed the question at the heart of every scandal, switching it from \"who is right or wrong?\" to \"which side do you want to win?\" By doing so, he tapped into the tribalism of politics at a time after the end of the Cold War when Washington was becoming more aggressively partisan.\n\nThe rise of negative partisanship\n\nTrump has thrived on, and fuelled, that same tribalism which, since the turn of the century, has become more zealous as elections have come to be fought on questions of culture and identity as well as economics and foreign policy. Indeed, in this era of extreme polarisation, the former president has benefited from one of the most pronounced trends in US politics: the rise of negative partisanship, where political behaviour is determined not so much by affection for your own side as animosity towards your opponent.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump won partly because he was Donald Trump — an anti-politician who promised to shake up Washington. But much of his appeal stemmed from the fact he wasn't Hillary Clinton. Part of the reason why Joe Biden won in 2020 was because Trump found it harder to portray him as a hate figure. Negative partisanship was not so guttural and impassioned.\n\nTrump is trying to repeat the same trick with Kamala Harris that he pulled off with Hillary Clinton, by attacking her personally and also by assailing what he claims she personifies. A woke America. An elite America. A more multi-cultural America, in which minority groups will by mid-century be in the majority.\n\nFor many Americans, Trump is a bulwark against a future they do not want to live in. The phrase \"Make America Great Again\" recalls a bygone age.\n\nFor both sides, negative partisanship could be the key to victory. Harris is trying to draw together an anti-Trump coalition, including Republican defectors who fear the former president poses a clear and present danger to democratic norms.\n\nTrump is trying to assemble an anti-Harris coalition, including Republican waverers who fear the vice-president poses a clear and present danger to what they would regard as cultural normalcy.\n\nIt explains the ugly tenor of the 2024 election, a contest driven by fear and mutual loathing.\n\nNick Bryant, a former BBC Washington correspondent, is the author of The Forever War: America's Unending Conflict with Itself.","summary":"An applicant with Trump's record and resumé would struggle to get offered a day shift overseeing the drive-thru.

Musk said the labor union “did nada” for job security during the last recession and accused it of taking away benefits from unionized workers when asked if he was threatening to pull benefits from Tesla workers who wanted to unionize. Musk and the UAW clashed just two months ago when the labor union filed labor charges against him and former President Donald Trump for comments they made during an interview together. The UAW argued both men were advocating “for the illegal firing of striking workers.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nX Workers Reportedly Must Prove They Deserve Their Stock—Elon Musk’s Various Employee Policies, Explained (Forbes)\n\nAuto Workers Union Files Labor Charges Against Trump And Musk After X Interview (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The report, which describes the incident as a \"simple assault,\" notes that on Aug. 26 the campaign staffer used “both” hands while trying to move past the cemetery worker, who NBC News previously reported had attempted to stop the staffer from taking photos. The names of both people were redacted. According to the report, the cemetery employee didn’t need medical attention on scene “and later refused when offered.” The worker also did not want to press charges, the report said. A Trump campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night on the Army documents. An Army spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but told Politico in a statement: “The law enforcement investigation into the incident remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time.” The internal documents were released by the Army after American Oversight, a government ethics and transparency group, sued to obtain the report. The group shared a copy of the report on its website after a judge ordered the Defense Department to provide the documents. Trump was at the cemetery on the day of incident. He had taken part in a wreath-laying ceremony commemorating three years since 13 U.S. service members were killed during an attack by the Islamic State outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan. Trump later headed to a restricted part of the cemetery known as Section 60 where the incident took place. Arlington National Cemetery released a statement at the time pointing to a federal law barring political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, including photographers. An Army spokesperson also said in August that the Trump campaign aide had “abruptly pushed aside” a cemetery employee who was trying to enforce restrictions on taking photos and video in that area. The same spokesperson said at the time that the Army considered the matter closed. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung previously denied elements of the incident, saying that there \"was no physical altercation as described,\" and that an unnamed person \"decided to physically block\" members of Trump's team. Trump has come under increasing scrutiny on military issues after former White House chief of staff John Kelly told The New York Times in interviews published this week that his former boss \"falls into the general definition of fascist,\" in addition to praising Hitler, and that he questioned the selflessness of fallen service members during a 2017 visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day. The former president also reportedly said in a private conversation at the White House, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" according to The Atlantic. Trump has denied making the remarks reported by The Atlantic and recounted by Kelly.","summary":"The U.S. Army on Friday released a heavily redacted copy of a police report stemming from an August incident in which a staffer from former President Donald Trump’s campaign allegedly pushed an Arlington National Cemetery worker.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/army-releases-report-trump-campaign-incident-arlington-cemetery-rcna23566","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241025-arlington-cemetery-2018-ac-619p-3ed3ec.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:48:12","author":"Zoë Richards","authors":["Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.293},{"id":261134490,"title":"“Official Report Reveals Details of Trump’s Visit to Arlington”","text":"The U.S. Army on Friday released a heavily redacted incident report of a “Simple Assault” during former President Donald Trump‘s contentious August visit to Arlington National Cemetery, where an employee trying to stop Trump staffers from taking pictures and filming was “abruptly pushed aside.”\n\nThe document, published on the website of the watchdog group American Oversight, contains seven pages with three lines about the incident in an executive summary.\n\n“On 26 August 2024 at 1030 hours, the Joint Base Myer – Henderson Hall (JBM-HH), Police Department was notified by [redacted] of the following incident: While working at the Arlington National Cemetery, [redacted] with both of [redacted] his hands while attempting to move past [redacted] did not require medical attention on scene and later refused when offered.

I think he's the same kind of artist: a thought-provoking artist. I was that before he was.\"\n\n Younger listeners might be confused as to how the star of Are We There Yet? and onetime Donald Trump ally Ice Cube could have any claim to the hip-hop throne. But true fans of the genre should be well aware of N.W.A.'s place in rap history and Cube's subsequent solo success, cementing his status as one of the most dominant hip-hop stars of the late '80s and '90s, with seven consecutive albums that hit either No. 1 or No. 2 on Billboard's R&B charts and nine singles in the top 10 of the rap charts.\n\n This isn't the first time Cube has commented on Lamar, 37. The Friday star also expressed his admiration for the \"King Kunta\" rapper's beef with Drake earlier this year. \"I approve of the beef,\" he said. \"I always approve of rap battles. That's the essence of the game… As long as it doesn't get physical, 'cause that’s not rap. When it get physical, that's just street crime.\" He also said he sees Lamar as the winner of the battle so far: \"I think Kendrick is up, I think he’s landed the more hard and effective punches, so to speak.\"\n\n Elsewhere in \"It's My Ego,\" Cube compares himself to a titan of a different genre, rapping, \"Rock & Roll Hall of Famer, like Jimi Hendrix.\" The hip-hop legend makes several other pop culture references throughout the track, name-dropping Al Green (as the song samples his song \"Love and Happiness\") and shouting out one of the most memorable moments in Oscars history (\"I'll smack your ass, like Will did Chris\"). \n\n \"It's My Ego\" is the first single from Ice Cube's upcoming album Man Down, which drops on Nov. 22. The album will be his first solo record since 2018's Everythang's Corrupt. His most recent full-length project came in 2022's Snoop Cube 40 $hort, the first album by supergroup Mount Westmore (consisting of Snoop Dogg, E-40, Too Short, and Ice Cube). That album was originally released via blockchain — a fitting move for Cube as a mogul always looking for his next business venture.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Watch the music video for \"It's My Ego\" above.","summary":"&#34;I think he&#39;s the same kind of artist: a thought-provoking artist.&#34;","url":"https://ew.com/ice-cube-explains-kendrick-lamar-lyric-8734845","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/2h1OEZhaFjLdENpJnKAlCdlZSgM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kendrick-Lamar-and-ice-cube-102524-1-993e26ccc6194bc69eb4d9827ba194a8.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/7EE2zQVi-GQ0UtFMY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:46:54","author":"Wesley Stenzel","authors":["Wesley Stenzel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.453},{"id":261134772,"title":"10 Washington Post Columnists Condemn Non-Endorsement as ‘Terrible Mistake’","text":"Ten Washington Post editorial columnists signed a letter condemning owner Jeff Bezos’ decision on Friday to forgo the usual presidential endorsement and pull the one that had been written to back Kamala Harris calling it a “terrible mistake.”\n\nThe statement reads: \n\nThe Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake. It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love, and for which we have worked a combined 235 years. This is a moment for the institution to be making clear its commitment to democratic values, the rule of law and international alliances, and the threat that Donald Trump poses to them — the precise points The Post made in endorsing Trump’s opponents in 2016 and 2020. There is no contradiction between The Post’s important role as an independent newspaper and its practice of making political endorsements, both as a matter of guidance to readers and as a statement of core beliefs. That has never been more true than in the current campaign. An independent newspaper might someday choose to back away from making presidential endorsements. But this isn’t the right moment, when one candidate is advocating positions that directly threaten freedom of the press and the values of the Constitution.\n\nThe letter was signed by Perry Bacon Jr., E.J. Dionne Jr., David Ignatius, Heather Long, Ruth Marcus, Dana Milbank, Catherine Rampell, Eugene Robinson, Jennifer Rubin and Karen Tumulty.\n\nEditor at large Robert Kagan already submitted his resignation from the paper, according to Semafor media writer Max Tani.\n\nThe Washington Post Build shared a statement to X on Friday that they were “deeply concerned” about the non-endorsement. \n\n“We are deeply concerned that The Washington Post — an American news institution in the nation’s capital — would make the decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, especially a mere 11 days ahead of an immensely consequential election.

Some expressed support for authoritarianism.\n\nAnalia, (ABC News is not using last names for privacy reasons) a 46-year-old accounting tour operator and former Democrat from Florida, explained she leans toward Trump because of his policies.\n\n\"I don't like him as the person that he chose to be, but I like his politics,\" she said. \"But as a human being, I would never support.\"\n\nWhen asked about an authoritarian leader, she said, \"I think it's good for the country. I think we need some sort of order. I do like those kinds of things from [Trump].\"\n\nShe said while people deserve freedom, a balance is necessary and society demands \"certain rules\" be implemented.\n\nOne woman who wished to remain anonymous -- but disclosed she also previously identified as a liberal Democrat -- agreed that Trump fits the definition of a fascist -- on a personal level.\n\n\"Personally, he's a fascist,\" she said. \"Professionally wise, as president, I think he would do a good job.\"\n\n\"We can call our bosses fascist. Doesn't mean that they're not good bosses,\" she said.\n\nShe also said she would be fine with Trump imposing an authoritarian government, arguing that \"somebody needs to impose some type of leadership.\"\n\nA 21-year-old independent voter who says he leans moderate and attends St. Mary's University in Texas, told ABC News that while he does not like Trump, he prefers him as a candidate and that his being a fascist isn't disqualifying.\n\n\"It's something that I'm kind of having to look past,\" he said. I don't necessarily want to, but considering the candidates we have … I feel like it's something I kind of have to do.\"\n\nHe also expressed that he does not think Trump can impose fascism in America.\n\n\"I don't think he can actually implement it, but I do see him as at least trying,\" he said.\n\nForty-three-year old manufacturing manager Michael from Texas, who responded to the poll that both Trump and Harris were fascists, told ABC News that he believes both candidates are implementing policies that would take away people's freedoms.\n\nAlthough he was not completely supportive of Trump, Michael explained that the ideals Trump supports align more closely with his own.\n\nWhen asked about Kelly's recent comments about Trump, Michael said he was not bothered and that such information will not change his vote.\n\nForty-two-year old Mindy from North Carolina told ABC News Trump \"definitely\" fits the definition of a fascist, and responded affirmatively when asked if she supported authoritarian leadership.\n\nDespite that, she said she doesn't think Trump would take away personal freedoms. \"Kamala Harris is taking away our freedom,\" she argued.\n\nA conservative Republican who works in home health care, Mindy brought up abortion and said that \"it's a woman's choice for what she wants to do with her body,\" agreeing that she would consider herself to be \"pro-choice.\"\n\nAt the same time, though, Mindy said she would continue to support Trump even if he were to impose restrictions on abortion.","summary":"Among registered voters who say Trump is a fascist, 8% support him anyway.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/americans-told-pollsters-trump-fascist-theyll-vote/story?id=115152532","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/33149251-7566-4224-9e3c-c910960fc570/trump-1-gty-er-241025_1729870489864_hpMain_2_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:42:36","author":"Emily Chang","authors":["Emily Chang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":261136326,"title":"IDF Confirms: Israeli Retaliation Against Iran Has Begun: 'Military Targets'","text":"The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed Saturday morning local time that Israel has begun retaliating against Iran.\n\nIn a statement, the IDF said:\n\nIDF: In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the State of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran. \nThe regime in Iran and its proxies in the region have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th – on seven fronts – including direct attacks from Iranian soil. \nLike every other sovereign country in the world, the State of Israel has the right and the duty to respond.\nOur defensive and offensive capabilities are fully mobilized. \nWe will do whatever necessary to defend the State of Israel and the people of Israel.\n\nIDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari emphasized that Israel’s objectives were “military targets.”\n\nReports emerged early Saturday morning local time that Israel’s retaliation against Iran for two massive, direct attacks on Israel has begun, with explosions reported in the areas around the capital city of Tehran.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported: “Several loud explosions have been heard in Iran’s capital Tehran and the nearby city of Karaj city early Saturday, semi-official Iranian media says, adding that the cause is unknown.”\n\nIran launched several hundred cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and drones against Israel in April. U.S. President Joe Biden said at the time that Israel should “take the win” and refrain from a major response. Israel responded with largely symbolic attacks on Iranian air defense sites, as if to show that Israel could easily evade or destroy them.\n\nIran launched 200 ballistic missiles against Israel on October 1, 85% of which were intercepted by Israeli and allied air defenses. Israel said it would retaliate at the time and place of its choosing. President Biden urged Israel not to hit Iran’s oil and gas industry or its nuclear program, which is thought to be close to producing a nuclear weapon.\n\nIt is unclear what the targets of Israel’s retaliatory attacks are, though Fox News’ Trey Yingst suggested that the attacks might focus on military sites. It is also unclear how long the attacks would last, or how Iran would respond.\n\nIsraeli reserve General Amir Avivi, who predicted Israeli strikes on Lebanon, said this week that war with Iran would last “months.”\n\nThursday marked the anniversary of the October 7, 2023, terror attack by the Iranian-backed Hamas terror group.\n\nJoel B.

In a statement, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung slammed the Harris campaign for allegedly ’emboldening’ China. It was, however, not immediately clear what information, if any, the hackers were able to acquire. Phone communications of current and former senior US officials are coveted by foreign spies, as reported by CNN.In a statement on Friday, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said, “The US Government is investigating the unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China.”After the FBI identified the hacking targeting telecommunication firms, the CISA and FBI “immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,” the statement said, adding the investigation was underway. The New York Times first reported on hackers targeting the phones of Donald Trump and JD Vance. The effort is part of a broader Chinese hacking campaign that has infiltrated multiple US telecommunications companies in the past several months.Investigators believe the hackers are likely trying to access sensitive national security information, including, in some cases, information on wiretap warrant requests made by the US Justice Department, CNN had reported previously.The report further stated citing sources that there is no indication in this case that the hackers searched for data on Donald Trump and JD Vance linked to US law enforcement activity.The hackers’ targets include major US broadband and internet providers AT&T, Verizon and Lumen. The Chinese government has refuted the allegations. The development comes as China, Iran and Russia continue to make efforts to influence or monitor various aspects of the US election, according to CNN. China has not made a concerted effort to influence the presidential election. According to US intelligence agencies, but has targeted at least 10 congressional, state or local election races with covert social media campaigns.","summary":"The News Mill","url":"https://thenewsmill.com/2024/10/chinese-hackers-targeted-phone-data-of-donald-trump-jd-vance-report/","image":"https://thenewsmill.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/chinese-hackers-targeted-phone-data-of-donald-trump-jd-vance-report.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:33:27","author":"ANI","authors":["ANI"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":261133602,"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Kamala Harris for president","text":"Leonardo DiCaprio is endorsing Kamala Harris for president, with the Oscar-winning actor expressing support for the Democratic nominee in a video Friday.\n\n“Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy, we need a bold step forward to save our economy, our planet and ourselves,” DiCaprio said in the video posted to Instagram. “That’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.”\n\nDiCaprio, long an outspoken advocate for addressing the climate crisis, has supported Democratic candidates in the past.

Near or at the top are major union and newspaper endorsements.\n\nBut some of those vital stamps of approval are suddenly not rolling in for Kamala Harris, and it’s becoming a painful trend for this flailing campaign.\n\nThe biggest blow came Friday when The Washington Post, a newspaper that has never endorsed a Republican presidential candidate in its entire history, announced it will not endorse Harris or Trump for president.\n\nYup, the same publication that endorsed Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale won’t back the 2024 Democratic nominee.\n\nThink about this for a moment: To boost Harris, many in the media — including WaPo itself — have been comparing Donald Trump to Hitler (again). The Washington Post’s gems go back to the 2016 campaign.\n\nSeptember 2016: “Don’t compare Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. It belittles Hitler.”\n\nDecember 2023: “Yes, It’s OK to compare Trump to Hitler”\n\nSeptember 2024: “Trump gets compared with history’s great villain because his rhetoric is that bad”\n\nBut now the paper won’t endorse his opponent? Does it suddenly think she’s as bad as — or maybe even worse than — “Hitler”? \n\nFormer WaPo editor Marty Baron called the decision “cowardice, with democracy as its casualty.”\n\nIts current editor, Will Lewis, says the non-endorsement is based on the newspaper “returning to its roots” of not officially siding with any presidential candidate.\n\nThe last time it took a pass was in 1988, when George H.W. Bush went on to win 40 states in a landslide victory over Michael Dukakis. \n\nBut this “roots” explanation doesn’t hold water. If this was always the intention, why wait until right before the election to announce it? \n\nMaybe, just maybe, WaPo’s top brass — presumably owner Jeff Bezos himself — watched Kamala’s trainwrecks on “60 Minutes,” Fox News and this week’s Town Hall on CNN.\n\nBezos couldn’t get behind such a substance-free candidate like Kamala, no matter what the staff thought.\n\nEven Democrats are horrified with her performances, with former Obama strategist David Axelrod going so far to call her out for non-answers, describing them as “word salad city.” \n\nThe WaPo’s no-endorse decision comes just days after the Los Angeles Times, the largest newspaper in Kamala’s own home state, also declined to back either candidate. \n\nIn this case, the paper’s owner, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, nixed any formal statement of support for either of the wannabes. \n\nThe LA Times editorial-page editor and two editorial-board members then promptly resigned in protest, showing again just how far left the newsroom has gone: Furious that their candidate of choice won’t get the paper’s backing, these “journalists” simply quit.\n\nThere may be something else in play here: For several weeks, Donald Trump has been on an upward trajectory in the polls. Almost every major forecaster has him as the favorite to win. \n\nHe’s tied nationally, a position he never came close to achieving in 2016 or 2020.\n\nAnd he’s ahead in the polling averages in every swing state, with states like New Hampshire, Virginia and New Mexico coming into play. \n\nTo that end, is this hedging by these papers meant to avoid publicly backing a losing candidate who’s going backward in a hurry? \n\nThe unions aren’t breaking out the pom-poms for Kamala either.\n\nThe nation’s largest union, The Teamsters, with 1.3 million members, has refused to back her. Internal polling shows Trump up 27 points on Kamala among its rank and file.\n\nAnd the Firefighters Union, which boasts nearly 350,000 members, also skipped giving her the nod.\n\nThen there’s the Arab American PAC, based in the key state of Michigan. For all Harris’ pandering — selling out Jews and Israel — she still couldn’t win over this Arab group, which typically endorses Democrats. \n\nRemember, all of these voices heartedly endorsed Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nTheir support is supposed to be an absolute layup for any Democrat running for the nation’s highest office.\n\nIt just ain’t happening for Kamala.\n\nAnd that’s a strong sign her campaign is in a free-fall. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump, the happier warrior of late, has impressive momentum as we head into November. \n\nThe joy is clearly gone for the Kamala Harris campaign — along with the endorsements she needs from voices Democrats have always had in the bag.\n\nJoe Concha is a Fox News Contributor and bestselling author.","summary":"The joy is clearly gone for the Kamala Harris campaign — along with the endorsements she needs from voices Democrats have always had in the bag.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/25/opinion/kamala-harris-failure-to-win-key-endorsements-suggests-her-campaign-is-doomed/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/democratic-presidential-nominee-vice-president-92368620-e1729897246394.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:32:22","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":261133672,"title":"Trump repeats false claims of \"rampant cheating\" in 2020 election","text":"Trump repeats false claims of \"rampant cheating\" in 2020 election\n Former President Donald Trump made new threats Friday to hold people accountable for what he calls \"rampant cheating\" in the 2020 election.

While the state does have more total voter registrations than eligible voters, that number includes voters who are inactive but cannot yet be removed from voter rolls under federal and state laws. The number of active voters is far less than those who are eligible to vote, and experts say there is no reason to believe that widespread fraud will result.\n\nStill, numerous social media users suggested the numbers were proof that Michigan is trying to cheat in the 2024 election. Among them was billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who has committed at least $70 million in support of Trump.\n\n“Jocelyn Michelle Benson, shame on you for blatantly lying to the public!” Musk wrote in an X post directed at Michigan’s secretary of state. “You only plan to remove ineligible voters AFTER this election. That necessarily means that there are far more people registered to vote than there eligible voters.”\n\nBenson responded on X, stating: “Let’s be clear: @elonmusk is spreading dangerous disinformation. Here are the facts: There aren’t more voters than citizens in Michigan. There are 7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 citizens of voting age in our state. Musk is pushing a misleading number that includes 1.2 million inactive records slated for removal in accordance with the law.”\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThere were approximately 7.9 million people of voting age in Michigan as of July 1, 2023. This figure is 500,000 fewer than the total registered voters — approximately 8.4 million. But that’s because the total registered voters include 1.2 million voters who are inactive. Those labeled inactive have not voted for six consecutive years or have not responded to a notice confirming their residency. Inactive voters are still eligible to vote.\n\nUnder state and federal law, voters are only removed from voter rolls after they have been sent a notice that their registration is subject to cancellation and two subsequent federal election cycles have passed without any response or voting activity. Voter registration cannot be canceled only because of a failure to vote.\n\nThis waiting period is why there are more total registered voters than eligible ones in the state.\n\nMore than 339,000 voter registrations are slated for cancellation in 2025 and more than 257,000 in 2027. As of March 2024, Michigan had canceled more than 800,000 voter registrations since 2019, including 273,609 for possible changes of residency, 532,513 for deaths and 16,716 at the request of the voter, according to its Department of State.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and two individual voters filed a federal lawsuit in March against Benson and Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater for allegedly failing to “maintain clean and accurate voter registration records.” The suit was dismissed Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering, who said the plaintiffs lacked legal standing and, regardless, did not state a plausible claim.\n\nMichigan is hardly the only state with large numbers of inactive voters on its rolls. Every state — aside from the six which are exempt from the National Voter Registration Act — must send voters a cancellation notice and wait two federal election cycles before removing inactive voters.\n\nThe large number of inactive voters is a sign of robust list maintenance, according to David Becker, the founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, who served as a co-chair on Michigan’s Election Security Advisory Commission.\n\nRead the full fact check here.\n\n— Melissa Goldin\n\nGeorgia voting machines are not flipping votes\n\nCLAIM: A Dominion voting machine in Whitfield County, Georgia, flipped a vote to a candidate not marked by the voter.\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s false.

The ballot was spoiled, and the voter cast a replacement that was counted. Officials said there was no problem with the voting machine.\n\nThe statements followed a post by U.S. Rep.

While the state does have more total voter registrations than eligible voters, that number includes voters who are inactive but cannot yet be removed from voter rolls under federal and state laws. The number of active voters is far less than those who are eligible to vote, and experts say there is no reason to believe that widespread fraud will result.\n\nStill, numerous social media users suggested the numbers were proof that Michigan is trying to cheat in the 2024 election. Among them was billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who has committed at least $70 million in support of Trump.\n\n“Jocelyn Michelle Benson, shame on you for blatantly lying to the public!” Musk wrote in an X post directed at Michigan’s secretary of state. “You only plan to remove ineligible voters AFTER this election. That necessarily means that there are far more people registered to vote than there eligible voters.”\n\nBenson responded on X, stating: “Let’s be clear: @elonmusk is spreading dangerous disinformation. Here are the facts: There aren’t more voters than citizens in Michigan. There are 7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 citizens of voting age in our state. Musk is pushing a misleading number that includes 1.2 million inactive records slated for removal in accordance with the law.”\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nThere were approximately 7.9 million people of voting age in Michigan as of July 1, 2023. This figure is 500,000 fewer than the total registered voters — approximately 8.4 million. But that’s because the total registered voters include 1.2 million voters who are inactive. Those labeled inactive have not voted for six consecutive years or have not responded to a notice confirming their residency. Inactive voters are still eligible to vote.\n\nUnder state and federal law, voters are only removed from voter rolls after they have been sent a notice that their registration is subject to cancellation and two subsequent federal election cycles have passed without any response or voting activity. Voter registration cannot be canceled only because of a failure to vote.\n\nThis waiting period is why there are more total registered voters than eligible ones in the state.\n\nMore than 339,000 voter registrations are slated for cancellation in 2025 and more than 257,000 in 2027. As of March 2024, Michigan had canceled more than 800,000 voter registrations since 2019, including 273,609 for possible changes of residency, 532,513 for deaths and 16,716 at the request of the voter, according to its Department of State.\n\nThe Republican National Committee and two individual voters filed a federal lawsuit in March against Benson and Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater for allegedly failing to “maintain clean and accurate voter registration records.” The suit was dismissed Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering, who said the plaintiffs lacked legal standing and, regardless, did not state a plausible claim.\n\nMichigan is hardly the only state with large numbers of inactive voters on its rolls. Every state — aside from the six which are exempt from the National Voter Registration Act — must send voters a cancellation notice and wait two federal election cycles before removing inactive voters.\n\nThe large number of inactive voters is a sign of robust list maintenance, according to David Becker, the founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, who served as a co-chair on Michigan’s Election Security Advisory Commission.\n\nRead the full fact check here.\n\n— Melissa Goldin\n\nGeorgia voting machines are not flipping votes\n\nCLAIM: A Dominion voting machine in Whitfield County, Georgia, flipped a vote to a candidate not marked by the voter.\n\nTHE FACTS: That’s false. The Whitfield County Board of Elections and Registrars issued a press release Oct. 19, noting the case involved one voter out of 6,000 ballots cast since early voting began Oct. 15. The ballot was spoiled, and the voter cast a replacement that was counted. Officials said there was no problem with the voting machine.\n\nThe statements followed a post by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who claimed on X that a voting machine had changed a voter’s ballot in her Georgia district during early voting. She later updated her post to include a statement from county election officials explaining what happened and thanking them for resolving the issue.\n\nWhitfield County election officials said in the press release that the voter noticed when reviewing their printed ballot that it didn’t reflect their choice. A poll worker assisted the voter in marking their choice and casting their vote.\n\n“Georgia law allows voters to spoil their printed ballot if they make the wrong selection on the ballot marking device. If a voter requests to change their selections, they are immediately given a new opportunity to make and print the correct choice,” officials said.\n\nThey noted that if there was reason to suspect that the machine made an error it would be taken out of service. No machines were taken out of service, county election officials said.","summary":"A steady stream of false and misleading information is circulating online around the 2024 election.

This was followed by 10 years on the City Council and 6 years in the state Legislature. I served two terms on the City Council.\n\nI share the above to emphasize how we need our next mayor to share this love for Fremont.\n\nCouncilmember Raj Salwan loves Fremont. Like my family, he and his parents have established roots and a business in this great city. Raj has served honorably on the City Council. He will tackle our most pressing challenges by reducing traffic congestion, creating a safer city for all, supporting affordable housing while regulating the proliferation of homeless encampments and supporting sustainable growth that balances innovation and environmental responsibility.\n\nElect Raj Salwan the next mayor of Fremont.\n\nDominic Dutra\n\nWe should all support\nSonoma County measure\n\nRe: “Family farms or factory farms?” (Page A1, Oct. 20).\n\nWhen discussing the public health issues of meat and dairy consumption, it is clear that irrespective of politics, no one wants to hear the fact that we must significantly reduce our meat and dairy consumption and production to save our planet and improve our health.\n\nIf a product like tobacco was a family business, would we shy away from discussing its harm to public health? Are we justified to protect the harmful animal agriculture business because some farms are owned by families?\n\nAs a master’s student studying public health systems change, I believe Measure J in Sonoma County is an opportunity to create a more sustainable food system, address climate change and protect ourselves from zoonotic diseases, pollution and antibiotic resistance. This is not just a fight for animal rights; it’s a pivotal moment to enhance public health.\n\nI urge everyone to support Measure J for the well-being of our communities and our planet.\n\nMolly Woerner\n\nHousing crisis demands\ngovernment action\n\nIt angers me how much the cost of living is going up. To hear some cities are being labeled as “impossibly unaffordable” is bizarre.\n\nWe need more affordable housing, especially in the Bay Area and California, but California cities take up four of the 10 spots for “impossibly unaffordable” cities. The government needs to come up with a plan to lower housing costs so that it isn’t only the richest people who can afford the basic need of shelter.\n\nImagine a world without the stress of knowing whether or not you will find a place to call home, where everyone has a place to go at the end of the day. That is what we need. This housing crisis won’t be solved without help from our government.\n\nMark Alcazar\n\nElecting Trump would\nsquander WWII effort\n\nWhy did the United States and our allies bother to defeat fascism in World War II? Donald Trump now has a real chance to be elected — again.\n\nHalf the country apparently believes the preposterous notion that Trump will punish the “others” he taught them to fear — but he’ll be loyal to his supporters. Nonsense. Autocrats who oppress “others” always end up oppressing everyone.\n\nOnce the man who promises to “terminate the Constitution” takes power, he will no longer need your vote. Future “elections” will be bogus rigged affairs, like the ones Trump reveres in fascist Russia and Hungary. If Trump disappoints you — and you criticize him — you will risk being declared an “enemy from within,” or a “radical left lunatic,” and “handled” by “the National Guard — or if really necessary, the military.”\n\nIncredibly, half the country is willing to squander the sacrifices of our ancestors.\n\nGrace Clark\n\nTrump disqualified by\ndisdain for institutions\n\nOne presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has made it clear that he doesn’t like or respect America’s democratic institutions. All one has to do is listen to what he says. He has disdain for our elections and won’t accept the results if he does not win. Despite dozens of court cases after the 2020 election, there was never any proof of massive fraud as he claimed.\n\nDonald Trump tried to overturn a free and fair election that he lost in 2020, and it seems clear he’s planning to do the same thing this time. He promoted the violence that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on our Capitol. He is unfit for the office of president for these and many other reasons.\n\nPlease listen to all of those who have worked with Trump in his first administration and have endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz because Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy.\n\nColleen Perez\n\nTrump’s election defeat\nmust be substantial\n\nSome people say they won’t vote for Donald Trump, but aren’t sure about Kamala Harris. To those, I’d advise that Trump and his anti-democratic ambitions must be soundly defeated, not by a few percentage points, but by a tsunami. If persecuting “the enemy within” becomes government policy, spies will put names onto lists, people will begin to disappear; neighbors will distrust neighbors; everyone will be afraid to speak their opinions aloud.\n\nOur freedoms cannot be yielded to a dictator, not even for one day; that day could last a very, very long time. Over 700 former national security and White House officials who have seen Trump operate up close have signed letters saying not only that Trump is unfit for office, but that they support Harris for president. This is not the time for the tepid reserve of not voting; active support of the Democrat is necessary to stop this anti-democracy threat.\n\nBruce Joffe","summary":"East Bay Times Letters to the Editor for Oct. 27, 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/25/letters-1910/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SJM-L-ALACOUNTY-XXXX-56.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:30:17","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":261135868,"title":"Trump won't lower prices—no matter how many fake grocery bills go viral","text":"There is a weird genre of conservative trolling where someone posts a photo of a handful of groceries and captions it with stuff like “This cost me $190. THANKS, BIDEN.” \n\nIt’s all bullshit, of course. But aside from the lies, what do these people expect Donald Trump to do about it? \n\nThe genre may have gotten its start with none other than The New York Times’ David Brooks, a conservative columnist who complained on X last September about spending $78 at an airport for a burger and fries. \n\n“This meal just cost me $78 at Newark Airport,” Brooks tweeted. “This is why Americans think the economy is terrible.” \n\nThe included photos showed what appeared to be a burger, crinkle-cut fries, lettuce, tomato, ketchup packets, and an amber beverage over ice. Turns out, he heavily exaggerated and had seemingly bought two double-shots of whiskey. \n\nThe genre has since been popular among right-wingers as a way to claim that the economy is crushing people’s lives, hence the need to vote for Trump. \n\nAn X user quickly debunked the claim, pricing out the same items at two different outlets:\n\nClaim: $175\nActual: Walmart: $80 \nWhole Foods: $119\n\nEven New York Times reporter Mike Isaac priced it out according to the Whole Foods near him in the high-cost San Francisco Bay Area. The price? $120. \n\nThat said, no one claims the price of groceries hasn’t gone up. It has. But what would Trump do about it? \n\nAsked that specific question at a Michigan event, Trump said he would lower prices by restricting food imports. Economists rightfully pointed out that restricting competition would actually increase prices as well as lead to retaliatory tariffs that would hurt American farmers, forcing them to, yet again, raise prices to compensate for those losses. \n\nWe know price gouging was a meaningful driver of those higher grocery bills, but Trump has attacked a proposal by Vice President Kamala Harris to punish price-gougers as “Soviet-style” controls. Yet, as this Politico story points out, Republicans at the state level have gone after price gouging in the food industry. But Trump is not interested, because he will never do anything to stand in the way of anyone’s profit, especially if it’s at the cost of the plebes. \n\nAnd then there’s the effect Trump’s policies would likely have on the overall economy.\n\nSixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists have argued that Trump’s policies would “reignite this inflation, with his fiscally irresponsible budgets.” Another letter, this time by 23 Nobel-winning economists, stated, “[Trump’s] policies, including high tariffs even on goods from our friends and allies and regressive tax cuts for corporations and individuals, will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality. Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.”\n\nNone of that would bode well for grocery prices. \n\nThose conservatives posting pictures of their groceries aren’t going to buy arguments from academics, or look at charts of falling inflation that is the envy of the world. They have an agenda to sell: They need Trump to get elected.","summary":"There is a weird genre of conservative trolling where someone posts a photo of a handful of groceries and captions it with stuff like “This cost me $190.

Those polls show almost two-to-one support for enforcing the nation’s existing border laws that protect American strivers and families from poor migrants and from employers who cheat by hiring cheap foreign labor.\n\nAlso, pollsters rarely ask questions that are tuned to show higher support for enforcement or ask questions when they know the result will be pro-enforcement, said Feere. He added:\n\nThere’s never any polling out there on sanctuary jurisdictions or sanctuary policies. The last time it happened, it was in 2015 by UC Berkeley, and it was an amazing poll just of Californians. Overwhelmingly, 74 percent of Californians opposed sanctuary policies.\nBut they haven’t asked the question again and the reason, in my mind, is that they haven’t found a way to tinker with the question, whereas they still think there’s a way to tinker with questions on deportations, detentions, and amnesty, to skew responses with certain word choices.\nThey’ve avoided the sanctuary question because they can’t come up with a way to tinker with the wording and the public responses are clear — high opposition to sanctuary jurisdictions.\n\nSimilarly, most of the groups that commission immigration polls want to get a result that matches their goals. This means few pollsters are paid to get the most accurate results by asking multiple questions about immigration.\n\nOne exception is a September poll by YouGov, which asked 20 questions about migration. The questions show strong and somewhat responses, as well as “not sure” responses.\n\nThat poll showed 58 percent support for “Using active-duty troops to help with arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border.”\n\nSeventy-nine percent favored “Using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrant gang members, drug dealers, and cartel members.”\n\nTwenty-six percent supported “Ending all immigration to the U.S.”\n\nSixty percent favor “Banning apprehended immigrants from being released into the U.S. while they await court hearings.”\n\nFifty-one percent favor “Arresting and deporting thousands of illegal immigrants.” Twenty-one percent “strongly opposed” the deportations.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, investor groups will fight deportations using their networks of pro-migration groups, based experts, and left-wing journalists.\n\nThe battle is already underway. For example, A CBS News report on October 17 was headlined “Trump’s plan to deport millions of immigrants would cost hundreds of billions, CBS News analysis shows.”\n\nIn response, supporters of pro-American immigration laws say many migrants will choose to go home, many can be sent home quickly, and many state and cities will use their police to send migrants home. They also argue that deporting migrants home will free up jobs and housing for Americans. That shift would reduce welfare and aid spending on poor migrants and unemployed Americans.","summary":"Pro-migration activists are skewing polls to hide Americans' growing support for the deportation of illegal migrants.\n\n\nThe post Poll: Half of Americans Support Migrant Deportations via Military &#8216;Encampments&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/25/poll-half-of-americans-support-migrant-deportations-via-military-encampments/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/10/Deport-Migrants-to-US-Military-Installations-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:29:51","author":"George Soros,Neil Munro","authors":["George Soros","Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":261133434,"title":"Ex-Oath Keepers, Including Heavy Metal Guitarist, Get Probation for Jan. 6","text":"Two former members of the far-right Oath Keepers, including a heavy metal guitarist, received probation on Friday for their roles in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.On that day of infamy, a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., in a failed attempt to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden's 2020 election win. The riot erupted following Trump's repeated claims that Biden's election victory was stolen via widespread voter fraud, despite there being no evidence to support such claims.Jon Ryan Schaffer pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding and entering and remaining in a restricted building with a dangerous or deadly weapon in April 2021. He was the first defendant charged with crimes in the attack to plead guilty.Schaffer was sentenced to three years' probation on Friday, with U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta crediting him for his decision to quickly accept responsibility.'I Will Not Let You Down'Before receiving his sentence, Schaffer, founder of heavy metal band Iced Earth, apologized to his fans and said he deeply regrets the \"pain and embarrassment\" his actions have caused.\"You have my word: I will not let you down,\" Schaffer told Mehta.Wearing a hat that read \"Oath Keepers Lifetime Member\" and a tactical vest on the day of the siege, Schaffer, who was armed with bear spray, was among the first rioters to breach the Capitol, according to prosecutors.Schaffer's attorney, Marc Victor, said his client was inside the Capitol for roughly 10 minutes. Victor said Schaffer didn't participate in any violence and destruction.\"He was wrong but that's what he believed,\" Victor said. \"He was misled by people in the executive branch.\"Victor said Schaffer already spent around three months in jail after his arrest.Another Ex-Oath Keeper Avoids Prison TimeFormer Oath Keeper Caleb Berry was also sentenced to probation on Friday after pleading guilty in 2021 to conspiracy and obstruction charges in a separate case.Berry was praised for his extensive cooperation with investigators, which included testifying at two trials.Mehta told Berry that the American people owe him a \"debt of gratitude\" for testifying against other Oath Keepers about their actions surrounding the Capitol riot.\"Agreeing to cooperate and telling the world took guts, took courage, not without some risk to you,\" Mehta said.Berry provided what prosecutors called \"pivotal\" testimony against Oath Keepers who ended up being convicted of seditious conspiracy relating to the riot.In court on Friday, Berry said he was grateful to prosecutors for charging him because it opened his eyes to the \"path of radicalization\" he was headed down.Berry apologized to his family and the \"entire country\" for his regretful decisions.\"I acted in a way that was foolish ... I let my emotions get the best of me,\" he said.Hundreds Charged in Capitol RiotOver 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the attack on the Capitol. Roughly 1,200 have pleaded guilty or have been convicted after trials. More than 1,000 of the January 6 defendants have been sentenced, with about two-thirds receiving jail time from a few days to 22 years.Trump, now the GOP presidential nominee, also faces four federal felony counts related to his activities surrounding the Capitol attack.The former president is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction and attempting to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.Trump has previously referred to January 6 defendants still jailed as \"hostages\" and \"victims\" and repeatedly called for their release. He also said he'd pardon them if elected on November 5.This article includes reporting from the Associated Press.","summary":"Jon Ryan Schaffer and Caleb Berry received probation Friday for their actions surrounding the Capitol attack of January 6, 2021.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/oath-keepers-heavy-metal-guitarist-probation-capitol-riot-1975283","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2504916/jan-6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:28:10","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.129},{"id":261133360,"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio endorses Kamala Harris for president","text":"Leonardo DiCaprio is endorsing Kamala Harris for president, with the Oscar-winning actor expressing support for the Democratic nominee in a video Friday.\n\n“Climate change is killing the earth and ruining our economy, we need a bold step forward to save our economy, our planet and ourselves,” DiCaprio said in the video posted to Instagram. “That’s why I’m voting for Kamala Harris.”\n\nDiCaprio, long an outspoken advocate for addressing the climate crisis, has supported Democratic candidates in the past.

In the book, she recalled meeting the former president “at some function” in the ‘80s, noting that the whole encounter made her feel extremely uncomfortable. \n\nMacLaine told People that she and Trump first crossed paths while she was checking out a space in Manhattan’s 666 Fifth Avenue building, a property Trump owned at the time. Back then, Trump was a real-estate mogul quickly gaining notoriety after appearing on the Oprah Winfrey Show and David Letterman.\n\n“There was a vacant apartment in that building,” she told the outlet. “I went up to look at it, and walked in because I knew it was available, and he was there. We met in a room where no one else was.” \n\nShe noted, “In his head, I could see he was undressing himself and me, and I got out of there very fast. Didn’t take the apartment either — and it was too expensive.”\n\nMacLaine didn’t just look back on her encounters with world leaders; she reflected on how these moments placed her squarely in the midst of history. One such night was JFK’s legendary 1962 birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden, where Marilyn Monroe famously serenaded the president with her sultry “Happy Birthday.” MacLaine joined Jimmy Durante on stage that evening, adding her star power to what would go down as one of the most unforgettable nights in presidential history.\n\nBut that wasn’t her only bout of involvement with the Kennedys, with the book featuring a photo from the afterparty alongside a juicy story involving John and Robert Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. It also includes a snapshot of MacLaine with the youngest Kennedy sibling, Ted, taken 22 years later. “Here, I’m recounting the story to Teddy in 1984,” she writes. “He’s laughing about how his brothers always managed to pull it off.”\n\nMacLaine has met almost every president since Harry Truman was elected in 1945, with one exception to date. \n\n“I never encountered [Richard] Nixon,” she recalled. “I thought he was ridiculous and wouldn’t want to have met him.”\n\nShe remembered being “fascinated by [Jimmy Carter’s] intelligence” and genuinely liking “[Ronald] Reagan as a person very much; he was a show business favorite.”","summary":"‘In his head, I could see he was undressing himself and me, and I got out of there very fast,’ the Oscar winner recalls","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/shirley-maclaine-donald-trump-encounter-b2635940.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/26/00/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:16:18","author":"Olivia Hebert","authors":["Olivia Hebert"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.14},{"id":261135324,"title":"Biden visits Indian Country and apologizes for the ‘sin’ of a 150-year boarding school policy","text":"LAVEEN VILLAGE, Ariz. — President Biden on Friday formally apologized to Native Americans for the “sin” of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a “blot on American history” in his first presidential visit to Indian Country.\n\n“It’s a sin on our soul,” said Biden, his voice full of anger and emotion. “Quite frankly, there’s no excuse that this apology took 50 years to make.”\n\nIt was a moment of both contrition and frustration as the president sought to recognize one of the “most horrific chapters” in the national story. Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that resulted from the federal government’s policies, noting that “while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing” and that great nations “must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.”\n\n“I formally apologize as president of United States of America for what we did,” Biden said. The government’s removal of children from their Native American community for boarding schools “will always be a significant mark of shame, a blot on American history. For too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention, not written about in our history books, not taught in our schools.”\n\nDemocrats hope Biden’s visit to the Gila River Indian Community’s land on the outskirts of Phoenix’s metro area will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris’ turnout effort in a key battleground state. The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and Harris’ support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters.\n\n“The race is now a turnout grab,” said Mike O’Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. “The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.”\n\nBiden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July.\n\nBut analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal to Native American voters – a group that has trailed others in turnout rates.\n\nIn 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nBiden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country.\n\nFor decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. Not everyone saw the apology as sufficient.\n\n“An apology is a nice start, but it is not a true reckoning, nor is it a sufficient remedy for the long history of colonial violence,” said Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People’s Law Project and Sacred Defense Fund.\n\nAt least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government’s abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology.\n\nAt least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them.\n\n“President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,” said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. “I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.”\n\nDemocrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities.\n\nBoth Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona’s open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona’s federally recognized tribes.\n\nHarris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe’s leader. Walz is scheduled to go to the Navajo Nation in Arizona on Saturday.\n\nThe White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years.\n\nThe president designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.\n\nIn addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more.\n\nBiden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.\n\nShe, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government’s boarding school policies that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.\n\nThom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris’ and Trump’s campaigns – and their allies – have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona.\n\n“They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,” Reilly said. “The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.”","summary":"The government-run boarding schools for decades forcibly separated children from their parents.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/25/biden-visits-indian-country-and-apologizes-for-the-sin-of-a-150-year-boarding-school-policy/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Biden_80043_ea30bf-1729900439.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-25 23:16:05","author":"Aamer Madhani And Josh Boak,AAMER MADHANI and JOSH BOAK - Associated Press","authors":["Aamer Madhani And Josh Boak","AAMER MADHANI and JOSH BOAK - Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":261133830,"title":"Is Joe Rogan a Donald Trump Supporter? What We Know","text":"Joe Rogan is set to interview Donald Trump for his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, in his Austin, Texas-based studio this Friday, according to multiple media reports.\n\nRogan, the former host of NBC’s mid-2000s reality game show Fear Factor, has approximately 17.5 million YouTube subscribers and 19.3 million Instagram followers. With around 15 million Spotify listeners, he reaches an impressive audience of about 52 million.\n\nHere’s what to know about the relationship between the comedian and the Republican nominee.\n\nWho Is Joe Rogan?\n\nRogan, originally from New Jersey, is a multifaceted American comedian, podcast host, and mixed martial arts commentator. He first gained fame as a stand-up comedian and as a cast member on the TV show NewsRadio in the 1990s. He later became widely known for hosting The Joe Rogan Experience, his popular podcast that features long-form conversations with a diverse range of guests, including comedians, actors, scientists, and politicians. By 2020, he secured one of the largest licensing deals in the industry with Spotify, where he has continued to dominate the podcasting landscape.\n\nIn addition to his podcasting career, Rogan is a prominent commentator for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and has a strong background in martial arts, holding black belts in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Taekwondo.\n\nWhy Is Rogan Having Trump on His Podcast?\n\nTrump has never appeared on Rogan’s podcast, and the two have had a complicated relationship. However, Rogan’s team invited both presidential candidates onto the show. While they engaged with Kamala Harris‘ campaign officials, an appearance by the Democratic presidential nominee on the podcast will not take place due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nIs Rogan a Trump Supporter?\n\nRogan has stated that he doesn’t consider himself a conservative, even describing himself as a “bleeding heart liberal when it comes to a lot of sh*t” during a 2022 episode with comedian Andrew Schulz. He emphasized, “I’m so far away from being a Republican. Just because I believe in the Second Amendment and just because I support the military and just ’cause I support police [doesn’t mean I’m a Republican].”\n\nIn the past, Rogan has also been critical of Trump, calling him an “existential threat to democracy” in July 2022. He also mentioned that he had turned down several opportunities to invite Trump onto his podcast, saying, “I’ve said no every time. I don’t want to help him.”\n\nMore recently, however, Rogan has noted some positive aspects of Trump’s presidency, acknowledging that the economy performed well during that time and that Trump made efforts to address various national issues.\n\nAdditionally, Rogan and Trump share some allies, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump after dropping out of the presidential race, and tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nWhen Is Trump’s Episode Coming Out?\n\nWhile the release date for Trump’s episode has not been announced, the show typically does minimal editing and publishes episodes quickly, often the same day as recording, according to Lulu Cheng Meservey, Vice President of Communications at Substack.\n\nAccording to JRELibrary.com, the podcast is prerecorded several days in advance, with episodes typically released daily at 1 PM EST from Tuesday to Friday, and sometimes on Saturday.","summary":"Rogan is sitting down with Trump for an episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" which boasts around 15.7 million followers on Spotify.

It takes a long time to turn.”\n\nAlexei Souvorin, a registered independent in Asheville, claimed that “it’s very weird” to see people outside of the state use the tragedy to score political points.\n\n“A lot of people aren’t, like, in the loop and don’t know what’s going on,” he claimed before criticizing Trump’s Monday appearance.\n\n“Most of what he was doing was claiming that the relief organizations that really, really helped us need to be defunded and did nothing,” Souvorin continued. “They tried their hardest here with what they had, and he seemed to really disagree with that.”\n\nChris Moyer moved to Asheville just one month before Helene’s impact and explained that the “things that [Trump’s] done or said” made her regret voting for him in the past.\n\n“I think it showed a lot of the reason we don’t want people to be here right now,” Stewart said of Trump’s visit. “Shut down roads just for the sake of a picture, and to say that he had done it, I don’t know. I would love to say that you could change my mind about any of the things that he’s ever done or said, but that’s not happening.”\n\nMelissa Duong, who spoke to the Washington Examiner before voting early in Weaverville, just north of Asheville, was emphatic that a “natural event like this” shouldn’t be political.\n\n“Mother Nature is not a Republican, or they’re not a Democrat. And so I think this is the time where we all need to come together,” she stated. “Let’s focus on the individuals and the families who were hurt the most out of this, and how can we help them.”\n\nMary Weber, a Harris campaign volunteer working near the polling center on the University of North Carolina Asheville campus, told the Washington Examiner that she “was not very happy” Trump chose to visit “just because it’s already so chaotic and so many roads are closed and people without power still and water and communications.”\n\n“I’ve had a good experience with FEMA, very prompt response, good help,” she continued. “I don’t really understand that logic, and I am glad that people like [GOP Rep.] Chuck Edwards are speaking out strongly against that and discounting all the things that are being said [by Trump].”\n\nEdwards, a Republican, created a page on his official site titled “Debunking Helene Response Myths” to dispel what he called conspiracy theories and hoaxes about the federal government’s response to Hurricane Helene.\n\nStill, Bo Hess, a clinical social worker and Democratic candidate for Asheville City Council, did give Trump credit for visiting Asheville but was critical of the misinformation the former president continues to push.\n\n“We need our leaders to be able to show up wherever there are issues. We want our leaders to be there. We want them to care. We also need our leaders to be strong enough to be able to handle facts and truth, and quite frankly, there’s only one candidate in this race that is actually strong enough and tough enough to handle facts and truth, and unfortunately, it’s not the former president,” Hess told the Washington Examiner. “So being on the ground and seeing that misinformation was heartbreaking.”\n\nTrump held four campaign events in North Carolina this past week, including rallies in Charlotte, Greensboro, Greenville, and his trip to Asheville. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate, also held a campaign event in Charlotte Friday.\n\nHarris, on the other hand, has spent significantly more time campaigning in the blue wall than the South following Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nThe vice president did survey storm damage around Asheville alongside Biden in early October and rallied in Charlotte shortly after.\n\nGov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Harris’s running mate, held a rally in Wilmington on Thursday, and former President Barack Obama held a solo rally supporting Harris in Charlotte on Friday.","summary":"ASHEVILLE —&#160;One month after Hurricane Helene ravaged North Carolina and much of the Southeast, residents are tired of their tragedy being used to score political points ahead of the 2024 election.
