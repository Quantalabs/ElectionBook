Time is running out.”\n\nThe David family, which allowed the release of the video, said in a statement sent to the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters, “We are forced to witness our beloved son and brother, Evyatar David, deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas’s tunnels in Gaza — a living skeleton, buried alive. \n\n“The deliberate starvation of our son as part of a propaganda campaign is one of the most horrifying acts the world has seen.”\n\nThe appalling video sparked outrage in Israel and across the globe.\n\n“Hamas terrorists deliberately starve our hostages, documenting them in a cynical, humiliating, and malicious manner,” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nNaftali Fürst, a Holocaust survivor, said she watched the images of the hostages with a “heavy heart”, taking her back decades.\n\n“I survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald. I know hunger up close. In the camps, we were given rations of bread and watery soup,” she said. “We were so hungry, we would even eat grass if we could find it.\n\n“I remember the humiliation — the complete stripping of human dignity. I know the fear, the terror.”\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill pointed to Hamas’ monstrous treatment of Mr David as a reminder of the terrorist group’s barbarity and role in prolonging the bloody conflict in Gaza. \n\n“Iran-backed Hamas terrorists have held innocent people hostage, starving them for 666 days,” Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott said of the horrifying footage. \n\n“Just look at these photos — it’s gut-wrenching. Every day that goes by is a risk to their lives. We cannot stop until every hostage is home and Hamas is destroyed.”\n\nPennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman recounted how he met with Mr David’s family and demanded Hamas release the hostages.\n\n“I cannot even begin to imagine the horror of this video for them. I continue to stand with these families and every last hostage. Hamas: send these poor souls home, disarm, and end this hell on earth in Gaza,” Mr Fetterman said in response to the chilling video.\n\n Hudson Valley, New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler called the imagery “vile” and underscored Hamas’ role in fuelling the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. \n\n“This is vile. Where are all those demanding Israel end this war now?” Mr Lawler said. “Where are all those decrying the humanitarian crisis now? \n\n“The only entity for the devastation that has been inflicted upon innocent Israelis and Palestinians is Hamas. Period. Full stop.”\n\nBronx Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres said, “The world’s silence about the deliberate starvation of Israelis and Jews — at the hands of Hamas and Islamic Jihad — is as deafening as its hypocrisy.”\n\n“A humanitarianism that devalues Jewish life is no humanitarianism at all, for it has been hollowed out by antisemitism,” Mr Torres added.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the images “vile” and “unbearable”.\n\n“The hostage’s hell must end,” he wrote on X on Saturday.\n\nIsrael has come under heightened pressure on the world stage over the conditions in Gaza, with countries such as Canada, the UK and France moving to recognise a Palestinian state as soon as next month. \n\nBut top US officials have repeatedly sought to drill home to allies that Hamas is the one preventing peace. \n\n“The fastest way to end the Humanitarian Crises in Gaza is for Hamas to SURRENDER AND RELEASE THE HOSTAGES!!!” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this week.\n\nHamas is believed to still have 20 living hostages in captivity and 30 who are dead. Despite that, Israel has moved to allow more humanitarian aid to the war-torn enclave, including from airdrops, tactical pauses in key areas, and the opening of new routes for aid to flow through.\n\nThe cruel hostage video marks the second one released by the terror group this week.\n\nOn Thursday, chilling footage showed Israeli hostage Rom Braslavski ghostly and frail as he cried during the six-minute video.\n\nBoth were kidnapped at the Nova music festival during the October 7 terror attack and are among the remaining 20 hostages believed to still be alive.\n\n“They are on the absolute brink of death,” brother Ilay David said Saturday, speaking in English before a crowd of thousands in Tel Aviv gathered for their weekly demonstrations to call for the release of all hostages and an end to the war.\n\nMr David called on President Trump to secure the release of the hostages “by any means necessary”.\n\n“To remain silent now is to be complicit in their slow agonising death,” he said.\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff, meanwhile, told Israeli hostages’ families in a meeting in Tel Aviv earlier Saturday, that he had no news of progress in talks with Hamas, according to Hebrew media.\n\n“I hear your frustration. But the situation is complicated. There are many reasons that I cannot detail,” he said.\n\nMr Witkoff added that an end to the war was “very close”, according to a statement by the Hostages Families Forum Headquarters.\n\n“We have a plan to … bring everyone home.”\n\nThe Trump administration envoy said the US was after a deal that would release all hostages from the Palestinian enclave and end the war.\n\n“No piecemeal deals,” he added. “That doesn’t work. We’ve tried everything.”\n\nHamas refuted claims by Mr Witkoff it was ready to lay down arms, vowing not to disarm “as long as the occupation exists” and until there is a fully sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nThis article originally appeared on NY Post and was reproduced with permission","summary":"Hamas forced emaciated Israeli hostage Evyatar David to dig his own grave in a sick new propaganda video.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/middle-east/few-days-left-to-live-hamas-releases-chilling-video-of-living-skeleton-hostage-evyatar-david/news-story/da5c5c9ab380e037dbf7edf1831cb91d?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/3ca931abb2389c3b1c325f3763e25935","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 01:33:27","author":"Gabrielle Fahmy","authors":["Gabrielle Fahmy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":347653378,"title":"Peace Offering? Donald Trump's Nobel Obsession","text":"A craving for international prestige, a decade-long Obama rivalry and perhaps a dash of provocation: a mercurial melange of factors is at play in Donald Trump's obsession with the Nobel Peace Prize.\"It's well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 31, prompting reactions of disbelief and sarcasm from the Republican leader's opponents.Since his January 20 return to power, the US president \"has brokered, on average, one peace deal or ceasefire per month,\" Leavitt said, citing as examples his mediations between India and Pakistan; Cambodia and Thailand; Egypt and Ethiopia; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); Serbia and Kosovo; and others.His leading spokeswoman also mentioned Iran, where Trump ordered US strikes against the Islamic republic's nuclear facilities, as evidence of decisions Leavitt claims have contributed to world peace.She made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine, which Trump pledged multiple times to end on \"day one\" of his term, or the war in Gaza, which rumbles on and for which the US supplies Israel with weapons.For some foreign leaders, mentioning the prestigious award has become a sign of diplomatic goodwill toward an American president who envisions himself as a peacemaker.Pakistan nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, as did Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.During an early July meeting at the White House, a journalist asked the presidents of Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, and Gabon whether Trump deserved the award.Basking in the flattering responses from the African leaders, a smiling Trump said: \"We could do this all day long.\"Tens of thousands of people can offer a nomination to the Nobel committee, including lawmakers, ministers, certain university professors, former laureates and members of the committee themselves.Nominations are due by January 31, with the announcement coming in October -- this year on the 10th of the month.Law professor Anat Alon-Beck, who is an Israeli-American, submitted Trump's name to the committee's five members, who were appointed by the Norwegian Parliament. The assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law told AFP she did so because of the \"extraordinary leadership\" and \"strategic brilliance\" he has shown, in her opinion, in advancing peace and securing the release of hostages held in the Gaza Strip. For some, the prospect of handing the prize to someone who has upended the international order is untenable.\"Nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is like entering a hyena in a dog show,\" US history and politics researcher Emma Shortis wrote on news site The Conversation.\"Of course Trump does not deserve it.\"The American president disagrees.\"I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,\" Trump told reporters in February as he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, lamenting not ticking the Nobel box in his life.\"No, I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be,\" Trump griped on his Truth Social platform in June.\"But the people know, and that's all that matters to me!\"Trump is well-known as someone who is particularly fond of accolades and prizes, Garret Martin, a professor of international relations at American University, told AFP, \"so he would welcome this major international recognition.\"And since the beginning of his presidential ambitions 10 years ago, \"he has put himself in opposition to Barack Obama, who famously won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009,\" Martin added.The prize awarded to the Democratic former president, barely nine months after he took office, sparked heated debate -- and continues to do so.\"If I were named Obama I would have had the Nobel Prize given to me in 10 seconds,\" Trump bellyached in October 2024, during the final stretch of the presidential campaign.Three other US presidents have also been so honored: Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Jimmy Carter. The prize was also awarded to Henry Kissinger in 1973 for his efforts to help end the war in Vietnam. The choice of the one-time US secretary of state was heavily criticized.The full list of Nobel Peace Prize nominees is confidential -- except for individual announcements by sponsors -- but their number is made public.

Here’s What Trump’s Submarine Order Might Involve","text":"In a move laden with Cold War echoes, US President Donald Trump revealed on Friday that he has “ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions,” following a provocative warning issued by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s ex-president and current deputy chair of its Security Council. Trump, writing on Truth Social, framed the deployment as a precaution, saying it was meant “just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that.” While no official details have emerged about which submarines are being dispatched—or where—speculation has centred around three categories in the US Navy’s nuclear-powered underwater fleet: the stealthy ballistic-missile submarines (SSBNs), the versatile guided-missile variants (SSGNs), and the fast-attack workhorses. The Department of Defense has not confirmed Trump’s statement, and the US Navy, per its doctrine, maintains strict secrecy on submarine locations. Ohio-Class SSBNs Remain The Most Potent Nuclear Deterrent At Sea At the top of the speculation chain are the 14 Ohio-class SSBNs, the backbone of the US Navy’s sea-based nuclear deterrent. These 560-foot-long leviathans carry up to 20 Trident II D5 ballistic missiles, each capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads with a range of 7,400 km. Designed to survive a first strike and retaliate from hidden depths, these vessels are virtually undetectable once submerged. SSBNs rarely surface or make their presence known, a policy designed to uphold second-strike credibility. As the Navy notes in its public fact sheets, these submarines operate with an unmatched level of stealth and remain on continuous patrol, often in oceans far from the public eye. If Trump’s order was indeed a show of strength, an SSBN surfacing near strategic regions like the Barents Sea or Indo-Pacific would send a clear and deliberate signal to adversaries. SSGNs Offer Tomahawk Precision And Special Forces Deployment Capabilities The second possibility involves the four Ohio-class boats converted into guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) during the post-Cold War downsizing of America’s strategic arsenal. These submarines retain the dimensions and stealth characteristics of the SSBNs but swap nuclear Trident missiles for up to 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles with a 1,000-mile range. SSGNs also offer advanced Special Operations capabilities, with lockout chambers for Navy SEALs and intelligence-gathering functions. The USS Florida, one such vessel, notably surfaced off the coast of South Korea in 2023, hinting at its deterrent utility. If Trump’s intent was to signal operational flexibility alongside firepower, SSGNs fit the bill. Fast-Attack Submarines Are Shadow Warriors Built For Quick Kinetic Responses Third on the list are the fast-attack submarines, comprising the Virginia, Los Angeles, and Seawolf classes. Unlike their strategic cousins, these subs are designed for multi-mission operations: anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, strike missions, and carrier group support. The Virginia-class, the most modern of the bunch, displaces up to 10,200 tons and carries a smaller arsenal of Tomahawks. Seawolf-class boats, including the highly specialised USS Jimmy Carter, are tailored for deep-sea espionage and classified missions. Given their mobility, these submarines can be deployed rapidly to hotspots—but their appearance won’t carry the same strategic gravitas as an SSBN or SSGN. Strategic Messaging Mirrors Cold War Naval Maneuvering Trump’s decision, even if symbolic, rekindles the memory of Cold War-era posturing, when the US and Soviet navies routinely engaged in undersea chess. By ordering the subs’ positioning in response to Medvedev’s threats—which included nuclear rhetoric aimed at NATO—Trump appears to be invoking a doctrine of strategic ambiguity. Experts like Bryan Clark, a former US Navy submarine officer and now a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, say such deployments, even if unconfirmed, carry weight. “The moment a political leader says submarines have been moved, adversaries take notice, because they can’t verify the claim but must prepare for the worst,” Clark told Defense One. Pentagon Has Not Confirmed Movement; Operational Silence Maintained It is worth noting that the Pentagon has issued no formal comment on the matter. Nonetheless, the ambiguity and timing have sparked widespread debate. With US-Russia tensions simmering over Ukraine and renewed warnings from Moscow’s top brass, the suggestion of nuclear submarine positioning is likely to have ripple effects—not just in naval circles, but across strategic command chains in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Whether Trump’s order is followed through or not, the signal it sends is clear: the theatre of strategic deterrence has once again moved underwater. SSBNs, SSGNs, or fast-attack subs—each offer a different mix of stealth, firepower, and messaging. And while their locations remain a secret, their potential is enough to shape the calculus of adversaries.

Senate Republicans and Democrats were quick to point the finger at one another for the deal’s demise, but it was ultimately Trump who nuked the talks. PIRRO CONFIRMED AS D.C. U.S. ATTORNEY AMID PARTISAN CLASH AS DEM NOMINEE BLOCKADE CONTINUES In a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of \"demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees.\" \"This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,\" Trump said. \"Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!\" \"Do not accept the offer,\" he continued. \"Go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country.

But prior to the president’s edict, both sides of the aisle believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough to both meet Trump’s desire to see his nominees confirmed and leave Washington. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that there were \"lots of offers\" made between him and Schumer over the course of negotiations. \"There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end,\" he said. Senate Democrats wanted the White House to unfreeze billions in National Institute of Health and foreign aid funding, in addition to a future agreement that no more clawback packages would come from the White House. In exchange, they would greenlight several of Trump’s non-controversial nominees. RECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., accused Schumer of going \"too far\" by upping the price tag on his demands. \"We've had three different deals since last night,\" he said. \"And every time it's been, every time it's ‘I want more,’\" Mullin said of Schumer’s demands. He said that Republicans weren’t caught off guard by Trump’s call to halt talks, and noted that the White House had been heavily involved in negotiations. \"You get to a realization that there was, it was never about making a deal,\" he continued. \"They want to go out and say the President's being unrealistic, and because he can't answer to his base to make a deal like we have in every other president in history.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now, Republicans won’t pursue recess appointments, but Mullin noted that moving ahead with a rule changes to the confirmation process when lawmakers return in September was going to happen in response. Senate Democrats, on the other hand, countered that their offer never changed, and that Republicans kept increasing the number of nominees they wanted across the line, and attempted to include in more controversial, partisan picks. \"The ask evolved on both sides quite a bit over time,\" Thune said. \"But in the end, we never got to a place where we had both sides agree to lock it in.\"","summary":"Senate Republicans tried to broker a deal with Senate Democrats to confirm dozens of President Donald Trump&apos;s nominees, but talks began degrade and Trump nuked the deal, sending lawmakers home until September.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tells-schumer-go-hell-over-senate-nominee-deal-funding-demands-after-negotiations-collapse","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/president-donald-trump.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376491695112","publish_date":"2025-08-03 01:18:33","author":"Alex Miller","authors":["Alex Miller"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":347652538,"title":"ICYMI#TheTribuneOpinion: Using the middle path to navigate Trump’s tariffs","text":"US President Donald Trump’s imposition of 25 per cent tariffs plus a penalty for buying oil from Russia evoked mixed reactions in India.

It will be the least costly, writes former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg in his Edit piece India should play the waiting game on Trump tariffs. The government cannot, and should not, accept the additional 25 percent-plus penal US tariffs. While it makes sense for India to liberalise agricultural trade by permitting imports of GM edible oil or dairy products, forcing India to buy American F-35 jets or crude oil is plain blackmail, he writes.Just before Trump’s tariff announcement, the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom grabbed headlines. In her Op-ed article UK trade pact is forerunner to India-US deal, senior financial journalist Sushma Ramachandran talks about the many takeaways from the trade deal—getting tariff concessions in rigid product categories like scotch whiskey, automobiles; expanded market access to Indian goods in the British market, and above all, keeping the agri-based sector out of bounds for British traders.On the other hand is Jayati Ghosh’s Oped piece The dirty secret in the India-UK trade deal which underlines how the intellectual property (IP) rules imposed by the UK will jeopardise India’s pharma industry and tilt the regulatory balance in favour of Western patent holders.The Operation Sindoor discussion finally happened in Parliament, with the Opposition and the Treasury benches indulging in the usual rant against each other.

Comparing her leadership role to that of her brother, independent journalist Sheela Bhatt in her Oped The sindoor in Priyanka’s sari writes that Rahul Gandhi proudly believes he’s an outsider within his party. He is stubborn and can go to any extent to prove his point even if it hurts the party interest while Priyanka is flexible, she writes.Another independent journalist Smita Gupta writes in a supporting Oped piece Rising voice, but waning influence, that the Congress had strategised that Rahul should remain the key party leader and Priyanka focus on her role as MP.

He was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nSince starting his second term in January, the Republican has moved to control major cultural institutions, while slashing arts and humanities funding.\n\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order to \"restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness\" and \"remove improper ideology\".\n\nThe order accused the institution of having \"come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology\" and argued the shift has promoted narratives that portray American values as \"inherently harmful and oppressive\".\n\nThe impeachment exhibit \"will be updated in the coming weeks to reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation's history\", the Smithsonian said in its statement.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/us-museum-says-trump-administration-did-not-compel-impeachment-display-removal-5274141","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--erHHwHwp--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/smithsonian_trump_61071.jpg?itok=wlG5_wIP","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 00:46:13","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":347649164,"title":"Dua Lipa cosies up to fiance Callum Turner as she parties the night away at Sunny Hill Festival to celebrate being granted her Kosovo citizenship","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSunday, Aug 3rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did tender leave Kate and Wills' superyacht to get George a 'specific dietary item'... from one of the few Greek islands with a McDonald's?\n\nTwo Afghan asylum seekers have been charged over the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in quiet Warwickshire town\n\nJoan Collins, 92, oozes sophistication in a chic white dress as she joins husband Percy Gibson, 60, at lavish dinner party in Saint-Tropez\n\n'The truth about Andrew would bury the Royal Family for good': Warnings Epstein may have sold prince's most intimate secrets to Putin - including videos - exposed in the devastating book royals tried to ban\n\nDAN HODGES: I thought Starmer was just weak.

In it, David is skeletally thin and is shown digging a hole, which, he says in the video, is for his own grave.\n\nIsraeli restrictions on the entry of goods and aid into Gaza have led to severe shortages of food and other essentials, stoking international demands for a ceasefire. UN-backed food security experts said this week that the “worst-case scenario of famine” is now playing out in Gaza.\n\nHamas has included this issue in their hostage videos, warning that the hostages are going hungry alongside their captors and that time is running out for a ceasefire.\n\nIn a statement, the family of David demanded that the aid that is now getting into Gaza thanks to renewed UN convoys and foreign airdrops must also reach their son.\n\n“They are on the absolute brink of death,” his brother Ilay said at a rally in support of the hostages in Tel Aviv, where thousands gathered holding posters of those in captivity and chanted for their immediate release.\n\nOf the 251 hostages taken during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.\n\nDonald Trump’s Middle East envoy on Saturday told families of hostages that he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza.\n\nSteve Witkoff, who arrived in Israel as Benjamin Netanyahu’s government faced global outcry over the devastation in Gaza and the starvation growing among its 2.2 million people, met the prime minister on Thursday. On Friday he visited an aid distribution site run by the Israel and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\n\nGlobal outrage has grown over Israel’s restrictions on aid and the deadly unrest surrounding the GHF sites, with daily reports of shootings at all four locations since the group took over aid distribution at the end of May. The UN says 859 Palestinians have been killed during that time in the vicinity of these sites, and more than 500 have been killed along the routes of food convoys.\n\nHospitals in Gaza say Israeli fire killed more than a dozen people on Saturday, eight of them while trying to get food.\n\nIsrael blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza and says it is taking steps for more aid to reach its population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, airdrops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys. UN agencies have said that airdrops of food are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and quickly ease the access to it.\n\nSeven Palestinians died of malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, including a child, the territory’s health ministry said on Saturday. This brings the total deaths among children from causes related to malnutrition in Gaza to 93 since the war began.\n\nThe German government, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, joined calls for Israel to deliver more aid on Saturday, saying that the current amount remains “very insufficient”.\n\nFrance’s foreign minister also called for humanitarian aid to be supplied to the people of Gaza in massive quantities, while also denouncing as “despicable” videos of Israeli hostages held in Gaza posted by Hamas’s armed wing.\n\nWith Reuters and Agence France-Presse","summary":"Family of Evyatar David condemn video as protesters in Tel Aviv call for a deal to be made to return hostages\n\n\nStarvation takes hold in Gaza after a week of appalling milestones\n\nHamas has reaffirmed that it will not disarm unless an independent Palestinian state is established, as the group released its second video in two days of an Israeli hostage.\n\nResponding to one of the key Israeli demands to end the war in Gaza, Hamas – which has dominated the territory since 2007 – said it could not yield its right to “armed resistance” unless an “independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital” is established.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/03/israel-gaza-war-hamas-releases-second-video-of-hostage","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3279220d9e3e2d7bf22a77bbbf9525e5f3be862a/0_0_2440_1952/master/2440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 00:35:26","author":"Guardian staff and agencies","authors":["Guardian staff and agencies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.012},{"id":347650776,"title":"India to defy Trump’s threats and keep buying Russian oil, government sources say","text":"India will keep purchasing oil from Russia, despite President Donald Trump threatening to impose penalties for doing so, two Indian officials said on Saturday\n\nOfficials in India, the most populous country on Earth, told Reuters and\n\nThat contradicted a statement from Trump, who on Friday told reporters his understanding was that India would “no longer” be buying oil from Russia.\n\n\"These are long-term oil contracts,\" an unnamed Indian official told Reuters. \"It is not so simple to just stop buying overnight.”\n\nLast week, Trump said India would face unspecified penalties for buying Russian oil in addition to a 25 percent tariff on goods.

This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.\nPakistan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, being crossed by several major faults. As a result, earthquakes in Pakistan often occur and are destructive.\nThis collision zone makes the country highly vulnerable to violent earthquakes. Provinces such as Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh and Punjab are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, contributing to frequent earthquake activity.\nThe country's geography makes certain regions more prone to earthquakes, including the high-risk areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, due to their proximity to major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust.\nBalochistan is located near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates.\nOther vulnerable regions, such as Punjab, which lies on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, are susceptible to seismic activity. Sindh, though less prone, is still at risk due to its location.\nOne of the most significant earthquakes in Pakistan's history is the 1945 Balochistan earthquake (8.1 magnitude), the largest earthquake in the country's history.

U.S. Attorney amid partisan clash as Dem nominee blockade continues","text":"The Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, President Donald Trump’s pick to serve as Washington D.C.’s top prosecutor, as lawmakers failed to reach a deal to ram through dozens of the president’s nominees. The onetime New York judge and prosecutor and former Fox News host was one of the over 150 still outstanding nominees on the Senate’s calendar as Senate Republicans work to find a path forward to ram through Senate Democrats’ blockade of Trump’s nominees, and part of a slew of picks to get a vote over the weekend. But just ahead of her confirmation vote, the path to a deal was derailed, and lawmakers opted to ram through just seven of Trump’s nominees before heading home until September. RECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ Pirro, who was confirmed by a 50-45 vote, will serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, a post she has held since May on an interim basis. Pirro previously served as the District Attorney in Westchester County, New York, for over a decade. Prior to that, she was on the bench as a judge in Westchester County in the early 1990s. \"Jeanine is incredibly well-qualified for this position, and is considered one of the Top District Attorneys in the History of the State of New York,\" Trump said when he nominated Pirro. \"She is in a class by herself.\" HOMESICK GOP SENATORS MULL THROWING OUT THE RULES OVER STONEWALLING DEMS She was not Trump’s first pick for the job, however. His first choice, Ed Martin, failed to gain enough support among Republicans earlier this year. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., effectively tanked Martin’s nomination over concerns about his views on the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on Capitol Hill. And Pirro’s road to confirmation was not without its own hiccups and drama. GRASSLEY REBUKES TRUMP'S PRESSURE TO 'HAVE THE COURAGE' TO SPEED UP NOMINATIONS Senate Democrats have accused her of amplifying Trump’s 2020 election fraud claims and defending him after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot during her time as a Fox News host, and warned that she would do the president’s bidding in her role as Washington D.C.’s top prosecutor. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month, Democrats staged a walkout in protest of both her and U.S. District Judge Emil Bove, who was confirmed earlier this week in a tight, 50 to 49 vote. She later advanced out of committee on a party-line vote. \"She’s an election denialist, recklessly peddling President Trump’s Big Lie despite even her own Fox News producers and executives warning her to reel it in,\" Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill. and the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said of Pirro.","summary":"Former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro was confirmed as

saying: \"We have a very, very good plan that we're working on collectively with the Israeli government, with Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu … for the reconstruction of Gaza.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.\n\nMr Witkoff also said Hamas was prepared to disarm in order to end the war, though the group has repeatedly said it would not lay down its weapons.\n\nIn response, Hamas, which has dominated Gaza since 2007 but has been militarily battered by Israel in the war, said it would not relinquish \"armed resistance\" unless an \"independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital\" was established.\n\nIndirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire in the Gaza war and a deal for the release of half the hostages ended last week in deadlock.\n\nOn Saturday, Hamas released its second video in two days of Israeli hostage Evyatar David.\n\nIn it, skeletally thin David is shown digging a hole, which he says is his own grave.\n\n\"They are on the absolute brink of death,\" David's brother Ilay said at a rally in support of the hostages in Tel Aviv, where thousands gathered holding posters of those in captivity and chanted for their immediate release.\n\nIsraeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Sa'ar said the \"world cannot remain silent in the face of the difficult images that are the result of deliberate sadistic abuse of the hostages, which also includes starvation\".\n\nMr Witkoff, who arrived in Israel with Mr Netanyahu's government facing a global outcry over the devastation in Gaza and the starvation growing among its 2.2 million people, met the prime minister on Thursday.\n\nAfterwards, a senior Israeli official said an understanding between Israel and Washington was emerging that there was a need to move from a plan to release some of the hostages to a plan to release all the hostages, disarm Hamas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip, echoing Israel's key demands for ending the war.\n\nGaza starvation\n\nOn Tuesday, Qatar and Egypt, who are mediating ceasefire efforts, endorsed a declaration by France and Saudi Arabia outlining steps toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAs part of it, they said Hamas must hand over its arms to the Western-backed Palestinian Authority.\n\nThe crisis in Gaza has also prompted a string of Western powers to announce they may recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Witkoff visited a US-backed aid operation in southern Gaza, which the United Nations has partly blamed for deadly conditions in the enclave, saying he sought to get food and other aid to people there.\n\nDozens have died of malnutrition in recent weeks after Israel cut off all supplies to the enclave for nearly three months from March to May, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.\n\nIt said on Saturday that it had recorded seven more fatalities, including a child, since Friday.\n\nIsrael blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza and says it is taking steps for more aid to reach its population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, air drops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys.\n\nUN agencies have said airdrops of food are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and quickly ease access to it.\n\nThe Gaza war began when Hamas killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostage in an attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, according to Israeli figures.\n\nIsrael's offensive has since killed more than 60,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials.\n\nAccording to Israeli officials, 50 hostages now remain in Gaza, only 20 of whom are believed to be alive.","summary":"Steve Witkoff tells

Zero madness could save every family £1,000 a year","text":"Labour is facing a make-or-break moment when it comes to its new cult, Net Stupid Zero. \n\nThis week, Ed Miliband opens his latest renewable energy auction, which allows green developers to bid for lucrative taxpayer-funded contracts.\n\nThe eco lobby says the auction, officially titled Allocation Round 7 (AR7), will be the centrepiece of Labour’s plan to decarbonise the grid by 2030, and that this seventh round must be the biggest yet to ‘keep the dream alive’. \n\nBut it’s a dream Britain cannot afford. Inflation is rising. Food prices are once again on the up. And families across the country are cutting back – not just on holidays or takeaways, but on essentials.\n\nAccording to research consultancy More In Common, 60 per cent of Britons list the cost of living as their top concern – and have done so consistently since January last year. \n\nAnd one of the biggest contributory factors to this crisis is an issue that almost no one in Westminster wants to talk about: Net Zero and the spiralling cost of Britain’s green energy agenda.\n\nExpensive energy is the grenade exploding Britain’s economic model. It is not just about switching on the lights and heating homes. \n\nIt powers industry, transports goods, and underpins every job and price tag. When energy becomes expensive and unreliable, everything else does too.\n\nWhen you hear ministers blaming this crisis on Russian president Vladimir Putin and international fossil fuel markets, remember this: UK energy prices were already among the highest in the developed world before Russia invaded Ukraine. \n\nThis emergency didn’t start in Moscow. It was manufactured in Westminster. We blew up coal plants, messed up nuclear, banned fracking, deterred North Sea investment (which drove up gas imports) and prioritised unreliable green energy.\n\nFrom the other side of the Atlantic, even Donald Trump can see that, writing on his social media site Truth Social: ‘North Sea Oil is a treasure chest for the United Kingdom. \n\nThe taxes are so high, however, that it makes no sense... Incentivise the drillers, fast.’ He rightly added that wind is ‘the worst form of energy’ and a con.\n\nWhen it comes to energy, Westminster has been Putin’s most useful idiot. If the US is waking up to that fact, when will Labour?\n\nFor nearly two decades, clueless politicians from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have clung to a fantasy: that we could eliminate all hydrocarbon use, build a national grid dominated by wind and solar power, and suffer no consequences.\n\nThe result? At a time of rising demand we are reliant on an unreliable energy supply and lumbered with higher bills. Three-quarters of the rise in electricity bills over the past decade can be attributed to green energy policies and the multi-billion-pound subsidies paid to renewable investors, according to Net Zero Watch. \n\nYet hundreds of thousands of jobs are being destroyed by high energy prices, while millions more are at risk.\n\nNow suppliers are warning that prices will rise again in 2026. Professor Gordon Hughes, a former energy adviser at the World Bank, has warned they could approach 40p per kilowatt hour by 2030 – up from 25p today, which is a catastrophic increase. \n\nThat’s why I took action. Last month, I wrote to major windfarm developers, warning them and their investors to stay away from the AR7 auction. I made it clear that if they press ahead, a Reform government will make them regret it.\n\nAs Nigel Farage said a few weeks ago about the renegotiation of green subsidy contracts, investors will see ‘some haircuts’. Naturally, activists, consultants and subsidy-hunters – the ‘Green Blob’ – erupted in outrage. \n\nBut, if these windfarms go ahead, it will be an act of grave economic self-harm. By putting a spanner in the works of Miliband’s mad plan, we can stop the 20-year rise in bills. By 2030, my letter alone might be saving households £1,000 a year.\n\nBut this isn’t just about price. It’s about security. Much of our ageing fleet of gas-fired power stations is nearing retirement. Thanks to subsidised renewables, few developers are willing to invest in replacements.\n\n Why build a power station that often won’t run to full capacity, especially when Miliband’s plan would make the existing situation even worse?\n\nMeanwhile, demand for new gas-fired electricity generating units is exploding globally as countries race to power the AI boom.\n\nLead times of gas infrastructure projects are now as long as eight years. Even if we ordered replacements today, they wouldn’t arrive until 2033. \n\nThat’s years after the capacity crunch is expected to bite. If we don’t act fast, we’ll be forced to ration power.\n\nRenewables may also be making the grid dangerously unstable. That’s not just an economic risk, it’s a public safety threat. \n\nLook at Spain and Portugal, where a blackout triggered by solar farm switch-offs killed at least eight people in June. Iberian grid operators restored power in a day, but our system is just as vulnerable.\n\nNo one knows if the ‘smart’ gizmos grid managers hope will stabilise the system will actually work when it is under stress. Clearly, they need only fail once – and the whole country goes dark.\n\nWorse still, under political pressure, resources have been poured into connecting new renewables to the grid, rather than maintaining what we already have.\n\nAs a result, our electricity grid infrastructure is crumbling. Ageing transformers are already catching fire, most famously the one that routed power to Heathrow Airport, which went up in flames in March causing the airport to close for 16 hours and 1,000 flights to be cancelled. \n\nWith demand for replacements sky-high in Europe, those problems will not be fixed any time soon.\n\nThis is not a functioning energy system. It’s a slow-motion car crash. But Mad Miliband is determined to step on the accelerator.\n\nLabour cannot say they weren’t warned. Just after the election, a YouGov poll found more than half of voters expected Labour to deliver real progress on the cost of living within two years. \n\nTwelve months in, and with Reform leading in the polls, we will be there every step of the way holding them to account.\n\nWe must end the decline, not manage it. As an immediate first step that means trying to minimise the damage of AR7.\n\nIt means cancelling the folly that is Net Stupid Zero. And it means restoring energy policies that prioritise affordability, reliability, and national security.\n\nThis isn’t just an economic battle. It’s a democratic reckoning. The public, rightly, cares about the environment. \n\nBut they never voted to be poorer, or to be saddled with unsustainable costs like green levies and hidden network charges that flow from Westminster’s Net Zero agenda.\n\nThat’s why I won’t apologise for going to war with the root causes of this crisis: green energy subsidies and their vested interests. \n\nThe British people deserve leaders who will fight, not flinch, when livelihoods, families and the national interest are on the line.\n\nLet the battle begin.","summary":"RICHARD TICE: Labour is facing a make-or-break moment when it comes to its new cult, Net Stupid Zero.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14965633/RICHARD-TICE-Milibands-Net-Zero-save-family.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/02/21/100874759-0-image-m-90_1754164934727.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/21/2858961530025168363/1024x576_MP4_2858961530025168363.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 00:11:01","author":"Editor,Richard Tice","authors":["Editor","Richard Tice"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":347648968,"title":"Leaked memo from Hegseth’s brother calls for US army to help with deportations nationwide ‘for years to come’: report","text":"A leaked memo from the Department of Homeland Security suggests that the Trump administration is considering using the U.S. military to boost its ongoing mass deportation agenda, while acknowledging the deployment of troops in Los Angeles earlier this year wasn’t “perfect.\"\n\nThe memo was written by DHS senior adviser Phil Hegseth, the brother of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The New Republic published the texts on Saturday. \n\nPresident Donald Trump has already used U.S. military personnel in his aggressive deportation campaign. In June, Trump nationalized approximately 5,000 National Guard members and sent them to LA to push back against protesters demonstrating against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids in their neighborhoods. \n\nIn addition to the National Guard members, Trump also sent 700 U.S. Marines to the city to stomp out the \"violent insurrectionist mob.\" \n\nMost of the military members sent to LA have since been pulled out of the city. \n\nThe DHS memo outlines a June 21 meeting between senior DHS and Pentagon officials, according to The New Republic, and suggests that U.S. military members will be needed to carry out Trump’s deportation efforts for \"years to come.\" \n\nTop level officials from both agencies, including Hegseth and acting ICE commissioner Todd Lyons, were listed as participants, the outlet reported.\n\nThe memo advises departments on how they can \"better plan for national security and illegal immigration\" via three action items, including utilizing the Pentagon's \"nationwide operational planning capabilities.\" \n\n\"The U.S. military leadership (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and NORTHCOM) need to feel — for the first time — the urgency of the homeland defense mission.

It does suggest that they are expecting similar operations to be carried out in the future, however. \n\n“Everyone here is also aware of our joint work in L.A.,” it states. “It hasn’t been perfect, and we’re still working through best practices together, but I think it’s a good indicator of the type of operations (and resistance) we’re going to be working through for years to come.”\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the Department of Homeland Security.","summary":"The DHS and Department of Defense memo suggests it expects LA-style riots for “years to come”","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/memo-leak-pete-hegseth-military-deportations-b2800978.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/28/9/56/SEI260097702-(1).jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/w0oJkDhC-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-03 00:07:07","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.383},{"id":347649070,"title":"World News | India's US Crude Oil Imports Surge 51 Per Cent Following Trump's Return to Office: Sources","text":"By Reena Bhardwaj\nWashington DC [US], August 3 (ANI): India has dramatically increased its crude oil imports from the United States since President Donald Trump returned to the White House for his second term, according to sources familiar with the trade data.\nAlso Read | US Shooting: Montana Shooter's Vehicle Located, Suspect Still at Large, Say Officers.\nThe surge represents a significant shift in India's energy procurement strategy, with imports jumping by more than half compared to the previous year.\nGovernment sources revealed the scale of the increase in bilateral energy trade between the world's largest democracy and the US.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump Orders 2 Nuclear Submarines Near Russia After Former President Dmitry Medvedev's Remarks on Soviet-Era Strike Capability.\n\"From January to June 25, India increased its imports of US average crude supplies by 51 per cent compared to the same period last year. (From .271 mb/d in January to June 2025 as compared to 0.18 mb/d in the same period last year).\"\nThe trend has been particularly pronounced in recent months, with the April-June 2025 quarter showing an even steeper rise of 114% compared to the same period in 2024. The financial value of these imports has more than doubled, climbing from $1.73bn in the first quarter of 2024-25 to $3.7bn in the corresponding period of 2025-26.\nThe momentum appears to be accelerating, with sources indicating the upward trajectory has continued through the summer months.\n\"So, in July 2025, India imported 23 per cent more crude oil from the US compared to June 2025. In India's overall crude imports, while the US share was only 3 per cent, it increased to 8 per cent in July. Furthermore, in the financial year (2025-2026), Indian companies would increase their crude oil import by 150 per cent\", sources say.\nThe increased trade extends beyond crude oil to other energy products. India's imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from America have also risen sharply.\nLNG imports reached $2.46bn in the 2024-25 financial year, nearly doubling from $1.41bn the previous year - an increase of almost 100%.\nSources suggest this is just the beginning, with discussions underway for a major long-term LNG contract worth tens of billions of dollars.\nThe energy trade surge comes as both countries express optimism about their broader relationship. On Friday, India's foreign ministry signalled confidence that bilateral ties would continue strengthening despite global uncertainties.\nSpeaking at a regular press briefing, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal emphasised the resilience of the partnership between New Delhi and Washington.\n\"India and the United States share a comprehensive global strategic partnership anchored in shared interests, democratic values, and robust people-to-people ties. This partnership has weathered several transitions and challenges. We remain focused on the substantive agenda that our two countries have committed to and are confident that the relationship will continue to move forward,\" he said.\nThe comments reflect India's approach of maintaining stable diplomatic and economic relations regardless of political changes in Washington, with energy cooperation emerging as a key pillar of the bilateral relationship.

Koh Yu-hwan, emeritus professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University, described South Korea as being mired in a policy dilemma, particularly regarding any potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait.\n“Washington is urging Seoul to take clearer positions, but South Korea’s strategic interests are not always aligned with a full containment approach towards China,” Koh said. “This leaves Seoul with limited room to define its own stance in a fast-evolving security environment.”\n\nA ‘linchpin’ of security?\nWhen asked by This Week in Asia about Washington’s ties with Seoul, a US State Department spokeswoman said that the alliance was viewed as the “linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity” in Northeast Asia and the wider region and had been since 1953.\nShe emphasised in her email that this partnership, strengthened and modernised over seven decades, “must continue to adapt to a changing regional security environment” and highlighted the ongoing discussions that were being held on Seoul shouldering more of the defence burden.\nShould conflict erupt on the Korean peninsula, China could pose a “third-party intervention threat”, according to Sydney A. Seiler, a senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies’ Korea Chair.\nMainland Chinese forces would likely support Pyongyang, he said, making it “most prudent to plan today for how the US and ROK [South Korea] can prepare to deal with a breakout of hostilities” over Taiwan. Seiler added that Pyongyang’s stance amid such a crisis would be a critical variable.\n\n“Most important is that Beijing and Pyongyang understand the shared US-ROK commitment” to counter aggression from China or North Korea, Seiler said. “Indifference, apathy, equi-distancing, or hedging risk would be exploited by Beijing.”\nAnalysts say Washington has been increasingly explicit in its demands for allies to shoulder more defence responsibilities under US President Donald Trump.\n“Trump explicitly demands the sharing of roles, responsibilities and burdens from allies and friendly nations,” said Park Won-gon, chairman of the East Asia Institute’s North Korea Studies Centre, in a recent commentary.\n\nThe call for greater burden-sharing was reinforced at May’s Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, where US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said it “makes no sense” for Asian nations exposed to North Korean and Chinese threats to spend less on defence than their Nato counterparts. South Korea spent around 2.8 per cent of its gross domestic product on defence last year – far below the 5 per cent pledged by some European allies.\nHegseth further warned against “seeking both economic cooperation with China and defence cooperation with the United States”, which he said was becoming increasingly untenable.\n“Economic dependence on China only deepens their malign influence and complicates our defence decision space during times of tension,” Hegseth said. “Nobody knows what China will ultimately do, but they are preparing. And therefore we must be ready as well.”\nUS forces’ expanding role\nUnder this evolving paradigm, US forces stationed in South Korea – currently numbering some 28,500 – may see their role expand from deterring Pyongyang’s military to broader operations across the Indo-Pacific, including potential contingencies in the Taiwan Strait.\nSpeaking at a symposium in Hawaii in May, US Forces Korea Commander General Xavier Brunson reportedly described South Korea as “a fixed aircraft carrier floating between Japan and mainland China”.\nStressing the strategic necessity of a continued US ground presence on the Korean peninsula, he told the US Army’s Land Forces Pacific Symposium that “the mission of USFK is not solely focused on North Korea”, signalling a shift in the military command’s traditionally narrow focus.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, regional cooperation is also deepening. The US, South Korea and Japan have been exploring closer missile defence integration and intelligence sharing, moves analysts say are aimed squarely at countering China’s growing military reach.\nBut this evolving alliance comes with its costs. In his commentary for the East Asia Institute, Park argued that the Trump administration’s strategy linking economics and security “imposes a substantial burden on US allies”. For South Korea – directly threatened by Pyongyang and economically intertwined with both Washington and Beijing – that challenge is most acute.\n“South Korea stands at a crossroads of choices more arduous and momentous than ever,” Park wrote. This was especially true as the USFK’s focus started shifting from “deterring North Korean threats to cover the Indo-Pacific region, targeting China”, he added.\nMilitary strategists say US forces stationed in South Korea are more vulnerable to Chinese attacks than those deployed elsewhere such as Japan, which offers a more defensible staging ground for regional power projection.\n\nIn recent months, Washington has reportedly been pressing South Korea to apply their mutual defence treaty to any possible Taiwan Strait crisis.\nOne article of their treaty does stipulate that an armed attack “in the Pacific area” is to be treated as a mutual threat.\nBut Seoul, for its part, says it has neither accepted nor rejected such a demand.\nIn a televised debate before he took office, South Korea’s newly elected President Lee Jae-myung, who self-identifies as a pragmatist, emphasised the need for balance.\n“We shouldn’t exclude or antagonise China and Russia. Diplomacy must always prioritise national interest and be approached pragmatically,” he said.\nWhen pressed on whether South Korea should intervene in a potential Taiwan Strait conflict, Lee was unequivocal: South Korea should prioritise its own “national interests” and avoid being drawn in, he said.\nBut that might be easier said than done. “As long as Seoul remains unable to clearly define its position on USFK’s role in a Taiwan contingency, its direct involvement remains a matter of speculation,” Koh said.","summary":"The Korean peninsula has once again become a fulcrum of global anxiety, as South Korea grapples with intensifying pressure from its US ally to take sides in Washington’s deepening rivalry with China, all while North Korea rattles its sabres on Seoul’s doorstep.\nAnalysts warn that Seoul must tread this delicate geopolitical tightrope with unequalled agility to avoid being drawn into a major-power confrontation.\n“As tensions escalate between superpowers, South Korea must retain strategic...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3320497/shrimp-among-whales-south-korea-faces-us-vs-china-dilemma","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/01/588b0b21-80e9-4c22-b4c7-77890e66b14b_dc9cb281.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-03 00:00:15","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.025},{"id":347652842,"title":"US agency probes special counsel who prosecuted Trump","text":"Since taking office in January, US President Donald Trump has taken a number of punitive measures against his perceived enemies.

Email: poppy.gibson@mailonline.co.uk \nBy POPPY ATKINSON GIBSON \n Published:00:22 BST, 3 August 2025 |Updated:00:38 BST, 3 August 2025 \n\nBonnie Blue has taken another hit as her Channel 4 documentary '1000 Men and Me' has been snubbed by firms who have refused to run adverts alongside the programme. \nThe show, which was broadcast on Tuesday, has been heavily criticised for glamorising porn and some companies have decided they don't want their products associated with the adult content star. \nAnd it's not just businesses, as the children's commissioner has also demanded the broadcaster remove adverts from the documentary. \nThe shocking programme followed Bonnie Blue, real name Tia Bellinger, as she geared up to complete her goal of having sex with 1,000 men in 12 hours. \nThe Channel 4 show followed the adult content creator, providing behind-the-scenes insight and interviews. \nHowever it has been criticised for failing to challenge the star or the men involved and the wider impacts on attitudes towards sex. \nThe programme did not pixelate any nudity and included clips from Bonnie Blue's stunt including a snippet of the star having sex with three men at the same time.\nIn reaction to the documentary, card payment service Visa, juice brand Cawston Press and vodka brand Smirnoff, which is owned by drinks company Diego, have told Channel 4 they did not want their products associated with the controversial content. \n\nBonnie Blue (pictured) has been hit once again as her Channel 4 documentary '1000 Men and Me' has been snubbed by firms who have refused to run adverts alongside the programme\n\nThe show, which was broadcast on Tuesday, has been heavily criticised for glamorising porn and some companies have stated they don't want their products associated with the adult content star\n\nBrands including Cawston Press have told Channel 4 they did not want their products associated with the controversial content (File image)\n\nVodka brand Smirnoff, which is owned by drinks company Diego, said the programme was not in line with their advertising guidelines and company values (File image)\nThey added they did not want their products promoted because it was not in line with their advertising guidelines and company values. \nThe broadcaster has also been slammed for making the programme freely available to under-18s via the app and its on demand player despite it being shown at 10pm after the watershed. \nWhile viewers under 18-years-old are technically blocked from such content, there is no age verification process and the show was released just days after new rules were introduced to social media sites to improve children's online safety. \nChildren's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza said: 'This documentary risks taking us a step back by glamorising, even normalising, the things young people tell me are frightening, confusing and damaging to their relationships.'\nIan Katz, chief content officer at Channel 4, defended the documentary, telling the Sunday Times that it is 'clearly a legitimate subject' as Bonnie Blue is a 'huge phenomenon' who has 'transformed the porn industry'.\nHe also claimed Blue was sufficiently challenged about her actions in the programme.\nIt comes after the star was kicked out of a Premier League game in May- but not before performing a vulgar gesture. \n\nThe shocking programme followed Bonnie Blue, real name Tia Bellinger, as she geared up to complete her goal of having sex with 1,000 men in 12 hours\n\nThe programme did not pixelate any nudity and included clips from Bonnie Blue's stunt including a snippet of the star having sex with three men at the same time\n\n The truth about Bonnie Blue: KATHRYN KNIGHT \nBlue was ejected from the Chelsea away end as the team fought it out against Nottingham Forest for the a Champions League berth. \nFootage posted online showed a member of Forest's 'response team' speaking to a companion of Bonnie - before ushering the pair out. \nHowever, the adult actress mimicked a sex act before turning to leave - then stopped to bend over provocatively in front of the security guard.\nThe clip was posted online with the caption 'Bonnie blue just got kicked out of the away end wtf' and shows fans booing as she was escorted out. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBonnie Blue's 'controversial' Channel 4 documentary '1000 Men and Me' suffers fresh blow as firms pull adverts as the content 'glamorises porn'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 14\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

There were very real and very credible threats on her life. The prison had dangerous inmates serving time for serious crimes like rape and murder.\n\n‘Tallahassee has not had a permanent governor in some time and is chronically under-staffed. She has faced death threats before but after meeting with the government she was bombarded with them. She had a target on her back.\n\n‘There were real fears inside Tallahassee that they could not guarantee her safety, which is why she was moved.’\n\nMaxwell was moved early on Thursday morning in a two-car convoy that drove ‘for 16-hours straight’ to Bryan, Texas. \n\nShe was not shackled during the drive and stopped once for a toilet break in Louisiana. \n\nIt is unprecedented for a convicted sex offender such as Maxwell – sentenced to 20 years – to be moved to a minimum-security facility like Bryan, nicknamed ‘Camp Fed’. \n\nThe source explained: ‘There is a different class of people at Bryan so she is less likely to be attacked. It is an all-female facility. \n\n'These are non-violent, white-collar criminals. It is a professionally run prison camp with a great warden, working cameras everywhere and properly trained staff. She is far safer there.’\n\nThe source said reports Maxwell was in an ‘honour dorm’ in Tallahassee and already receiving preferential treatment were untrue.\n\nBryan prison allows inmates to freely roam its 37-acre grounds which have ‘limited or no perimeter fencing’, according to the US Bureau of Prison’s website.\n\nInmates can take part in activities including training guide dogs for the blind, which allows them to keep a puppy for much of the day for ‘socialisation’. There are yoga classes and a state-of-the-art gym.\n\nMaxwell will mix with white collar criminals including Elizabeth Holmes, the Silicon Valley fraudster convicted of stealing tens of millions through her now defunct blood-testing company, and Jen Shah, a former Real Housewife of Salt Lake City who was convicted of a telemarketing scam.\n\nThe family of Virginia Giuffre expressed outrage over the move.\n\nMs Giuffre died by suicide in April aged 41. She claimed Maxwell recruited her from the spa at Donald Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago club and she was ‘passed her around like a plate of meat’ for Epstein and his friends to abuse.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Ms Giuffre’s family said: ‘Trump has sent a clear message today. Paedophiles deserve preferential treatment... Ghislaine Maxwell is a monster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.’\n\nMr Trump’s administration was plunged into a storm after promising to release files on Epstein but failing to do so. \n\nIn an interview with Newsmax on Friday he said he will release them ‘as long as they don’t hurt anyone’. He added: ‘I’m allowed to give her (Maxwell) a pardon but, right now, it would be inappropriate to talk about it.’\n\nMaxwell was set to testify before Congress on August 11 but it has been postponed while the US Supreme Court decides whether to hear her appeal.","summary":"Ghislaine Maxwell was moved from Tallahassee Federal Jail in Florida to low-security Bryan prison camp 100 miles outside Houston, Texas, amid fears she would be killed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14965905/Ghislaine-Maxwell-low-risk-jail-inmates-death-threats-snitch.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/03/00/100877399-0-image-m-92_1754176644747.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/07/16/6044778018224976899/1024x576_MP4_6044778018224976899.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-02 23:36:36","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":347649148,"title":"US nuclear submarines 'closing in' on Russia: Trump warns 'I want to be ready' as he ramps up tension in chilling war of words with former Russian president","text":"US President Donald Trump last night confirmed that two US Navy nuclear submarines are 'getting closer to Russia', dramatically escalating tensions between the two countries.\n\nMr Trump ordered the submarines, packed with nuclear warheads, towards Russian waters after an online spat with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev – now deputy chairman of Russia's National Security Council – who said: 'Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.'\n\nThe sabre-rattling came after Mr Medvedev wrote on social media platform Telegram that Russia could invoke 'Dead Hand' – a doomsday program with the ability to automatically launch a nuclear counterstrike against major US cities, even if Moscow and President Vladimir Putin are wiped out.\n\nMr Medvedev wrote: 'As for the talk about the 'dead economies' of India and Russia, and 'entering dangerous territory' – maybe he should recall his favourite movies about 'the walking dead,' and also remember how dangerous the so-called 'Dead Hand', that does not exist in nature, could be.\n\n'He should remember two things: 1: Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2: Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country. Don't go down the Sleepy Joe [a reference to former President Joe Biden] road!'\n\nWriting on Truth Social, Mr Trump said: 'Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions. Words are very important and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.\n\n'A threat was made… so we have to be very careful. We're going to protect our people. He's entering very dangerous territory!'\n\nOn Friday, in an interview with cable channel Newsmax, Mr Trump added: 'The subs are getting closer to Russia. We always want to be ready. I want to make sure his words are only words and nothing more than that.'\n\nLast night the White House, Pentagon and Downing Street refused to comment on the escalating tensions, which come just days before Mr Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to declare a ceasefire in the war against Ukraine. \n\nThe US President has vowed to impose 'devastating' sanctions on Russia and her closest trading partners if his demands are not met.\n\nA source close to the President told the MoS: 'Trump is running out of patience with Russia. He promised to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office and clearly that has not happened.\n\n'Now he's threatening to impose sanctions if Putin doesn't declare a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table to discuss peace.'\n\nWhile the location of the subs is unknown, the US Navy has 71 nuclear-powered submarines in its fleet, all of which can travel thousands of miles without resurfacing.\n\nBy comparison, the Russian Navy fields fewer than 30 nuclear‑powered submarines. Military experts said Mr Trump will most likely have deployed two Ohio -class vessels.\n\nEach is armed with up to 20 Trident II D5 missiles that can deliver multiple thermonuclear warheads with a range of up to 7,000 miles.\n\nSources last night told the Washington Post that Russia is 'seeking clarity' from America about Mr Trump's 'actions and intentions', with Russian officials scrambling to assess the significance of the subs' deployment.\n\nRIA Novosti, a state-controlled news agency which has been called 'Putin's mouthpiece', confirmed it had sent enquiries to the White House, Pentagon, US Central Command and the National Security Council, but had not received a response.\n\nMr Trump's dramatic doubling down came after the deadliest Russian air strike on Kyiv this year, when 31 people were killed in a single missile strike on an apartment block in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nFive children, the youngest aged just two, were among the dead.\n\nMr Trump called the air strike 'disgusting' and announced he was sending his special envoy Steve Witkoff to the region to try and negotiate a ceasefire.\n\nRussian lawmaker Viktor Vodolatsky said there are enough Russian nuclear submarines in the high seas to tackle the two American subs.\n\n'The number of Russian nuclear submarines in the world's oceans is significantly higher than the American ones, and the subs that US President Donald Trump ordered to be redirected to the appropriate regions have long been under their control,' he said yesterday. \n\n'So no response from the Russian Federation to the American leader's statement about the submarines is required.'\n\nRetired US Marine Colonel Mark Cancian called Mr Trump's announcement that he had sent subs steaming towards Russian waters 'highly unusual'.\n\nHe said: 'This is signalling in its purest form.'\n\nOthers urged restraint, saying Mr Medvedev does not speak for Putin. \n\nOligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, now a Putin critic living in London, said: 'When you see his [Mr Medvedev's] latest apocalyptic tweet about turning European capitals to dust, remember: this isn't strategic communication from the Kremlin. It's the rambling of a man drowning his terror in vodka.'\n\nThe exchange of nuclear threats and references to Cold War-era systems evoked echoes of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, the closest the world has come to full-scale nuclear war. \n\nThe 13-day crisis occurred after Fidel Castro overthrew the US-backed government and aligned his new regime with the Soviet Union.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy said US spy planes had spotted Soviet nuclear missile installations and threw a blockade around Cuba, even as Russian ships carrying additional warheads steamed towards the island, 230 miles off the tip of Florida.\n\nNuclear bombers on both sides were put on round-the-clock alert, provoking terror in the US with schoolchildren being taught what to do in a nuclear attack.\n\nSoviet President Nikita Khrushchev eventually backed down and turned his ships around.\n\nHe agreed to remove the nuclear missile installations in Cuba, in return for the US not invading the island.\n\nMr Trump has spoken of his admiration for JFK, saying: 'He made the Soviets blink first.'\n\nA source said: 'Whether this latest move leads to a breakthrough with Putin remains to be seen.","summary":"Donald Trump ordered the submarines, packed with nuclear warheads, towards Russian waters after an online spat with former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14965869/US-nuclear-submarines-Russia-Trump-war-president.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/02/23/100877073-0-image-m-71_1754175559375.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 23:35:21","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.038},{"id":347652262,"title":"Evyatar David: Video showing starving Israeli hostage digging his own grave released","text":"A video showing a severely emaciated Israeli hostage held by the Islamist Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been released by his family as hostage families meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff to demand their return.\n\nThe nearly five-minute clip shows 24-year-old Evyatar David, emaciated to the bone, in a narrow tunnel, being forced to dig what is described as his “own grave”.\n\nHis family approved the video’s release on Saturday.\n\n“Hamas is using our son as a live experiment in a vile hunger campaign,” the family wrote in a statement.\n\n“He is being starved purely to serve Hamas’s propaganda.”\n\nMr David was abducted on October 7, 2023, while attending the Nova music festival in southern Israel during the attack by Hamas.\n\nIn the video, he recounts the days in July when he was given only beans, lentils, or nothing at all to eat. Sometimes, he says, he went days without any food.\n\nAddressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr David says at one point: “I have been completely abandoned by you, my Prime Minister, by you, who should be taking care of me and all the other prisoners.”\n\nIn its propaganda, Hamas refers to its hostages as “prisoners”.\n\nA staged scene at the end of the clip shows Mr David holding a shovel, digging a hollow area in the sandy floor of the tunnel.\n\n“Here I am digging my own grave,” he says.\n\nHe adds that he is growing weaker by the day and believes this will be his burial site. The clip ends with the text message: “Only a ceasefire agreement will bring them (the hostages) back.”\n\nAlso on Saturday, relatives of Israelis held hostage in Gaza gathered behind a barbed wire installation in Tel Aviv to draw attention to the plight of their loved ones.\n\n“Our children are experiencing a Holocaust. Never again is happening right now. They will not survive much longer,” said Einav Zangauker, the mother of a man with dual US and Israeli citizenship who was abducted by the Palestinian Islamist Hamas on October 7, 2023.\n\n“Netanyahu, the time has come to do the only thing that will bring back all the hostages - put a comprehensive deal on the table that will end the war!”\n\nThe US special envoy Steve Witkoff also met with the families at the site after visiting a food distribution site in Gaza, according to Israeli media reports.\n\nIn a meeting with them, Mr Witkoff said the US will bring their loved ones home and ensure that Hamas is held accountable.\n\n“We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part. We will do what’s right for the Gazan people,” Mr Witkoff told the families, according to a statement.\n\n“We know who is alive, and someone will be to blame if they don’t come out alive. The US stands behind this statement,” he added.\n\nThe envoy also raised hopes that the war’s end is near.\n\n“We have a plan to end the war and bring everyone home.”\n\nFor US President Donald Trump, the release of all hostages is a “sacred mission,” he said.\n\nAt least 20 hostages are believed to be alive in Gaza.","summary":"A video showing a severely emaciated Israeli hostage held by Hamas has been released as hostage families meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff to demand their return.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/evyatar-david-video-showing-starving-israeli-hostage-digging-his-own-grave-released-c-19561023","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19561023/b84ce9a0a02b74a02cf6dd5e8b67e1dcdabc718f-16x9-x1y0w2446h1376.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 23:32:28","author":"Gregor Mayer","authors":["Gregor Mayer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":347644194,"title":"\"He just said, like, the reason he might not do it is because Sean Combs was not nice to him during one of his campaigns,\" [Facepalm]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SHARON MAI \n Published:21:59 BST, 2 August 2025 |Updated:00:02 BST, 3 August 2025 \n\nThe Brady Bunch star Susan Olsen was seen on a rare public outing in LA recently - more than five decades after shooting to fame in the show.\nThe 63-year-old actress - who played Cindy Brady from 1969 to 1974 - looked nearly unrecognizable when she stepped out to pick up her mail.\nOlsen put on a casual display in a black, graphic T-shirt with burgundy red shorts.\nStill sporting platinum blonde hair with bangs, she was spotted driving her white SUV.\nHer outing comes shortly after she revealed she almost died while filming the pilot episode for The Brady Bunch in the late 60s.\nShe also recently opened up about the one gripe she had with playing the character of Cindy, the youngest Brady child of the bunch.\n\nThe Brady Bunch star Susan Olsen - who played Cindy Brady (pictured 1969) was seen on a rare outing this week\n\n Brady Bunch star reveals how she almost DIED while filming show's pilot episode \nAppearing on The Real Brady Bros podcast earlier this year, where she also revealed she was gravely injured while filming the pilot, she said she didn't appreciate playing a dumbed down character. \nChatting with former co-stars Barry Williams and Christopher Knight, who played her TV brothers, she looked back on a scene from the pilot episode that illustrated Cindy's dense mind. \nIn the episode, Cindy and sisters Marcia and Jan talk to their mom Carol ahead of her wedding.\nCarol says she feels butterflies, to which the youngest Brady replies, 'Are you sleeping with your mouth open, mommy?' \n'That's just how my career was and it was something I had to accept,' Olsen said about her tendency to play dull roles. \nWilliams, 70, weighed in: 'Do you understand that you were the cutest person in the world? You’re just adorable.' \n\nThe 63-year-old actress looked nearly unrecognizable when she stepped out in Los Angeles on Tuesday morning\n\nStill sporting platinum blonde hair with bangs, she was spotted driving her white SUV \n\nThe star was beloved by fans for her role in the hit show \nAnd 67-year-old Knight added that the former child star Susan had a 'doll face.' \nWilliams also said that he and Knight were aware that Olsen was 'a little bit uncomfortable with the nature' of her character. \n'You're so much smarter than the character and you're so much edgier than your character. But here it is right there. You're saying the most idiotic thing imaginable,' he observed. \nDuring the same interview, Olsen also has revealed that a grave accident could have killed her while she filmed the pilot for the iconic series in the late 1960s. \nShe recounted being left with a swollen face after lighting equipment fell directly onto her. \n'My eyes were black. I mean, I had two black eyes. My nose was swollen. My face was swollen,' the actress said on the rewatch podcast.\nThe incident happened the day before the cast gathered to film the pilot episode in 1969. \n\nAppearing on The Real Brady Bros podcast earlier this year, where she also revealed she was gravely injured while filming the pilot, she said she didn't appreciate playing a dumbed down character; pictured September 2019 in Los Angeles\n\nThe Brady Bunch cast is pictured from left to right: Robert Reed, Barry Williams, Eve Plumb, Olsen, Christopher Knight, Ann B. Davis, Florence Henderson, Mike Lookinland, Maureen McCormick\n\nJust seven years old at the time, Olsen had been getting her makeup done when she was struck by lighting equipment. She recalled how she did not sue the studios but continued filming the show; pictured from left to right in 1969: Olsen, Lookinland, Plumb, Knight, McCormick, Williams\n\nJust seven years old at the time, Olsen had been getting her makeup done when she was struck. She shared the story with former costars Barry Williams and Christopher Knight, and she noted that she wished her family had sued the studio for the accident. \n'The saddest news is that we didn't sue Paramount, because I would have made more off of that than the show,' Olsen said candidly.\n'But I came to work the next day. Florence [Henderson] was the first one to see me. She's like, \"You make sure everybody sees her.\" And my mom was like, \"Oh, yes, I will.\" Because everybody was trying to say, \"It didn't really hit her. She's fine.\"' \nThe actress continued, 'I looked like I was in a horror film.

Indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel, aimed at securing a 60-day ceasefire and a deal for the release of hostages, ended last week in a deadlock. Earlier this week, Qatar and Egypt, who are mediating ceasefire efforts, endorsed a declaration by France and Saudi Arabia outlining steps toward a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As part of this measure, Hamas must hand over its arms to the Palestinian Authority. In its statement, Hamas — a Palestinian political and military group which has governed the Gaza Strip since the most recent elections in 2006 but has been militarily battered by Israel in the war — said it could not yield its right to \"armed resistance\" unless an \"independent, fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital\" is established. The statement was in response to comments from United States President Donald Trump&apos;s Middle East envoy, who told families of hostages being held by Hamas that he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the war in Gaza. Steve Witkoff is visiting Israel as its government faces mounting pressure over the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the enclave. In a recording of the meeting, reviewed by Reuters, Witkoff is heard saying: \"We have a very, very good plan that we&apos;re working on collectively with the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Netanyahu ... for the reconstruction of Gaza. That effectively means the end of the war.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks. Witkoff also said that Hamas was prepared to disarm in order to end the war, though the group has repeatedly said it will not lay down its weapons. Israel considers the disarmament of Hamas a key condition for any deal to end the conflict. Last month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described any future independent Palestinian state as a platform to destroy Israel and said, for that reason, security control over Palestinian territories must remain with Israel. He also criticised several countries, including the UK and Canada , for announcing plans to recognise a Palestinian state in response to the devastation of Gaza from Israel&apos;s offensive and blockade. He called the move a reward for Hamas&apos; conduct. On Sunday AEST, Hamas released its second video in two days of Israeli hostage Evyatar David. In it, David, skeletally thin, is shown digging a hole, which, he says in the video, is for his own grave. \"They are on the absolute brink of death,\" David&apos;s brother Ilay said at a rally in support of the hostages in Tel Aviv, where thousands gathered holding posters of those in captivity and chanted for their immediate release. \"In the current unimaginable condition, they may have only days left to live.\" The war started when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on 7 October, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza. Israel&apos;s subsequent military assault on Gaza has turned much of the enclave into a wasteland, killing more than 60,000 Palestinians and setting off a humanitarian catastrophe. Nearly a week has passed since Israel, under international pressure amid growing scenes of starving children, announced limited humanitarian pauses and airdrops meant to get more food to Gaza&apos;s over two million people. But the United Nations, partners and Palestinians say far too little aid is still coming in, with months&apos; worth of supplies piled up outside Gaza waiting for Israeli approval. The leading international authority on food crises this week said a \"worst-case scenario of famine\" was occurring in the besieged enclave. Israeli officials deny that starvation is occurring in Gaza . download our app subscribe to our newsletter</b","summary":"The Palestinian political and military group has delivered a fresh rebuke to a key Israeli demand to end the war in Gaza.","url":"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/hamas-says-it-wont-disarm-unless-independent-palestinian-state-is-established/67qx83grj","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/daf4c15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1406+0+0/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fa3%2F456377b542aab2a55c30b1166955%2F20250802198674344228-original.jpg","video":"https://link.theplatform.com/s/Bgtm9B/waHuk5APg5my/meta.smil?feed=Phoenix%20Web%20Player&amp;format=smil&amp;ord=7739193&amp;policy=15513405&amp;dfptag=sz%3D530x298%26iu%3D%2F4117%2F__AD_PREROLL_NAME__%2Fweb%26ciu_szs%26impl%3Ds%26gdfp_req%3D1%26env%3Dvp%","publish_date":"2025-08-02 23:01:40","author":"Aap / Hassan Alzaanin/tass/sipa Usa","authors":["Aap / Hassan Alzaanin/tass/sipa Usa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":347644926,"title":"Shady foreign leaders are pouncing on Trump's thirst for peace prize","text":"President Donald Trump is obsessed with getting a Nobel Peace Prize. President Barack Obama won one—so why can’t he?\n\nHis desperation is so transparent that foreign leaders are now using it as a tool of manipulation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on July 7 that he would nominate him. A group of African leaders followed. So did Pakistan—just one day before condemning Trump for bombing Iran. Now Cambodia’s joined in on the butt-kissing.\n\nOfficially, the prize goes to the person who, in the words of its namesake Alfred Nobel, “shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”\n\nImagine Trump, of all people, being the recipient of that.\n\nOf course, a nomination means almost nothing. According to Snopes, hundreds of thousands of people around the world are eligible to nominate anyone—including national legislators, university professors, and more. Back in 2020, a far-right Norwegian lawmaker nominated Trump, long before self-serving world leaders figured out how to game the system to flatter him.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t care about the difference between a nomination and actually winning the esteemed prize. In 2020, he treated being nominated as a monumental achievement. Again, from Snopes:\n\nAt a rally in Minden, Nevada, on Sept. 12, Trump called the nominations \"a big thing,\" saying that on Sept. 11 he had been \"nominated a second time for another Nobel prize,\" a confusing formulation of words that muddled the fact that he was only nominated for one award, albeit by two different individuals. He touted the nomination again at a rally in Las Vegas on the following day, telling the crowd, \"They nominated your president, twice last week, on two different subjects, for a Nobel prize.\" \n\nSean Hannity, Fox News host and one of the president's most prominent supporters, tweeted that in the space of \"only one week,\" Trump had been \"nominated for not one, but two Nobel Peace Prizes,\" the same oddly inaccurate phrasing used by the president himself.\n\nBetween Sept. 10 and Sept. 14, Trump and his campaign ran a combined total of 48 Facebook and Instagram ads touting the nominations as part of his reelection pitch to voters. Half of those ads contained a graphic with an unfortunate spelling error that read \"President Trump was nominated for the Noble Peace Prize.\"\n\nSo far this year, the Nobel committee has received 338 nominations for the 2025 prize. The deadline was Jan. 31. Don’t be surprised when Trump starts whining that he didn’t win, despite taking office again a mere 11 days before the deadline. And expect a repeat performance next year, too, when he is actually rejected.\n\nBut how could Trump even be in the conversation?\n\nRelated |In his mind, Trump is already a dictator\n\nHe bombed Iran. He encouraged ethnic cleansing in Gaza. He’s currently threatening nuclear war against Russia. He sanctioned International Criminal Court judges. He trashed the United Nations. He gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development, which will cause millions of avoidable deaths, according to a study by The Lancet. And somehow this is a man promoting “fraternity between nations”?\n\nTrump wants the world to see him as a peacemaker. But he’s never created peace—only chaos. And no amount of flattery from influence-seeking foreign leaders will change that.","summary":"President Donald Trump is obsessed with getting a Nobel Peace Prize.

His policies are the stuff of the Mad Hatter.\n\nAnd today I can reveal that Labour’s Net Zero drive will cost an estimated £23 billion a year by 2030.\n\nThat is the equivalent of slapping another £389 a year onto the cost of living for households.\n\nIt is a cost this country cannot afford.\n\nLet me give you a few examples to show you just how barmy our energy policy has become under ‘Red Ed’.\n\nFirst- the oil and gas industry.\n\nJust weeks after winning the election, Labour banned new licences to drill for oil and gas in the North Sea.\n\nFurious trade unions said that up to 30,000 UK jobs could be lost, but their dire warnings fell on deaf ears.\n\nBut the most ridiculous thing is that Britain still imports oil and gas taken from the very same seabed from Norway.\n\nSo, Norway gets to keep the taxes, profits and jobs, while the UK goes without.\n\nIt is a grotesque example of self-harm. \n\nSecond – the bizarre case of the Drax power station in North Yorkshire.\n\nIt imports wood from halfway around the world to burn, yet the UK taxpayer has spent billions of pounds in green subsidies on the power station. \n\nThis simply makes no sense.\n\nThird – the sky high cost of wind and solar energy.\n\nLabour has set the UK insane targets to quadruple offshore wind and double onshore wind in just five years.\n\nBut energy produced by these wind farms is actually MORE expensive.\n\nEd Miliband has promised wind farms a fixed price of £113 per MWh for the next 20 years. \n\nThat is 50 per cent HIGHER than the average cost of electricity.\n\nThe cost of building new wind and solar farms is also enormous.\n\nAn estimated £40 billion a year will be spent upgrading the National Grid, and rolling out new pylons and battery storage sites. \n\nWorst of all, wind and solar are even paid NOT to produce energy. \n\nThis is because our creaking National Grid cannot handle big surges of energy. \n\nSo when it is particularly windy they have to pay wind farms to switch off.\n\nThis year alone we have paid £700 million to wind farms to STOP generating power.\n\nIt is bananas.\n\nIn addition, Brits face environmental levies included in their energy bills, which are additional charges intended to fund the development of new, greener energy sources.\n\nLabour are sending environmental levies hurtling towards £14.8 billion in 2030.\n\nThe PM promised he would cut energy bills by £300 by the next election. \n\nBut the opposite is true. They are getting bigger and bigger.\n\nNo wonder President Trump thinks we are mad. \n\nOur energy costs are twice those in America. As a result their economy is booming while ours is stagnating.\n\nThe US President could see the truth and was unafraid to say it.\n\nBritain needs to completely change course.\n\nIt’s time to junk the clean power target and support energy policies that actually work. \n\nWe should take the US President’s advice and “drill baby drill” in the North Sea.\n\nWe should expand nuclear energy.\n\nAnd we should ditch our expensive green energy levies and subsidies. \n\nOtherwise we remain Ed Miliband’s mad world – and we will all pay the price.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBy Nick Timothy, Tory MP for West Suffolk Next to the Prime&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Impact of Ed Miliband’s Green Policies on Family Energy Bills Amid Prime Minister’s Cost-Cut Promises first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/impact-of-ed-milibands-green-policies-on-family-energy-bills-amid-prime-ministers-cost-cut-promises/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Family-mourns-after-shooting-leaves-three-women-dead-in-Hilliard-380x200.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 22:54:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":347642876,"title":"Smithsonian will again include Trump in impeachment exhibit in 'coming weeks'","text":"The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History will once again mention President Donald Trump in an exhibit on presidential impeachments after the removal of a placard noting his two Senate trials sparked concerns this week over the White House's influence on the institution. In a statement on Saturday, the Smithsonian detailed its decision to remove the Trump placard from the \"Impeachment\" section of an exhibit titled \"The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden,\" saying the decision was not influenced by politics, but rather the conditions of the placard. \"The placard, which was meant to be a temporary addition to a 25-year-old exhibition, did not meet the museum’s standards in appearance, location, timeline, and overall presentation,\" the Smithsonian's Saturday statement read. \"It was not consistent with other sections in the exhibit and moreover blocked the view of the objects inside its case. For these reasons, we removed the placard.\" The \"Impeachment\" section of the exhibit \"will be updated in the coming weeks to reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history,\" the Smithsonian said. The Washington Post was the first to report on the changes to the exhibit. According to the Post, the Trump references were removed from the exhibit after the Smithsonian undertook a content review following pressure from the White House and accusations of partisan bias. In its statement, the Smithsonian said it was \"not asked by any Administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit.\" “The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden” exhibit was created in 2000 and hasn’t been formally updated since 2008, a spokesperson for the Smithsonian told NBC News on Thursday. In lieu of an update, which the museum indicated would be costly, the Smithsonian in 2021 affixed a placard noting Trump's two impeachments to the exhibit. “It was intended to be a short-term measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in place until July 2025,\" the spokesperson said Thursday. Because the exhibit, which also covers Congress and the Supreme Court, hadn’t been updated since 2008, the museum decided to restore the “Impeachment” section of the gallery “back to its 2008 appearance,\" the spokesperson said at the time. The decision to remove the Trump label drew criticism from lawmakers, particularly as Trump has sought to exert his influence over the Smithsonian, which encompasses 21 museums, nine research centers and a zoo. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Friday accused Trump of attempting to \"rewrite history.\" \"He is censoring the American History Museum. It’s Orwellian. It’s downright Orwellian. It’s something you’d see in an authoritarian regime,\" Schumer said. \"Here’s my message to the president: no matter what exhibits you try to distort, the American people will never forget that you were impeached not once, but twice.\" Trump has called for a reimagining of the Smithsonian, accusing the cultural institution in March of coming “under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” and signing an executive order to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness.” In that order, Trump directed Vice President JD Vance to work with the Smithsonian's Board of Regents to \"remove improper ideology\" from the museums. Trump also barred spending on exhibits or programs \"that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\" Last week, artist Amy Sherald said she withdrew her exhibit from the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery after concerns were raised about a portrait she featured of a transgender woman dressed like the Statue of Liberty. \"I was informed by the National Portrait Gallery that concerns had been raised internally about the museum’s inclusion of a portrait of a trans woman titled Trans Forming Liberty. These concerns led to discussions about removing the work from the exhibition,\" Sherald said in a statement. \"I cannot in good conscience comply with a culture of censorship, especially when it targets vulnerable communities.\" A spokesperson for the Smithsonian disputed Sherald's characterization of the incident, arguing that the artist was not asked to remove the painting, but rather the museum wanted to contextualize the portrait through a video featuring differing opinions of it. \"The Smithsonian strives to foster a greater and shared understanding. By presenting and contextualizing art, the Smithsonian aims to inspire, challenge and impact audiences in meaningful and thoughtful ways. Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement with the artist,\" the spokesperson said.","summary":"The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History will once again mention President Donald Trump in an exhibit on presidential impeachments after the removal of a placard noting his two Senate trials sparked concerns this week over the White House's influence on the institution","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/smithsonian-will-include-trump-impeachment-exhibit-coming-weeks-rcna222690","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250802-Smithsonian-RM-e631bc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 22:54:14","author":"Nnamdi Egwuonwu","authors":["Nnamdi Egwuonwu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":347642006,"title":"Sell only Swadeshi goods, PM Modi exhorts Indian traders amid ‘global economic uncertainty’","text":"Asserting that India is on the path to becoming the world's third-largest economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday that the country must remain alert to its own economic priorities amid the instability and uncertainty facing the world economy.\n\n PM Modi's remarks came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump called India a \"dead economy\" after announcing a 25% tariff on the import of Indian goods along with an unspecified \"penalty\" for buying Russian military equipment and crude oil.\n\n Addressing a public meeting in his parliamentary constituency Varanasi on Saturday (August 2, 2025), Mr. Modi said, \"As we talk about economic progress, I want to draw your attention to the current global scenario.\n\n \"The world economy is facing instability and uncertainty. In such times, countries are focusing solely on their own interests. India, too, is on the path to becoming the world's third-largest economy and must remain alert to its own economic priorities.\" \n\nThe prime minister also made a renewed push for 'Swadeshi', stressing that every party, leader and citizen must work to promote indigenous goods if \"we want India to become the third-largest economy\".\n\n‘Sell only Swadeshi goods’\n\n Making a special appeal to traders and shopkeepers, the prime minister said, \"At a time when the world is going through uncertainty, let us take a pledge to sell only Swadeshi goods from our shops and markets. Promoting made in India goods will be the truest service to the country.\" \n\nHe also urged people to be conscious consumers, saying, \"Whatever we buy, we should ask ourselves — has an Indian toiled to make this? If it has been made by the sweat of our people, with their skills, that product is Swadeshi for us. We must adopt the mantra of 'Vocal for Local'.\" \n\n\"The feeling of Swadeshi in every action will define our future. This will also be a true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. Only through collective effort can we fulfil the dream of a developed India,\" Mr. Modi said.\n\n The prime minister, who was addressing a massive public gathering on Saturday in Banauli village, highlighted the government's farmer-centric policies in detail.\n\n He said the government is constantly working for the well-being of farmers.\n\n Calling for a national movement to support local products, the prime minister said, \"This is not just about Modi saying it, every Indian should say this — if we want India to become the third-largest economy, every political party and every leader, keeping aside their hesitations, must work in the nation's interest and awaken the spirit of Swadeshi among the people.\" \n\nDemands made by U.S.\n\nThe U.S. tariff action is being seen as a pressure tactic to get New Delhi to agree to demands made by the U.S., which has, in recent days, got favourable trade deals with major partners like Japan, the UK and the European Union.\n\n India has especially toughened its stance on extending duty concessions on agri products, dairy and GM foods in the proposed bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the U.S.\n\n With the U.S. not able to finalise a deal with India so far, Mr. Trump on Thursday announced the imposition of an additional 25% import duty on Indian goods entering American markets from August 7.\n\n Earlier, this duty was to be imposed from August 1. The President has also not specified the penalty that he announced against India for buying crude oil and military equipment from Russia.\n\n‘Fastest growing major economy’\n\n In the backdrop of Mr. Trump's \"dead economy\" barb at India, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had told Parliament on Thursday that India is the world's fastest-growing major economy and widely expected to be the \"third largest economy\" in a few years.\n\nMr. Goyal also said India will take all necessary steps to safeguard and promote national interest and that the implications of the US tariffs are being examined.\n\n In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump had said, \"I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.\n\n \"We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World.\" \n\nHis remarks were echoed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who said President Trump has stated a \"fact\", prompting a strong condemnation from the BJP.\n\n While announcing the tariff, Trump described India's trade policies as \"most strenuous and obnoxious\".","summary":"The Prime Minister's remarks came just days after U.S. President Donald Trump called India a \"dead economy\"","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sell-only-swadeshi-goods-pm-modi-exhorts-indian-traders-amid-global-economic-uncertainty/article69888286.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/wefifo/article69888287.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20250802049L.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 22:53:03","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.324},{"id":347643310,"title":"Hamas refuses to disarm until Palestinian state established","text":"Hamas has reaffirmed that it will not agree to disarm unless a sovereign Palestinian state is established, in response to one of Israel’s key demands in talks about a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian armed group said it was responding to remarks it attributed to US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff that Hamas had “expressed its willingness” to lay down its weapons.\n\nIsrael considers the disarmament of Hamas one of several key conditions for any deal to end the conflict.\n\nIndirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages stalled last week.\n\nIn the past few days, Arab governments have urged Hamas to disarm and surrender control of Gaza, after a number of Western countries – including France and Canada – announced plans to recognise a state of Palestine.

She also appeared to be wearing a watch.\n\nShe was notably without fellow high profile inmate Jen Shah, the former Real Housewife of Salt Lake City who is also incarcerated at the facility.\n\nShah pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to a telemarketing scheme she ran targeting the elderly. \n\nPhotos have also shown Holmes and Shah running at the same time while engaging in cozy chats.\n\nMaxwell, who herself has been pictured running at her Florida prison, will likely soon run into both women.\n\nCamp Bryan is an all-female prison, unlike the Tallahassee prison, which housed men and women. \n\nThe camp is also a much more comfortable prison that holds primarily white-collar criminals and not people convicted of violent crimes.\n\nMaxwell's sudden removal to Texas from a low-security prison in Tallahassee outraged Epstein's victims and their families.\n\n'This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes,' said sisters Annie and Maria Farmer and members of Virginia Giuffre's family in a statement obtained by Daily Mail.\n\n'Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. \n\n'Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas.'\n\nPrison consultant Justin Paperny told Daily Mail he had never seen anyone convicted of a sex offense serve time in a minimum security prison such as Camp Bryan.\n\n'She was in a low security prison, that looks like prisons on TV or in the movies.

Ghislaine is a vegetarian and each prisoner is supposed to get 8oz of protein a day, but she was getting 2oz or less. The food was moldy. Everyone, not just Ghislaine, complained about the food,' the source said.\n\nMaxwell's lawyer David Oscar Markus confirmed to Daily Mail that she was moved from the Tallahassee prison on Thursday.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons confirmed the transfer on Friday.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy NIOMI HARRIS \n Published:23:02 BST, 2 August 2025 |Updated:23:11 BST, 2 August 2025 \n\nDenise Welch seemingly broke in down tears and was hugged by her son Matty Healy in West Hollywood this week after backlash over her comments about his ex Taylor Swift.\nThe Loose Women star, 67, recently faced the wrath of Taylor's huge fanbase after making a subtle dig at her tendency to pen songs about her famous exes before accusing her Swifties of lashing out at anyone who dares to criticize her.\nAnd it appears that things may have gotten too much for Denise as she struggled to hold in her emotions while out with her rocker son, 36, on Friday - though a source told TMZ it was due to a 'family matter'.\nThe actress was seen dabbing her eyes with a tissue as she sat on a pavement outside Stella restaurant, with the 1975 front man sitting close by to support her.\nThe pair, who were said to be at dinner with Matty's fiancée Gabbriette Bechtel, appeared deep in conversation, with Matty taking the opportunity to puff on a cigarette while supporting is mother.\nDenise and Matty then stood up and embraced, before seemingly heading inside.\n\nDenise Welch seemingly broke in down tears and was supported by son Matty Healy in West Hollywood this week amid the backlash over her comments on his ex Taylor Swift \n\nFollowing the fallout from her comments, in which she was branded 'obnoxious by Taylor's camp, Denise struggled to hold in her emotions while out with her rocker son, 36, on Friday.\n\nThe Loose Women star, 67, recently faced the wrath of Taylor's huge fanbase after making a subtle dig at her proclivity to pen songs about her famous exes [Denise and Taylor pictured]\n\nDenise had plenty to say about Taylor during an appearance on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live last month\nThough it's unclear why Denise was apparently in tears, a source told TMZ: 'There was a family matter that Matty was consoling his mother about.'\nDaily Mail has contacted Denise's representatives for comment. \nIt was said Taylor is taking 'the high road' after 'obnoxious' Denise, the mother of her ex Matty, took a swipe at her during an awkward interview exchange.\nThe 35-year-old singer became a hot topic of conversation during Denise's appearance on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live last month, during which she was quizzed about Taylor's latest album The Tortured Poets Department. \nDenise told host Andy Cohen: 'Obviously, on pain of death can I talk about that episode, but being her mother-in-law is a role that I am glad I lost'. \nHer confession elicited shocked gasps from audience members, to which Welch quickly clarified her statement.\n'Not that I have anything against [Taylor] at all!' she said emphatically, adding: 'It was just – it was tricky.'\n'Listen, you're not allowed to say anything,' she went on, 'and then she [Taylor] writes a whole album about it.'\n\nThe actress was seen dabbing her eyes with a tissue as she sat on a pavement outside Stella restaurant, with the 1975 front man sitting close by to support her\n\nDenise was seen blowing her nose as her supportive son sat close by \n\nThe pair, who were said to be at dinner with Matty's fiancée Gabbriette Bechtel, appeared deep in conversation\n\nThe former Coronation Street star looked glum as she stared into the distance, while Matty took the opportunity to puff on a cigarette while supporting is mother\n\nDenise and Matty then stood up and embraced, before seemingly heading inside\n\nThough it's unclear why Denise was in tears, a source told TMZ: 'There was a family matter that Matty was consoling his mother about' \n\nDenise was clearly upset during the day out with her eldest son and future daughter-in-law\n\nThe mother and son were seen speaking outside for a period of time\n\nIt is not known why Denise was upset, though her tears come in the wake of backlash from Taylor's camp\n\nThe TV personality cut a chic figure in a blue blazer, jeans and white wedge sandals\n\nEXCLUSIVE Taylor Swift hits back at ex Matty Healy's 'obnoxious' mother and issues firm warning \nTaylor and Matty, 36, dated following her split from her longterm boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, in April 2023. \nBut the relationship was short-lived - and Taylor has since moved on with NFL star Travis Kelce, while Matty himself is now engaged to model Gabbriette Bechtel.\nSince then, the $1.6billion songstress has been basking in the glory of her record-breaking Eras Tour, her historic buy-back her musical masters, and her loved-up relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight-end Travis.\nThat's why, according to an inside source, Taylor has no plans to issue a scathing response to Denise's sly digs.\nInstead, she plans to do exactly as she always does… and just shake it off.\n'It's a bit obnoxious in Taylor's eyes, but she has to take the high road,' the insider exclusively told the Daily Mail.\n'If there was anything that would be in a future song of Taylor's – if she were ever to respond – she would respond that way. But as of right now, she might just let it slide. She is not going to let Denise ruin her day.'\nWhile Taylor and Matty only dated for a few short months in 2023, their paths first crossed years earlier.\n\nDenise told host Andy Cohen: 'Obviously, on pain of death can I talk about that episode, but being her mother-in-law is a role that I am glad I lost' \n\nBut she clarified that her son — the frontman for The 1975 — is taking the aftermath of Taylor's album 'all in completely good grace'\n\nThey briefly dated following her split from actor Joe Alwyn in April 2023. Their rollercoaster romance came to an end that June after Matty faced criticism for making a series of offensive comments\n\nTaylor is pictured with Nick Grimshaw (left) and Matty (right) in 2015 in London. She reportedly met Matty when she attended a 1975 show in Los Angeles in November 2014\n\n Denise Welch's rants and jibes over the years as opinionated Loose Women star targets Taylor Swift \nThe two reportedly met when Taylor attended a 1975 show in Los Angeles in 2014, with her friends Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding in tow.\nBut they weren't properly in each other's orbits until 2022, when rumors began circulating that Matty would be featured on Taylor's album Midnights.\nThere turned out to be some truth in the gossip. Matty revealed in the November of that year that he had collaborated with Taylor in the studio, though their work never saw the light of day.\nThey picked up the professional collaboration in January 2023, with Taylor making a surprise appearance on stage at a 1975 concert.\nAnd then, following news of her split from Joe in April that year, the new romance was confirmed - just one month later.\nBut as quickly as it had begun, Matty was swept up in controversy over offensive accents and crude jokes he had made about rapper Ice Spice.\nAcross social media, Taylor's fans expressed their disappointment with the singer over her choice of partner, and urged her to dump Matty.\nBy early June, the two were reported to no longer be together.\nLoose WomenDenise WelchMatt Healy\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDenise Welch's 'tears' after Taylor Swift swipe: Loose Women star appears to cry in the street and is hugged by son Matty Healy after TV interview backfired\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 22\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Senators were supposed to be long gone from Washington by now, but Trump’s demands to ram his nominees through Senate Democrats’ historic blockade have kept lawmakers in town. But by late afternoon, not much progress had been made. RECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ When asked if any headway had been made, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News Digital, \"Unfortunately, not really, no.\" \"The Dems are dug in on a position that's just not working,\" he said. Negotiations have been ongoing among Republicans, Democrats and the White House. Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., met last night to discuss an offer from Democrats. The two have not spoken directly since then, instead communicating through intermediaries, Thune said. However, he expected they would talk again later Saturday. Senate Republicans want to strike a deal that would see nominees that made it through committee with bipartisan support get lightning-fast votes on the floor, but Schumer has not relented. SENATE GOP EYES RULES REVOLT AS DEMS STONEWALL TRUMP NOMINEES A source familiar with negotiations said Senate Democrats are looking for deals on the release of funding withheld by the White House and a guarantee that there will be no future rescissions packages — a particular sticking point for them heading into the looming deadline to fund the government. In exchange, they are offering a tranche of nominees to go ahead now, and another round later in the fall. But Trump, who is at his Bedminster, N.J., golf course, has demanded that lawmakers stay in town and pass the entire slate of nominees on the Senate calendar, which has ballooned to over 150. The president lauded Senate Republicans in a post to Truth Social on Saturday \"for fighting, over the Weekend and far beyond, if necessary, in order to get my great Appointments approved, and on their way to helping us MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" \"The Radical Left Democrat Senators are doing everything possible to DELAY these wonderful and talented people from being approved,\" he said. \"If George Washington or Abraham Lincoln were up for approval, the Dems would delay, as long as possible, then vote them out.\" GRIDLOCK CRUMBLES AS SENATE ADVANCES SPENDING BILLS IN RACE AGAINST SHUTDOWN While Republicans have confirmed well over 100 of the president’s nominees, the only pick to make it to the floor without objection was Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Not a single one of Trump’s nominees has gotten a voice vote or gone through unanimous consent, two floor actions that have been routinely used to advance nominees in the upper chamber throughout the years. At this point four years ago, 49 of former President Joe Biden’s picks had been confirmed by voice vote. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., explained that Republicans have three options that they have enough support among the conference to move forward with: reach a deal with Democrats; adjourn the Senate and give the president runway for recess appointments and finally, a rules-change package, which some Republicans consider the \"nuclear option.\" On recess appointments, a move floated since before Trump took office, Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., contended it would be up to Democrats whether Republicans actually went through with it. \"The Democrats’ obstruction is leading to, in very short order, us taking the necessary actions to give the President power to make recess appointments,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While it would be a touchy move that would set off a firestorm among Democrats, Republicans aren’t afraid to move ahead with a rules change. When asked if a rule change should be done before lawmakers leave town, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said \"I think that’d be best.\" But the preference is to strike a deal, preferably on a potential package on over 60 nominees that were advanced out of committee in a bipartisan fashion. \"The reason why we're that way is because Schumer led us down this road,\" Mullin said. \"He didn't have to do it this way.\"","summary":"The negotiations between Senate leaders simmered over President Donald Trump&apos;s nominees, with Republicans looking at all options to get the ball rolling and leave D.C.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-dig-in-trump-demands-all-nominee-fight-boils-over-senate-gop-looks-deal","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/donald-trump-trans-athlete-080125.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376491695112","publish_date":"2025-08-02 22:08:37","author":"Alex Miller","authors":["Alex Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":347645966,"title":"Will Sean Diddy get a pardon? President Trump opens up on charges against the rapper","text":"AgenciesDonald Trump openly spoke about singer and rapper Sean Diddy Combs and said that he considers him “sort of half-innocent” despite his criminal conviction in federal court in July 2025.\n\nUS President Donald Trump openly spoke about singer and rapper Sean Diddy Combs and said that he considers him “sort of half-innocent” despite his criminal conviction in federal court in July 2025. The US president said that pardoning the music mogul was “more difficult” because of past criticism.In an interview with Newsmax on Friday night, Trump said, “He was essentially, I guess, sort of half-innocent.” “He was celebrating a victory, but I guess it wasn’t as good a victory,” he added. Combs, 55, was convicted in a New York federal court of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for flying people around the country, including his girlfriends and male sex workers, for sexual encounters, while he was acquitted of more serious charges. He could get up to a decade in prison at his sentencing set for Oct. 3.According to The Guardian, several media outlets reported that Trump has been weighing a pardon for Combs. He has been seen partying in public and exchanging mutual declarations of friendship ahead of his two presidencies.Speaking about the music mogul, Trump said, “When I ran for office, he was very hostile.” “It’s hard, you know? We’re human beings. And we don’t like to have things cloud our judgment, right? But when you knew someone and you were fine, and then you run for office, and he made some terrible statements. So I don’t know … It makes it more difficult to do.”Live EventsCombs had told The Daily Beast in 2017 that he did not “really give a f**** about Trump,” according to The Guardian. When Trump’s first presidency ended in 2020 following a defeat to Joe Biden, Combs, who is Black told radio host Charlamagne tha God that “white men like Trump need to be banished.” “The number one priority is to get Trump out of office,” Combs said.Sean 'Diddy' Combs asks judge to throw out guilty verdicts or grant him a new trialMeanwhile, Combs has asked a judge to throw out his guilty verdicts on prostitution-related counts or grant him a new trial, saying such convictions are without precedent. “This conviction stands alone, but it shouldn't stand at all,\" the Wednesday filing said.Combs' lawyers argue that his two felony convictions were a unique misapplication of the federal Mann Act, which bars interstate commerce related to prostitution. “To our knowledge, Mr. Combs is the only person ever convicted of violating the statute for conduct anything like this,” a Wednesday filing from Combs' legal team said.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onSean Diddy Combs pardonSean Diddy Combs criminal convictionDonald Trump comments on Sean DiddyTrump Sean Combs relationshipSean Diddy Combs sentencing October 2025\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

I think what it is is it just takes the burden off the back of the American taxpayer.\"\n\nIn his words, Trump is growing increasingly disappointed by what he sees as the lack of significant progress in the Ukrainian conflict settlement. Whitaker added that weapons deliveries to Kiev will create preconditions for a peace process.\n\nOn July 14, US President Donald Trump said that Washington will continue transferring weapons and military equipment to Kiev, if Europe pays and NATO coordinates the process. According to the American president, the deliveries will include 17 Patriot systems.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on August 1 that Moscow’s main objective is to eradicate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis and ensure Russia’s security. In his words, Russia is ready to wait if Ukraine thinks that the time for talks has not come yet.\n\nRussian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told VGTRK journalist Pavel Zarubin in an interview that Russia was ready to make rapid progress in the Ukrainian settlement, but the main thing for Moscow is to achieve its goals.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy NIOMI HARRIS \n Published:22:39 BST, 2 August 2025 |Updated:22:54 BST, 2 August 2025 \n\nStrictly Come Dancing is facing a fresh crisis as it's been reported that the BBC have launched an investigation into cocaine use by two stars of the show. \nAccording to The Sun, the broadcaster hired a law firm to probe allegations of drug taking by two individuals, whose drug use is said to be 'well-known' on the show.\nThe claims were reportedly made in a legal submission to the BBC by law firm Russells back in March, on behalf of former contestant Wynne Evans. \nThe publication also understands other people have also reported the allegations of drug taking on the dance show to the BBC.\nAmid the independent inquiry, it is said 'former contestants, dancers and crew' alike will have the opportunity to speak with law firm Pinsent Masons to express concerns.\nA source told The Sun: 'These claims are extremely serious and should be taken as such, given only last year that the BBC’s Director-General promised to clean up Strictly, it seems particularly shocking.\n\nStrictly Come Dancing is facing a fresh crisis as it's been reported that the BBC have launched an investigation into cocaine use by two stars of the show\n'The idea of the show’s stars discussing drug-taking is deeply disturbing, the BBC have known about these allegations for some time, and acknowledged receiving them.\n'Now they are taking firm action, they’ve been told that it’s well-known that two stars took drugs, including cocaine, which was talked about widely among the cast.'\nThe insider said the BBC understands that one star described another as 'off their face' on drugs, with that person telling one celebrity: 'Have you seen their pupils... they’re off their face.'\nAnother celebrity is also said to have told how it was 'well-known' that two of the stars took cocaine, adding that it was 'talked about widely' among the cast.\nThe individuals at the centre of the drug allegations have not been named.\nDaily Mail contacted BBC representatives for comment, with a spokesperson stating: 'We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. \n'We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.'\nDaily Mail understands that it is not unusual for the BBC to engage an external individual to provide additional expert resource to help deliver a BBC led investigation. In these cases, they would report into an established BBC team. \n\nThe claims were reportedly made in a legal submission to the BBC by law firm Russells back in March, on behalf of former contestant Wynne Evans [pictured]\n\nAmid the independent inquiry, it is said that 'former contestants, dancers and crew' alike will have the opportunity to speak with law firm Pinsent Masons to express any concerns [the show's pro dancers pictured last year] \nThe shock allegations come just amid a long period of controversy for the BBC and Strictly over the past year or so.\nIn July last year, more than six months after quitting the show citing 'personal reasons', actress Amanda Abbington accused pro dancer Giovanni Pernice of 'unnecessary, cruel and mean behaviour' during their time dancing together on Strictly.\nGiovanni rejected the claims immediately, and a BBC investigation ruled in September that her claims of physical aggression and threatening behaviour were not upheld.\nWhen BBC bosses published their report into Giovanni's behaviour, it cleared him of the most serious allegations of physical aggression, but upheld verbal bullying and harassment. \nComplaints of verbal bullying and harassment meant the BBC issued an apology to Amanda, but Giovanni said he was 'pleased the report has not found any evidence of threatening or abusive behaviour'.\n\nIn July last year,

partner Katya Jones, who seemed to remove his arm from her lower waist on the show.\nAfter the BBC launched an investigation into his conduct, bosses decided not to renew his radio contract for his show.\nThe TV star confirmed in May that they will not be renewing his one-year rolling contract following a four-month investigation after the inappropriate comments made during his time on Strictly.

Sun reports. \nA source said higher-ups had heard from several colleagues and logged concerns over her 'hard' and 'bullying' behaviour on the breakfast show, as well as her Radio 5 Live show. \nWynne

Tagovailoa, one of the strongest arms in the league, has dealt with several health issues in his career that has impacted his performance, especially concussions.While talking about Tagovailoa on Thursday, Trump seemed confident that the former Alabama Crimson Tide star can make an impact on his team as long as he's healthy. The President almost demanded health from Tagovailoa next season, saying:\"Saquon Barkley was on the council and Tua Tagovailoa the quarterback, he’s been fantastic. ... When he’s not injured, he’s great. He’s gotta stay healthy. He’s a great guy.”Talking with Tom Pelisero and Brian Baldinger of NFL Network on Saturday, McDaniel reiterated Trump's words and shot down any concerns about the quarterback being unhealthy for the new season.“I think if I was concerned about how serious he (Tua) was taking his part in staying healthy, I think he got an executive order last night to stay healthy if I’m not mistaken,” McDaniel joked.During the speech at the White House on Thursday, Trump announced an executive order to reinstate the Presidential Fitness Test, which was discontinued since the 2012-13 school year. Tagovailoa and the Philadelphia Eagles' star running back Saquon Barkley were two of the athletes named to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.Since 2019, Taigovailoa has suffered four documented concussions, including three in the last three NFL seasons. He was out for four weeks after suffering a concussion against divisional rivals Buffalo Bills in Week 2 of the 2024 season.That concussion sparked speculations about a potential retirement for the Dolphins star. However, he returned to the field and was close to taking the Dolphins to the playoffs until a Week 18 loss to the New York Jets ruined their plans.Mike McDaniel praises Tua Tagovailoa's maturity ahead of a crucial 2025 seasonThe Miami Dolphins could look very different after the 2025 NFL season. McDaniel is aware of that, but he also knows Tua Tagovailoa is taking this campaign with the utmost respect and seriousness. He praised the quarterback's maturity to keep pushing despite being under constant criticism.“It’s been cool to watch him really evolve into who he is on the national stage, but more so like, really in his own skin, be the true leader of the team and it’s real and authentic,” McDaniel said. “And all he’s done with a ton of noise, focus on the right stuff. So there’s a lot of things that go into staying healthy, but first and foremost you have to prioritize, really acknowledge what you mean to the team.”The Dolphins are set to bounce back in a competitive AFC that might be up for grabs.","summary":"Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel echoed US President Donald Trump's words regarding Tua Tagovailoa's health for the 2025 NFL season.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/nfl/news-he-got-executive-order-last-night-mike-mcdaniel-reiterates-donald-trump-s-remark-tua-tagovailoa-s-health-ahead-2025-nfl-season","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/08/23847673-1754163857.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-02 21:54:17","author":"Orlando Silva","authors":["Orlando Silva"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.364}]}
