A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out \"Free Palestine\" as he was led past the press cordon. In response, Harris said, \"I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,\" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector’s din. PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: ‘WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?' Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump. After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week. \"I take it many people here watched it,\" she said, as the reference drew applause. \"You’ll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.\" Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations \"massive\" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements. She also said the Republican wants to impose a \"Trump sales tax,\" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president’s foreign tariff plans. DE NIRO, DE BLASIO HEADLINE ‘PAISANS FOR KAMALA’ RED-SAUCE DINNER LIVESTREAM EVENT Harris also spoke about national division, saying \"we are not going back\" to past years, and instead called for a \"new way forward.\" \"We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,\" she said. \"People are exhausted with that stuff.\" She also called herself the \"underdog\" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke. \"So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?\" Harris asked Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro – who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris’ running mate consideration – offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage. \"We have proved … that we can ‘get sh—done’!\" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration’s edgy slogan of sorts. \"[We’ve invested] a historic amount in our public schools… when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,\" he added. \"We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].\" \"Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to – you belong and I got your back,\" Shapiro went on, adding Harris’ campaign offers a similar vision.

She stood up for our union sisters and brothers. This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump’s tenure in the White House, \"we are not going back to that.\" \"When you go back and look at his record, it was … less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,\" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost \"basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.\" Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans \"declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.\" In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration’s disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.\" \"The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn’t be easier for Pennsylvanians.\" At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin – in nearby Northumberland County – also host sizable communities. In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an \"especially easy choice\" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his \"blossoming friendship\" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status. At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine – which borders Poland: \"Why don’t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,\" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.","summary":"At a rally at Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about her debate performance, abortion, and other issues.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-interrupted-multiple-times-pro-palestinian-protesters-she-rallies-wilkes-barre-pennsylvania","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/0fbfea74-GettyImages-2170586246.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 00:46:43","author":"Charles Creitz","authors":["Charles Creitz"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":256378746,"title":"Haitian motorist making illegal turn in Springfield, Ohio, smashes into mom driving with autistic daughter","text":"A Haitian driver made an illegal turn and smashed into a mother’s pickup truck in Springfield, Ohio, a Post reporter witnessed Friday — as the small city grapples with a surge of immigrants from the Caribbean country who are unfamiliar with the rules of the road. Robyn Stultz, a 32-year-old mother of three, was approaching the intersection at West First Street and St Paris Road with her 7-year-old autistic daughter in the backseat when a black Hyundai sedan collided with her truck around 2:30 p.m. The Haitian driver made a right turn from the left lane — marked for continuing straight or turning left — and crashed into Stultz’s Ford F-350, which was making a right turn from the right lane, when he tried to overtake her, a Post reporter observed. The Haitian driver, who remained at the scene, told The Post he was licensed and was driving to his job at Amazon. He said he had lived in the US for three years. “I went to turn, there was an accident and that’s it. Why are you asking me questions?” he said. Fortunately, Stultz and her young daughter were unhurt. “He tried to cut off the truck behind me and get over, so they honked their horn at him, and he tried to overtake me on the corner,” she said. “I seen him at the last minute but you try and stop a big truck like this — there’s no way,” she added. The Post has reached out to the Springfield Police Department for more information. Residents of Springfield, which has attracted national attention over false claims about its Haitian population, said that the main issue with the tens of thousands of new Haitian immigrants is not unfounded rumors of people snatching and eating pets, but from the reckless drivers. Tensions have been rising between the Haitian population and native Springfield residents since 2023, after 11-year-old Aiden Clark was killed when a 36-year-old Haitian driving without a US license caused a school bus to roll over. Twenty others were hospitalized. In December, Springfield grandmother Kathy Heaton was struck and killed by a Haitian immigrant driving with an expired license in December while she was collecting her garbage cans. But prosecutors declined to charge the driver, 38-year-old Robenson Louis. Stultz said the Haitian drivers need some drivers ed courses. “The Haitians just don’t know our laws. They are causing accidents all the time. They just need to learn the laws of the road, they need schooling,” she told The Post. “My kids stay at home 95% of the time because the roads aren’t safe with these Haitian drivers,” the mother added. Bryce Hatzer, 22, who witnessed Stultz’s crash, agreed that the Haitian drivers are a hazard in Springfield. “Every day I almost get hit by Haitians at this same intersection,” he said. “The Haitians don’t know how to drive. That guy was in the wrong lane to turn right, that’s why they collided,” he said of Stultz’s crash. The driving problem has attracted such attention that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced this week that in addition to $2.5 million in aid, he would be sending additional State Highway Patrol troopers to Springfield to help maintain order on the roads. Mandy Heaton, Kathy Heaton’s daughter-in-law, asked the Springfield City commission in an emotional testimony to support “Kathy’s Law,” which would require all immigrants seeking an Ohio driver’s license to go through the same tests and regulations required of first-time American drivers. Some 20,000 Haitian migrants flocked to the city of just 60,000 people in just a few years. The city came under the national spotlight after claims that the Haitian immigrants were killing local dogs, cats and fowl for food. The claims made headlines after they were repeated by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Local officials denied that anything like that had happened. Vance has also alleged Springfield is experiencing a “massive rise in communicable diseases,” however Clark County Combined Health District Commissioner Chris Cook told NBC News Friday that’s not accurate. Several schools in Springfield were closed for the second day in a row on Friday due to bomb threats as a result of the national media attention. Several city commissioners and a municipal employee were the target of an emailed bomb threat, a city spokesperson told NBC. Local police and FBI agents are working “to determine the origin of these email threats,” the city official said.","summary":"\"The Haitians just don't know our laws.

Here are three takeaways from Harris’s first solo interview of her 2024 campaign. Separation from Biden on economic vision Harris touted herself as a “new generation of leadership” in contrast to President Joe Biden, saying repeatedly she wants to develop an opportunity economy. She reiterated previous campaign messaging in which she laid out her plans for a $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child’s life, a $50,000 tax deduction for new businesses, and an offer of $25,000 in assistance for new home buyers. “My approach is about new ideas, new policies that are directed at the current moment,” she said. “And also, to be very honest with you, my focus is very much in what we need to do over the next 10 to 20 years to catch up to the 21st century around, again, capacity but also challenges.” Moderate approach to gun ownership The vice president reiterated that she and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), are gun owners and support the Second Amendment while also pushing for certain restrictions. The statement mirrors the approach Democrats have taken against former President Donald Trump in an effort to siphon voters away from him with more moderate messaging on gun control. Harris noted that a “majority of [National Rifle Association] members support” universal background checks on gun purchases as she does. She said her career as a prosecutor helped her understand why an assault-style weapons ban is necessary, saying she’s “personally seen what assault weapons do to the human body.” A more moderate message on guns could help her in Pennsylvania, a state that has swung between Democrats and Republicans in past presidential elections. Repeats belief about why voters don’t want Trump Harris pressed her belief that she’s the more qualified candidate to unite the country, saying there’s “hate and division” coming out of Trump and his campaign. She noted that she’s supported by “over 200 Republicans,” including former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. Harris has touted Republican endorsements in an effort to appeal to those in Trump’s party who are unsure about their path forward. She believes she can lead better than Trump. “I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” she said. “I think people are exhausted with that approach.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with a local Philadelphia television station on Friday for the first solo interview of her 2024 presidential campaign.

She answered five questions from Action News 6 ABC, a local affiliate of ABC News, in the interview that came just days after the moderators in the ABC debate with Donald Trump assisted her by providing fact checks on the former president but not her. One of the ABC moderators for the debate, Linsey Davis, is a member of Harris’ sorority and Dana Walden, a Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC, is one of the vice president’s close friends. Action News 6 ABC anchor Brian Taff asked Harris, 59, what she would specifically do to bring down prices as president. “Well, I’ll start with this. I grew up as a middle class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard,” she began, before going on about her neighborhood where people “were proud of their lawn.” “We as Americans have beautiful character. We have ambitions and aspirations and dreams. But not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions,” Harris went on. She did not say how she would bring prices down but did highlight her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and giving tax breaks to new small businesses. Harris also said she is “obviously not Joe Biden” because she offers an “opportunity economy” and “a new generation of leadership.” “So, for example, thinking about developing and creating an opportunity economy where it’s about investing in areas that really need a lot of work,” she said, seemingly looking to find words. The veep said she was not going take “anyone’s guns away” and that she supports the Second Amendment, but will ban “assault weapons” and “universal background checks.” “They’re literally tools of war,” Harris said. On what she thinks Trump’s appeal is to voters, Harris again took a few sentences to get to the core of the question. “I, uh, based on experience and, uh, and, a lived experience know in my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of Americans have in common so much more than what separates us,” she said. “And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other,” she said of Trump, arguing voters want someone with “common sense.” “I think people are more willing now in light of the hate and division that we see coming out of Donald Trump to say, ‘Hey, let’s put country first.'” Taff finally asked Harris if there was anything she wanted voters to know about her. “I don’t know. I mean, probably it’s not very different from anybody watching right now. I love my family, um, one of my favorite things that I lately have not been able to do is Sunday family dinner. I love to cook. I have incredible friends,” Harris said. “I have a career that really, and I said it the other day, you know, as a career prosecutor, I never asked a victim of crime where they were a Republican or a Democrat. The only thing I ever asked them was, ‘Are you OK?'” she said, arguing she thinks most Americans want that approach. Harris has avoided the press for the majority of her time as the Democratic nominee. She did her first debate over a month after replacing President Biden, 81, in the race with CNN alongside her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. She then appeared on two local radio shows before debuting on the debate stage against Trump on Tuesday with ABC. Harris has been criticized for not allowing the press more access to her campaign as the race dwindles down to less than two months before Election Day.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with an ABC affiliate for her first solo interview Friday, choosing the same network that got her through this week's slanted presidential debate.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/kamala-harris-sticks-with-abc-for-first-solo-interview-since-slanted-debate-and-still-serves-up-word-salad/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/kamala-harris-sticks-abc-first-89615400.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 00:23:25","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":256378244,"title":"Allegations of eating cats increase hostility towards Haitian immigrants as Trump exacerbates tensions in peaceful Ohio community","text":"For more than two centuries, it’s a town that has stayed out of the spotlight as its largely law-abiding folk quietly carried on with their lives. It’s so unassuming, even its name was taken from another city. But now Springfield, Ohio, has suddenly found itself under worldwide scrutiny over its burgeoning Haitian population – and you can taste the tension on the streets. The latest inflammatory and unproven accusations that some new immigrants are eating household pets have only served to increase the rancor of many locals who cannot accept the new arrivals. Meanwhile, some of the 15,000 or so Haitians who have made the city their home since 2020 are now considering leaving because of the bitterness being generated, DailyMail.com can reveal. For a mid-western city previously known for farm machinery manufacturing, it’s not overstating to say that turmoil is in danger of taking over. One white local told us: ‘I fear bullets are going to fly.’ On the very day we visited to try to unpick fact from fiction, a bomb threat closed down the city hall and an elementary school. Mayor Rob Rue admitted the words contained ‘hateful language towards immigrants and Haitians’. Into that mix, of course, came Donald Trump, who propagated the pet-eating narrative during his combative presidential debate on Tuesday with Kamala Harris. He claimed: ‘In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country.’ After ABC news anchor and debate co-moderator David Muir interceded to say the city said there had been no credible reports of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community, Trump doubled down. Although the debunked claims have been on social media, he said: ‘I’ve seen people on television. The people on television saying my dog was taken and used for food.’ Even before the debate, Trump – the first president since McKinley not to have a dog in the White House – posted AI memes on his Truth Social account showing cats in MAGA hats. This was after his vice presidential pick JD Vance had seized on the accusations to build a narrative against migrants and illegal immigration. This drama all over a city of 60,000 that was founded in 1801, named after Springfield, Massachusetts, and had previously been in decline for decades as its blue-collar industries collapsed. The influx of Haitians has been credited with helping a resurgence, filling job gaps in places like the Amazon distribution center and a local metal working factory. But the pet-eating claims and others that immigrants have been slaughtering ducks in the park have left the city on edge. Unlike many American downtowns now, Springfield has an aura of regeneration with coffee shops and bistros in neat redbrick buildings. Large colorful murals celebrating the city adorn walls. Road signs proclaim ‘Springfield, find your unwind.’ Outwardly, the factor is definitely feelgood. But you barely need to scratch the surface to reveal the fractious underbelly. At the Haitian Community and Support Center, administrator Rose-Themar Joseph was composed yet clearly unsettled in her response to the ex-president’s incendiary remarks, viewed by 67million Americans who watched the debate live on TV. Between assisting new arrivals at the center’s building on the edge of the city, she told us: ‘Trump’s comment shocked me and frustrated me. ‘Haitians are being used as part of a political agenda by people with power and money. They should fact check the information before spreading it all over the world. It’s showing a lack of humanity. ‘We don’t know the exact number of Haitians now in Springfield. But they come here because there are jobs and it is a much more affordable part of the country that Florida or New York. ‘Many work in the local Amazon center. All types of people, doctors, lawyers, all types who had to flee Haiti because there is a complete breakdown of law and order on the streets.’ Joseph, a 40-year-old mother, fled Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince four years ago after an armed gang stopped her car and shot at it. Miraculously, the former American Red Cross worker survived, but her family implored her to leave fearing she would be targeted again. ‘There were three of us in the car and we were stuck in traffic. This gang came out and just started shooting. That kind of thing happens all the time there. Shootings, kidnappings, nobody can feel safe. Joseph entered the United States in Miami four years ago on a visitor visa and was granted Temporary Protected Status, available to people from war-torn countries or broken regimes. She moved to Springfield for its affordability. Her current organization helps newcomers apply for jobs, seek out school places for their children and investigate the possibility of certain qualifying benefits such as food stamps. The majority of Haitians in Springfield are legal immigrants, there through TPS, Green Cards, the Humanitarian Parole Program and also citizenship. Despite the current tensions, she insisted on leaving us with this message: ‘I just want to say to the American people, thank you.’ At the thriving Rose Goute Creole Restaurant situated in a busy strip of diners and stores, manager Romane Pierre, 41, sat at one of his tables and put on a brave face despite his rising concerns. His main worry was escalation. ‘Many people in our community are shocked by Donald Trump’s words and genuinely fear what could happen next. ‘Some are considering leaving Springfield, I know some others who have actually left. Because Haitians in this town don’t have guns. But Americans, they do have guns. ‘American people like their cats and dogs, so when it’s said Haitians are eating them we don’t know how they’re going to react. I know a lot of people who feel afraid right now. They don’t know what’s going to happen next. ‘This was the feeling just before the debate as well, when JD Vance started sharing these stories. ‘Let me tell you, Haitians don’t eat dogs, they don’t eat cats. My people, they like goat.’ And he emphasized: ‘Haitians come here looking for an opportunity, they’re looking for a job, a place to live that they can afford. And they work very hard.’ Pierre came to the United States in 2020 and headed to Springfield ‘because you could get a four-bedroom house for $700 a month. After I came, every day, every day, every month, more people followed.’ He accepts the massive influx has put terrific strain on schools, housing and health care. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine this week pledged $2.5 million to expand primary health care cover in Springfield. Pierre fled Port-au-Prince after his computer business was ransacked by an armed gang and he was told his life under threat. He entered the US on a visitor visa and claimed Temporary Protected Status. His spoken English is excellent. ‘It’s chaos in Haiti. Here we feel we have some security and with hard work and ambition we can make something or ourselves.’ Returning to the Trump comments, Pierre pointed to a large floral arrangement on the restaurant counter. ‘A lot of Americans come in here, they like Haitians,’ he said. ‘After the presidential debate, some of them brought us those flowers. There’s hope.’ However, the unifying sentiment was not in evidence just 100 yards away as Priscilla Marrs waited to pick up her daughter Courtney from her shift as Dunkin’ Donuts. The 53-year-old didn’t mince words. While she was not convinced Haitians were pet-eaters, she randomly insisted: ‘You just can’t go anywhere without them taking all the groceries.’ She also blamed Haitians for car accidents, saying: ‘There’s wrecks everywhere. I mean, you have to watch it when you drive around here. The crashes, it’s ‘cause of them. I mean everywhere you go. It’s really bad.’ Asked if she had witnessed any Haitians in car accidents, Marrs admitted: ‘Well, no. But they follow you all around in when you’re in Walmart.’ She cited on example of being followed but when asked how she knew they were Haitian, she replied: ‘I mean, I’m assuming they were. Because I mean, that’s all you see.’ Daughter Courtney was equally vocal, saying: ‘I don’t care for ’em. I used to work with them almost four years in a factory. ‘They’re rude, they’re disrespectful. You know, they pretty much had all of our jobs at the car parts place where I used to work. They got their way, with the hours they wanted.’ And in a general swipe – despite Haitians filling employment gaps as Springfield starts to climb out of economic torpor – she added: ‘It’s like, I feel like they’re taking all of our good stuff away from us Americans, like our cars, our housing, a lot of our jobs.’ Outside Springfield City Hall, while it remained shut due to the bomb threat, mom-of-three Jessica McNairtook an even more trenchant stance against the newcomers. Confusingly mixing up the protagonist in the bomb threat that also closed an elementary school, she said: ‘It’s out of control here. I mean, they come over here… I work hard, pay taxes and my child can’t even get an education because we have threats at schools. ‘And they can’t drive, they can’t drive at all. And my rent’s going up because of them, and my insurance is going up, everything’s going up.’ Wearing a t shirt with a picture of a defiant Trump with his fist raised after escaping the assassination bid, and the words ‘You Can’t Kill Freedom,’ the Amazon worker ramped up her attack. ‘My job is full of them, plum full. And I was even informed they’re (Amazon) are not even hiring Americans no more,’ she alleged. Asked if she had proof of such a hiring policy, she replied: ‘I’ve not got that, but I’ve heard. You go into my place of work and you don’t see no Americans in training. It’s all immigrants.’ And warming to the theme, she continued: ‘This is our country. Then they come here, get housing, they get a car, brand new cars, they get welfare. What about our homeless people being kicked out of their houses just so they can put Haitians in them? ‘They should just go back to their country. They won’t fight for their country? This ain’t Springfield, it’s Little Haiti.’ Military veteran Ken McGravy, 68, said he had no proof of missing pets, or ducks and geese from parks that have also featured in social media allegations against Haitians. But he did tell DailyMail.com there are ‘suspiciously’ fewer wild birds in the city’s Snyder Park where he walks regularly. He could not be sure why. Also strolling downtown, he gave his own chilling insight into his home city. ‘There’s a lot of hatred in Springfield,’ he told us. ‘A lot of rednecks who are really racist, and that’s such a sad thing. ‘This circus now has been whipped up through social media and seized upon. I was born in Springfield and I genuinely fear that, knowing the place as I do, bullets might start to fly unless things start to tone down. It’s dangerous.’ Haitian Sedieu Estache, 26, had come to the city hall to pay his water bill, not realizing it was closed. After parking his white Ford Explorer SUV, he smiled as he told us: ‘I’ve never had a problem with the people of Springfield. I feel they accept me.’ The Amazon employee fled Haiti because he supported one of the opposition parties and was constantly receiving death threats at his Port-au-Prince home. After receiving Temporary Protected Status, he headed straight to Springfield three years ago. ‘I was menaced in my own country,’ he said. ‘I feared for my life and felt I had no alternative but to leave. Here, I can make a good life, I can contribute.’ Half a mile away, at the Covenant Presbyterian Church, a group of pastors gathered in a bid to calm what they felt was an ugly situation that was rapidly escalating – an urgency highlighted by the bomb threat. Pastor Jodie Noble told DailyMail.com: ‘We are together today in a call for restraint, an appeal for calm, in response to the violence and the threats that are occurring here. ‘It’s always a surprise what humans can do based on emotion. And I pray that will not be our truth here. We are together knowing that could be a reality, of what anger could produce in people.’ Pastor Carl Ruby of the city’s Central Christian Church, said: ‘In Springfield we stand together and we stand side by side with our new Haitian neighbors. We stand together as conservatives, progressives, Democrats, Republicans, Protestants and Catholics… to remind everyone that God loves immigrants. ‘The real story is not the anger. The real story is for 80 years we were a shrinking city and now we are growing.’ The group was joined by Viles Dorsainvil, executive director of the Haitian help center, who said: ‘We are here to contribute to the wellbeing of Springfield.’ Of the MAGA attack line regarding pets, he said: ‘High ranking people in power should try to control their narrative. Their rhetoric can affect a community, it can affect an entire country. But we are still optimistic. We have hope.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFor more than two centuries, it’s a town that has stayed out&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Allegations of eating cats increase hostility towards Haitian immigrants as Trump exacerbates tensions in peaceful Ohio community first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/allegations-of-eating-cats-increase-hostility-towards-haitian-immigrants-as-trump-exacerbates-tensions-in-peaceful-ohio-community/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Cat-eating-claims-fuel-anti-Haitian-immigrant-hate-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-14 00:23:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":256378888,"title":"Trump vows 'large deportations' in US amid false claims of Haitians eating pets in Ohio: 'We will start in Springfield'","text":"Former President Donald Trump pledged on Friday to initiate massive deportations from Springfield, Ohio, if re-elected.

The influx has helped the city meet rising labor demand after decades of industrial decline, reported CBS. Most of these migrants are in the US legally through Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and humanitarian parole programs, which allow them to live and work while their home countries experience crisis.Despite Trump's claims, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, along with Springfield’s mayor and police chief, confirmed that there have been no credible reports of migrants stealing or eating pets.Governor DeWine offers support for strained resourcesWhile acknowledging the strain on local healthcare systems, Governor DeWine announced a $2.5 million initiative to expand primary care access in Springfield, where many Haitian migrants have limited health services. \"We will continue to do everything we can to help the community deal with this surge of migrants,\" DeWine said, criticizing the federal government's lack of a clear plan.Biden condemns Trump’s rhetoricPresident Joe Biden denounced Trump’s remarks during a White House event celebrating Black excellence, calling the comments harmful to the Haitian community. \"This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop,\" Biden said, referring to the inflammatory claims Trump and his allies have made about Springfield’s migrants.Despite Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, painting Springfield as a community in crisis, local leaders and experts have consistently rejected their claims, pointing to the important contributions of migrants in the region.'We need help, not hate'Haitian community leaders across the United States said the Republican candidate's remarks could put lives at risk and further inflame tensions in Springfield. \"We need help, not hate,\" Springfield's mayor Rob Rue told ABC News.City officials say they have received no credible reports of anybody eating household animals.

But nothing could have prepared fans for Prue Leith's latest look. The restaurateur, 84, made sure all eyes were on her as she opted for a striking all leather look. The broadcaster strutted down the catwalk during the Vin + Omi show at The Kensington Building during London Fashion Week on Friday. Beaming in snaps, the tight fitted PVC midi dress featured raunchy red lace up detailing and exaggerated wide shoulders. Prue Leith ditched the pastries for the PVC as she debuted a VERY bold all leather look during the Vin + Omi show at The Kensington Building during London Fashion Week on Friday The restaurateur, 84, made sure all eyes were on her as she opted for a striking all leather look She is normally known for her colourful ensembles, bold prints and the quirky glasses she styles each week on The Great British Bake Off The star accessorised the look with some black leather trainers and matching leather gloves as she switched the kitchen for the stage. Ditching her glasses, Prue opted for intense smoky eye makeup and a bold red lip. Prue will soon be back on screens with Paul Hollywood as the fifteenth series of The Great British Bake Off kicks off on September 24 at 8pm. Earlier this year Prue admitted that she almost didn't apply to replace Mary Berry on the much loved show as she feared she wouldn't tick the 'diversity boxes'. The star has been a judge on the cooking competition since she replaced Mary in 2016. However, this very nearly wasn't the case as Prue reveals she initially completely dismissed the idea. It was revealed that the women had known each other since the 1970s when a photo of them with broadcaster Jack de Manio (1914-1988) was unearthed. Prue told the Sliding Doors podcast with Jennie Becker: 'I just jumped at it. I had begun to think about it, once I knew Mary Berry was not going to go on. I thought: \"Oh, I’d love that job\", but I dismissed the thought. Pouting in snaps, the tight fitted PVC midi dress featured raunchy red lace up detailing and exaggerated wide shoulders Ditching her glasses, Prue opted for intense smoky eye makeup and a bold red lip The star accessorised the look with some black leather trainers and matching leather gloves as she switched the kitchen for the stage The star looked surprisingly at home on the catwalk Prue seemed to be embracing her inner Cruella DeVille in the ensemble Prue will soon be back on screens with Paul Hollywood as the fifteenth series of The Great British Bake Off kicks off on September 24 at 8pm She showcased her age defying looks once again Earlier this year Prue admitted that she almost didn't apply to replace Mary Berry on the much loved show as she feared she wouldn't tick the 'diversity boxes' 'I thought: \"They’ll get someone younger, someone more . . . probably a young Asian chef or something, that would tick all the diversity boxes and stuff’. But no, they chose me.\" 'If you think about my past career, I’d had 11 years sitting at the Great British Menu as a judge and every plate has about ten tastes on it - it makes Bake Off look really simple.

I knew all the top chefs, I had a Michelin restaurant of my own so I knew that level of cooking very well.' The connection to baking specialist Maty extends to Prue's own husband, fashion designer John Playfair, 77, who frequently uses it to his advantage while commenting on his wife's cooking. 'I won’t bake cakes since we are both too fat, so he taunts me with, \"I wish I’d married Mary Berry,\"' she said. At the time of Prue's arrival, fans, already disgruntled by the move from BBC to Channel 4 and the loss of Mary, Sue Perkins, and Mel Giedroyc, did not warm to her. Prue told The Times in February: 'Oh, I hate my voice. It’s too posh. When I replaced Mary Berry on Bake Off someone on Twitter said: \"Oh no, not that posh b**ch\", and I sort of agreed with her. But yes, Americans seem to like it.'

Gov. Burt Jones will not be charged over efforts to overturn former President Donald Trump’s electoral defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Peter Skandalakis, who leads the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, a judicial agency that assists prosecutors across the state, said in a statement that he considered the matter closed. Jones was among a slate of 16 alternate presidential electors who met at the state Capitol on Dec. 14, 2020, and cast votes for Trump even after an official vote count confirmed Joe Biden defeated him in the state. Additionally, Jones was asked by the chairman of a Georgia Senate Judiciary subcommittee to deliver a letter to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 5, 2021, requesting a delay in counting the Electoral College votes. Jones, then a state senator, did not deliver the letter. “My review of the evidence finds this matter does not warrant further consideration. The evidence reveals Senator Jones acted in a manner consistent with his position representing the concerns of his constituents and in reliance upon the advice of attorneys when he served as an alternate elector,” Skandalakis said in a four-page statement Friday. “The evidence also indicates Senator Jones did not act with criminal intent, which is an essential element of committing any crime.” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis was barred in 2022 from building a case against Jones, who at the time was running for lieutenant governor, after she participated in a fundraiser for a Democrat in that race. In April, Skandalakis became the lead prosecutor in the investigation into Jones, and said that he had reviewed transcripts and witness depositions, videos of Georgia legislature committees, the investigative file of the Atlanta Judicial Circuit District Attorney’s Office, and text messages from Jones’ phone. He also said he conducted four interviews with Jones. Jones had denied wrongdoing in the case, and blasted Willis in a statement Friday. “I have always wanted to tell my story in front of a fair and unbiased prosecutor, which Fani Willis clearly is not. I am thankful that I finally had the opportunity to do that. Ms. Willis has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars trying to weaponize our judicial system, increase her political profile, and finance an inappropriate relationship with her boyfriend,” Jones said in a statement. A spokesperson from the Futon County District Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday evening. Trump and more than a dozen other people were indicted in August 2023 on state felony charges in Georgia tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Four of the original 19 co-defendants pleaded guilty, while Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. The judge overseeing the case threw out three of the initial 41 counts in the indictment this week, including two brought against Trump. The case remains on hold over efforts to disqualify Willis in her role as prosecutor.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA special prosecutor announced Friday that Georgia Lt.

She has raised six children who range in age from 12 to 25.\"I have two sons who are hungry every second, every minute of the day,\" Selden said. \"I have daughters who would like to think that they eat dainty, but they don't.\"Her family has always relied on the federal Child Tax Credit, first created in 1997, to help make ends meet. During the pandemic, the credit was boosted temporarily from $2,000 to $3,000 per child, and up to $3,600 for families with children under the age of 6. The move helped cut U.S. child poverty by 46%, according to a 2022 report from the U.S. Census Bureau.\"Bills still needed to be paid and things still needed to be bought,\" Selden said. \"And it was a comfort in knowing that you had this extra income.\"It costs an estimated $310,000 to raise a child from birth to age 18, the Brookings Institution found in a 2022 report. One of the few things both presidential candidates agree on is that the Child Tax Credit should get a big boost. Former President Donald Trump's campaign is proposing a $5,000 per child yearly tax credit. Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing a credit of up to $3,600 per child, with a bump to $6,000 for newborns. Trump wants the credit to go to all families regardless of income, while Harris would restrict the credit to low and middle-income families only. She would also make the credit \"refundable,\" meaning even parents who don't pay taxes would get the credit in cash. \"This is a really exciting moment,\" University of Maryland economics professor Melissa Kearney told CBS News. \"…We have tons of evidence that supplementing the income of low-income families with children really meaningfully improves those children's lives. We see they do better in school. Their health outcomes are improved in ways that persist into their adulthood.\"The cost has always been a sticking point. A bill to expand the credit failed in the Senate just last month.Selden believes parents should receive a Child Tax Credit because their children \"are taking care of our future.\"\"We want them to grow up to be great, productive citizens in this country,\" she added. \"And it's like you can't do that if they can't eat.\"","summary":"Government figures show it now costs more than $300,000 to raise a child from birth to age 18.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boosting-child-tax-credit-key-issue-harris-trump/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/a3e80fed-bbd2-4168-b6b2-e4ada3d5e23c/thumbnail/1200x630/d2917cc48dc2720a2fda4ec3754e5617/1726271638621.png?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3193324_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:56:48","author":"Nancy Cordes","authors":["Nancy Cordes"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":256377614,"title":"Trump Tries Hard to Attract Taylor Swift Fans with Tasteless Tour Merchandise","text":"Donald Trump has a well-documented history of saying weird things about Taylor Swift, but he reached a disturbing new low on August 18, 2024 when he shared AI images of the pop superstar endorsing him, which is obviously not the case. For the record, neither Trump nor his campaign made the images. According to The Guardian, the AI images were created by another user on Truth Social. However, the former president did blast them to his legion of followers on the platform that he also happens to own. Swift remained oddly silent about the AI imagery in the weeks after. That changed when she dropped her September 10th endorsement of Kamala Harris following the vice president’s first debate with Trump. Clearly, Swift saw the images and did not take the situation lightly. In fact, she cited Trump’s AI use as the main reason for publicly backing Harris. “It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,” Swift wrote on Instagram. “It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.” Of course, Swift also took a cheeky swipe at Trump’s running mate JD Vance by signing her post as “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady.” Vance has been under fire for his 2021 remarks to Tucker Carlson where he referred to Democratic women as “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.” Swift clearly caught that scandal, too.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\n&#013; &#013; Christina House/Getty Images After wrapping up a strange and wild-eyed&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Tries Hard to Attract Taylor Swift Fans with Tasteless Tour Merchandise first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-lifestyle/trump-tries-hard-to-attract-taylor-swift-fans-with-tasteless-tour-merchandise/","image":"https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/trump-makes-desperate-attempt-to-keep-swifties-on-his-side-with-tacky-eras-tour-merch/intro-1726264180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:56:26","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":256377672,"title":"Donald Trump visits Bay Area for fundraising event ahead of November election","text":"SAN MATEO COUNTY, Calif.

After the latest debate here on ABC, polls across the country are tightening up between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Here in San Mateo County, it was obvious which way the group was voting. Woodside was once again home to an important campaign fundraiser.

While the outlet, RT, has previously been sanctioned for its work to spread Kremlin propaganda and disinformation, the new allegations suggest its role goes far beyond influence operations. Instead, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that RT is a key part of Russia’s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. “RT wants its new covert intelligence capabilities, like its longstanding propaganda disinformation efforts, to remain hidden,” Blinken told reporters. “Our most powerful antidote to Russia’s lies is the truth. It’s shining a bright light on what the Kremlin is trying to do under the cover of darkness.” RT has also created websites posing as legitimate news sites to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere, officials said. They say the outlet has also expanded its use of cyber operations with a new unit with ties to Russian intelligence created last year. The sanctions announced on Friday target RT’s parent organization, TV-Novosti, as well as a related state media group called Rossiya Segodnya and its general director Dmitry Kiselyov. A third organisation and its leader, Nelli Parutenko, were also sanctioned for allegedly running a vote-buying scheme in Moldova designed to help Moscow’s preferred candidates in an upcoming election. Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova suggested the sanctions against RT were unnecessary because it has already been sanctioned. “I think a new profession should appear in the United States — a specialist in sanctions already imposed against Russia,” she wrote on her Telegram channel. Russia’s global propaganda work is receiving extra scrutiny in the months leading up to the US election. The crowd-sourcing effort ran on Russian social media platforms and sought to raise funds for military supplies, some of which were procured in China, officials said. There were no obvious connections between RT and the fundraising campaign, or any indication that Chinese officials knew their products were being sold to Russia. The list of supplies also included night-vision equipment, drones, radios and generators. RT’s actions show “it’s not just a firehouse of disinformation, but a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government,” said Jamie Rubin, who heads the State Department’s Global Engagement Centre. Last week, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees with covertly paying a Tennessee company nearly $10 million for its content. The company then paid several popular far-right influencers, whose content often mirrored Russian talking points. Two of the influencers said they had no idea their work was being supported by Russia. This summer, intelligence officials warned that Russia was using unwitting Americans to spread its propaganda by disguising it in English on sites popular with Americans. Officials say Russia seeks to divide Americans ahead of the election as a way of reducing support for Ukraine. Russia’s influence operations also appear designed to support former President Donald Trump, who has criticised Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. –IANS khz","summary":"Washington, Sep 14 (IANS) The US State Department on Friday announced fresh sanctions on Russian state media, accusing a Kremlin news outlet of working for the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armour and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine, an official statement said.

Okay? That’s what I say. Good idea?” Biden, 81, snapped as he opened a meeting at the White House with visiting UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The journalist persisted, “But what do you say to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin’s threat of war, sir? It’s a serious threat.” “You’ve got to be quiet,” Biden replied. “I’m going to make a statement here, okay?” The journalist seemed to be part of the traveling British press corps and may have been unfamiliar with the American custom of waiting until the president is done speaking before asking questions. After Biden and Starmer’s brief introductory remarks, the reporter again lobbed his question. “I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin,” Biden said. The commander in chief on Monday confirmed that he was considering easing restrictions on Kyiv’s use of US-supplied weapons against Russia. “We’re working that out right now,” Biden told reporters on the White House lawn. Putin responded by saying, “This will mean that NATO countries — the US and European countries — are at war with Russia.” “And if this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us,” he said. The threat of nuclear war has loomed over the nearly three-year conflict in Ukraine as Washington largely bankrolls and arms the resistance to Putin’s invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been increasingly daring in counter-attacking Russia as the US election approaches on Nov. 5 — including launching a surprise invasion of Russian territory Aug. 6. Ukraine still holds some territory in the Kursk region of Russia — giving a potential bargaining chip in peace talks. Former President Donald Trump has vowed to hastily broker a peace deal to end the war if he wins the election — with Zelensky openly expressing his concern that would mean Ukraine ceding territory currently held by Russia in the country’s south and east.","summary":"President Biden scolded a journalist Friday for asking him to respond to Vladimir Putin&#8217;s statement that the US and Russia would effectively be at war if the American commander in chief lifts restrictions on Ukraine&#8217;s use of long-range missiles inside Russia. &#8220;I say you be quiet until I speak.

Speaking on Friday at a White House brunch billed as a “celebration of Black excellence”, Biden warned that Haitian Americans were a “community that’s under attack in our country right now”. His remarks were a rebuke to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his vice presidential pick JD Vance, both of whom have spread unfounded rumours about Haitian migrants and asylum seekers in the US. “It’s simply wrong. There’s no place in America” for that kind of rhetoric, Biden said, without naming Trump directly. “This has to stop, what he’s doing. This has to stop.” Trump — a former Republican president — and Vance, a senator from Ohio, have campaigned on a largely anti-immigrant platform, stirring fears of mass migration and crime at rallies across the US. In recent weeks, both men have zeroed in on the blossoming Haitian American community in Springfield, Ohio, where racial and ethnic tensions have simmered. Springfield, part of the country’s industrial Rust Belt, has sought to bolster its local economy in recent years by welcoming newcomers to the city. But as the Haitian American community grew, so too did the backlash. An estimated 15,000 Haitian immigrants have moved to the area — though officials on the city commission last year cited a lower estimate, between 4,000 and 7,000. Some longtime residents called on the city commission to “stop them from coming”. Tensions further escalated in August 2023, when a Haitian national was involved in a car crash that overturned a school bus and killed an 11-year-old child on the first day of school. While the boy’s family has called on residents to stop the “hate”, attacks on the Haitian American community have continued to spread, attracting national attention. In recent weeks, unfounded rumours have ricocheted across the internet that Haitian Americans are eating pets, echoing an anti-immigrant trope with a long history in the US. The rumour appears to have originated from a screenshot, supposedly taken from a private Facebook group. And city officials have publicly denied there was any basis for it. Even Vance acknowledged the murky nature of the allegations. “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false,” he wrote in a social media post on September 10. But Trump and Vance have since repeated the rumour multiple times, including at high-profile events like the September 10 presidential debate. “They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in,” he said at the televised debate, viewed by 67 million people. “They’re eating the cats.” The increased scrutiny on Springfield has led to multiple threats, reportedly linked to anti-immigrant sentiment. On Thursday, city hall was evacuated after a bomb threat. On Friday, other city buildings were likewise emptied after emails warned of an explosive device — including several schools. Nevertheless, that same day, Trump revisited his attacks on the Haitian American community in a news conference at his golf club outside of Los Angeles, California. “In Springfield, Ohio, 20,000 illegal Haitian migrants have descended upon a town of 58,000 people, destroying their way of life,” he said. “Even the town doesn’t like to talk about it because it sounds so bad for the town.” He said the city — as well as Aurora, Colorado — would be a centrepiece for his immigration crackdown, should he be re-elected in November’s election. “We’re going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country,” he said. “And we’re going to start with Springfield and Aurora.”","summary":"The US president called out his Republican rival for baselessly attacking Haitians in the city of Springfield, Ohio.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/13/biden-slams-trump-for-attacks-on-haitian-americans-this-has-to-stop?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-09-13T191508Z_1016443509_RC2AZ9AGQ8ZZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-BIDEN-AFRICA-1726269703.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:40:51","author":"Apps Support","authors":["Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":256377706,"title":"Biden administration is likely to delay decision over U.S. Steel","text":"WASHINGTON - The Biden administration is likely to delay a final decision on whether to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel of Japan until after the election, slowing a process that has been caught up in presidential politics, according to people familiar with the matter.Top Democrats and Republicans, including President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, have been in agreement that Nippon’s $15 billion bid to take over U.S. Steel should not move forward and that the company should remain American owned and operated.However, the prospect that the deal would be blocked before the election drew backlash from business groups and legal experts who feared that political interests were tainting a process that is intended to be focused on national security.","summary":"The White House has faced backlash for politicizing its review of Nippon Steel’s takeover of the company.","url":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/09/14/companies/us-steel-nippon-steel-biden-delay/","image":"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2024/09/14/421660.jpg?v=3.1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:40:00","author":"Alan Rappeport,Andrew Duehren,Lauren Hirsch,Web Master","authors":["Alan Rappeport","Andrew Duehren","Lauren Hirsch","Web Master"],"language":"en","source_country":"JP","sentiment":-0.709},{"id":256377076,"title":"Angry Mother Decides to Sell Taylor Swift Concert Tickets After Singer Endorses Kamala Harris","text":"A mom has revealed that she is shaking off Taylor Swift by selling three concert tickets following her endorsement of democratic nominee Kamala Harris – claiming she doesn’t want her daughter supporting someone with ‘non-Christian beliefs.’ The unnamed Canadian mother shared a message to the 34-year-old pop sensation via a video that has since been circulating the web. In the three-minute clip, the woman claimed that she was selling tickets she had purchased for her 13-year-old daughter’s birthday after the Cruel Summer hitmaker took to Instagram to show her support for Kamala following the explosive presidential debate earlier this week. She confessed that she now had bad blood with the songstress as she alleged Taylor didn’t care about the economy because she was a ‘billionaire’ and was too focused on her ‘private planes.’ The mom also said she now refused to spend ‘another dollar’ supporting the star’s ‘non-Christian beliefs’ – giving the singer’s pro-choice abortion position as an example. At the beginning of the clip, the mom noted that while she knew it was a ‘long shot,’ she still wanted to post the video in hopes the pop sensation would see it. She also insinuated that the star had planned her endorsement with Kamala prior to the debate. The mom said: ‘One, I think it’s really interesting how you had that one long letter for all your fans already printed out two seconds after Kamala and Donald Trump had their debate, which only tells me you already had this written up before the debate, which also tells me that you did not have an open mind. ‘Kamala lied to everyone on that stage and those of us that know, know.’ The unnamed mother went on to unleash a furious rant about the singer’s alleged lack of concern for the economy. She added: ‘Taylor, you are a billionaire. The rest of us are not, the rest of us are struggling, people can’t afford homes and some of us are losing our businesses. ‘If Harris gets into office, our economy is screwed but I know that doesn’t effect you because you have all that money and private planes. You just don’t even live in that kind of world.’ The Canadian woman noted that it seemed like the issues at hand were ‘LGBTQ rights and aborting babies,’ claiming ‘neither one of those are affected under Donald Trump.’ ‘Donald Trump is the right guy for the job. If the economy of the United States suffers, the whole world suffers, Taylor. If the whole world suffers, there goes your job and your career because nobody is going to be able to afford going to your concerts,’ she added. The mom then threw in religious beliefs into her furious rant as she claimed that according to the bible, she is permitted to ‘judge other believers.’ ‘How can you call yourself a believer and be for killing babies? So with that, I have three tickets to the Toronto show that I was going to take my 13-year-old, she turns 13 that day and it was a special gift because she’s been a Taylor Swift fan forever and I was going to take her to this concert. ‘But my tickets are now up for sale because I don’t want to spend another dollar supporting you and your private planes and your non-Christian beliefs. ‘I also don’t want my daughter – my Christian daughter – to believe that it’s okay to do things that are against God’s work, like killing babies,’ she added. The enraged mother ended the clip by claiming that she was ‘done’ with the pop sensation. Her viral video comes days after Taylor dramatically endorsed the democratic nominee in an Instagram post following the presidential debate. The megastar made the bombshell announcement on Instagram after the ABC showdown in which Trump accused migrants of eating pets and said Democrats wanted to ‘execute babies’ in the ninth month of pregnancy. Her post read: ‘Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. ‘As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country. ‘Recently I was made aware that AI of “me” falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. ‘It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth. ‘I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for Kamala because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. ‘I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades. ‘I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.’ The I Knew You Were Trouble hitmaker poked fun at Republicans in her post as she threw shade at the comments Trump’s vice presidential pick, JD Vance, made about ‘childless cat ladies.’ Taylor signed her post: ‘With love and hope, Taylor Swift, childless cat lady.’ The Trump campaign shrugged off the endorsement. ‘It’s further evidence that the Democrat Party, unfortunately, is the party of the wealthy elite,’ Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told DailyMail.com. ‘And Taylor Swift may make great music, but she does not understand the struggles of everyday, hardworking families, and President Trump is speaking on behalf of those hardworking, struggling families who don’t get the privilege, like Taylor Swift, of living in a gated community, who need their local police to be funded, who want their Second Amendment right to defend themselves and their family because they don’t have armed security like Taylor Swift has.’ Taylor has endorsed before, having previously backed Joe Biden in the 2020 election. And in an interview in 2019 with The Guardian, Taylor said she supported Hilary Clinton over Trump in the 2016 election and accused Trump of treating the presidency like ‘an autocracy.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA mom has revealed that she is shaking off Taylor Swift by&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Angry Mother Decides to Sell Taylor Swift Concert Tickets After Singer Endorses Kamala Harris first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/angry-mother-decides-to-sell-taylor-swift-concert-tickets-after-singer-endorses-kamala-harris/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Furious-mom-reveals-she-is-SELLING-her.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:36:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.192},{"id":256377296,"title":"Trump defends relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist","text":"Trump defends relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist Former President Donald Trump is defending his relationship with 9/11 conspiracy theorist and self-avowed white nationalist Laura Loomer and doubling down on false claims about pets being eaten in Springfield, Ohio.

Walz’ stop in Portland came after appearances earlier in the day in Bangor and is part of a blitz by the Harris-Walz campaign in states around the country, particularly battleground areas, on the heels of the presidential debate this week between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. “Tim and Kamala, with your help, will build an opportunity economy for everyone where if you work hard you can get ahead and you don’t have to scrape by,” Walz told a crowd of around 500 supporters during a rally at the Brick South event space. She encouraged people to make calls, volunteer and “do whatever you can,” to help elect Harris and Tim Walz. “We can choose to move forward but we’re going to have to fight, and we’re going to have to fight for it every day,” Walz said. Walz is the latest national surrogate to come to Maine on behalf of the Harris campaign, which has also sent Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, here twice, along with other surrogates, though neither Harris or Tim Walz have visited yet. Maine as a whole is seen as reliably Democratic, but the 2nd Congressional District has leaned more conservative in recent years. The state is one of two that split their electoral votes, and in 2016 and 2020 Trump carried the 2nd District to secure one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Neither Trump, his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, nor their family members have been to Maine yet this election cycle. Trump has spent less time here this year than in past campaigns – in 2016 he had already visited Maine three times before Labor Day and in 2020 he visited Bangor and Guilford during a trip in June. That could be a sign that the Trump campaign no longer sees the 2nd District as a toss-up, though political observers say Trump has also traveled less in general this election cycle. And while polling on Maine is limited, the latest results from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, released in late August, had Harris up by 5 percentage points in the 2nd District and leading Trump 55% to 38% statewide. The poll surveyed nearly 1,000 people between Aug. 15 and 19 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Walz, the first lady of Minnesota, where her husband is governor, also visited the Briar Patch bookstore and a campaign office in Bangor earlier in the day. In Portland, she spoke about her husband, their careers as teachers and educators, and some of the campaign’s priorities, choosing to highlight gun safety and reproductive rights. Speaking of Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Walz brought up a comment made by Vance recently in the wake of a school shooting in Georgia in which Vance said school shootings are a “fact of life” and argued that security should be bolstered at schools. “Their advice is we have to just get over it,” Walz said as the crowd booed. “I don’t buy it. I am not accepting that.” She said Trump and Vance are also “coming for our reproductive freedoms,” and spoke about how she and her husband struggled to start a family and had to use fertility treatments. “Everyone should have the freedom to build our families as we choose,” Walz said. “Just as important, we should be able to decide not to have children at all if that is our choice. The point is it should be our choice.” Walz was welcomed to the stage Friday by Mollie Barnathan, a Portland mother of three who talked about how she twice needed an abortion after pregnancies in which her babies had severe health conditions. “Both times I was able to access the health care I needed with dignity and respect,” said Barnathan, who said that many women across the country don’t have that same access because of Trump. Trump has boasted of his role in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and place decisions on abortion law in the hands of states, many of which have moved to restrict access. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills also appeared at Friday’s rally and credited the Biden-Harris administration with many successful initiatives in Maine, including infrastructure investments, an expansion of high-speed internet and increased access to child care. “Kamala Harris lives by the values she was brought up with, the kind of values we (in Maine) were brought up with,” Mills said. “And who else better embodies the kindness, respect and compassion than her running mate, my friend Tim Walz?” The rally Friday drew a long line of people that waited outside before the doors opened. Chris Pesek of Cumberland Center came to the rally because he believes Harris is the best choice for president and wanted to get more involved in her campaign. A registered Republican, Pesek said he also signed up to call voters on behalf of the Harris campaign. “I have sons and daughters and I care about what’s going to happen to the future of our country,” said Pesek, 60. “I see what (Trump) has done to the Supreme Court. I see and listen to Biden-Harris and I think they’ve gotten a lot accomplished, whereas I think Trump was taking us backwards. So I wanted to get involved and see what I can do to spread the word.” Jackie Clark of Portland said she was excited to show her support for Harris. Clark, 37, said she is originally from Minneapolis, so Tim Walz “is a huge deal in my family and we were very excited he was selected.” Clark, a Democrat, said she had planned to vote for Joe Biden but has enjoyed seeing enthusiasm build around Harris-Walz. “The entire vibe change that has happened in the last few weeks has been really exciting, and I feel more emboldened to support it wholeheartedly,” she said.","summary":"Walz spoke at a rally at Thompson's Point Friday night after stops in Bangor as part of a blitz by the Harris-Walz campaign on the heels of the presidential debate.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/13/gwen-walz-tells-supporters-in-portland-to-choose-a-new-way-forward-with-harris-walz/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/39674716_20240913_walz_10.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:26:30","author":"Rachel Ohm","authors":["Rachel Ohm"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":256376672,"title":"Fani Willis Skips Hearing Amid Subpoena Challenge: What Happens Now","text":"Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis skipped a hearing on Friday before a special committee of the Georgia state Senate examining misconduct allegations leveled against the prosecutor.The Republican-led committee formed this year is specifically delving into accusations of \"various forms of misconduct\" against Willis regarding her prosecution of former President Donald Trump, who was charged along with 18 allies, accused of attempting to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results.Willis' role in the case has been questioned after it was revealed that she had a romantic affair with the special prosecutor she hired to lead the case against Trump. The former president's team has sought to dismiss the case on accusations that Willis' relationship with the prosecutor, Nathan Wade, formed a conflict of interest, although Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willis was allowed to remain on the case as long as Wade stepped aside.Trump and his co-defendants have appealed that ruling by McAfee, and the Georgia Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments on the case in December.Willis was subpoenaed by the Georgia state Senate special committee to testify at a Friday hearing.In addition to testifying before the state Senate, Willis' subpoena orders her to produce documents related to the hiring and payment of Wade. State lawmakers also seek copies of text messages between the prosecutors, regardless of the subject. Willis said in a court filing earlier this week that producing such information would place an \"immense\" burden on her office and that the \"broad demands\" of the subpoena \"are profoundly harmful to the Prosecution.\"Willis did not attend Friday's hearing and is actively challenging the legality of the subpoena, although a court did not issue a ruling on her challenge before Friday. The Associated Press (AP) reported that the Senate committee instead heard from an attorney of the legislative counsel and a former secretary of the state Senate, which both said that the state lawmakers have the power to use subpoenas to compel testimony and documents from witnesses as part of its investigation.As former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek Friday, the legality questions around Willis' subpoena will have to be decided by the Georgia courts, \"but these sorts of legislative subpoenas are generally void because of the separation of powers.\"\"The legislature passes laws and the executive enforces them,\" Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said in an email. \"The Georgia State Senate can't tell a District Attorney how to prosecute cases.\"Even if the subpoena is found by a court to be valid, Rahmani added, the Georgia state Senate \"can't enforce it on its own.\"\"They would need a prosecutor like the Georgia Attorney General to compel attendance or prosecute Willis for failure to do so,\" he added. \"Willis can affirmatively file a motion to quash the subpoena, which she has, or she could raise the separation of powers defense in any action to enforce the subpoena.\"Legal analyst and attorney Dave Aronberg echoed to Newsweek on Friday that Willis \"is allowed to seek judicial intervention in this matter\" as she challenges the subpoena.\"If she ignores the subpoena completely,\" Aronberg noted, \"there could be consequences ... But not yet.\"According to AP, the Georgia state Senate committee chairman, state Senator Bill Cowsert, said during Friday's hearing that the panel has hired outside legal counsel to assist in enforcing the subpoena against Willis.As Trump's election subversion case stalls in court, McAfee dismissed two charges against the former president on Thursday, ruling that the Fulton County District Attorney's Office did not have the authority to bring charges that concern documents filed in federal court. The judge did allow eight other charges against Trump to proceed—down from the 13 that he originally faced.","summary":"The Atlanta prosecutor was ordered to testify before a Georgia state Senate committee examining allegations of misconduct.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/fani-willis-skips-hearing-amid-subpoena-challenge-what-happens-now-1953781","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2471302/fani-willis-skips-court-amid-subpoena-challenge.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:25:18","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":256376870,"title":"Pope Francis slams Trump & Harris over what he calls ‘anti-life’ policies","text":"Rome, Sep 14 (IANS) Pope Francis has slammed both US presidential candidates — Donald Trump and Kamala Harris — for what he called “anti-life policies” on abortion and migration, and advised American Catholics to choose the “lesser evil” in the upcoming US elections. “Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants or the one who (supports) killing babies,” Francis said on Friday. “Both are against life,” Francis told reporters aboard his plane returning to Rome after a 12-day tour of Asia. Francis stressed that he is not an American and would not be voting. Neither the Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was mentioned by name. But Francis nevertheless expressed himself in stark terms when asked to weigh in on their positions on two hot-button issues in the US election — abortion and migration — that are also of major concern to the Catholic Church. Francis has made the plight of migrants a priority of his pontificate and speaks out emphatically and frequently about it. While strongly upholding church teaching forbidding abortion, Francis hasn’t emphasised church doctrine as much as his predecessors. He said that migration is a right described in scripture, and that anyone who doesn’t follow the Biblical call to welcome the stranger is committing a “grave sin”. He was also blunt in speaking about abortion. “To have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word or not, but it’s killing,” he said. “We have to see this clearly.” Asked though what to do at the polls, Francis recalled the civic duty to vote. “One should vote, and choose the lesser evil,” he said. “Who is the lesser evil, the woman or man? I don’t know.” “Everyone in their conscience should think and do it,” he said. It’s not the first time Francis has weighed in on a US election. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Francis was asked about Trump’s plan to build a wall at the US-Mexican border. Francis declared then that anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants “is not Christian”. In responding on Friday, Francis recalled that he celebrated Mass at the US-Mexico border and “there were so many shoes of the migrants who ended up badly there”. The US bishops conference, for its part, has called abortion the “preeminent priority” for American Catholics in its published voter advice. Harris has strongly defended abortion rights. US President Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, shares Harris’ strong support for abortion rights, a stance that prompted some Catholic bishops and other conservatives to call for him to be denied access to Communion. After meeting Francis in person at the Vatican in October 2021, Biden came away saying the pope told him he was a “good Catholic” and should continue receiving Communion. Francis, asked on previous occasions about some US bishops who want to deny Communion to Biden over his support for abortion rights, has said bishops should be pastors, not politicians. –IANS khz","summary":"Rome, Sep 14 (IANS) Pope Francis has slammed both US presidential candidates &#8212; Donald Trump and Kamala Harris &#8212; for what he called &#8220;anti-life policies&#8221; on abortion and migration, and advised American Catholics to choose the &#8220;lesser evil&#8221; in the upcoming US elections. &#8220;Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants [&#8230;]","url":"https://bhaskarlive.in/pope-francis-slams-trump-harris-over-what-he-calls-anti-life-policies/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/iansportalimages.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbnails/202409143222430.jfif?ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:22:52","author":"IANS","authors":["IANS"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.147},{"id":256376812,"title":"\"This has to stop\": Biden condemns Trump's lies about Haitian immigrants","text":"President Joe Biden strongly condemned former President Donald Trump’s continued racist attacks on Haitian immigrants in an Ohio town, calling the smears “simply wrong.” Outside the White House on Friday, in remarks before a brunch celebrating Black excellene, Biden defended the Haitian-American community — including White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre — and denounced the incendiary comments comments from Trump. “I want to take a moment to say something. So many Americans, like Karine [Jean-Pierre], as you point out, is a proud Haitian American, a community that’s under attack in our country right now. It’s simply wrong,” Biden said. “This has to stop, what he’s doing. It has to stop.” Trump has repeatedly accused Haitian immigrants in the town of Springfield, Ohio of eating local pets. The white nationalist rumor spread quickly after being boosted by Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk and Sen. Ted Cruz. The attacks against Haitian immigrants from Trump and running mate JD Vance have motivated bomb threats at schools in Springfield. On Friday, Trump refused to back down from the bigoted rhetoric, instead promising to deport Haitian immigrants, despite their legal status. “We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio. Large deportations. We’re gonna get these people out,” Trump said. The Harris campaign has also denounced the bigoted remarks, with vice presidential nominee Tim Walz shutting down chants of “we don’t eat cats” in Michigan on Thursday, saying “it would be funnier, too, if it wasn’t so dangerous.”","summary":"The smears against Haitian immigrants, which Biden called \"simply wrong,\" inspired a slate of bomb threats in Ohio","url":"https://www.salon.com/2024/09/13/this-has-to-stop-biden-condemns-lies-about-haitian/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/joe_biden_2161029386.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:19:38","author":"Griffin Eckstein","authors":["Griffin Eckstein"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":256377736,"title":"Trump pledges mass 'deportation' after pet-eating claim","text":"Donald Trump and his running mate on Friday continued to disparage Haitian migrants in an Ohio community, further fueling false claims the Republicans have promoted even as the city saw bomb threats and school evacuations and local officials called for a cooling of the anti-immigrant rhetoric. “We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio,” Trump said Friday during a news conference in California, adding that he could possibly hold a campaign event or town hall in the city and claiming the migrants are “destroying the way of life.” Ohio authorities have said there are no credible or detailed reports to support the debunked allegations circulated this week by both Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants are eating domestic pets and birds in the city’s public parks. Trump mentioned the claims during a debate Tuesday with his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, prompting her to laugh and call the GOP presidential nominee “extreme.” READ MORE: ﻿Hunter discovers remains of missing 3-year-old US boy After city agencies were targeted in a bomb threat, Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Thursday called on politicians to tamp down the rhetoric. “All these federal politicians that have negatively spun our city, they need to know they’re hurting our city, and it was their words that did it,” Rue said in an interview with WSYX. A city spokesperson said an emailed threat claimed that bombs had been planted in the homes of Springfield’s mayor and other city officials. A second email claimed that bombs had been placed at locations including Springfield City Hall, a high school, a middle school, two elementary schools and the local office of the state motor vehicles bureau. The buildings were evacuated, and authorities with explosive-detection dogs swept and cleared them, officials said. On Friday, President Joe Biden said the Haitian community is “under attack” right now, and called for an end to Republicans’ comments.

While he stated the “real threat” of immigration is happening at the Southern border, he said, \"The people of Ohio are scared.” In a post on X on Friday Vance stated, without evidence, that Springfield has experienced “a massive rise in communicable diseases, rent prices, car insurance rates, and crime.” “Don’t let biased media shame you into not discussing this slow-moving humanitarian crisis in a small Ohio town,” he said. Trump and his supporters have used the furor over migrants in the Ohio community to draw further attention to Trump's signature campaign issue of immigration reform and blame Harris for an influx of migrants into the U.S. It's a theme that Trump has used throughout his bids for public office.

Vance amplified the posts from his own X account. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country,\" Vance posted Monday on X. “Where is our border czar?” Vance asked, referring to a label that some used to reference Harris, whom Biden tapped to deal with some issues related to immigration in 2021. In a later post, Vance said his office “has received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants,” adding, “It’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” Springfield has seen its Haitian population grow in recent years. It’s impossible to give an exact number, according to the city, but it estimates that Springfield’s entire county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000. The city also says that Haitian immigrants are in the country legally under a federal program that allows them to remain in the country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe for them to return. Haiti’s government has extended a state of emergency to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.

Trump repeated the claim during Tuesday's debate. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said Tuesday. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame.” Debate moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not true. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine — whose family operates a charity in Haiti in honor of their late daughter, Becky, who died in a car accident — said this week he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield. DeWine said the Haitians who have moved to Ohio are generally hard-working people who love their families and who are seeking to escape the violence in their home country for good jobs in the state. On Wednesday, DeWine said that he believed the Springfield mayor’s assessment that the claims were unfounded, telling CBS News that the internet “can be quite crazy sometimes.” There have been other responses, including from the father of an 11-year-old Ohio boy killed last year when a Haitian immigrant driver hit a school bus. At a Springfield City Council hearing on Tuesday, Nathan Clark implored Trump and other politicians to stop invoking his son’s name in the immigration debate. Democrats have addressed the situation, with the Democratic National Committee pushing out a fundraising email on Wednesday with the subject line, “Chaos, cats, and conspiracy.”","summary":"Donald Trump and his running mate on Friday continued to disparage Haitian migrants in an Ohio community, further fueling false claims.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/trump-and-vance-are-still-stoking-fears-of-haitian-migrants-as-ohio-community-faces-bomb-threats/6862acfe-b7f6-4303-9a45-ee0e2bc44fad","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/sJDtSlD80-8YtiZwPyH7QFa-drs=/698x2:4277x2014/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F697f4734-3e9e-4d02-9c14-15bfe52d1d5b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:18:43","author":"9News,Associated Press","authors":["9News","Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.284},{"id":256376444,"title":"Trump loses 'Electric Avenue' lawsuit as judge finds he has zero defense for tweeting the song","text":"A federal judge in Manhattan has found former president Donald Trump liable for damages in a hotly-contested copyright battle over Eddy Grant's '80s dance hit \"Electric Avenue.\"In a 30-page decision, the judge on Friday delivered a one-two blow that essentially ends the case pretrial, with nothing now left to determine but damages.In the first legal blow, the judge found that the song was properly copyrighted. And in the second blow, the judge threw out the only defense offered in the case: a claim that Trump had made \"fair use\" of the song.\"It's everything we asked for,\" Grant attorney Brett Van Benthysen told Business Insider. \"One-hundred percent.\"Grant, a UK citizen who lives in Barbados, has been told of the decision, said another of his lawyers, Brian Caplan.\"Mr. Grant believes that the ruling will help other artists and owners of copyrights defend against similar infringement,\" Caplan said.\"This is a complete victory for Plaintiffs as to liability. Plaintiffs will be seeking attorney's fees in the subsequent damages phase,\" he added.It remained unclear Friday night if the parties would agree to damages among themselves, or go to trial and let a jury pick a number.\"There will either be a trial just on damages, assumedly before a jury, or we could agree to a number without a trial,\" Van Benthysen said.Grant's lawsuit demanded that Trump pay him $300,000, though that could rise if the former president must also pay the thousands of dollars in legal fees the artist has spent during four years of litigation.Both Eddy Grant and Trump were forced by subpoena to give dueling depositions in the case, and former Trump adviser Dan Scavino was also deposed.Grant had sued Trump in 2020, over a campaign tweet — a crudely-drawn, 55-second animation that showed then-presidential candidate Joe Biden feebly puttering along a railroad track in a push cart while a high-speed \"Trump-Pence\" train zoomed past.About 40 seconds of \"Electric Avenue\" plays as part of the soundtrack.In summarizing the history of the case in his decision, US District Judge John G. Koeltl revealed that it was Scavino — Trump's director of social media and deputy chief of staff for communications at the time — who uploaded the video to Trump's personal Twitter account on August 12, 2020.\"Scavino testified that he saw the video on a Trump supporter's social media page either on the same day or the day before he posted the tweet,\" the judge wrote Friday.\"Scavino also testified that he spoke with former President Trump before posting the tweet and that former President Trump 'let [him] go with [his] instinct on it and post it,'\" the judge wrote.The video was viewed more than 13.7 million times, was liked more than 350,000 times, and was retweeted more than 139,000 times, the judge wrote.Grant's lawyers immediately sent Trump's lawyers a cease and desist letter, but it wasn't until Grant sued on September 1, 2020 that the video was taken down.In rejecting Trump's claim that Grant had never properly secured a copyright for the Electric Avenue sound recording, the judge said it was enough that Grant held the copyright for a compilation record that included the song.Decisions in multiple prior legal cases support that finding, the judge said. Trump, meanwhile, was unable to cite a single supporting case, the judge said.And in rejecting Trump's claim that the animation was a \"fair use\" of the song, the judge went methodically in his decision through the four-factor standard for fair-use exemptions to copyright.The first factor looks at how the copyrighted work was used. In Trump's case, Electric Avenue was used for a commercial purpose, not for an allowable non-profit, research, or educational purpose, the judge wrote.The second factor looks at whether the copyrighted work was \"creative\" or \"factual.\" \"It is clear that \"Electric Avenue is a creative work and therefore is closer to the core of copyright protection,\" the judge wrote.The third factor weighs how much of the copyrighted work was taken for an unauthorized use. Here the judge found that \"the song plays for the majority of the animation; the excerpt is of central importance.\"The final factor asks \"whether, if the challenged use becomes widespread, it will adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work,\" the judge wrote.\"In this case, there is no public benefit as a result of the defendants' use of 'Electric Avenue'\" the judge wrote.\"As the plaintiffs correctly argue, the defendants 'could have used any song, created a new song, or used no song at all, to convey the same political message in the Infringing video.'\"But the damage to Grant could be significant if the copyright to his songs was not strictly enforced, the judge noted.\"Widespread, uncompensated use of Grant's music in promotional videos — political or otherwise — would embolden would-be infringers and undermine Grant's ability to obtain compensation in exchange for licensing his music,\" the judge wrote.An attorney for Trump did not immediately return a request for comment.","summary":"A federal judge in Manhattan found Trump liable in the \"Electric Avenue\" copyright case, saying he offered no real defense for using the song.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-loses-electric-avenue-copyright-lawsuit-2024-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/66db794e1d8d2deb96ba34cd?width=1136&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:16:33","author":"Laura Italiano","authors":["Laura Italiano"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":256376318,"title":"Trump Promises Mass Deportations Will Begin in Springfield and Aurora","text":"Former president Donald Trump promised his mass deportation plan would begin in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado—two cities at the center of anti-immigration talk this week.Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles, the Republican nominee in the 2024 election repeated claims of a Venezuelan gang takeover of Aurora, as well as unfounded accusations that Haitian migrants in Springfield have been eating residents' pets.\"We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country,\" Trump said Friday afternoon. \"And we're going to start with Springfield and Aurora.\"Trump has promised mass deportations as part of his election campaign for months, promising to bring in the army and local law enforcement to remove millions of illegal immigrants.At Friday's press conference, Trump promised to send them \"back to Venezuela\", after saying he would begin in Springfield where much of the migrant population is from Haiti.\"The people of Ohio are scared,\" Trump said Friday. \"The people of Colorado... you have a Governor there who is very weak, he doesn't know what to do.\"Trump and his running mate JD Vance have pushed the idea that Haitians in the Ohio city have been eating and stealing pets and livestock, squatting and spreading communicable diseases.Local officials and community leaders have sought to dispel these claims, but tensions have run high and bomb threats were made on Thursday and Friday, leading to the closures of schools and municipal buildings.Many of those who have moved to Springfield are there legally under Temporary Protected Status for Haitian migrants.In Aurora, Colorado, apartment complexes did see problems with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, with members of the notorious group moving in and causing issues for Venezuelan residents and others.The city's mayor, Mike Coffman, told Newsweek last Friday that the story had gotten out of hand and that the gang was not in charge of apartment buildings.

Environmentalists had successfully sued when protections for wolves were lifted in former President Donald Trump’s final days in office. Friday’s filing with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals was President Joe Biden administration’s first explicit step to revive that rule. Protections will remain in place pending the court’s decision. The court filing follows years of political acrimony as wolves have repopulated some areas of the western U.S., periodically attacking livestock and eating deer, elk and other big game. Environmental groups want that expansion to continue since wolves still occupy only a fraction of their historic range. Attempts to lift or reduce protections for wolves date to the administration of President George W. Bush more than two decades ago. They once roamed most of North America but were widely decimated by the mid-1900s in government-sponsored trapping and poisoning campaigns. Gray wolves were granted federal protections in 1974. Each time the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declares them recovered, the agency is challenged in court. Wolves in different parts of the U.S. lost and regained protections multiple times in recent years. Congress circumvented the courts in 2011 and stripped federal safeguards in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains. Thousands of wolves have since been killed in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Lawmakers have continued to press for state control in the western Great Lakes region. When those states gained jurisdiction over wolves briefly under the Trump rule, trappers and hunters using hounds blew past harvest goals in Wisconsin and killed almost twice as many as planned. Michigan and Minnesota have previously held hunts but not in recent years. Wolves are present but no public hunting is allowed in states including Washington, Oregon, California and Colorado. They’ve never been protected in Alaska, where tens of thousands of the animals roam. The Biden administration last year rejected requests from conservation groups to restore protections for gray wolves across the northern Rockies. That decision, too, has been challenged. State lawmakers in that region, which includes Yellowstone National Park and vast areas of wilderness, are intent on culling more wolf packs. But federal officials determined the predators were not in danger of being wiped out entirely under the states’ loosened hunting rules. The U.S. also is home to small, struggling populations of red wolves in the mid-Atlantic region and Mexican wolves in the Southwest. Those populations are both protected as endangered.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Biden administration on Friday asked an appeals court to revive a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden administration moves to remove safeguards for gray wolves first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/biden-administration-moves-to-remove-safeguards-for-gray-wolves/","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/2DGHXZI75JEYPIPK3GWHXPNCVE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:08:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":256377132,"title":"Scorned Wife: MAGA Rep, 59, Had Affair With 32-Year-Old","text":"Tennessee Rep.

The New York Post reported Camie alleged that the impetus for his filing was the congressman’s “affair with a 32-year-old woman.” “I have offered reconciliation, and he wants nothing of it and has insisted on a divorce,” Camie reportedly wrote in texts. The Post reported that Camie also forwarded her allegations in an email to Capitol Hill lawmakers. “I am being quite open about this as 1) I cherish the prayer of any who are willing and 2) I want to make others aware of how readily available ‘predators’ are for our husbands,” Camie allegedly wrote. Camie went on to attack lawmakers for how they “become intoxicated with power and adoration.” Such is what caused Green to push “God out of his life, me out of his life,” she alleged, adding that he “developed friendships with other congressmen and women having affairs and getting divorces, drinking, parties, all while hosting a weekly Bible study in the basement of our home.” “I am still praying for him... but my hope is dwindling. He is no longer wearing his wedding band and his will is dug in,” she added. “If my story can prevent this tragedy from happening to someone else, I will tell it.” Green responded to the news in a statement released Friday acknowledging a “difficult time for my family and me,” reported the Daily Mail. “We are currently going through divorce proceedings,” said Green. “As this is a deeply private matter, I ask for privacy. I will continue to serve this district with all I’ve got, as I have the last five and a half years.” In her letter, Camie further claimed that Green’s affair was with a political reporter—and named the journalist’s employers. However, a cease-and-desist letter from the news outlet’s counsel reportedly rebuked those claims as “false and per se defamatory.” “Your message has not only caused this reporter considerable emotional distress, it has harmed her professional reputation,” wrote content counsel Brian Westley, as reported by the Post. “We therefore insist that you immediately set the record straight.” (Camie later did so in a statement to POLITICO, saying she wanted to ”correct the record” and regretted her error. The woman with whom Green cheated also spoke with POLITICO, anonymously, describing their relationship as “on-again-off-again.”) Green cited “irreconcilable differences” in his divorce filing. After announcing plans to retire this year, he reversed course after Republicans, including former president Donald Trump, encouraged him to stay in Congress.","summary":"Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesTennessee Rep.

The Prime Minister described his discussions with Mr Biden as “long and productive”, but would not be drawn on what the pair had decided regarding Ukraine’s potential use of Western weaponry against Russian targets. At the beginning of their meeting in the Blue Room at the White House in Washington DC on Friday, Mr Biden said “I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin” when asked about the Russian President’s threat of war with Nato. Questioned on what they had decided in relation to Ukraine’s potential use of long-range missiles, Sir Keir told reporters: “We had a wide-ranging discussion about strategy in Ukraine, of course, in the Middle East and other parts of the world. “This wasn’t a meeting about a particular capability. That wasn’t why we got our heads down today. “It was to allow ourselves the space, which we took, the time, which we took, to have a strategic discussion so that tactical decisions could be seen within the wider strategy. “It was a really good invitation from the President, we’ve had a very productive (meeting) and we’ve come to a strong position. I’m very pleased that we’ve had these discussions.” At the beginning of their talks, Sir Keir said the next weeks and months will be “crucial” in Ukraine and said it was “important” the two countries continued to support the eastern European nation in its fight against Russia. The meeting comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed his frustration at the continued restrictions on the use of Western weaponry against Russian targets. In a lengthy statement posted on X, Mr Zelensky said after meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy and his US counterpart Antony Blinken earlier this week, “there should be no unanswered questions about why Ukraine needs sufficient long-range capabilities”. At the White House on Friday, Sir Keir told the US President: “Historically, we’ve shown the strength of our relationship. “We are strategically aligned and we have a common cause on these global issues.” The PM denied that the need to weaken Mr Putin within months was because of the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in November’s presidential election. Questioned on whether Mr Trump’s potential victory was a factor, he told reporters: “No, I think if you look at both the Ukrainian situation and the Middle East, it is obvious that in the coming weeks and months there are really important potential developments, whatever timetables are going on in other countries. “And that’s why I wanted to have this opportunity to talk directly to the President … about those decisions in the next few months, but to make sure that those decisions were, as it were, pitched in the wider strategic thinking that we share in relation to Ukraine, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific.” Sir Keir said the quickest way to resolve the conflict in Ukraine “lies through what Putin actually does”. He said: “There’s only one reason we’re having these discussions, and that is Putin has illegally invaded Ukraine, and the quickest way to resolve this obviously lies through what Putin actually does, because it’s for him to end this.” Mr Lammy and Mr Blinken were pressed on the use of Western weaponry during their visit to Ukraine earlier this week, but said they had to report back to their bosses, the Prime Minister and US President. Mr Putin said allowing long-range strikes “would mean that Nato countries, the United States, and European countries are at war with Russia … if this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions based on the threats that will be created for us”. Asked what he thought of Mr Putin’s threat of war, Mr Biden said: “I don’t think much about Vladimir Putin.” Mr Biden thanked Sir Keir for his “leadership” during the Ukraine conflict, adding: “Putin will not prevail in this war”. He said: “The United States is committed to standing with you to help Ukraine as it defends against Russia’s onslaught of aggression. “It’s clear that Putin will not prevail in this war. The people of Ukraine will prevail.” The US President said the two leaders would talk about Ukraine, the need for a hostage and ceasefire deal in the Middle East, and about the Indo-Pacific region. He told the PM: “I’ve often said there’s no issue of global consequence where the United States and UK can’t work together and haven’t worked yet.” Before the meeting began, a British reporter was told to “be quiet while I speak” by the US President as Mr Biden was asked about Mr Putin’s threat of war. Concern about escalation has been one of the reasons why permission has not yet been given to Kyiv for the unrestricted use of Western weapons. Iran has been hit with sanctions by the UK and US after the two countries formally accused Tehran of supplying ballistic missiles to Russia. Mr Lammy and Mr Blinken announced further financial support for Ukraine, including a £600 million package from the UK and 717 million dollars (£550 million) from the US to meet immediate humanitarian, energy and stabilisation needs. The UK package includes a reaffirmation of Rishi Sunak’s pledge of £242 million, as well as 484 million dollars (£371 million) worth of loan guarantees for World Bank lending before the end of the year, while the US package includes 325 million dollars (£250 million) to support Ukraine’s energy needs. The PM and Mr Biden’s first White House bilateral took place as the Sir Keir attended the Nato summit just days after Labour won the election.","summary":"The Prime Minister met with US President Joe Biden in Washington.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/ukraine-joe-biden-keir-starmer-prime-minister-middle-east-b1182028.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/09/14/00/d2637340b75597886adb90d0c965ebf7Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzI2MzU0OTY4-2.77450588.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 23:06:08","author":"Josh Payne","authors":["Josh Payne"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":256377410,"title":"Joe Biden ordered to show China 'US is in control' with Donald Trump tactic","text":"403 ERROR The request could not be satisfied.

John Higham Mountain View Advertising methodology can’t sell Harris’ run Re: “Harris turns to favorite foods in effort to show a more private side and connect with voters“(Page A4, Sep.9). Back in the last century, I thought Joe Namath was a great football player, but I couldn’t care less what brand of toothpaste he used. Now Democrats exploit popular advertising methodology on Harris’ behalf as she conflates food with politics. Harris is very successful at diverting attention from issues of her predecessor’s administration into a debate on character. Did McDonald’s and Doritos get money or have to pay to help endow her with character? Her sharing of her collard greens recipe might backfire. It exacerbates my contempt of popular democracy as Harris stakes election chances on popular opinion, otherwise known as collective stupidity. Fred Gutmann Cupertino Standing up to Trump will benefit nation Donald Trump’s poor debate performance against Kamala Harris was illuminating. As a malignant narcissist and abuser, Trump expects to have his ego inflated and receive praise for mediocrity while being protected from the consequences of his own actions. The threats for not feeding his ego are both express and implied, such that our elections are under constant threat if they do not placate him. Those who enable him and minimize his failings represent millions of voters and far too many journalists and politicians who are conditioned to kowtow to narcissists and abusers, against all our best interests. Whether these people be presidents, CEOs, members of Congress or middle managers, America would be far healthier if it stood up to them instead of appeasing them. Voting for Harris and a Democratic Congress would be a big step in the right direction. Mathew Clark Campbell Swift endorsement came with civics lesson This election will be so close that a small number of votes might determine the winner. So every vote is crucial. At 82, I am not a devotee of Taylor Swift, although I admire her popularity and her ability to influence her fans. But I was quite impressed by her Instagram statement endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Why? Because her endorsement was accompanied by a model lesson in civic responsibility. She emphasized not only the importance of voting but also explained the need to register in order to vote. Her post redirected her followers to vote.gov, the official U.S. voter registration website. Harris is having a difficult time with younger voters. Perhaps Swift’s endorsement can influence some of her followers who might not have planned to vote. And even if that reaches just a few prospective Swifties, it might be just enough to affect the outcome. Thank you, Taylor.

JD Vance outlined a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine. But objectively, it sounds a lot like Vladimir Putin’s. Vance’s critics immediately said he had described a Russian victory, while his supporters said he had offered the only realistic path to peace. In an interview with “The Shawn Ryan Show” that was posted Thursday, Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, was asked about former President Donald Trump’s plans to end the war. Vance said Trump would sit down with Russians, Ukrainians and Europeans and say, “You guys need to figure out what a peaceful settlement looks like.” He went on to outline what he thinks a deal would entail: The Russians would retain the land they have taken and a demilitarized zone would be established along the current battle lines, with the Ukrainian side heavily fortified to prevent another Russian invasion. While the rest of Ukraine would remain an independent sovereign state, Vance said, Russia would get a “guarantee of neutrality” from Ukraine. “It doesn’t join NATO, it doesn’t join some of these sort of allied institutions,” Vance said. “I think that’s ultimately what this looks like.” Victoria J. Nuland, a former senior State Department official who helped shape the Biden administration’s Ukraine policy, said Vance’s plan was very similar to what Putin had repeatedly offered as peace terms. “This is essentially the proposal put forward in February,” she said. “And why? Because it is a great gift to him.” The Kremlin’s terms for ending the war have focused on Russia keeping the territory it has captured and forcing Ukraine to become neutral, meaning it would not join NATO. Biden administration officials have long insisted those demands amount to capitulation, not negotiation. Nuland questioned who would enforce a demilitarized zone, given that there was little appetite for a large international peacekeeping force. Absent that or other robust security guarantees, Putin would simply bide his time and then restart the war, she said. “Putin will just wait, rest, refit and come for the rest,” Nuland said. Another problem with Vance’s vision is that it ignores the will of the Ukrainians, who insist they want to keep fighting to regain their lost territory, said Luke Coffey, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. “I don’t think he offered a realistic proposal for peace,” Coffey said. “He offered a plan for a Russian victory.” Vance’s plan has worried Ukrainians. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chair of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, called the proposal “election rhetoric which will hardly stand the test of political reality.” He said what was “conspicuously absent” from Vance’s description of Trump’s peace plan was “the issue of reliable security guarantees for Ukraine.” But Elbridge A. Colby, who was a Pentagon official during the Trump administration, said Vance’s plan was based on a realistic assessment of the current status of the war, which began in February 2022. Colby said Russia was continuing to make significant progress in eastern Ukraine and counterattacking in Kursk, a Russian city that the Ukrainian military has occupied since last month. Wars usually end roughly along the line of contact between two opposing armies. And he said there was no plausible basis for thinking Ukraine would gain the upper hand. Colby said Vance’s statement ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine was the right policy choice, and that an expansion of the alliance farther east was not in U.S. security interests. But he said Vance’s comments do not rule out economic and social ties with Europe, or even other security contributions. “Sen. Vance is being realistic and putting out forthrightly a realistic basis for ending the conflict,” he said, “while other people are engaged in a kind of irresponsible fantasy.” Of course, it is not entirely clear that Vance was speaking for Trump. At times, Trump has embraced Vance’s policy positions and other times pushed back on them. Coffey said that during his presidency, Trump showed that he often ignores advice from top officials, and there is no guarantee that Vance’s plan will be adopted. Still, he added, the two men appear in alignment. “Listening to what Trump has said, and listening to what Vance has said, I would say Vance is probably in the ballpark,” Coffey said. “But what matters at the end of the day is what Trump does or does not want to do.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times. © 2024 The New York Times Company","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Sen.

Lee recently posted on Facebook about a neighbor’s cat that went missing, adding that the neighbor told Lee she thought the cat was the victim of an attack by her Haitian neighbors. Newsguard, a media watchdog that monitors for misinformation online, found that Lee had been among the first people to publish a post to social media about the rumor, screenshots of which circulated online. The neighbor, Kimberly Newton, said she heard about the attack from a third party, NewsGuard reported. Newton told Newsguard that Lee’s Facebook post misstated her story, and that the owner of the missing cat was “an acquaintance of a friend” rather than her daughter’s friend. Newton could not be reached for comment. Lee said she had no idea the post would become part of a rumor mill that would spiral into the national consciousness. She has since deleted the Facebook post. Other posts have also contributed to the false allegations, including a photo of a man holding a dead goose that was taken in Columbus, Ohio, but was spread by some online as evidence of the claims about Springfield. Graphic video of a woman who allegedly killed and tried to eat a cat was also found not to have originated in Springfield but in Canton, Ohio, and does not have any connection to the Haitian community. Local police and city officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of such crimes in Springfield, but that hasn’t stopped the lies from spreading across the country and igniting a national frenzy that landed on the presidential debate stage this week. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who was born less than an hour away from Springfield, have repeated the baseless allegations. Lee said she never imagined her post would become fodder for conspiracy theories and hate, she said. “I’m not a racist,” she said through heavy emotion, adding that her daughter is half Black and she herself is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community. “Everybody seems to be turning it into that, and that was not my intent.” The anti-immigrant fervor in Springfield led to school and municipal building closures on Thursday and Friday after city officials received bomb threats. Lee said she pulled her daughter out of school and is now worried about her safety with so much attention on her family. She is also concerned for the safety of the Haitian community, which she said she did not intend to villainize en masse. “I feel for the Haitian community,” she said. “If I was in the Haitians’ position, I’d be terrified, too, worried that somebody’s going to come after me because they think I’m hurting something that they love and that, again, that’s not what I was trying to do.” Immigrant advocacy groups have said these kinds of claims can be dangerous. “The Haitian-American community in Springfield, OH and around the country is feeling targeted and unsafe because dehumanizing, debunked and racist conspiracies are being advanced at the highest levels of American politics and are still being repeated,” Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration refor said in an email. “The false claim that Black immigrants are violently attacking American families by stealing and eating their pets is a powerful and old racist trope that puts a target on people’s backs, and it is turbo-charged in the era of MAGA when political violence has become commonplace and we have already witnessed violent incidents incited by such rhetoric.” Lee said that there are very real problems related to Springfield’s population boom that caught the struggling city off guard. Springfield was not prepared to address the housing, health care and other service needs that came with the sudden increase of new residents over the last five years when Haitians arrived, many of them with protected status under federal law. Still, she never imagined that her Facebook post would set off a national news cycle. “I didn’t think it would ever get past Springfield,” she said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSPRINGFIELD, Ohio — The woman behind an early Facebook post spreading a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A woman from Springfield clarifies she did not intend to start rumors about Haitians first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/a-woman-from-springfield-clarifies-she-did-not-intend-to-start-rumors-about-haitians/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240913-springfield-ohio-ch-1650-031a0b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:59:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":256375984,"title":"Violent crime has increased, DOJ report says, after David Muir disputed Trump’s claim that crime is ‘through the roof’","text":"Violent crime has increased under the Harris-Biden administration, according to data from the Department of Justice published Friday — belying ABC News debate moderator David Muir’s correction of Donald Trump during his showdown with Kamala Harris Tuesday night. The DOJ’s survey from the Bureau of Justice statistics is self-reported instances of violent crime over the last six months — meaning that it includes crimes that may not have been reported to police. The annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed total instances of reported violent crime — including rape, robbery and aggravated assault — is up from 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023. The highest recent rate of violent crime was in 2022, when the survey tracked 9.8 instances per 1,000 people over the age of 12. The rate of rape increased from 1.2 per 1,000 in 2020 to 1.7 in 2023, while robbery went from 1.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 2.6 per 1,000 in 2023, and aggravated assault rose from 2.9 per 1,000 in 2020 to 4.5 per 1,000 in 2023. The question of whether crime has increased in the Harris-Biden administration compared to Trump’s was a major point of contention in Philadelphia Tuesday night, when the 45th president charged that “crime in this country is through the roof.” “President Trump,” Muir stepped in to say, “as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country.” The 2024 quarterly FBI report that Muir was likely referencing does not account for crimes that go unreported to police, but does show that violent crime decreased by 15.2% when comparing the first three months of 2023 to the same period this year. The FBI statistics included murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault under violent crimes — but was far from a complete picture, as only 72% of the law enforcement population participated in the report. Trump took a victory lap on Friday after the report was released, citing the Bureau of Statistics report during a press conference in southern California. “You remember where David Muir tried to correct me that crime is rampant like never before?” Trump told reporters. “I guess [the DOJ] probably watched the debate and they heard this foolish man, this foolish fool make that statement to me,” the 78-year-old added. The NCVS also showed other forms of crime were up from 2019, including stranger violence (8.1 per 1,000 compared to 11.4 per 1,000 in 2023) and violent crime with a weapon (4.0 per 1,000 vs 5.3 per 1,000 in 2023.) Motor car theft has also increased from 3.9 per 1,000 in 2019 to 6.1 per 1,000 in 2023. John Lott, former Justice Department senior adviser for research and statistics, told The Post that there are multiple reasons the discrepancy between the FBI and DOJ numbers. “There’s reasons why you could argue the number of crimes reported to police in the FBI data has gone down,” Lott said, pointing out that the number of law enforcement officers in cities like New York has “plummeted” over the past few years. He added that the NCVS was set up decades ago to account for crimes that don’t get reported to the police. “About 40% of violent crimes are reported to the police and about 30% of property crime are reported to police,” Lott went on, adding that the controversy boils down to a question of whether people care merely about reported crime, or “total crime.” “My guess is people care more about total crime,” he said. Friday afternoon, Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called on Muir, the anchor of ABC’s “World News Tonight” to “issue an immediate public apology to President Trump for wrongly and rudely fact checking him on the debate stage.” “This new data proves President Trump was right,” Leavitt added. “Violent crime is up and if Kamala is given another four years to implement her weak-on-crime, defund the police, no cash bail policies — America will continue to turn into a crime-ridden hellhole for illegal immigrants, Venezuelan gangsters, and drug dealers. ONLY President Trump will restore law and order. If Americans want to be safe, VOTE TRUMP.” ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post.","summary":"The annual National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) showed total instances of reported violent crime -- including rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- is up from 5.6 per 1,000 in 2020 to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/us-news/violent-crime-has-increased-doj-report-says-after-david-muir-disputed-trumps-claim-that-crime-is-through-the-roof/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89611512.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/2oOzfVRr-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:59:29","author":"Diana Glebova","authors":["Diana Glebova"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":256376178,"title":"Who is Laura Loomer?

Laura Loomer, 31, a right-wing theorist and social media influencer, flew with the Republican nominee in his private jet to Tuesday night’s debate where he repeated a baseless claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ‘They’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats,’ Trump said in his showdown with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. ‘They’re eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what’s happening in our country, and it’s a shame.’ Trump reinforced his belief in the claim even when a moderator told him it had been debunked, saying he saw it ‘on television’. Who influenced Trump’s eating dogs and cats remark? The rumor had been circulating right-wing channels on the Internet, but many have suspected that Loomer, who had been posting about it, directly inspired Trump to utter it during the critical debate. Loomer on the day before the debate had aired the eating pets claim on X (formerly Twitter), where she has 1.2million followers. ‘Disturbing reports came out this weekend about Haitian immigrants eating people’s pets in Ohio where Democrats like @SenSherrodBrown and the Biden-Harris regime imported over 20,000 cannibalistic Haitians who are now killing people’s pets and hunting domestic animals on the streets of Ohio,’ she posted on Monday. https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1833137398093431131 ‘Vote for @berniemoreno. Bernie will help secure our border and he won’t allow Haitian invaders to eat your dogs and cats for dinner.’ A source close to the Trump campaign expressed ‘100%’ concern around Loomer’s closeness to Trump to the news outlet Semafor ‘Regardless of any guardrails the Trump campaign has put on her, I don’t think it’s working,’ said the source, but also added that Loomer did not participate in his debate preparations and that she was a ‘positive person to be around’. Who is Laura Loomer? Loomer, born in Arizona, describes herself as an ‘Investigative Journalist’ and ‘Feisty Jewess’ on her X profile. She has worked as a commentator for the far-right activist group Project Veritas, and for Alex Jones’ far-right conspiracy theory and fake news site, Infowars. Loomer ran unsuccessfully as a Florida congressional candidate twice – for House districts in Palm Beach County in 2020 with Trump’s backing, and in Central Florida in 2022. Besides flying with Trump the debate that many said he lost, Loomer accompanied him to an event the day after commemorating the 9/11 attacks. Loomer has also attended numerous events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. What has Trump said about Loomer? Trump addressed Loomer on Friday amid rising backlash against her from his base. ‘I don’t know. Laura is a supporter. She’s a strong person,’ he said during a press conference in California. ‘I don’t control Laura. I can’t tell Laura what to do.’ Trump distanced himself from Loomer a day after doubling down on the eating pets claim and dragging yet another animal into the mix. ‘They’re taking the geese. You know where the geese are? In the park, in the lake,’ he said during a rally in Tucson, Arizona. ‘And even walking away with their pets. “My dog’s been taken.”‘ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

Earlier this week, McFarland took to the Today Show to “announce” the new dates for Fyre Fest II, which he now says will take place April 25-28 on “a private island off the Caribbean coast of Mexico.” By most counts, however, this is the third or fourth version of a sequel to the event McFarland has broadcast to his followers. McFarland has been hyping up a follow-up to the disastrous 2017 Bahamas festival since he went to prison in late 2018, changing the date for his redemption-style event several times while carefully removing or updating past references to Fyre II each time he updates his social media sites. According to court documents, McFarland has been writing up a plan for the event — first called PYRT festival — since he was incarcerated at Elkton Federal Correctional Institute in Ohio on charges of fraud and lying to the FBI. McFarland immediately begin hawking the event on TikTok when he got out of prison in mid-2022 with a scavenger hunt. McFarland had fans looking through empty bottles by late November of that year for free tickets to an event he’d eventually rebrand as Fyre Fest II in August of 2023, where he claimed to have placed 100 tickets on sale for $499 a pop and immediately sold out of them, which would have generated nearly $50,000 in revenue. The date for that event was scheduled for late 2024 and at one point McFarland bragged there were more people signing up for his event than buying tickets for Coachella. Besides the first 100 tickets allegedly sold to Fyre II, fans have only been able to “sign up” for tickets to the sequel event, clicking through a form-style website where they are encouraged to apply for the opportunity to buy tickets to Fyre Festival II, with prices ranging from $1,400 to $1.1 million. At this point, fans can’t buy tickets for the event — they can only apply to attend. McFarland detailed the venture to both the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, saying that he hopes to gather about 3,000 people for the event and also promises “an incredible production company who’s handling everything from soup to nuts” for the fest. “We have the chance to embrace this storm and really steer our ship into all the chaos that has happened, and if it’s done well, I think Fyre has a chance to be this annual festival that really takes over the festival industry,” McFarland told NBC. McFarland has not avoided legal trouble since leaving prison. Last year he was served a civil summons, which claimed he ripped off an investor who gave him $740,000 for his new venture. An attorney for 54-year-old Jonathan Taylor of New York — who met McFarland while both were serving prison sentences at Elkton — said Taylor struck an agreement with McFarland and his business partner, Michael Falb (also named as a defendant), in which they allegedly offered him one-third equity in the venture, PYRT Technologies, in exchange for a $740,000 investment. Taylor claims McFarland and Falb then reneged on the deal by refusing to grant him the equity they promised or to return the money despite his demands that they do so. A judge later ruled that Taylor needed to refile the lawsuit to push the case forward. McFarland has managed to stay busy with other ventures since leaving prison. In May, McFarland won a heavily hyped martial arts fight against a social media influencer, defeating the heavily favored crypto YouTuber Justin “Jchains” Custardo via TKO during the main event of Karate Combat’s Influencer Fight Club series at the Consensus conference in Austin, Texas. McFarland has also launched the PYRT marketing agency and been heavily involved in the promotion of the song “ONBOA47RD,” a pro-Donald Trump rap song from Fivio Foreign and Kodak Black.","summary":"After several false starts, the high-profile ex-con said his redemption event is set for April 25-28 off the coast of Mexico.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/pro/fyre-fest-ii-scheduled-next-spring-says-billy-mcfarland/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Billy-McFarland-2018-ap-c-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:59:16","author":"Dave Brooks","authors":["Dave Brooks"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":256377510,"title":"The Biden administration is taking steps to eliminate protections for gray wolves","text":"By MATTHEW BROWN BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — The Biden administration on Friday asked an appeals court to revive a Trump-era rule that lifted remaining Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves in the U.S. If successful, the move would put the predators under state oversight nationwide and open the door for hunting to resume in the Great Lakes region after it was halted two years ago under court order. Environmentalists had successfully sued when protections for wolves were lifted in former President Donald Trump’s final days in office. Friday’s filing with the 9th U.S. District Court of Appeals was President Joe Biden administration’s first explicit step to revive that rule. Protections will remain in place pending the court’s decision. The court filing follows years of political acrimony as wolves have repopulated some areas of the western U.S., sometimes attacking livestock and eating deer, elk and other big game. Environmental groups want that expansion to continue since wolves still occupy only a fraction of their historic range. Attempts to lift or reduce protections for wolves date to the first term of former President George W. Bush more than two decades ago and have continued with each subsequent administration. They once roamed most of North America but were widely decimated by the mid-1900s in government-sponsored trapping and poisoning campaigns. Gray wolves were granted federal protections in 1974. Each time the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declares them recovered, the agency is challenged in court. Wolves in different parts of the U.S. lost and regained protections multiple times in recent years. “The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is focused on a concept of recovery that allows wolves to thrive on the landscape while respecting those who work and live in places that support them,” agency spokesperson Vanessa Kauffman said. The administration is on the same side in the case as livestock and hunting groups, the National Rifle Association and Republican-led Utah. It’s opposed by the Sierra Club, Center for Biological Diversity, Humane Society of the United States and other groups. “While wolves are protected, they do very well, and when they lose protections, that recovery backslides,” said Collette Adkins with the Center for Biological Recovery. “We won for good reason at the district court.” She said she was “saddened” officials were trying to reinstate the Trump administration’s rule. Efforts to restore wolves to date have been limited to a handful of regions. Federal officials last year agreed to develop a first-ever national recovery plan, by December 2025, under a settlement in a separate lawsuit. Kauffman declined to say whether that national plan would still be pursued if the government prevails in the 9th Circuit case. But attorneys suggested in Friday’s court filing that the government is ready to move on from gray wolf recovery, now that the species is no longer in danger of extinction. “The ESA (Endangered Species Act) is clear: its goal is to prevent extinction, not to restore species to their pre-western settlement numbers and range,” U.S. Department of Justice attorneys wrote. Congress circumvented the courts in 2011 and stripped federal safeguards in the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains. Thousands of wolves have since been killed in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Lawmakers have continued to press for state control in the western Great Lakes region. When those states gained jurisdiction over wolves briefly under the Trump rule, trappers and hunters using hounds blew past harvest goals in Wisconsin and killed almost twice as many as planned. Michigan and Minnesota have previously held hunts but not in recent years. Wolves are present but no public hunting is allowed in states including Washington, Oregon, California and Colorado. They’ve never been protected in Alaska, where tens of thousands of the animals live. The Biden administration last year rejected requests from conservation groups to restore protections for gray wolves across the northern Rockies. That decision, too, has been challenged. State lawmakers in that region, which includes Yellowstone National Park and vast areas of wilderness, are intent on culling more wolf packs. But federal officials determined the predators were not in danger of being wiped out entirely under the states’ loosened hunting rules. The U.S. also is home to small, struggling populations of red wolves in the mid-Atlantic region and Mexican wolves in the Southwest. Those populations are both protected as endangered.","summary":"If successful, the move would put the predators under state oversight nationwide and open the door for hunting to resume in the Great Lakes region after it was halted two years ago under court order.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/09/13/the-biden-administration-is-taking-steps-to-eliminate-protections-for-gray-wolves/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gray_Wolves-Endangered_12805.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:56:02","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":256375846,"title":"FACT FOCUS: A look at false claims made by Trump in California","text":"By MELISSA GOLDIN In a press conference from his Los Angeles-area golf club, former President Donald Trump revisited several topics from Tuesday night’s debate, repeating several false and misleading claims on issues including crime, the economy and immigration. Here’s are the facts: Trump again falsely claims crime skyrocketed under the Biden administration CLAIM: New numbers show that crime has skyrocketed under the Biden administration. THE FACTS: Violent crime surged during the pandemic, with homicides increasing nearly 30% in 2020 over the previous year — the largest one-year jump since the FBI began keeping records. But FBI data released in June shows that the overall violent crime rate declined 15% in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. One expert has cautioned, however, that those figures are preliminary and may overstate the actual reduction in crime. On Friday, Trump cited numbers he said were from the “bureau of justice statistics” to claim crime was up. This appears to be a reference to the National Crime Victimization Survey recently released by the Justice Department, which shows that the number of times people were victims of violent crime increased by about 40% from 2020 to 2023. The report notes, however, that while the rate of violent victimizations in 2023 was higher than it was in 2020 and 2021, it was not statistically different from the rate in 2019, when Trump was president. That survey aims to capture both crimes reported to police and crimes that are not reported to police and is conducted annually through interviews with about 150,000 households. It doesn’t include murders or crimes against people under the age of 12. No basis for claims that violent crime has spiked as a result of the influx of migrants CLAIM: Thousands of people are being killed by “illegal migrants” in the U.S. THE FACTS: This is not supported by evidence. FBI statistics do not separate crimes by the immigration status of the assailant, nor is there any evidence of a spike in crime perpetrated by migrants, either along the U.S.-Mexico border or in cities seeing the greatest influx of migrants, like New York. In fact, national statistics show violent crime is on the way down. Inflation has not reached record levels CLAIM: Prices have gone up “like no one’s ever seen before.” THE FACTS: That’s not accurate. Inflation did soar in 2021-22, though it rose by much more in 1980 when inflation topped 14%. It peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. Economists largely blame the inflation spike on the pandemic’s disruptions to global supply chains, which reduced the supply of semiconductors, cars and other goods. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also pushed up gas and food prices. And Biden’s stimulus checks and other spending contributed by turbocharging spending coming out of the pandemic. Inflation has now fallen to 2.5%, not far from the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Prices are still about 19% higher than they were before the pandemic, but the Census Bureau reported Tuesday that household incomes have risen by a similar amount, leaving inflation-adjusted incomes at roughly the same level as they were in 2019. Trump raises false claims to suggest voting systems are fraudulent CLAIM: The voting system isn’t honest. Millions and millions of ballots are sent out “all over the place. Some people get two, three, four or five.” THE FACTS: Election officials have procedures in place to ensure that only one mail ballot is issued to each eligible voter. When a voter requests a mail ballot, election officials will verify that person’s eligibility by checking voter registration records — looking to match the voter’s information to what’s on file and, in some cases, checking that the voter’s signature matches as well. When a ballot is sent out by an election office, that ballot is assigned to that specific voter. If someone else tries to use that ballot, the voter’s information will not match the office’s records for that ballot and it will be rejected. Election officials constantly update their voter lists to ensure they are accurate, removing dead people, those who have moved out of state or are not eligible. In some cases, ballots are canceled — if a voter makes a mistake and requests a new ballot or decides to vote in person instead of using a mail ballot. In those cases, the original ballot is marked in such a way that if that original ballot were to show up at the election office it would be flagged and rejected. At one point in his remarks, Trump singled out California, where all voters receive a ballot in the mail. He suggested he would win if votes were counted honestly. He has made this claim before and it is a reach. Just 23% of California voters are registered as Republican while 46% are registered as Democrats. He lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016 in California by 4.2 million votes, and he lost the state to Biden in 2020 by 5.1 million votes. Trump misrepresents a revision of U.S. job numbers CLAIM: A whistleblower forced the government’s recent downward revision of job gains by 818,000. THE FACTS: That’s false. The preliminary revision occurred as part of a normal annual process and was released on a previously disclosed date. Every year the Labor Department issues a revision of the number of jobs added during a 12-month period from April through March in the previous year. The adjustment is made because the government’s initial job counts are based on surveys of businesses. The revision is then based on actual job counts from unemployment insurance files that are compiled later. The revision is compiled by career government employees with little involvement by politically appointed officials. The Biden administration is not secretly flying hundreds of thousands of migrants into the country CLAIM: Harris and the Biden administration are secretly flying in hundreds of thousands of “illegal immigrants.” THE FACTS: Migrants are not secretly being flown into the U.S. by the government. Under a Biden policy in effect since January 2023, up to 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela can enter the country monthly if they apply online with a financial sponsor and arrive at a specified airport, paying their own way. Biden exercised his “parole” authority, which, under a 1952 law, allows him to admit people “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer, Chris Rugaber, Christina Almeida Cassidy and Elliot Spagat contributed to this story.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump revisited several topics from Tuesday night’s debate, repeating several false and misleading claims on issues including crime, the economy and immigration.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/13/fact-focus-a-look-at-false-claims-made-by-trump-in-california/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Election_2024_Trump_35495.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:54:29","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":256378220,"title":"The Late Late Show review: Patrick Kielty’s second season kicks off with serviceable monologue and just one flub","text":"Patrick Kielty recently described The Late Late Show (RTÉ One, Friday, 9.35pm) as uniquely Irish, which might be a polite way of saying that it’s creaky, long past its sell-by date and potentially a bit rubbish – but that some of us would miss it if it were to mysteriously vanish overnight.

But this week, we are watching the real-world effects of that recklessness play out with alarming speed. Consider the timeline. On Monday, Trump’s running mate, J. D. Vance, mentioned on X the claim—for which there is no verifiable evidence—that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, are “abducting” and eating pets. Vance was promoting a racist theory that had been circulating in certain corners of the internet in recent days, a manifestation of the anti-Haitian sentiment that has bubbled up in Springfield after roughly 15,000 Haitian migrants arrived in the town over the past few years. MAGA supporters quickly kicked into action, sharing cat memes referencing the pet-eating theory. On Tuesday, Vance posted on X that his senatorial office in Ohio had “received many inquiries from actual residents of Springfield who’ve said their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.” Vance acknowledged in his post that these rumors may “turn out to be false” but went on to say: “Do you know what’s confirmed? That a child was murdered by a Haitian migrant who had no right to be here.” And he egged on the internet trolls in a subsequent post: “Keep the cat memes flowing.” Vance was referring to an 11-year-old who was killed when a Haitian driver crashed into a school bus last year. (The driver has since been convicted of involuntary manslaughter.) On Tuesday, the boy’s father spoke out against the politicization of his son’s death. “My son, Aiden Clark, was not murdered. He was accidentally killed by an immigrant from Haiti,” Nathan Clark said in remarks before Springfield’s city commission. “I wish that my son, Aiden Clark, was killed by a 60-year-old white man. I bet you never thought anyone would ever say something so blunt, but if that guy killed my 11-year-old son, the incessant group of hate-spewing people would leave us alone.” In 2020, the population of Springfield, Ohio, was nearly 60,000. The town had been losing residents because of declining job opportunities, but a recent manufacturing boom has brought in an influx of immigrants, who are mostly Haitian, as Miriam Jordan of The New York Times has reported. Most of these immigrants are in the U.S. legally; local authorities and employers say that Haitian immigrants have boosted what was once a declining local economy, but such a mass arrival of migrants has also strained government resources. Trump’s decision to bring up Springfield at the debate—in his now-infamous and bizarre “eating the pets” non sequitur—may have been his attempt to redirect attention to immigration, which he sees as a winning topic for his campaign. But it was also a reminder of his penchant for spreading conspiracy theories and his habit of fueling the fire of racism and hate in America. The days that followed revealed how a rambling Trump comment—with the help of Vance and the pair’s social-media faithful—can generate actual threats of violence. Yesterday, Springfield’s mayor, Rob Rue, reported that the city had received multiple bomb threats via email, consisting of “hateful language towards immigrants and Haitians”; the threats prompted the evacuation of Springfield City Hall, two schools, and a local Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles facility. Today, a second wave of threats led to the evacuation of multiple city buildings and two elementary schools. Rue told The New York Times that “it’s frustrating when national politicians, on the national stage, mischaracterize what is actually going on and misrepresent our community.” According to the New York–based The Haitian Times, as well as The New York Times, some Haitian residents in Springfield say they are being intimidated and fear for their safety. Spokespeople for the Trump-Vance campaign have condemned the bomb threats. But Trump has not altered his rhetoric as a result: At a campaign event in Tucson yesterday, Trump repeated the pet-abduction claim, and at a press conference in California this morning, he repeated his promise to deport immigrants from several American cities, including Springfield, en masse. In less than a week, cat memes and absurd posts have escalated into bomb threats and school evacuations. Writing on Tuesday about the MAGA-world cat content, my colleague Ali Breland noted, “This kind of posting almost never stays online. It’s all fun and games, until it isn’t.” The memes don’t stay online, because they’re made and amplified by people who take action in the real world—Donald Trump and J. D. Vance among them.

Lee recently posted on Facebook about a neighbor’s cat that went missing, adding that the neighbor told Lee she thought the cat was the victim of an attack by her Haitian neighbors. Newsguard, a media watchdog that monitors for misinformation online, found that Lee had been among the first people to publish a post to social media about the rumor, screenshots of which circulated online. The neighbor, Kimberly Newton, said she heard about the attack from a third party, NewsGuard reported. Newton told Newsguard that Lee’s Facebook post misstated her story, and that the owner of the missing cat was “an acquaintance of a friend” rather than her daughter’s friend. Newton could not be reached for comment. Lee said she had no idea the post would become part of a rumor mill that would spiral into the national consciousness. She has since deleted the Facebook post. Other posts have also contributed to the false allegations, including a photo of a man holding a dead goose that was taken in Columbus, Ohio, but was spread by some online as evidence of the claims about Springfield. Graphic video of a woman who allegedly killed and tried to eat a cat was also found not to have originated in Springfield but in Canton, Ohio, and does not have any connection to the Haitian community. Local police and city officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of such crimes in Springfield, but that hasn’t stopped the lies from spreading across the country and igniting a national frenzy that landed on the presidential debate stage this week. Former President Donald Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who was born less than an hour away from Springfield, have repeated the baseless allegations. Lee said she never imagined her post would become fodder for conspiracy theories and hate. “I’m not a racist,” she said through heavy emotion, adding that her daughter is half Black and she herself is mixed race and a member of the LGBTQ community. “Everybody seems to be turning it into that, and that was not my intent.” The anti-immigrant fervor in Springfield led to school and municipal building closures on Thursday and Friday after city officials received bomb threats. Lee said she pulled her daughter out of school and is now worried about her safety with so much attention on her family. She is also concerned for the safety of the Haitian community, which she said she did not intend to villainize en masse. “I feel for the Haitian community,” she said. “If I was in the Haitians’ position, I’d be terrified, too, worried that somebody’s going to come after me because they think I’m hurting something that they love and that, again, that’s not what I was trying to do.” Immigrant advocacy groups have said these kinds of claims can be dangerous. “The Haitian-American community in Springfield, OH and around the country is feeling targeted and unsafe because dehumanizing, debunked and racist conspiracies are being advanced at the highest levels of American politics and are still being repeated,” Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America's Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for immigration refor said in an email. “The false claim that Black immigrants are violently attacking American families by stealing and eating their pets is a powerful and old racist trope that puts a target on people’s backs, and it is turbo-charged in the era of MAGA when political violence has become commonplace and we have already witnessed violent incidents incited by such rhetoric.” Lee said that there are very real problems related to Springfield's population boom that caught the struggling city off guard. Springfield was not prepared to address the housing, health care and other service needs that came with the sudden increase of new residents over the last five years when Haitians arrived, many of them with protected status under federal law. Still, she never imagined that her Facebook post would set off a national news cycle. “I didn’t think it would ever get past Springfield,\" she said.","summary":"The woman behind an early Facebook post about Haitian immigrants eating local pets that helped thrust a small Ohio city into the national spotlight says she had no first-hand knowledge of any such incident and is now filled with regret and fear as a result of the ensuing fallout.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/-just-exploded-springfield-woman-says-never-meant-spark-rumors-haitian-rcna171099","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240913-springfield-ohio-ch-1650-031a0b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:48:11","author":"Alicia Victoria Lozano","authors":["Alicia Victoria Lozano"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":256375546,"title":"Trump and Harris' views on China, according to their records and what they've said","text":"Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have accused one another of being weak on China, which is widely viewed as the greatest geopolitical threat and economic rival to the U.S. The Trump campaign has suggested, without citing any evidence, that Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be working for the Chinese. Walz has a long history with the country, dating back to 1989 when he taught English at a Chinese high school. However, he has spent his political career criticizing the Chinese government, especially its human rights record. \"We all know that Kamala Harris wanted to outsource our factories and jobs to China, but I didn't expect her to outsource the selection of her running mate to China, too,\" Trump's vice presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, said during a campaign stop in Asheboro, North Carolina, in August. In September, during their presidential debate, Harris argued that Trump \"sold us out\" to China by \"selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military,\" and she noted her rival's praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping. During the Biden administration, the U.S. implemented export controls to help try to keep American technology out of China. Restrictions on advanced semiconductors and chip-manufacturing equipment were tightened a year later. But during her campaign, Harris has offered scant details about how her China policy would differ from President Biden's. The president has portrayed China as an authoritarian rival seeking to surpass the U.S. as the leading global power. Trump has emphasized trade relations, accusing China of taking advantage of the U.S. through its economic policies. Here's a look at the two candidates' records and what they've said about China. U.S.-China relations In her Democratic National Convention speech in August, Harris said the U.S., not China, \"wins the competition for the 21st century.\" It was a line she repeated at the debate. She met briefly with Xi in 2022 in Bangkok amid friction between the two countries. Harris said she stressed the need to \"maintain open lines of communication to responsibly manage the competition between our countries.\" In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" in 2023, Harris attributed \"tension\" in the relationship to the competition between the two nations. \"But that does not mean that we are seeking conflict,\" she said, adding that the U.S.-China economic relationship is \"not about decoupling — it is about de-risking.\" \"It's not about pulling out, but it is about ensuring that we are protecting American interests and that we are a leader in terms of the rules of the road, as opposed to following others' rules,\" Harris said. Trump has sought to portray himself as a staunch critic of China, while also professing his admiration for its leader. In a recent interview with Fox News host Mark Levin, Trump said he \"respected\" China and Xi, adding that he'd \"rather have a good relationship with China.\" He previously called Xi a \"brilliant guy\" who \"runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.\" But Trump has threatened to escalate his trade war with China, floating a tariff of 60% or more on Chinese goods. He has also proposed revoking China's Most Favored Nation trade status, phasing out all imports of essential goods from China and banning China from buying U.S. farmland. During Trump's first term in the White House, the Justice Department launched the controversial China Initiative, which sought to crack down on Chinese economic espionage.He has vowed to ramp up efforts to stop China from spying on the U.S., saying last year that \"a reformed FBI and Justice Department will be hunting down Chinese spies\" and new visa and travel restrictions will \"shut off Chinese access to American secrets.\" TaiwanHarris has reaffirmed U.S. support for Taiwan, a self-governing island that China views as its territory. The U.S. has a longstanding \"One China\" policy that does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation, nor does it recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. While visiting the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan in September 2022, Harris said the U.S. opposes \"any unilateral change to the status quo.\" \"We will continue to support Taiwan's self-defense, consistent with our longstanding policy,\" she said. She also condemned China's aggression in the South China Sea, accusing it of \"undermining key elements of the international rules-based order\" and coercing and intimidating its neighbors. Trump, however, told Bloomberg Businessweek in July that Taiwan should pay for U.S. protection, accusing it of stealing business from the U.S. chip industry. Human rights abusesIn the Senate, Harris co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which put conditions on the U.S.-Hong Kong trade relationship. The bill was introduced amid a Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy protests in the former British colony. Harris also co-sponsored the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. The bill authorized sanctions against those responsible for human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Trump signed both into law.","summary":"A look at the records and statements of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on China in the final weeks before the 2024 presidential election.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-harris-china-2024/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/dfe354f2-ac65-4500-b241-21ae33788122/thumbnail/1200x630/a8644e773d4c45f9bc5706cb4ff629b7/gettyimages-2170486375.jpg?v=d2d77bee90bcafa285fd6d60bd8b3612","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3185439_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-13 22:48:00","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.011}]}
