Israeli authorities say that around 1,200 Israelis were killed, while over 39,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, per the Associated Press.Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York, who has been critical of Israel's war and is a member of the group of progressive Democratic House lawmakers known as \"the Squad\" like Bush, lost his primary election last month to a pro-Israel candidate backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).A poll released on Monday by The Mellman Group on behalf of Democratic Majority For Israel (DMFI), a PAC affiliated with AIPAC, suggests that Bush could be next. The poll found that the incumbent congresswoman's pro-Israel challenger Wesley Bell holds a 6-point lead in the August 6 primary, 48 percent to 42 percent.\"As voters hear from the candidates, Democrats in Missouri's 1st District are increasingly disillusioned with Bush and attracted to Bell,\" DMFI PAC Chairman Mark Mellman said in a statement.\"In just the last month, Congresswoman Bush saw a 12-point increase in the number of voters who say she does not get things done for her district and an 8-point increase in those who do not think she's honest or ethical,\" Mellman added.Newsweek reached out for comment to the Bush campaign via email on Monday.Since shortly after Israel began its attack on Gaza, Bush has been calling for a ceasefire. She has gone on to accuse Israel of genocide against Palestinians, while arguing that U.S. military aid to Israel amounts to spending \"billions of dollars to continue enabling mass atrocities.\"Bush was among many Democrats who boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress last week. In a statement, Bush accused pro-Israel lawmakers of \"continuing to green-light genocide\" and \"actively celebrating the man at the forefront of that genocide.\"Bell, prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, has promised to \"fight to make sure the United States remains Israel's strongest ally,\" arguing that the attack on Gaza is justified because \"Israel has the right to defend itself and go after those who perpetrated\" the October 7 attack.The Bush campaign has accused Bell of being \"bankrolled by the MAGA extremists trying to take away our abortion rights,\" claiming that Republican Senator Josh Hawley and donors to former President Donald Trump are behind the primary challenge.Some Jewish leaders from Bush's constituency have accused her of \"ignoring\" them, while over 30 rabbis from the St. Louis area have endorsed Bell and condemned the congresswoman's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to Jewish Insider.AIPAC, DMFI and pro-Israel group United Democracy Project have recently spent over $7.6 in campaign ads and materials supporting Bell and attacking Bush, according to St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK.Pro-Israel groups reportedly spent around $15.6 million to help Westchester County Executive George Latimer oust Bowman, who has also accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.","summary":"Bush, a member of the progressive group of Democratic lawmakers known as \"the Squad,\" has accused Israel of \"genocide\" in Gaza.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/cori-bush-could-lose-primary-israel-divides-democrats-1931714","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2438673/cori-bush-could-lose-israeli-palestinian-conflict-primary.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:42:19","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":252922954,"title":"Biden Unveils Long-shot Plan To Overhaul US Supreme Court","text":"Joe Biden unveiled plans Monday for sweeping US Supreme Court reforms, as he seeks to cement his legacy in the twilight of his presidency despite Republicans branding the proposals dead on arrival.Stung by shock rulings on abortion and other topics and by a series of scandals involving the conservative-dominated court, Biden called for 18-year term limits for justices and an enforceable ethics code.\"Extremism is undermining public confidence in the court's decisions,\" Biden said in a speech outlining the \"bold\" plans at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas.Making his first speech on the road since dropping out of the 2024 election, Biden also proposed a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court's recent ruling backing Donald Trump's claims of presidential immunity. \"There are no kings in America,\" he said at the library -- which celebrates the legacy of Johnson, or LBJ, the last incumbent US president not to seek a second term back in 1968.Biden's move follows a series of shock Supreme Court decisions, especially the 2022 repeal of the nationwide right to abortion, an issue which has become crucial in November's election.Vice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in a statement that she and Biden both called on Congress to support the plans.\"These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law,\" she said.But Biden's proposals have almost no hope of getting through a deeply divided US Congress, with Republicans holding a majority in the House of Representatives.Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement that the \"dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris administration is dead on arrival in the House.\"Biden however retorted in his speech that Johnson's \"thinking is dead on arrival.\"The plans would see justices serve terms of 18 years with new justice appointed every two years. The ethics code would meanwhile force judges to declare gifts and possible conflicts of interest.The US Supreme Court plays an outsize role in determining the lives of ordinary Americans, with justices appointed for life deciding on almost every key issue from reproductive health to the environment.It currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three right-leaning justices appointed by Trump while he was president.But public opinion has recently turned against an institution once seen as the last impartial arm of the US government, with a recent poll showing nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that the court's decisions are mainly political.As well as the abortion judgement, the court has also rolled back the power of federal agencies and blocked Biden's signature student debt forgiveness plan.It then partially ruled in early July in favor of Trump's claims that he had immunity from prosecution for acts committed while president.Trump is now using that ruling to challenge his recent criminal conviction in a porn star hush-money case and a series of other prosecutions.Meanwhile the Supreme Court has been rocked by ethics scandals involving arch-conservative justices.Justice Clarence Thomas recently admitted that two luxury vacations he took in 2019 were paid for by a billionaire Republican political donor.Thomas, the longest-service justice on the court, has also ignored calls to recuse himself from cases related to the 2020 election, after his wife took part in the drive to keep Trump in power despite his electoral loss.And Justice Samuel Alito has rejected calls to recuse himself from some Trump-related cases after flags linked to the former president's false election fraud claims were discovered to have been flown outside his home and vacation property.Legal expert Steven Schwinn warned that Biden had a \"close to zero\" chance of getting the plan through Congress.But Biden was probably trying to \"raise public consciousness\" and \"introduce the Supreme Court as an election issue,\" Schwinn, a law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, told AFP.","summary":"Joe Biden unveiled plans Monday for sweeping US Supreme Court reforms, as he seeks to cement his legacy in the twilight of his presidency despite Republicans branding the proposals dead on arrival.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/biden-unveils-long-shot-plan-overhaul-us-supreme-court-3738404","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4539014/us-president-joe-biden-speaks-lbj-presidential-library-austin-texas-july-29-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:42:11","author":"Brendan Smialowski With Danny Kemp In Washington","authors":["Brendan Smialowski With Danny Kemp In Washington"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":252922764,"title":"Secret Service delayed Trump from taking stage at Nashville conference after another security lapse: sources","text":"Former President Donald Trump was briefly delayed by Secret Service agents from taking the stage at a conference in Nashville Saturday because of another security lapse, The Post has learned. The hold up was caused by two individuals who made their way around metal detectors inside the Music City Center where the 2024 Bitcoin conference was held shortly after 3:30 p.m., according to law enforcement sources. The GOP nominee was set to give the keynote address, but was instructed by his security detail to wait until the individuals were located, according to sources. After the two people were tracked down, they were ejected from the event and questioned, sources said. Neither person has been criminally charged. The two did get stopped at an initial checkpoint before they bypassed the second screening, sources said. It’s unclear how they got past the screening and what, if any, blame falls on the Secret Service for the security lapse. The Secret Service did not immediately respond with a request for comment. An email to the Trump campaign was also not immediately returned. The latest security slip-up came around two weeks after Trump was grazed by a sniper’s bullet during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in a failed assassination attempt. The shooting has led to enormous criticism and scrutiny against the Secret Service as lawmakers have pushed for more answers from the federal agency as to what went wrong in Pennsylvania.

Josh Shapiro laid into Donald Trump in a show that he has what it takes to be Kamala Harris’ running mate. The Democratic governor made the case against Trump by claiming the former president is ‘weird,’ ‘dangerous’ and proposing some ‘scary s***’ on his 2024 platform – and claimed the former president is ‘scared’ of the vice president. But Shapiro also sought to prove he was ready to take on Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) during a rally for Harris’ campaign outside of Philadelphia. Pennsylvania is massively important in this election cycle and is one of the few battleground states that could determine the outcome in November. Trump nabbed a victory in Pennsylvania in 2016 by just 0.7 percent before the state flipped blue in 2020 to go for Biden over the incumbent by a 1.2 percent gap. The Keystone State is one of the three toss-ups for 2024, according to Cook Political Report. The other two are rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin. A Bloomberg report Monday reveals that Shapiro as well as Arizona Gov. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are the top three contenders Harris is considering adding to her ticket. Joined by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during a stop in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Monday afternoon, Shapiro launched expletive-ridden attacks against Trump and Vance, whom he would debate if selected to join Harris’ ticket. ‘I have a message to Donald Trump – stop s*** talking America,’ Shapiro said to an auditorium of about 1,000 Democrat voters. ‘This is the greatest country on the face of the earth, let’s start acting like it.’ ‘You ever see this guy? When he’s on the stage, he’s like kind of meanders over, he can’t really walk well. And he goes over to the flag and he, like, hugs the flag,’ the Pennsylvania Governor said in reference to a bit the former president sometimes repeats during appearances. ‘I love the flag, but it’s a weird thing he does,’ Shapiro added. ‘But while he’s hugging the flag, you know what he’s doing? He’s ripping away our freedom. That’s what he’s all about.’ He also claimed Trump is scared to debate Harris after the ex-president said he wouldn’t commit to anything until she was officially the party’s nominee, which happens next month at the Democratic National Convention. The governor said that Harris is ‘not only ready, she’s damn ready.’ ‘You know who else knows she’s ready? Donald Trump knows she’s ready,’ Shapiro added. ‘And you know how I know this?’ he went on. ‘Because he’s afraid to debate her now. And it’s not just because she’s a skilled debater… He’s afraid to debate her because he can’t defend his record.’ Whitmer claims that Harris will choose her running mate in the next six or seven days. In her remarks at the Wissahickon High School gymnasium on Monday, the Michigan governor seemed to join-in on Shapiro’s audition for the VP role. ‘Another governor who believes in our three-part strategy: Get s*** done,’ Whitmer said of her Pennsylvania counterpart. The crowd then began chanting the phrase. Harris entering the race has injected enthusiasm in eastern Pennsylvania voters and many told DailyMail.com that they were getting ‘sad’ continuing to support Biden before he exited the race last weekend. ‘I am absolutely more excited to vote,’ mother of one and store manager Amanda Baker, 40, said. ‘Like when Biden was running, I knew I had to vote because you have to do your civic duty to save the country,’ she continued. ‘But now I’m like excited to vote and tell people who I’m voting for.’ Leah, 48, works at a hospital in Lehigh Valley and told DailyMail.com: ‘I feel a spring in my step.’ ‘Also it’s more fun to talk about, you know, the election, whilst before it was almost like something you wanted to hide because it was just like so sad and depressing with Joe Biden.’ A door-knocker in Conshohocken said he got tired of arguing with people about Biden’s age. ‘I’ve been kind of dragging my feet because I didn’t want to argue about whether he [Biden] was too old or not too old,’ said Bill Gwynn, 70. ‘Now I’ve got a story to tell.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

He also called on lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. Biden, who has less than six months left in his presidency, detailed the contours of his court proposal in an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he was marking the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His calls for dramatic changes in the court have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with 99 days to go before Election Day. Still, Democrats hope it’ll help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-President Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos,” quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. “Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” Biden said. He added, “We can and must prevent abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court.” The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. Biden pointed to the 2013 high court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and rolling back abortion rights, and a 2023 decision “eviscerating” affirmative action in college admission programs as three prime examples of what he saw as “outrageous” decisions that have shaken Americans’ faith in the high court. Harris, in a statement, said the reforms being proposed are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Biden in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of his address shrugged off Johnson’s pronouncement that the proposal is going nowhere. “I think that’s what he is — dead on arrival,” Biden offered. He added that he would “figure out a way” to get it done. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and “reduce the chance that any single president imposes undue influence for generations to come.” He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. “This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws, and face no consequences.” Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favor a mandatory retirement age, 77% to 61%. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favor of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Supreme Court justices served an average of about 17 years from the founding until 1970, said Gabe Roth, executive director of the group Fix the Court. Since 1970, the average has been about 28 years. Both conservative and liberal politicians alike have espoused term limits. An enforcement mechanism for the high court’s code of ethics, meanwhile, could bring the Supreme Court justices more in line with other federal judges, who are subject to a disciplinary system in which anyone can file a complaint and have it reviewed. An investigation can result in censure and reprimand. Last week, Justice Elena Kagan called publicly for creating a way to enforce the new ethics code, becoming the first justice to do so. The last time Congress ratified an amendment to the Constitution was 32 years ago. The 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, states that Congress can pass a bill changing the pay for members of the House and the Senate, but such a change can’t take effect until after the next November elections are held for the House. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref.” “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed during the Obama administration, has faced scrutiny after it surfaced her staff often prodded public institutions that hosted her to buy copies of her memoir or children’s books. Alito rejected calls to step aside from Supreme Court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection defendants despite a flap over provocative flags displayed at his homes that some believe suggested sympathy to people facing charges over storming the U.S. Capitol to keep Trump in power. Alito says the flags were displayed by his wife. “These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court’s fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,” Biden said. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back that Biden’s proposal amounted to taking a “torch” to the “crown jewel of our system of government.” “President Biden and his leftist allies don’t like the current composition of the court so they want to shred the Constitution to change it,” McConnell said. ___ Madhani reported from Washington.

Indeed, they showed just how far they’re willing to go to take down Donald Trump and win an election. And that they are the real threat to democracy and America’s political system. The plan, rolled out by President Biden and Veep Kamala Harris, would impose 18-year term limits on justices, essentially, a plan to pack the court with liberals. They’d subject justices to a code of conduct you can bet will be used similarly against justices they dislike. Plus, they want more limits on presidential immunity after the Supreme Court reminded them that, under the Constitution, presidents cannot be charged with crimes for official actions they take while in office. That could help promote their strategy of using lawfare against political foes. Make no mistake: This would be a radical upturning of an institution that has served the nation well for decades. Dems aim to undermine the court’s legitimacy and overturn its decisions — all to frame Trump and win an election. Their sock puppets in the media laid the groundwork for a code of conduct with their perverted attack on the conservative justices — Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, in particular. But it’s all theater. It’s part of the Dems’ fantasyland claim that “democracy is at stake” and the end of America as we know it is nigh. How can we know? Because Biden himself once opposed court-packing. Because the idea for term limits has come up only now, with conservatives holding a majority of the court’s nine seats. Indeed, Dems were quite happy with lifetime appointments when left-leaning justices, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were in the majority. Also because there’s no actual problem here this plan aims to fix (other than Dems not getting their way on key issues before the court). Rather, the nation’s high court is functioning not only as it was meant to function — but in precisely the way you’d want it to: i.e., not as an extension of the political system, but as an independent branch of government that puts a check on other branches. Under the Biden-Harris, the court would no longer be an apolitical arbiter that judges issues — like the constitutionality of laws, say, and the limits of congressional and executive-branch power — based on the merits. But here’s the kicker: Dems know none of this is going to happen. And that doesn’t matter: They’ll just blame those evil Republicans for blocking “reform.” Let’s face it: The idea of subverting an independent body to the will of politicians is precisely what voters should be most worried about. It would destroy a political system that has long served America well. Democrats may be right that “democracy” is at risk this year — from them.","summary":"Democrats just revealed their true, sick political nature with their cynical push to remake the Supreme Court.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/opinion/the-biden-harris-plan-to-wreck-the-supreme-court-is-the-real-threat-to-americas-democratic-system/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/president-joe-biden-vice-president-86026154_dc4fe0-e1722298056806.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 00:27:45","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":252922986,"title":"How Elon Musk allowed X to become a stalwart platform for Trump supporters","text":"On July 13, less than an hour after the attempted assassination on US presidential candidate Donald Trump, Elon Musk posted the following to his more than 190 million followers on X (formerly Twitter): A few days later it was reported Musk planned on committing US$45 million per month to a pro-Trump super political action committee (PAC). Musk denied this and said he had established a new “America PAC”, with a focus was on “meritocracy and individual freedom”. It’s expected Trump will benefit from donations by Musk, who has said “Republicans are mostly, but not entirely, on the side of merit and freedom”. Musk has previously described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and political moderate. His political views often haven’t aligned neatly with the left-right binary. In the context of US presidential elections, however, he supported the Democratic candidate in every election between 2008 and 2020. Now he is being viewed as a potential meal ticket for conservatives – particularly after his endorsement of Trump. So what changed? The death of Twitter – and birth of X Ever since Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 and rebranded it as X, the platform has been criticised for allowing hate speech and bots to proliferate. Research suggests both accusations are true. According to a 2023 report from The Centre for Countering Digital Hate, Musk’s ownership corresponded with a 119% rise in tweets relating to a conspiracy that claims LGBTQ+ people are grooming children. The report sparked Musk’s ire and legal backlash. This week, Musk is in the news for using transphobic rhetoric in reference to his own daughter, Vivian Wilson, whom he has described as being “dead — killed by the woke mind virus”. This isn’t the first time Musk has been involved in anti-trans rhetoric. Last year, a colleague and I conducted our own analysis of X posts that revealed the strong presence of predominantly right-wing bot accounts. Over the course of the first Republican primary debate (and simultaneously streamed interview between Trump and right-wing media figure Tucker Carlson) in August, we found a coordinated network of more than 1,200 accounts promoting the conspiracy theory that Trump was the rightful winner of the 2020 US presidential election. This content received more than three million impressions. We also found a sprawling network of 1,305 unique bot accounts (many of which were pro-Trump). Beyond this, Musk’s rule over X has prompted hundreds of thousands of users (including journalists and academics) to delete or abandon their accounts. But while left-leaning public figures lost followers, reinstated right-wing personalities including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate and Trump himself have rapidly gained them. Last year, NPR News was falsely labelled as “state-affiliated media” – a label that until then had been reserved for propaganda outlets from autocratic regimes. X later revised the label to call it “government-funded media”, despite NPR stating less than 1% of its budget is from the government. What this mean for Trump supporters? X was once touted as being a “global town square” where journalists, politicians and interested citizens could congregate for public debate. But given the number of journalists, academics and left-leaning users who have left, it seems unlikely it will ever return to this. In the absence of diverse perspectives and robust moderation practices, it’s no surprise it has become a space for Trump supporters to mobilise. Just this week, Musk seemingly violated his platform’s policies by sharing a deepfake video of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris without noting that it was satirical. The video, which includes voice manipulation, purports to show Harris making negative comments about President Joe Biden, Democrats and her own qualifications to be president. Musk also called Harris an “extinctionist” in relation to a video in which she discusses young people’s climate anxieties. Offline, Musk has reportedly been involved in meetings with a group of conservative billionaires aiming to ensure Trump wins the election. As to why he has changed his political tune from being a consistent Democratic voter, we can only speculate. Before his acquisition of Twitter, Musk claimed his problems with the platform stemmed from the “far left” management’s censorship of content. Reporters have also noted Musk’s actions often seem motivated by personal grievances and business motives. For example, after the Biden administration didn’t invite Tesla to a White House event for electric vehicle manufacturers, Musk took to Twitter to post criticisms of the US president. As the world’s richest man – with key positions in companies including Space X, Tesla, Neuralink and The Boring Company – Musk’s business bottom line has long been subject to policies and regulatory action from both sides of government. What’s next? Musk isn’t the first billionaire to air his personal political grievances online. Nor is he the first to throw money at whatever candidate’s policies suit him most. But he is arguably the first to do so while having control over a social media mouthpiece the likes of X. Returning to the upcoming US presidential elections, it is particularly concerning that Musk is seemingly allowing both incendiary speech and bots on his platform – especially in light of the Russian interference in the 2016 elections. And our own research from last year shows X’s bot problem is far from solved. In the lead-up to the November election, it will be important for researchers to keep track of automated activity and accounts on X. Unfortunately, they won’t be able to do this as they have in the past.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Republican rivals in a closely watched open congressional race in Arizona, a rare and surprising move before Tuesday’s primary election. In a Truth Social post over the weekend, Trump backed candidates Abraham Hamadeh and Blake Masters — former political allies turned bitter rivals — to represent the 8th Congressional District. “THEY WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!” Trump posted. Arizona, a key swing state that often spurs national debates over abortion and immigration, plays an outsized role in determining control of Congress and the White House. Some political observers consider the 8th District, northwest of Phoenix, the epicenter of efforts by Trump allies to cast doubt on the validity of election results. Whoever wins has a good chance of succeeding Republican U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko because the district leans conservative. Greg Whitten, a biosecurity worker, is running unopposed in the Democratic primary. All six GOP candidates largely agree on curbing illegal immigration, inflation and what many in the party describe as the “weaponization” of the federal government against Trump. Former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma, state Rep. Anthony Kern and political newcomer Patrick Briody, round out the field. Franks served eight terms in Congress before resigning in 2017 after staffers said he offered them money to bear his child. He has apologized profusely and leaned into his congressional experience in campaigning. Toma is a key figure on immigration and abortion issues in the state Legislature. He championed a ballot measure to ask voters to empower law enforcement to arrest migrants who illegally cross the Arizona-Mexico border between ports of entry. Kern is among 18 people charged for their roles in an attempt to overturn Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Briody is advocating for term limits in Congress. Hamadeh, a former Arizona attorney general candidate who unsuccessfully challenged his loss, first won Trump’s endorsement in December. Until Saturday, he had promoted himself as the only Trump-endorsed candidate in the 8th District race. While dual endorsements are rare, it’s not the first time Trump has made them. Trump on Saturday also endorsed three Republican candidates in Missouri’s gubernatorial contest. Trump backed “ERIC” in the final days of Missouri’s 2022 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, seemingly referring to three candidates with the first name Eric who were running for the seat. Masters now is distinguishing himself as the candidate with both Trump’s endorsement and that of his vice presidential pick, U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. “He (Trump) made a different decision last December, but I dare say, you know, he was impressed with the campaign I’ve been running,” Masters told The Associated Press. The late endorsement might not factor into some voters’ decisions in the race, given the majority of Arizonans vote early. Hamadeh, Masters and Kari Lake, who is now running for U.S. Senate, campaigned together in 2022 in separate races. But the friendship between Hamadeh and Masters deteriorated after they lost. Both have adopted Trump’s name-calling tactics, with Hamadeh referring to his opponent as “The Snake” and Masters labeling Hamadeh as “Dishonest Abe.” Masters’ attack ads have zeroed in on Hamadeh’s religious and cultural background, accusing Hamadeh of trying to hide his beliefs. Hamadeh’s spokesperson Erica Knight has described Hamadeh as coming “from a diverse, mixed-faith household and embodies the same Judeo-Christian values that our nation was built upon.” Masters has also criticized Hamadeh for not being married and not having children — echoing comments made by Vance, who has said “childless cat ladies” are running the Democratic Party and are anti-family. Hamadeh has brushed aside the criticism and touted what his says is “unwavering support of grassroots patriots,” along with an endorsement from Lake and Trump, Knight said. “While Blake ‘the Snake’ Masters has run a despicable campaign attacking an Army veteran, Abe has been focused on the issues that are affecting everyday Arizonans,” Knight said. Retired dentist Randall Letellier, 72, of Sun City, said he planned to vote for Hamadeh based on Trump’s initial endorsement and is now confused by the dual endorsement. “Why, the week before the election, would that come out?” Letellier said. “It doesn’t make any sense to me. I just tend not to believe that.” Doug Talbot, 52, who lives in Glendale, said Trump’s nod for Masters further nudged him in that direction. But he said he would keep researching candidates before casting a ballot. ___ Gabriel Sandoval is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Some of the four-hour ‘extravaganza’ was wicked. It was vile. It had nothing to do with sports. It was an all-out attack on Christianity laced with other ominous messaging.The darkness was cloaked with dazzling music, lights, and technology, therefore, easily missed by many caught up in the excitement and thrill. Who would expect this revulsion at what should be wholesome Olympics watched by children worldwide?It was exactly what the organizers wanted to convey despite the fake apologetic backtracking they now offer. Sorry fellahs, too little, too late.Bad as this was, it was however more than the misfit drag queen parody depicting Leonardo da Vinci’s 15th-century Last Supper painting, that depicts Jesus Christ with His apostles before He willingly went to suffer an agonizing death on the Cross for all of humanity. The painting depicts when Jesus revealed one apostle would betray Him.There was a massive golden bull, a symbol of apostasy and idol worship right below the Olympic rings.The hooded, black-cloaked torch bearer wearing a fencing mask that ran across rooftops didn’t represent Olympic joy. Whatever darkness that symbolized is a mystery.The caped rider galloping down the River Seine on a metal horse to deliver the Olympic flag bore a sinister resemblance to the pale horse rider in Revelation 6:8 representing death. It was also called out as counterfeiting Jesus’ walking on water (Matthew 14:22-33).A menage-a-trois stopped short of showing a full-blown sex act. It took place in France’s Bibliotheque National.Why was the Statue of Liberty depicted with a balloon hovering over it, shots on its face and arm and shredded clothing? Is that to be perceived as a threat of destruction? Or simply disdain for the US?Why was the Olympic flag raised upside down? What warning was that?How did the bearded man with long hair in a dress, or the headless woman singing do justice to the athletes or any Olympic sport?Rapper Snoop Dogg, hailed as an integral part of the Olympics, carried the torch ahead of the ceremony. Why choose the guy who wears a Baphomet necklace? (The horned pagan deity is associated with satanic and occult traditions.)Celine Dion and Lady Gaga? Excellent choices to fit with the theme.Dion sang Edith Piaf’s Hymne à l'amour from the Eiffel Tower. Remember Dion’s gender-neutral children’s Celinunuunu clothing. Many denounce the skulls, black toddler outfits and clothing carrying the phrase “New Order” as demonic. Whatever the truth of that, it's an odd fit for anOlympic event.Gaga sang Mon Truce n Plume, a French circus song. Gaga and her blood-soaked performances. Gaga who told Rolling Stone Magazine her stage shows were inspired by dreams about Illuminati rituals.“I have this recurring dream sometimes where there’s a phantom in my home. He takes me into a room, and there’s a blond girl with ropes tied to all four of her limbs. And she’s got my shoes on from the Grammys. Go figure — pyscho. And the ropes are pulling her apart,” said Gaga. “I never see her get pulled apart, but I just watch her whimper, and then the phantom says to me, ‘If you want me to stop hurting her and if you want your family to be OK, you will cut your wrist.’”The Olympic organizers apologized if they offended anyone — like the world’s almost 2.5 billion Christians — during the freakish, raunchy $1.5-billion production. Then they swiftly defended the clear mockery of Christianity. They weren’t sorry after all.No, there was no intention to “mock or shock,” the ceremony’s gay artistic director Thomas Jolly told The Associated Press after fiery condemnation about the parody depicting the Last Supper rippled across the globe.The ‘skit’ involving mostly freakishly dressed drag queens — and a transgender child — posing at a long table, was set to music with lesbian activist DJ Barbara Butch at the centre wearing a stupid, gaudy-looking crown.It continued with a man painted blue and covered only with a string of flowers and fruits laying in a platter of flowers. Many interpreted it to look like he was being served up as a Last Supper dish.Some claimed the skit was based on Dutch artist Jan Harmensz van Biljert’s 17th-century painting The Feast of the Gods. Nice try. For one, there’s no table in that painting. But there is one in the Last Supper.The official Olympic X account said it was merely an interpretation of Dionysus, the Greek God of wine and festivity.“The idea was to do a big pagan party linked to the gods of Olympus,” Jolly told media. Yay! A pagan party!“Above all I wanted to send a message of love, a message of inclusion, not at all to divide,” he added.Slimy liar. Paris 2024 confirmed it did indeed have to do with the Last Supper. This guy’s not very creative if the only way he could send love was to mock the revered core of the Christian faith.Of course, French President Emmanuel Macron loved it! He defended Jolly. He said the ceremony “made our compatriots extremely proud.”“To all the Christians of the world who are watching the #Paris2024 ceremony and felt insulted by this drag queen parody of the Last Supper, know that it is not France that is speaking but a Left-wing minority ready for any provocation,” European Parliament member Marion Marechal, whose grandfather founded what is now the National Rally, France's leading far-right party, posted on X.Julien Odoul, spokesman for the National Rally, condemned it as a “a ransacking of French culture.”“Paris Games is a shame and dark stain on Olympic movement,” wrote UFC champion Islam Makhachev.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, said the opening ceremonies demonstrate the “weakness and disintegration of the Western world.” Bingo!“Would they ever have dared to mock Islam in a similar way? Would they ever dream to mock a scene from the Quran in such a public way? We all know the answer to that,” thundered Australian Bishop Robert Barron. “What’s interesting here, is this deeply secularist, postmodern society knows who its enemy is. We Catholics should not be sheepish.”“Thousands of Christians in France gathered together in a breathtaking display of faith and unity. Who else thinks we need more of this? The mainstream media does not want you to SHARE this!” posted former president Donald Trump.“Unless there is more bravery to stand up for what is right, Christianity will perish,” posted Elon Musk.There are few braver than Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano. Excommunicated Vigano, who once called Pope Francis “a servant of Satan,” condemned the “vile attack on God.”“Tolerance cannot be the alibi for the systematic destruction of Christian society, a society by which billions of honest and hitherto silent people identify themselves.”He urged Christians worldwide to organize with concrete actions starting with a boycott of the Olympic games and all sponsors.“Finally, the homosexual set designer (Jolly) who gave birth to this blasphemous and vulgar spectacle must repay the fee that Macronaides charged French taxpayers.”Chances of anyone getting punished or fired are slim to none.Ironically, gay 40-year-long British respected broadcaster Bob Ballard was cancelled and resigned from BBC and Eurosport for being a sexist because he made a joke that hurt no one. When the Australian women's freestyle relay team won the gold and walked off the pool deck, Ballard quipped about them “finishing up.”“You know what women are like... hanging around, doing their make up,” he added.Drag queens were thrilled.“The opening ceremony did ruffle some feathers… and I LOVE it,” drag queen Nicky Doll wrote on Instagram.“And remember, to the ones that had their feathers ruffled seeing queerness on their screen: WE AIN’T GOING NOWHERE.”The organizers knew they could push it to the limits and get away with it. Why?Look at the mockery of Christianity in music and film awards ceremonies and performances by mega-stars including Taylor Swift, Beyonce, and more. Horns, fire, mock —? — seances, demonic-looking performers. Eminem’s most recent album lists song titles Evil, Lucifer and Antichrist.We needn’t look to Paris to be sickened by debauchery. It’s under our noses. There was one victimized transgender child in the skit mocking the Last Supper. Drag kids are regularly exploited dancing for dollars in a pub or venue near you. To name only a handful: Nova Tropica, 14. Charlotte Couture, 14. Melodollie, approximately 14. Bracken 17 but performing since she was 10. Minor Disappointment, 19, performing five years. The pictures they post are as disturbing as what was ‘celebrated’ at the Olympics.Vigano’s right. Tolerance cannot be an alibi.Musk is right too.","summary":"The opening Paris Olympic ceremonies were saturated with satanic themes. Some of the four-hour ‘extravaganza’ was wicked. It was vile.

Dhillon told the Washington Examiner. On Monday, Biden unveiled a plan to address recent rulings by the conservative-majority Supreme Court that were disfavored by Democrats, namely the July 1 presidential immunity decision in Trump v. United States. His plan proposes term limits for justices, who currently have lifetime appointments, an enforceable ethics code, and a constitutional amendment to overturn the recent ruling that grants former presidents substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts. Biden’s plans have been reported since at least mid-July, prior to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Since then, legal experts from both sides of the political aisle have expressed agreement that basic constitutional rules make Biden’s high court plans highly unlikely. Undoing the Trump immunity decision So far, the one planned amendment in the three-part plan requested the “No One Is Above the Law Amendment,” which aims to clarify that the Constitution does not shield former presidents from federal indictments, trials, convictions, or sentencing. This move would aim to undo the 6-3 ruling that found former presidents have immunity from being prosecuted for official acts while they were in office. However, to amend the Constitution, the proposal must be approved by two-thirds of both chambers of Congress and then ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures or state conventions — a process that has succeeded only 27 times in history, with the last amendment ratified in 1992. Steve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, questioned in a July 18 Substack blog why Biden was merely highlighting the recent Trump v. United States decision when there are multitudes of other high court decisions Democrats disfavor. “What about an amendment to overrule Rucho and reaffirm that the federal courts can adjudicate severe partisan gerrymandering? Or an amendment to overrule Citizens United and allow Congress to meaningfully limit the money in our elections? Or an amendment to overrule Dobbs? All of these have the exact same chance of getting two-thirds of the House and Senate to approve them (0.0%),” Vladeck wrote. Given the slim divide between Democrats and Republicans in Congress and the fragmented state governments, passing such an amendment, especially one favored by a single party, is highly improbable. 18-year term limits for justices In addition to term limits for justices, Biden referenced the 22nd Amendment, which imposes a two-term limit on presidents following Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four terms. This portion of the plan aims to impose 18-year term limits on the justices. However, imposing term limits on Supreme Court justices through an amendment faces similar improbabilities. Even if congressional Democrats could pass term limits as a law, it would likely be challenged in court and potentially struck down, as term limits for justices are not specified in the Constitution. Some legal experts believe this too would need to be approved via the required 60-vote constitutional amendment process, while others, such as Vladeck, suggested that the limits might only apply to “future officeholders.” “So, in my view, statutory term limits would be constitutional only if they went into effect starting with the next justice,” Vladeck said. “That means that, 30-40 years from now, when the last of the current justices leaves the Court, we’d have nine justices with term limits—but not tomorrow.” An enforceable ethics code Biden also called for Congress to pass a law establishing an enforceable ethics code for the Supreme Court, requiring disclosure of gifts, abstention from political activities, and recusal from cases with conflicts of interest. Such a law would also need to pass Congress and likely secure 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. Additionally, Vladeck voiced caution over an enforceable ethics code on the nine justices, saying that if anyone other than the justices is given power to enforce a code on the members for violating roles, “we’d no longer have ‘one Supreme Court,’ as Article III, Section 1 says we must; we’d have two.” Is there any way Biden’s plans could be enacted? Mike Davis, founder of the conservative Article III Project and a former clerk to Justice Neil Gorsuch, suggested the only way for Democrats to accomplish Biden’s plan is for Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to win against Trump in the November election. “If Kamala Harris wins the White House, she will almost certainly carry the House and Senate with her,” Davis posted to X.“They will nuke the Senate’s legislative filibuster — 60 vote threshold — and pack the Supreme Court with radicals,” Davis added. For now, given that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has not brought a similar Democratic bill to the floor, meeting the 60-vote threshold in a divided Congress appears unlikely. The Washington Examiner contacted Schumer for a comment. Meanwhile, other judiciary advocates, such as Kelly Shackelford, chief counsel for First Liberty Institute, renewed concerns that Biden’s plans merely aim to “subvert the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.” “Term limits are simply court-packing by another name,” Shackelford said, adding that if Biden’s plans were somehow successful, “the judiciary will no longer be a safeguard of our civil liberties but will instead be little more than a political tool used to crush the freedom of Americans.”","summary":"President Joe Biden’s ambitious three-pronged proposal to reform the Supreme Court is not likely to survive past its 15 minutes of fame, legal experts from across the partisan spectrum say. “It&#8217;s all posturing for the election season to try to garner votes amongst the far Left but also to bully the United States Supreme Court [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3103055/biden-supreme-court-reforms-already-on-life-support-legal-experts-say/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24184012822003-1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:57:02","author":"Kaelan Deese","authors":["Kaelan Deese"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.013},{"id":252922820,"title":"Biden proposed enforceable ethics code and term limits for Supreme Court. How might they work?","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden on Monday proposed major changes for the U.S. Supreme Court: an enforceable code of ethics, term limits for justices and a constitutional amendment that would limit the justices’ recent decision on presidential immunity. There’s almost no chance of the proposal passing a closely divided Congress with Election Day looming, but the ideas could still spark conversation with public confidence in the court hitting an all-time low amid ethical revelations about some justices. It also comes against the backdrop of a contentious presidential election and growing Democratic outrage about recent decisions from the conservative-majority court. Here’s a look at how the ideas, how they might work, and the possible stumbling blocks: How would justices’ terms be limited? Limiting how long justices serve on the nation’s highest court has broad support among Americans, polling indicates. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July 2022 found 67 per cent of Americans support a proposal to set a specific number of years that justices serve instead of life terms, including 82 per cent of Democrats and 57 per cent of Republicans. Biden’s proposal would limit justices to 18-year terms, a system that he says would make nominations more predictable, less arbitrary, and reduce the chances that a single president could shape the court for generations to come. There’s a big problem: The Constitution gives all federal judges lifetime tenure, unless they resign, retire or are removed. There are ideas about how to impose term limits without an amendment — but if such a law passed and were challenged in court the justices could end up ruling on it and it's unclear how they'd come down, said Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics. How would a code of ethics be enforced? The Supreme Court didn't have a formal code of ethics until last year, when the justices adopted one in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices, like Clarence Thomas. It still lacks a means of enforcement — something Biden says is “common sense.” Members of Congress, for example, generally can’t accept gifts worth more than US$50. Anyone can file complaints against other federal judges, who are subject to censure and reprimand. Justice Elena Kagan voiced support for adding an enforcement mechanism to the Supreme Court ethical code in a public appearance last week. Still, making the high court's ethical code enforceable raises thorny questions about how it might be enforced, and by whom. Lower courts say their discipline process isn’t intended to directly police their code of ethics, maintaining the code is too broadly phrased for violations to directly translate into discipline, Geyh said. That ethical code is overseen by the Judicial Conference, which is headed up by Chief Justice John Roberts. He “might be reluctant to use whatever power the conference has against his colleagues,” Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at NYU School of Law, said in an email. What about presidential immunity? Biden is also calling for a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court's recent decision giving former president Donald Trump — and all other presidents — broad immunity from criminal prosecution. The amendment would “make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office,” Biden wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. “We are a nation of laws — not of kings or dictators.” It wouldn't be the first time - the Constitution has been amended about five times to in US history to overturn a Supreme Court decision, Geyh said. But constitutional amendments have even higher hurdles than new laws. The proposal must get support from two-thirds of both the House and Senate and then be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures. No new amendments have passed in more than 30 years. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called Biden's proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Biden has resisted other calls to reform the Supreme Court A former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden has long resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court. In 2021, he fulfilled a campaign promise by convening a commission to study potential changes to the court. It was not charged with making recommendations and cautioned that excessive change could potentially erode democracy. The latest proposals come years later, and amid growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers.

The reasons behind his withdrawal remain unclear, with both the Harris campaign and Cooper's office declining to comment on the development.Newsweek contacted Harris and Cooper's office via email for comment.As a two-term governor of a battleground state, Cooper brought valuable experience and electoral success to the table. His decision to step back from national consideration raises questions about the challenges and pressures facing potential running mates in this unique electoral cycle.The timing of Cooper's exit is particularly notable, coming just weeks after President Biden's surprising departure from the race. Biden's endorsement of Harris as his successor followed what many observers described as a lackluster debate performance against former President Donald Trump, sparking intense discussions within the Democratic Party about leadership and electoral strategy.With Cooper's withdrawal, attention now focuses on the remaining candidates on Harris's shortlist. According to recent reports from Bloomberg and other media outlets, the vice president has narrowed her choices to three elected officials:1. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona 2. Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania 3. Governor Tim Walz of MinnesotaEach of these potential running mates brings unique strengths to the ticket. Kelly, a former astronaut, offers national security credentials and represents a crucial swing state. Shapiro, as the governor of Pennsylvania, could help secure a key battleground state that has been hotly contested in recent elections. Walz, leading Minnesota, provides a Midwest presence that could appeal to voters in a region that has often determined presidential outcomes.The Harris campaign has remained tight-lipped about the selection process, with a spokesperson stating only that the vice president has \"directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates.\" This careful approach reflects the high stakes involved in the decision.As the selection process continues, the remaining candidates are likely to face intense scrutiny from both the media and the public. Their past records, policy positions, and personal histories will all be examined as indicators of their potential performance on the national stage.The compressed timeline for Harris's decision adds an extra layer of pressure to the process. With the Democratic National Convention (DNC) looming and the general election campaign set to kick into high gear, the vice president must balance the need for thorough vetting with the urgency of presenting a unified ticket to the American people.","summary":"North Carolina Gov.

Add to that list a series of hastily organised Zoom calls to raise money and rev up supporters – including one on Monday night built around “White Dudes for Harris”. In barely a week since US President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris, tens of thousands of people have joined virtual gatherings spun up by activists and outside organisations to rally support for the vice-president among specific groups including black women, Hispanic women, black men, Asian-American, Native Americans and the LGBTQ community. The calls reflect how Democrats, including Biden, have frequently relied on voters from broad and disparate backgrounds to piece together a diverse coalition of support. Biden’s 2020 victory, for example, relied on segments of the population ranging from organised labour to conservative, suburban women disillusioned with Republican Donald Trump. We are organising ourselves this time because we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology Ross Morales Rocketto, White Dudes for Harris founder Organisers of Monday night’s “white dudes” Zoom expect 100,000 attendees to join a gathering featuring appearances from actors including Mark Ruffalo, Sean Astin, Mark Hamill and Bradley Whitford. Democratic officials including Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, all of whom have been mentioned as potential running mates for Harris, are also set to take part. “We are organising ourselves this time because we aren’t going to sit around and let the MAGA crowd bully other white guys into voting for a hateful and divisive ideology,” Ross Morales Rocketto, a progressive operative who founded the group, said in a statement. He was referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement. This month’s Zoom calls have not been organised by Harris’ team, but her campaign welcomes the assist – and the millions of dollars in fundraising. “Winning campaigns are powered by real, organic support,” Harris campaign communications director Michael Tyler said in a statement. The calls often feature celebrities who have supported Biden’s campaign in the past. And their sheer number shows how the vice-president will need to appeal to different facets of the increasingly pluralistic population. The political networking group “Win With Black Women” held a Zoom meeting the same night that Biden dropped out, and saw its number of participants swell to more than 44,000. It featured celebratory speeches from activists, business leaders, members of Congress and staff from the vice-president’s office. After that, a “Win With Black Men” virtual fundraising event attracted more than 53,000 attendees. They heard several presentations, including by 27-year-old Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost of Florida, who had been a leading advocate for Biden’s campaign among younger voters, and Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock. A Zoom of “White Women for Harris” attracted more than 164,000 participants – so many that the platform struggled to meet the demand. It was headlined by the likes of singer Pink and football star Megan Rapinoe. “As white women, we are the ones who have the privilege, of course, and we too have had to fight – and continue to fight – for our equality our selfhood, our freedom,” actor Connie Britton told participants. She supported Biden’s campaign in 2020 and this cycle before shifting enthusiastically to Harris. Trump’s campaign has also organised different groups of supporters by their distinct backgrounds, including events in battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Georgia for black voters and “Latino Americans for Trump”. Some Republicans have criticised Harris for her “diversity, equality and inclusion politics”, arguing that the vice-president’s political career was helped by Democratic efforts to promote diversity. That is despite House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill discouraging lines of criticism they considered racist and sexist – instead urging members of the party to focus their criticisms on Harris’ political record.","summary":"Organisers of the ‘white dudes’ Zoom expect 100,000 attendees to join a gathering featuring actors Mark Ruffalo, Sean Astin and Mark Hamill.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272394/white-dudes-harris-latest-series-zoom-gatherings-backing-us-vice-president","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/30/da5f16c3-9491-4819-9f21-97379300c441_f665243c.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:47:32","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.159},{"id":252923108,"title":"'Mass refusals to certify election' expected from officials in 3 swing states: report","text":"Just as some Republican election officials across the nation assisted Donald Trump with his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, \"at least 70\" of the former president's allies are expected to do the same in November, according to results from an investigation by Rolling Stone published Monday.

Will you let them?” “Us MAGA Republicans banned abortion, but that’s just the start,” a balding man with stained teeth says in the ad. He’s followed by man with blotchy skin and armpit stains, who adds, “We want the government involved in all aspects of your sex life.” Travis Helwig, a former head writer for Crooked Media — best known for hit podcast “Pod Save America” hosted by former Barack Obama staffers — now heads up the writers’ room for the PAC, which was formed to help boost the Democratic nominee’s appeal to millennials and Gen Z. Later in the clip, the the sweating man, who is now even sweatier, shares this anti-IVF statement: “If you freeze 12 eggs, you should be required to have 12 babies, or else you’re a serial killer.” He adds that he’s not a serial killer — in a way meant to be completely unconvincing.

Big poof of hair’","text":"Shocking new footage from the assassination attempt on Donald Trump shows local cops with guns drawn surrounding the building where Thomas Crooks opened fire — fully two minutes and 10 seconds before the shooting. The video later shows a barrage of gunfire, and then the crowd’s reaction to Crooks being shot and killed by the Secret Service, with one witness commenting that it must have been a headshot because of the “big poof of hair.” As the video unfolds, Trump can be heard in the background speaking to the crowd at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13 — but no attempt was made to get him off the stage. The clip – posted to X by user realDJStew724 — was taken at the base of the AGR International factory as Crooks was perched on top with an AR-15 rifle trained at the former president. “There’s f–king cops surrounding this whole entire f–king building right now,” a woman standing nearby said as the police officers moved around the building and Trump continued speaking in the rally behind, completely unaware of the danger unfolding. After a tense two minutes and ten seconds of bystanders advising each other to “make yourself small,” somebody screams “He’s got a gun!” and a loud bang erupts, quickly followed by a burst of gunfire and the sound of bullets ripping overhead. The volley is punctuated by a final shot, as the bystanders hunkering for cover try to figure out what happened. “Did they pick him off?” the cameraman asks somebody nearby. “F–k yeah, I saw a big poof of hair go up in the air. They got him right in the head. Big poof of hair,” a man replies, at the same moment a cheer erupts from the rally behind them as Trump got to his feet, bloodied, and raised a fist. It remains unclear exactly how long the police were surrounding the building before Dave began filming, but law enforcement sources told The Post that 25-30 to seconds passed between a local cop confronting Crooks on the roof of the building and Crooks opened fire. The Butler Township police officer retreated when Crooks pointed his rifle at the cop, authorities previously said. The new details suggest there was time to get Trump off stage before the shooting. However, details coming from the congressional investigations of the shooting show that the Secret Service and local cops had trouble communicating with each other that day — so it’s unclear whether the agents protecting Trump knew about the sniper on the roof in advance. Exactly how law enforcement reacted in those 30 seconds – and possibly the more than two minutes seen in the footage — could play a central part in the ongoing FBI investigation into the rally, former FBI special agent and SWAT team leader James Galiano told The Post, as it could reveal the holes in the communications protocols set up by the Secret Service that day. “On its face that that is an exceedingly long amount of time, but 30 seconds goes by quick in crisis situations,” Gagliano said. “I know how critical it is — but also how difficult it is — to coordinate with agencies and departments that you’ve never worked with before.” “But Secret service is the lead. So ultimately, the responsibility is going to come back on them,” he added, pointing out that until the investigation is concluded there were plenty of other glaring problems in what he called a “colossal failure” of a day. Other shortcomings include the roof where Crooks climbed — which was 130 yards from Trump’s stage — being left completely unsecured, and law enforcement being made aware of Crooks’ suspicious activity nearly 100 minutes before the shooting but failing to intervene. Crooks had even been surveying the rally grounds with a drone about two hours before the rally, yet law enforcement failed to investigate it — and if they had they may have discovered the rifle, 50 rounds of bullets, improvised explosives, and a ladder stashed in his car parked nearby. “That’s low hanging fruit,” Gagliano, the FBI expert, said of the drone blunder, pointing out that it doesn’t matter how commonplace drones are these days — security should have seen it an investigated. “You always assume the worst and work backwards from that. You always assume the worst case scenario. You ensure anything that’s possible has been mitigated, that you’ve thought it through.” “We call it in the business cascading systems failures. When one thing happens, it leads to another, and then another,” he added. “That’s how bad things happen.”","summary":"As the video unfolds, Trump can be heard in the background speaking to the crowd at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13 -- but no attempt was made to get him off the stage.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/us-news/wild-trump-shooting-video-shows-cops-then-barrage-of-fire/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/police-snipers-return-fire-shots-85718718_d25c36.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/z8JeYsjB-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:42:24","author":"Alex Oliveira,Joe Marino","authors":["Alex Oliveira","Joe Marino"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.408},{"id":252921048,"title":"Explanation of Biden’s plan for an ethics code and term limits for the Supreme Court","text":"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Monday proposed major changes for the U.S. Supreme Court: an enforceable code of ethics, term limits for justices and a constitutional amendment that would limit the justices’ recent decision on presidential immunity. There’s almost no chance of the proposal passing a closely divided Congress with Election Day looming, but the ideas could still spark conversation with public confidence in the court hitting an all-time low amid ethical revelations about some justices. It also comes against the backdrop of a contentious presidential election and growing Democratic outrage about recent decisions from the conservative-majority court. Here’s a look at how the ideas, how they might work, and the possible stumbling blocks: How would justices’ terms be limited? Limiting how long justices serve on the nation’s highest court has broad support among Americans, polling indicates. A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July 2022 found 67% of Americans support a proposal to set a specific number of years that justices serve instead of life terms, including 82% of Democrats and 57% of Republicans. Biden’s proposal would limit justices to 18-year terms, a system that he says would make nominations more predictable, less arbitrary, and reduce the chances that a single president could shape the court for generations to come. There’s a big problem: The Constitution gives all federal judges lifetime tenure, unless they resign, retire or are removed. There are ideas about how to impose term limits without an amendment — but if such a law passed and were challenged in court the justices could end up ruling on it and it’s unclear how they’d come down, said Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana University and expert in judicial ethics. How would a code of ethics be enforced? The Supreme Court didn’t have a formal code of ethics until last year, when the justices adopted one in the face of sustained criticism over undisclosed trips and gifts from wealthy benefactors to some justices, like Clarence Thomas. It still lacks a means of enforcement — something Biden says is “common sense.” Members of Congress, for example, generally can’t accept gifts worth more than $50. Anyone can file complaints against other federal judges, who are subject to censure and reprimand. Justice Elena Kagan voiced support for adding an enforcement mechanism to the Supreme Court ethical code in a public appearance last week. Still, making the high court’s ethical code enforceable raises thorny questions about how it might be enforced, and by whom. Lower courts say their discipline process isn’t intended to directly police their code of ethics, maintaining the code is too broadly phrased for violations to directly translate into discipline, Geyh said. That ethical code is overseen by the Judicial Conference, which is headed up by Chief Justice John Roberts. He “might be reluctant to use whatever power the conference has against his colleagues,” Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at NYU School of Law, said in an email. What about presidential immunity? Biden is also calling for a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court’s recent decision giving former president Donald Trump — and all other presidents — broad immunity from criminal prosecution. The amendment would “make clear that there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office,” Biden wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post. “We are a nation of laws — not of kings or dictators.” It wouldn’t be the first time – the Constitution has been amended about five times to in US history to overturn a Supreme Court decision, Geyh said. But constitutional amendments have even higher hurdles than new laws. The proposal must get support from two-thirds of both the House and Senate and then be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures. No new amendments have passed in more than 30 years. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called Biden’s proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Biden has resisted other calls to reform the Supreme Court A former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden has long resisted calls to reform the Supreme Court. In 2021, he fulfilled a campaign promise by convening a commission t o study potential changes to the court. It was not charged with making recommendations and cautioned that excessive change could potentially erode democracy. The latest proposals come years later, and amid growing outrage among Democrats about high court opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers. There’s also a hotly contested presidential election against Trump underway. It’s being blasted, though, by conservatives like activist Leonard Leo, who said in a statement: “It’s about Democrats destroying a court they don’t agree with.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – President Joe Biden on Monday proposed major changes for the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Explanation of Biden&#8217;s plan for an ethics code and term limits for the Supreme Court first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/explanation-of-bidens-plan-for-an-ethics-code-and-term-limits-for-the-supreme-court/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/v1AztroIxO0UY06b_6_a1SPrwuw=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/GHIDWVKOVNGQHDMSIGOYVQSXT4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:39:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":252920586,"title":"Nigeria doesn’t copy good things from the United States","text":"Just slightly over a week ago, the political landscape in the United States went 180 degrees with the announcement by President Joe Biden that he was withdrawing from the presidential race. Before then, Biden had been recalcitrant that he would not withdraw from the race. He insisted that he was strong and healthy and was the only person who could defeat the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. Even though Biden had given the American public many signs that indicated that he was mentally and physically unfit for the job, it was during the first presidential debate that his shortcomings became indisputable. Biden spoke in a raspy voice without any force. He looked feeble. But that was not all. He regularly lost his train of thought and mixed up the names of people and incidents. Even his opponent at that debate, Trump, had occasions when he was surprised at the lack of coherence in what Biden was saying. At a point in the debate, Trump said, while responding to an answer Biden gave to the moderators: “I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence, and I don’t think he did, either.” Biden’s performance was embarrassing. Opinion polls showed that Trump was widening the gap between them. Many Democrats, including legislators, began to openly ask him to withdraw from the race and save the party from not just losing the presidency but also losing some of their strongholds in Congress to Republicans and becoming weakened. To show their seriousness, many sponsors of the party withdrew their support. But the more Democrats asked Biden to withdraw, the more he said no and insisted that he was the person who could defeat Trump just as he did in 2020. The Democratic Party was divided and confused. The morale of members was low. Their case was worsened by the fact that Biden was (and still is) an incumbent president. As a result, he did not face any strong challenge for the ticket of the party earlier this year. Another factor – not usually publicly discussed – was the fact that Biden’s deputy, Vice President Kamala Harris, is a woman as well as a person of non-White race. Despite the high level of human rights in the United States, it has never elected a woman. It took America 232 years to elect a non-White person in 2008 in the person of Barack Obama. And it was because Obama had an amazing personality and showed exceptional promise with no bad story associated with him. It would be disastrous to sideline Harris because of her gender and race to pick a White male as Biden’s replacement at the polls. But with less than four months to the presidential election, even if Harris became the candidate of the Democratic Party, it was not obvious whether she could make any impact. Conversely, the Republican Party was upbeat. The morale of members was high. The missed assassination attempt on Trump some weeks ago drew him sympathy and helped to shoot up his rating. At the Republican Party’s convention, where Trump was officially confirmed as the presidential candidate and where he named his running mate, the party was as united and confident as it had not been in many years. All polls showed that Trump was ahead. It was obvious that Trump would rout Biden in the presidential race in November. Then on Sunday, July 21, Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race and support for Harris. Within 48 hours, the presidential bid of Kamala Harris received over $100 million in donations: a record. (Within one week, it raised $200 million). The Democratic Party was rejuvenated. Attention shifted from the Republicans to the Democrats. The campaign dynamics also completely changed. Before that Sunday, Trump was the younger and healthier candidate, while Biden was the old and feeble candidate. That was meant to be the focal point of the campaign. Immediately after Biden’s announcement, Trump became the old candidate: the oldest candidate in American history to run for president. The Republicans would be forced to change their campaign message and focus. Opinion polls showed that Harris had gone narrowly ahead of Trump, even though it is still within the margin of error, which makes it an open game. The Republicans believe that Trump will rescue the United States from the dangerous grip of Biden and the Democrats. The Democrats believe that Kamala Harris and the Democrats will save America from falling into the dangerous hands of Trump a second time. Another thing that happened after Biden’s announcement was the resignation of the Director of the American Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle. Since the attempt on Trump, Cheatle had vowed not to resign. Last week, she was grilled by Congress and both Democrats and Republicans tore her to shreds and told her to write her resignation letter immediately. She refused. But the next day, she resigned. This is why warts and all, the United States is an exemplary and exciting democracy. The system is above everyone. One person does not decide what happens in the country. People take responsibility for any lapses under their watch. There is no room for excuses. If they refuse to do that, they are put under pressure until they do the right thing. Biden is the president of the strongest country in the world. Therefore, he is the strongest president and individual in the world. But he had to succumb to the pressure from his party members to withdraw from the presidential race. The difference between the US and the Nigerian situation is that in cases like this, the Nigerian president would not resign. It happened when Umaru Musa Yar’Adua was ill. It happened when Muhammadu Buhari was also ill. It happened when Bola Tinubu was contesting for the presidency. Besides, there were many allies of theirs who came out and spoke strongly in their support, giving all kinds of reasons why their health situation was not an issue. Another point is the importance Americans place on presidential debates. Any candidate who refuses to attend a presidential debate is seen as showing disrespect to the American populace. The presidential debate is the avenue through which the American people, as well as citizens of all developed countries, gauge the physical and mental acuity of those who wish to lead them. They use it to find out who seems prepared for leadership. But in Nigeria, politicians snub debates and all attempts to answer unscripted questions. Tinubu did not participate in any presidential debate before the 2023 election. Before him, Buhari did the same thing. Likewise, Goodluck Jonathan, Yar’Adua and Olusegun Obasanjo either avoided presidential debates or participated in the one they created. There were always people who defended them and argued that talking is not the same thing as leadership. Nigeria copies most things from the US. The current presidential system of government which Nigeria practises was copied from the US after the First Republic failed and it was blamed on the British parliamentary system. The presidential system has not succeeded in delivering a reliable system that creates progress and stability. That proves that Nigeria’s governance failure has no connection with the system of government in place. The problem of Nigeria is that of a bad workman who continuously quarrels with his tools. Nigeria does not copy the transparency that the American system is known for. It does not copy the proclivity of Americans to put the interest of the country before their personal and parochial interests. Resigning from positions is almost unthinkable. Individuals are most times above the law. This makes it difficult for democracy to produce the desired dividends that are associated with it. The only dividend of democracy that has accrued to Nigeria is the fact that no president has stayed in power for more than two terms like what obtains in countries like Russia, Rwanda, Cameroon, etc, which purport to practise democracy. Nigerians look forward to the time their politicians will start copying the good examples from the United States.

Ten percent can be spent on grants for “transportation, schools, and parks.” Notably, only 80% of the proceeds of the bond issue need to be spent in the county funding the bonds.

Nick Waranoff Orinda Critique of Harris applies to others Re: “Democrats deserved contest, not coronation” (Page A7, July 25). In his critique of Kamala Harris, Bret Stephens mentions high staff turnover during her time as vice president and the fact that she failed the bar exam on the first try. Regarding turnover, he should have started by looking at the mile-long list of senior and mid-level Trump people who quit or were fired. As for the bar exam, Harris is in good company. Others who took the exam more than once include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Michele Obama, John F, Kennedy Jr., and former California Governors Jerry Brown and Pete Wilson. He also claims she has been a bad campaigner. He’s entitled to his opinion, but her first speech in Milwaukee looked pretty impressive to me, in contrast to Donald Trump’s 93-minute meandering speech at the Republican convention. John Walkmeyer San Ramon We must get serious after record heat Re: “Last Sunday was hottest day on Earth in recorded history” (Page A2, July 24) That alarming headline was corrected the next day online: “Sunday was hottest day on the planet – no, wait, it’s Monday.” Things are just starting to warm up. It is now obvious that the cost of this heat — both in dollars and in human lives — far outstrips the cost of reducing CO2 emissions. Are we going to follow Ben Franklin’s advice: “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”? Or John Paul Jones, “I have not yet begun to fight”? We need to get serious, folks. Cliff Gold Fremont Newsom’s order to sweep camps is cruel Re: “Newsom orders sweeps of camps” (Page A1, July 26). The scary truth is most Californians are only a few bad breaks away from homelessness. The unlucky blow may come from a wildfire or, worse, an unexpected medical bill. Insurers profit most off denying coverage, that is, if you were fortunate enough to have health insurance in the first place. Capitalism turns housing into a scarce commodity and then blames people who lack it. Rather than treating the unhoused as untouchable, we should give them security and more chances. It is the Christian thing to do and a humane imperative. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to sweep away homeless encampments is cruel. It does nothing to solve the systemic problems that cause homelessness in the first place. And by treating other people like trash, the Ggovernor has proven he’s garbage. Alan Marling Livermore Harris win is best hope for multiracial society I was one of 50,000 Black men on a call for Kamala Harris, a day after 44,000 Black women got together. I haven’t seen this level of excitement since Barack Obama in 2008. Black women and men being this energized is how we will win the fight for a multiracial democracy. Kamala was born at the same Oakland hospital as my son. In 2020, hundreds of us danced in front of her former Berkeley apartment to celebrate her victory. And boy will we party if, natch, when she wins the presidency. Ludovic Blain Berkeley Courts are best place to resolve ambiguities Re: “Eviscerating agencies’ power is dangerous” (Page A6, July 10). A letter writer complained that the Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimundo now prevents federal administrative agencies from “resolving statutory ambiguities.” But that is exactly how it should be. That’s what courts do. While agencies may have certain “expertise,” they are not courts. Courts have the expertise to resolve ambiguities in the law; agencies don’t. I don’t want an agency expert to interpret a legal ambiguity; that is not the job of a federal bureaucrat. That expert might be a conservative or liberal who lets his or her worldviews influence a decision. If an agency finds an ambiguity in the law, have them go to Congress to clarify the issue. That is the job of our representatives.

Or it could just be the ramblings of a deeply unpleasant man. Disgraced former president Donald Trump seems to be making weird statements about famous women part of his campaign. His latest target is Miley Cyrus. Upon singing the praises of her father, Billy Ray Cyrus, the notorious felon complained about the man’s much more famous daughter. Donald Trump is apparently a Billy Ray Cyrus fan On Saturday, July 27, Donald Trump gave a speech at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville. (That may sound random, but cryptocurrency barons have been pouring money into the Trump campaign in the hopes of widespread deregulation.) As is his habit, the infamous criminal spoke in a stream-of-consciousness manner. He noted that Billy Ray Cyrus was in the audience. “Billy Ray Cyrus is here,” Donald Trump announced. “Where is Billy Ray?” “He’s around here someplace, and he’s great,” he claimed wildly. Apparently saying whatever came to mind, Trump rambled: “He’s a conservative guy. I said, ‘How did you get such a liberal daughter?’ How did that happen, Billy Ray?’” Why did Donald Trump shade Miley Cyrus? It’s sometimes difficult to explain why a man like Trump shades someone, let alone someone as popular as Miley. In this case, he was also seemingly negging one-hit-blunder Billy Ray. Weird way to treat your apparent supporters. One would almost think that he is “blaming” Billy Ray. But, as we will explain momentarily, perhaps he was alluding to Billy Ray Cyrus’ recent and viral audio in which he said vile things about his own daughter. The answer to his question, of course, is that it’s normal for children to not be carbon copies of their parents. Miley is also a Millennial and part of the LGBTQ+ community. Both of those have statistical boosts to left-leaning politics. Billy Ray, a straight white male Boomer who considers himself a Country musician, is no surprise on the other side of the aisle. To be blunt, when you politicize who someone is and threaten their human rights, you’re arguably deciding their political affiliations for them. Miley shades with the best of them In the past, Miley Cyrus has spoken very openly about the disgraced former president. When Trump ran in 2016, Miley described him accurately as a “f–king nightmare” on her Instagram page. Then, following his electoral victory that year, she lamented the loss for America on Twitter. We promised to explain why Trump might shade Miley in apparent agreement with Billy Ray. Recently, a leaked audio recording showed Billy Ray Cyrus call Miley a “skank” and “devil” during a vicious, expletive-laden rant. He also put soon-to-be-ex-wife Firerose and his ex-wife, Tish, on blast. When a man speaks about his own family in that way, he seemingly invites others to do the same. Bizarrely, this was a rare instance of Trump being the “nice” one. Relatively.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWhen Trump shades Miley, it could be a desperate reach by his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump Criticizes Miley Cyrus in Peculiar Speech for Billy Ray&#8217;s Benefit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/donald-trump-criticizes-miley-cyrus-in-peculiar-speech-for-billy-rays-benefit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-Shades-Miley-Cyrus-For-Billy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:30:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.056},{"id":252921038,"title":"Top Democrats stress contrasts between Trump, Harris at Pa. rally","text":"AMBLER, Pa. — Seeking to capitalize on an outpouring of enthusiasm and an influx of cash, Democratic governors Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania sought Monday to draw a contrast between Vice President Harris and Donald Trump, warning a packed gymnasium here that he would strip more freedoms from a vast swath of Americans.","summary":"Govs. Gretchen Whitmer and Josh Shapiro, serving as surrogates for the vice president, blasted the GOP ticket as self-interested, out-of-touch and destructive.","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/29/whitmer-shapiro-harris-pennsylvania-rally/","image":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SVF5MT2FR23AMENRSDDNIY4ZVE_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:28:37","author":"Cleve R.

He also called on lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. Biden, who has less than six months left in his presidency, detailed the contours of his court proposal in an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he was marking the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. His calls for dramatic changes in the court have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with 99 days to go before Election Day. And in fact, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House.” Still, Democrats hope it’ll help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-President Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos,” quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. “Extremism is undermining the public confidence in the court’s decisions,” Biden said. He added, “We can and must prevent abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court.” The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. Biden pointed to the 2013 high court decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and rolling back abortion rights, and a 2023 decision “eviscerating” affirmative action in college admission programs as three prime examples of what he saw as “outrageous” decisions that have shaken Americans’ faith in the high court. Harris, in a statement, said the reforms being proposed are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court.” Biden in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of his address shrugged off Johnson’s pronouncement that the proposal is going nowhere. “I think that’s what he is — dead on arrival,” Biden offered. He added that he would “figure out a way” to get it done. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and “reduce the chance that any single president imposes undue influence for generations to come.” He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. “This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws, and face no consequences.” Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favor a mandatory retirement age, 77% to 61%. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favor of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref.” “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honorable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a GOP megadonor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed during the Obama administration, has faced scrutiny after it surfaced her staff often prodded public institutions that hosted her to buy copies of her memoir or children’s books. Alito rejected calls to step aside from Supreme Court cases involving Trump and Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection defendants despite a flap over provocative flags displayed at his homes that some believe suggested sympathy to people facing charges over storming the U.S. Capitol to keep Trump in power. Alito says the flags were displayed by his wife. “These scandals involving the justices have caused public opinion to question the court’s fairness and independence that are essential to basically carrying its mission of equal justice under the law,” Biden said. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back that Biden’s proposal amounted to taking a “torch” to the “crown jewel of our system of government.” “President Biden and his leftist allies don’t like the current composition of the court so they want to shred the Constitution to change it,” McConnell said.","summary":"President Joe Biden said Monday that \"extremism\" on the U.S. Supreme Court is undermining public confidence in the institution and called on Congress to quickly establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court's nine justices.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/29/biden-decries-extremism-on-supreme-court-details-plan-for-term-limits-ethics-code-for-justices/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24211785156918.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:22:55","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":252920450,"title":"Megan Thee Stallion to Join Kamala Harris During Rally in Atlanta for Special Performance","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is looking to go full steam ahead on her quest to become the next president of the United States, so she’s enlisting some help. According to a source, Harris will have Megan Thee Stallion join her at her rally on Tuesday (July 30) in Atlanta for a special performance. Over the weekend, Harris teamed up with *NSYNC star Lance Bass for a special TikTok clip slamming former President Trump ahead of this upcoming November election. “Hey Kamala, what are we gonna say to Donald Trump in November?” Bass asks Harris in the video. “Bye, bye, bye,” Harris sharply responds, referring to the pop group’s 2000 hit single of the same name. Over a week ago, President Biden decided to step aside from the presidential race, giving Harris his nod and endorsement to compete against Trump. This pivotal moment was followed by a surge of support from celebrities, including Cardi B, Lizzo, Lil Nas X and more, who have joined forces to back Harris in her historic bid to become the first female president of the United States. “On behalf of the American people, I thank Joe Biden for his extraordinary leadership as President of the United States and for his decades of service to our country,” Harris responded to Biden’s announcement. “I am honored to have the President’s endorsement, and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.” Following the endorsement, Harris released a campaign video featuring Beyonce’s 2016 “Freedom,” urging Americans to lean in and support her. “There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate.

We choose freedom.” Billboard reached out to Harris and Megan Thee Stallion’s team for comment.","summary":"Megan Thee Stallion is the next celebrity to support Vice President Harris' presidential run.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/megan-thee-stallion-kamala-harris-rally-atlanta-1235742703/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Megan-Thee-Stallion-BottleRock-Napa-Valley-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:19:45","author":"Carl Lamarre","authors":["Carl Lamarre"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.495},{"id":252920182,"title":"To earn women’s votes, Trump must stick to the issues — and show his softer side","text":"The Internet kerfuffle that took up endless pixels last week centered on Ohio Sen. JD Vance and his ruminations on the “bunch of childless cat ladies” who run the Democratic Party. “How does it make any sense we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” Vance, now former president Donald Trump’s running mate, asked in a 2021 Fox News interview. It was mostly people who would never vote for Trump, with or without Vance on the ticket, who pretended to be offended. Why, how dare Vance mock us as “cat ladies,” they demanded, as they re-listened to Barack Obama’s speech about those terrible white people clinging to God and guns. Judgment about my life choices; well I never. But some Republican women were also annoyed: The comments came off as condescending and judgmental, not to mention personal. Vance wasn’t wrong on the macro level — societally, we need people to have children. A June Pew Poll showed that Republicans largely understand this, with 59% of Trump supporters saying “society should prioritize marriage and having children,” while only 19% of then-candidate Joe Biden’s supporters agreed. But on the micro level, Vance’s comments picked at a painful personal scab for many women — especially those who wanted to have children but, for one reason or another, did not. Insulting people in your own base, especially women, is something Democrats do with ease but Republicans have yet to master. A few days ago, a Zoom call titled “White Women: Answer the Call!” raised a ton of money for Kamala Harris, largely by disparaging white women. “White women so rarely do this work,” writer Glennon Doyle said on the call. “Because you might make your neighbors uncomfortable. Because you also desperately need to be approved of and liked.” White women are the worst, said a white woman. The vagueness is part of what the left does well. White liberal women can say awful things about white women, while talking to white women, and everyone on the call will just assume it doesn’t apply to them. The Trump campaign has to walk a fine line in its appeal to the fairer sex — but earning our votes is not some insurmountable hurdle. In 2016, Trump won 39% of the female vote; by 2020, that number had climbed to 44%. (Erosion of his male support cost him re-election.) To build on that gain, the Trump campaign should not follow Harris in treating women as some fringe minority. In fact, female voters share the concerns of men on most issues. Like men, women care about safety and security, being able to buy food to feed our families and giving our children the life that we dream of for them. Trump’s vow to curb illegal immigration, to be tough on criminals and to establish “universal school choice” should all be popular issues with the ladies, as well as the men. Meanwhile, for any woman who gets sticker shock at the supermarket, Trump’s economic plan promises to reduce inflation. Anyone, of any gender, struggling to get by while the Biden/Harris White House pretends inflation is a myth will want to hear more about that. Even on abortion, Trump came off as the moderate in his debate with Joe Biden by emphasizing that Roe v. Wade allowed for abortion up until the moment of birth. Many people simply don’t know this truth, which illustrates the radicalism of the left’s position: While most Americans support keeping abortion legal, support drops precipitously after the first trimester. Still, to earn the votes of women, Trump and Vance must curb personal attacks. Sarcastic quips like Vance’s “cat ladies” comment will inevitably be clipped and shared to claim the misogyny of the all-male ticket. Yet following the July 13 assassination attempt on the former president, voters saw glimpses of a kinder, gentler man. His granddaughter Kai’s speech at the Republican National Convention showed a side of Trump few get to see. The campaign should lean into this powerful form of persuasion and feature more women who know Trump well — it doesn’t hurt to show us that he doesn’t actually bite. So while male and female voters may care about the same issues, getting women to turn out and proactively cast a Trump vote calls for the campaign to adjust its tone. The former president already has a ready-made line: Are you better off than you were four years ago? Few of us — women and men alike — are.

Responding to the assassination search issue, a Google spokesperson explained that its systems \"have protections against autocomplete predictions associated with political violence, which were working as intended prior to this horrific event occurring\". and the company is \"working on improvements to ensure our systems are more up to date.\" Meanwhile, Musk, the head honcho of the social media platform X, has directly and transparently thrown his support behind Trump, purportedly because of, among other things, Democrats' ultra-liberal policies and \"wokeness\". Amid outrage on the Democratic side, Musk retweeted over the weekend a parody of a Harris campaign ad without disclosing that it was digitally altered, a violation of his own platform's rules that forbid sharing manipulated media. The video contained manipulated audio that had Harris saying she did not \"know the first thing about running the country\" and is \"the ultimate diversity hire\". Trump supporters gloated about Musk beating the \"entire social media apparatus in one post\" (which has 129 million views by Monday morning), with one supporter asking, \"Who else loves the fact Elon bought this platform?\"","summary":"Alphabet/Google and X leaders Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk have been drawn into US election interference charges. Pichai faced controversy when Google's autocomplete didn’t show information about an assassination attempt on Trump, prompting accusations of bias. Musk openly supported Trump, sharing a parody Harris campaign ad without disclosing it was altered, violating platform rules.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumpists-claim-google-bias-accuse-pichai-of-backing-fellow-pio-kamala/articleshow/112120453.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112120594/112120594.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:12:36","author":"CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA","authors":["CHIDANAND RAJGHATTA"],"language":"en","source_country":"IN","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":252920136,"title":"Bella Hadid breaks her silence over controversial Adidas campaign which referenced 1972 Olympics that saw terrorists kill 11 Israelis: 'I am shocked'","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys My Profile Logout Login Discounts TUI Booking.com ASOS Just Eat Deliveroo boohoo Very Nike Virgin Media Uber Eats Boots B&Q Amazon John Lewis My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Monday, Jul 29th 2024 10PM 16°C 1AM 14°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement Two children dead, 11 people hurt in Southport knife rampage: Six kids and two adults 'who bravely tried to protect them' fighting for life after 'boy, 17, launched horror attack' at Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop Ex-BBC News at 10 presenter Huw Edwards faces child porn charges: Married father-of-five, 62, is accused of having 37 indecent images of children - including six under most extreme category Revealed: The commonly used tablets that stop working if you take them with coffee How to stop Labour pick-pocketing your savings: JEFF PRESTRIDGE on steps to take NOW to safeguard your pension and wealth William and Kate lead tributes as Team GB add sixth Olympic gong on Medal Monday: Cyclist Tom Pidcock and eventing team strike gold, diver Tom Daley, swimmer Matthew Richards and canoeist Adam Burgess take silver while equestrian Laura Collett wins bronze Chancellor Rachel Reeves is accused of undertaking a 'cruel' raid on pensioners after axing the winter fuel allowance for ten million older people Ozempic transformed my health but then an alarming side effect kicked in...

Email tips@dailymail.com By Jacqueline Lindenberg For Dailymail.Com Published:23:54 BST, 29 July 2024 |Updated:00:16 BST, 30 July 2024 e-mail View comments Bella Hadid has broken her silence over the recent controversial Adidas campaign by expressing that she is 'shocked' in a statement uploaded to her Instagram stories on Monday. The supermodel, 27 - who recently hired lawyers after her Adidas SL72 campaign was pulled - starred in the retro sneakers campaign but soon faced backlash due to the ad referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics that saw terrorists kill 11 Israelis. The pro-Palestinian star penned a lengthy message to her followers and began with, 'For those of you who do not know my heart, I want to make sure you're hearing directly from me about my recent campaign with adidas.' Hadid expressed she 'would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind.' 'In advance of the campaign's release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972. I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign.' Bella Hadid, 27, has broken her silence over the recent controversial Adidas campaign by expressing that she is 'shocked' in a statement uploaded to her Instagram stories on Monday; seen in May in Cannes The supermodel starred in the retro sneakers campaign but soon faced backlash due to the ad referencing the 1972 Munich Olympics that saw terrorists kill 11 Israelis Hadid expressed she 'would never knowingly engage with any art or work that is linked to a horrific tragedy of any kind' Bella further explained, 'Had I been made aware, from the bottom of my heart, I would never have participated.' 'My team should have known, adidas should have known and I should have done more research so that I too would have known and understood, and spoken up.' The model added that she 'will always speak up for what I believe to be wrong. While everyone's intentions were to make something positive, and bring people together through art, the collective lack of understanding from all parties undermined the process.' 'I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism,' Hadid continued, adding, 'That will never waiver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent.' The media personality also shared that, 'Connecting the liberation of the Palestinian people to an attack so tragic, is something that hurts my heart.' 'Palestine is not synonymous with terrorism and this campaign unintentionally highlighted an event that does not present who we are.' Bella stated that she is a 'proud Palestinian woman' and expressed 'there is much more to our culture than the things that have been equated over the past week.' 'I will forever stand by my people of Palestine while continuing to advocate for a world free of antisemitism. Antisemitism has no place in the liberation of the Palestinian people.' 'In advance of the campaign's release, I had no knowledge of the historical connection to the atrocious events in 1972. I am shocked, I am upset, and I am disappointed in the lack of sensitivity that went into this campaign,' she wrote 'I do not believe in hate in any form, including antisemitism,' Hadid continued, adding, 'That will never waiver, and I stand by that statement to the fullest extent'; seen in May in Cannes Share or comment on this article: Bella Hadid breaks her silence over controversial Adidas campaign which referenced 1972 Olympics that saw terrorists kill 11 Israelis: 'I am shocked' e-mail Add comment Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search Advertisement DON'T MISS Jennifer Aniston looks FURIOUS when oil is thrown on her during a climate change protest - but it's only a scene for the 4th season of The Morning Show Love Island crowns Mimii and Josh winners!

Belshe is one of several tech executives who have come out in support of the GOP ticket or have helped in their efforts to raise more cash. Vance worked closely early on in his career in venture capital in San Francisco with venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and counts billionaire investor Marc Andreessen and Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk as among his tech industry connections. Donald Trump’s Republican vice presidential pick is hoping to use his Silicon Valley connections to bolster the war chest of the Republican presidential campaign. And the tickets to the fundraiser come at a steep price. A $25,000 donation per person includes participation in the roundtable, a photo and dinner with the vice presidential candidate. For $15,000, attendees can get a photo and dinner, while $3,300 allows participation in the dinner only. Last time Vance, known for his best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” about his Appalachian roots, was in the Bay Area in June, he helped raise $12 million at the San Francisco home of billionaire tech entrepreneur David Sacks. The announcement that Belshe, a crypto executive, would host Vance for the fundraiser should come as no surprise. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto president if he were to be elected for another term. According to a Newsweek report, the former president spoke at a cryptocurrency conference on Saturday, making five major promises to the cryptocurrency industry. These promises included fighting inflation with crypto-friendly policies, encouraging the use of excess energy for cryptocurrency mining, and firing a government official viewed as anti-crypto. Here are five things to know about Belshe: — Belshe is the CEO and co-founder of BitGo, a pioneering cryptocurrency wallet, digital asset trust and security company based in Palo Alto. The company was founded in 2013 by Belshe and Ben Davenport, a former software engineer with Google and Facebook. BitGo’s valuation was pegged at $1.75 billion last year after securing Series C funding. — As a computer engineer, Belshe helped program the SPDY protocol, which made web browsing faster, and authored HTTP/2.0, which allowed websites to communicate with users’ web browsers more efficiently. — Belshe began his tech career as a software engineer at Hewlett Packard in 1993 before joining Netscape in 1995, where he worked on the Netscape Enterprise server. — He is an alumnus of California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, graduating in 1993. According to his LinkedIn profile, Belshe was voted “Computer Science Senior of the Year.” — Belshe has been posting political content on his X account over the past month. On July 27, two days before the fundraiser, he posted this pro-cryptocurrency quote from Trump: “Bitcoin is not a threat to the US dollar. They have it backwards. The US government is the biggest threat to the US dollar.” \"Bitcoin is not a threat to the US dollar. They have it backwards. The US government is the biggest threat to the US dollar.\" – President Donald Trump — Mike Belshe (@mikebelshe) July 27, 2024 —","summary":"The announcement that Belshe would host Vance for the fundraiser should come as no surprise.

All signs point to a tight race in November, and the GOP ticket is already behind with women: In five battleground states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Harris leads by 9 points or more with the ladies. Closing that gap may be an uphill battle. Even if Trump were ahead, it would be foolish to ignore the power of women voters: About 7.4 million more women than men were registered to vote in 2022, according to the Center for American Women in Politics, and more women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1964. Yes, Trump prevailed over a woman in 2016, but Hillary Clinton ran with decades of political baggage that repelled many voters. And that was before Roe v. Wade was overturned, which made abortion a hot-button issue, particularly for women: It hurt GOPers in 2022, and Democrats see that as the ace up their sleeve this year, too. Besides, the chance to vote for a woman who feels like a relative newcomer will almost certainly attract female voters who sat out other elections (or even some of those who pulled the lever for Trump in 2016 because they couldn’t stomach the alternative). Sure, there are plenty of women who want what Trump and Vance are selling: school choice, parents rights, a better economy, safer neighborhoods and a more secure border. But this is a different political landscape than 2016, and both Trump and Vance need to keep on the straight and narrow to avoid alienating female voters who might otherwise agree with them on policy. Maybe Trump should start by quit hurling derogatory nicknames and ad hominem insults at his foes. He can ding Kamala on policy without making crass comments or veering into petty pot shots about her looks or gender that might make women balk. He and his running mate must certainly avoid missteps like the one Vance made in 2021, when he blasted “childless cat ladies” who run the country but are “miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” He also foolishly suggested penalizing women without kids with higher taxes. For real? Vance’s comments resurfaced recently and spread like wildfire on social media, drawing backlash from even conservative women. Meanwhile, there’s plenty he can and should attack Harris on — inflation, the border disaster (which she oversaw), her lack of experience and her support for unpopular far-left causes, like defunding police, packing the court and the Green New Deal. Trump and Vance need to reassure women that they take them seriously as a voting bloc, and they have no interest in pushing national policy that controls women’s decisions on family matters. The GOP ticket knows women will play a major role in deciding this election, perhaps they should start acting like it.","summary":"A warning to Donald Trump and J.D.

According to one unnamed team leader, he only had a few people available because ‘everyone else is either working, on vacation or hurt.’ An unnamed team leader wrote to a text chat that they had been ‘requested by Butler to assist’ and needed six people to step up for the 12-hour detail. Two offered to do so for the whole time, and two more offered to split the Saturday shift. The new messages, bodycam footage and law enforcement debrief were obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. At 4:26 p.m., over 90 minutes before Trump took the stage, a Beaver County sniper finished his shift and departs the AGR building. AS he did, he texted a chain about a suspicious person he’d spotted, Thomas Matthew Crooks. The officer noted that he was sitting at a picnic table ‘about 50 yards from the exit.’ Later on, officers exchanged photos of Crooks, who had then been marked a ‘suspicious person,’ at 5:38p.m., over 30 minutes before Trump was shot. ‘Kid learning (sic) around building we are in. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. Another officer asked what direction Crooks was headed, to which an unnamed officer replied, ‘if I had to guess toward the back. Away from the event.’ It comes after a whistleblower last week revealed Secret Service stood in the way of using drone technology to survey the scene of the Butler rally where an assassin tried to shoot former President Donald Trump. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., revealed that one whistleblower had told his office the night before the rally Secret Service ‘repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally.’ The whistleblower alleged that after the shooting Secret Service ‘changed course and asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site in the aftermath.’ The drones that were offered ‘had the ability not only to identify active shooters but to neutralize them,’ according to Hawley. From Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas Hawley demanded all records and communications related to the drone offer. The new claim adds another layer to the probe of the Secret Service’s biggest security failure since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981. After a blistering six hours of testimony on Monday Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle handed over her resignation on Tuesday. She’d spent much of the day evading and giving conflicting answers to questions such as why the roof where gunman Thomas Crooks committed his attack wasn’t included within the security perimeter despite being within rifle range of the stage and why Trump was allowed to take the stage despite Crooks being identified as a suspicious person one hour before he fired any shots. When asked to explain why there wasn’t an agent on the roof, the director explained it’s because the agency generally ‘prefers sterile rooftops.’ FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers on Wednesday the 20-year-old gunman flew a drone 200 yards from the stage just two hours before he opened fire in Butler, Pennsylvania, and had three explosives in his car. Crooks shot Trump in the ear just 400 feet away from the stage in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter of the event. Wray said Crooks and his family owned a combined 14 guns and Crooks had visited a shooting range one day before the rally. Crooks used an AR-style weapon that had been purchased legally by his father and sold to him in October 2023. Wray said eight bullet cartridges had been recovered from the roof where Crooks fired off his shots toward the former president. And he wouldn’t rule out that Crooks did not have any accomplices to the crime, saying it’s still being looked at by law enforcement. As Wray faced questions about why the president was allowed on stage despite the ‘threat’ being identified 20 minutes before the shots were fired, Wray said, ‘we don’t know the answer to that.’ He said that no one in law enforcement saw Crooks with lying down in a shooting position with a gun in hand until ‘moments before’ he fired, but had seen him on the roof ‘minutes before.’ The FBI and Secret Service revealed to lawmakers last week they spotted Crooks as a person of interest a full 62 minutes before he fired a shot. He’d been seen with a range finder, which Cheatle said was ‘not a prohibited item’ at Trump rallies. This wasn’t enough to identify him as a threat. Twenty minutes before Crooks fired a shot, he was spotted on the roof. A bullet grazed Trump’s ear. One audience member, Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed and two others – David Dutch, 57 and James Copenhaver, 57 – were badly wounded but are in a stable condition.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNewly revealed texts between the Beaver County emergency services team reveal that&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Text Message from Trump Before Assassination Attempt Shows Emergency Effort to Find Cover for Officers on Vacation or Injured&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/text-message-from-trump-before-assassination-attempt-shows-emergency-effort-to-find-cover-for-officers-on-vacation-or-injured/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/29/23/87919539-13686083-image-a-1_1722291879884.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:08:43","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":252919590,"title":"Kamala Harris’ fracking ban comes under fire in Pennsylvania as Veep tries to reverse course: ‘Out of step’","text":"BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Vice President Kamala Harris’ inconsistent position on a hydraulic fracking ban is threatening to undermine her electability in oil-rich Pennsylvania. “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” the then-presidential candidate told a climate activist at a CNN town hall in 2019. Senate candidate Dave McCormick and other Pennsylvania Republicans have been quick to highlight what such a ban would mean for the Keystone State as Harris attempts to change course on the issue. “The Biden-Harris-[Sen. Bob] Casey energy agenda has essentially been to stop fossil fuels, and transition from lithium batteries and solar panels from China,” McCormick said on “Fox and Friends” Friday, adding: “It truly is out of step [with] where most Pennsylvanians are.” A McCormick campaign ad released last week featured similar attacks on Harris’ energy record, including her support for the Green New Deal — a series of progressive policy initiatives designed to phase out fossil fuels in America. Donald Trump Jr. and Ric Grenell are among other high-profile Republicans slamming Harris on X last week for her position on fracking. “Kamala Harris is even more extreme than Joe Biden – She wants to ban fracking and kill countless jobs in states like PA for American workers,” Trump Jr. wrote. “Dear Pennsylvania… take it from this Californian, don’t let Kamala Harris anywhere near your energy sources,” wrote former Director of National Intelligence Grenell. Perhaps such attacks are driving the Harris campaign’s recent shift on the issue? As of this weekend, Harris’ campaign claims she no longer supports a fracking ban, with a Harris campaign spokesperson telling The Hill that Donald Trump’s energy policies would “enrich oil and gas executives at the expense of the middle class.” Trump had criticized Harris’ support for a fracking ban at his North Carolina rally last Wednesday. Back on the left, Pennsylvania Democrat Conor Lamb — a once-promising young congressman who lost to John Fetterman in the 2022 Senate primary — praised the Harris’ pivot. “A good leader learns in public and isn’t afraid to admit when they change their mind,” Lamb tweeted Monday morning. With Trump set to rally in Pennsylvania’s capital this Wednesday, the former prez is likely to push the issue. Recent polls show Harris gaining on Trump nationally when compared to outgoing President Joe Biden, though Trump maintains a narrow lead across most swing states.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris’ inconsistent position on a hydraulic fracking ban is threatening to undermine her electability in oil-rich Pennsylvania.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/29/us-news/kamala-harris-fracking-ban-comes-under-fire-in-pennsylvania-as-veep-tries-to-reverse-course-out-of-step/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/vice-president-kamala-harris-delivers-86376352.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/aUCTQhMd-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:06:51","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":252920188,"title":"Iran seeks to undermine Trump ahead of election, officials signal","text":"Iran is working to stoke societal discord in the United States and undermine Donald Trump’s bid to regain the White House — as it tried to do four years ago, U.S. intelligence officials signaled Monday in a new assessment of the disinformation landscape ahead of November’s election.

The plan — which comes after a string of terms in which the court’s conservative supermajority preached judicial restraint while gutting landmark precedents — is entirely unattainable in the short term. And it’s thin on details. Among the open questions is whether some of the proposed reforms could withstand efforts by the Supreme Court itself to strike them down. “We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power and restore faith in the Supreme Court,” Biden said in a speech Monday afternoon in Austin, where he rehashed his proposals without fleshing out the logistics. Yet the move signals a key shift in the political discourse: Once the stuff of progressive pipe dreams, now even staunch centrists like Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee who quickly co-signed the president’s proposals, want to address the court’s outsized power. Though Biden stopped short of proposing to expand the court to even out its ideological imbalance, which a slight majority of Americans have endorsed in recent polling, the announcement marks a course change for the president. Biden, an institutionalist who defended the filibuster until the Dobbs decision in 2022, has finally started playing checks-and-balances chicken with a judiciary that continues to consolidate its own authority while pretending to be above the political fray. As previewed in an op-ed for the Washington Post, Biden’s plan has three basic proposals. First is to override the court’s recent decision about far-reaching presidential immunity by amending the Constitution itself. Although fanciful given the difficulty of the constitutional amendment process, this is also Biden’s most concrete proposal. Unlike his other proposals, this one includes a specific mechanism of binding the court to 21st-century realities about presidential power, instead of cherrypicking from the musings of Alexander Hamilton and his fellow founders. So far, Biden hasn’t proposed how he might accomplish his other two proposals: an 18-year term limit for Supreme Court justices, and an enforceable ethics code. Both provisions implicate Justice Clarence Thomas, who has been on the country’s highest bench since 1991 and who refused to recuse from cases stemming from the January 6 insurrection this term despite his wife’s deep involvement in Donald Trump’s “Stop the Steal” efforts to reverse his loss in the 2020 election. There are serious debates about whether these two measures would require constitutional amendments or if Congress has the authority to enact them in some fashion through legislation. The cross-ideological commission Biden appointed in 2021 — before the Supreme Court tossed Roe v. Wade and other bedrock doctrines — produced almost 300 pages of collective, heavily footnoted shrugs on such questions. Many Democrats are eager to at least try the legislation route, even if court reform bills will just wind up before the Supreme Court upon inevitable challenge. “It’s time for Congress to take significant action on Supreme Court ethics and term limits reform,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., wrote on X following Biden’s proposal. “I’ve got legislation to get it done.” Whitehouse’s bill, which would create a process to disqualify justices from particular cases and require the Supreme Court to draft its own ethics code, among other provisions, has dozens of co-sponsors and passed favorably out of the Judiciary Committee but is unlikely to pass the full Senate. Setting aside, again, the moonshot logistics and the unresolved particulars, Biden’s announcement is significant for its frank, if belated, diagnosis: There aren’t meaningful checks on the Supreme Court.","summary":"Once the stuff of progressive pipe dreams, now even centrists like Biden are questioning the court’s outsized power.\n\n\nThe post Now a Lame Duck, Biden Finally Floats Supreme Court Reforms appeared first on The Intercept.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2024/07/29/biden-supreme-court-reform-presidential-immunity-ethics/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24211739656366.jpg?fit=4000%2C2667","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:02:54","author":"Shawn Musgrave","authors":["Shawn Musgrave"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.217},{"id":252919214,"title":"Biden’s illegitimate ‘reforms’ are a nakedly political bid to tilt the Supreme Court on his way out","text":"Kamala Harris is so moderate that she only wants to pack the Supreme Court by stealth. By poorly disguised stealth, to be sure, but it’s difficult to obscure the intended destruction of an institution of American government. The newly minted Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed President Biden’s plan for Supreme Court “reform,” the centerpiece of which is a proposal for an 18-year term limit that would immediately usher Justices John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito off the court. This is court-packing by another name. Biden also wants an enforceable ethics code imposed on the court and a Constitutional amendment saying that presidents don’t have immunity from prosecution for their official acts, countering the Supreme Court’s recent decision on this question. Harris is strongly in favor: “These popular reforms will help to restore confidence in the court, strengthen our democracy and ensure no one is above the law.” They will do none of the above. As a matter of basic legitimacy, foundational rules of government should be fashioned without knowing which party or faction will benefit from, or be harmed by, them. The term-limits idea, in contrast, is obviously crafted to undo the effect of Democrats losing the 2016 election and handing Donald Trump three Supreme Court appointments. (The left wasn’t agitating for term limits when the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg, who joined the court in 1993, had already served more than 20 years — they were cheering her on.) No one is going to have more trust in the court after it’s been kneecapped for partisan purposes. If the Romans created a desert and called it peace, the Democrats want to blow up the court and call it restored. The court-packing scheme is another way station in Biden’s sad slide left. Years ago, he spoke of FDR’s attempted court-packing — also sold as a reform to freshen up the composition of the court — in harsh terms. Roosevelt had been “corrupted by power,” according to Biden. Then, he evaded the pressure from the left to endorse court-packing in 2020; now, he’s buckled to his party’s progressive base, yet again. But Biden has never paid the full political price for his leftward lurch. Until he pushed it too far, this is where Biden’s age helped him: It was hard to look at a frail old man who talked of being a working-class kid from Scranton and conclude that he was a radical. As a woke progressive from Oakland, Calif., Kamala Harris doesn’t have the same latitude. Her promise to destroy a pillar of our government won’t help moderate her image. Democrats are willing to do anything to address Donald Trump’s supposed threat to our norms and institutions, except honor those things themselves. Between Barack Obama and Joe Biden’s multiple lawless unilateral acts, they’ve done more than their part to normalize executive overreach. By never truly accepting the results of the 2016 election, they’ve contributed to the cycle of disputing the legitimacy of lost elections. By heedlessly opening the border, they’ve created precedent for ignoring unwelcome laws. By pursuing a strategy of lawfare against Trump, they’ve created the precedent for distorting the legal system to try to destroy a political opponent. And now they are going after the Supreme Court for the offense of issuing rulings that they don’t like — rulings, by the way, that may be flawed, but are well-reasoned according to a transparent, consistent theory of constitutional interpretation. The conservative justices, sticklers for the details and history of the law, are the opposite of everything the Democrats dislike about Donald Trump. That doesn’t matter, though, since the left isn’t opposed to Trumpism so much as anything that stands in the way of the unchecked implementation of its progressive vision. The most fruitful line of attack against Biden was that he was old, incompetent and a bad president. The best line of attack against Harris is that she’s a radical. By endorsing court-packing, she’s offering fresh evidence for the indictment.

Meadows, former President Donald Trump’s onetime chief of staff, argued in a petition, made public over the weekend, that federal court was the appropriate venue for the two election charges brought against him by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. “It is hard to imagine a case in which the need for a federal forum is more pressing than one that requires resolving novel questions about the duties and powers of one of the most important federal offices in the Nation,” Meadows’s attorneys wrote. Meadows’s petition to the Supreme Court comes after the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Meadows’s request in December. The former chief of staff’s argument to the appellate court was twofold. Meadows claimed that he should have his case removed to federal court, but this requires a federal defense. Meadows therefore said that his federal defense would be that the actions cited in Willis’s indictment were protected from prosecution because they were part of Meadows’s official duties as White House chief of staff. Meadows’s attorneys said the appellate court erred in ruling that former officials such as Meadows are not entitled to federal removal the same way current officials are. Additionally, the appellate court found Meadows’s actions cited in Willis’s indictment were not part of his official job duties. “That decision defies statutory text, context, history, and common sense,” Meadows’s attorneys wrote in their Supreme Court petition. The attorneys were able to heavily reference the Supreme Court’s decision that presidents enjoy absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for certain actions they perform in their official capacity. Meadows’s use of the decision, which the Supreme Court made in response to Trump’s election case in Washington, D.C., is the latest instance of the ruling’s reverberating effects. Trump has already wielded it in Florida and New York, and some of Trump’s co-defendants in Georgia, such as Meadows, were expected to make use of it, as well. “Just as immunity protection for former officers is critical to ensuring that current and future officers are not deterred from enthusiastic service, so too is the promise of a federal forum in which to litigate that defense,” Meadows’s attorneys wrote. Meadows’s petition comes more than seven months after the 11th Circuit denied Meadows’s request, an unusually lengthy duration for a defendant seeking the Supreme Court’s intervention in a case. Meadows’s attorneys had asked in May for an extension to file their request, in part because Trump’s immunity case was still pending at the time.

PG&E’s business model isn’t working on behalf of its ratepaying customers. In addition, PG&E is blaming higher rates on efforts to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, is dragging its feet on modernizing its distribution system. Their implementation of NEM 3.0, reducing credits to solar homeowners, suggests that they don’t want to transform to a more distributed electricity infrastructure that uses more rooftop solar generation. The investor-owned business model in California needs to change from one strictly focused on profit to one more focused on transition over time to more distributed, fully renewable sources of electricity. The 19th-century model of central power and long transmission lines is out of date. Rob Hogue Menlo Park Congress embraces Israel’s brutal war Re: “Israel’s Netanyahu defends war, praises U.S. alliance” (Page A4, July 25). I watched the beginning of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress until I could no longer watch it due to disgust at what I heard, including repeated applause by the Congress. How dare the Congress invite Netanyahu, accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. How dare the Congress applaud almost every statement he made, however disgusting. I bet Netanyahu did not mention Israeli tactics used against civilians including withholding food, fuel, water, sanitation and medical supplies, and the destruction of housing and hospitals, all required to support the civilian population. I bet Netanyahu did not mention that Palestinian civilians live in tents in intense heat and are constantly shifted from area to area before they are again bombed. Congress epitomized what one thinks when one hears the expression “useful idiot,” … or “bought and paid for.” Utterly disgusting. Larry Dorshkind Redwood City Vance all too willing to subvert elections Re: “How a ‘never-Trumper’ turned running mate” (Page A7, July 18). JD Vance isn’t the only “never-Trumper” who sings a different tune today. Mike Johnson, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz and Mick Mulvaney all described Donald Trump as unfit, in graphic terms, in 2015 into 2016. After Trump’s election in 2016, those critics all verified that winning is the best deodorant. Vance’s most striking comment for me was that he would not have certified the 2020 election, requiring states to provide multiple slates of electors for Congress to “fight over.” Vance would do what Trump’s actual vice president, who honored his oath, refused to do. Gives some insight into Vance’s selection to the ticket. Richard DeBolt San Jose Price of cost of living is our quality of life Re: “Eye-popping costs intensify housing crisis” (Page A6, July 26). Families, low-wage workers and students are finding it impossible to survive the high cost of housing in California. Construction workers need a decent wage for the amount of labor-intensive work that they do. Imagine building a home you cannot afford under a hot sun. The only way for many of these people to live here is to live in crowded homes or to be homeless. The rent is not the only thing that is worrisome. The food, utilities, gasoline and all the other necessities are too expensive. Necessary wages have also become too expensive for businesses and taxpayers. California is losing its quality of life because it costs too much for too many people. Patricia Marquez Rutt Redwood City Let’s expand telecommuting options I strongly support expanding telecommuting options in the Bay Area. As home to many tech companies, the region has transitioned to remote work during the pandemic, proving its feasibility and numerous benefits. Telecommuting increases productivity and work-life balance for employees while reducing overhead costs and broadening the talent pool for employers. It also addresses chronic traffic congestion and pollution, and enhances residents’ quality of life. It also promotes workforce inclusivity, benefiting parents, caregivers, individuals with disabilities and those living in affordable areas. Embracing telecommuting aligns with the Bay Area’s innovative spirit and sustainability commitments, providing numerous benefits. I encourage local leaders to support this shift.

Vance, who has faced widespread mockery for his attacks on “childless cat ladies,” claimed that Harris wants to end the child tax credit in a so-far failed effort to move on from his proposals to favor parents over others. “A lot of parents and a lot of non-parents look at our public policy for the last four years and ask: How did we get to a place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?” Vance, 39, said in a Fox News interview Sunday night. Vance’s claim about Harris is flat-out false. In fact, the Biden administration dramatically increased the credit during the COVID-19 pandemic and pushed for its extension. Vance and his Republican allies in the Senate killed that effort a few months ago. The Harris campaign today lobbed new attacks on Vance, a first-term senator from Ohio, calling him too inexperienced to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. “(He’s) one of the most unprepared people that we have ever put up to hold the vice presidency of the United States,” said Mitch Landrieu, co-chair of Harris’s campaign, told CNN. The newly minted No. 2 pick on former President Donald Trump’s ticket is facing a second week of questions about his less-than-optimal rollout after being unveiled at the Republican National Convention. After delivering an underwhelming speech at the RNC, Vance has been dogged by myriad questions about his far-right views, which Democrats have branded as “weird.” He was caught on tape suggesting that Democrats cannot be trusted with America’s future because they are led by unhappy people without biological children like Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Vance has also proposed giving more votes to parents of young children, an idea that would violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection for all, including those he derides as “childless cat ladies.” Trump has been surprisingly slow to defend Vance against the backlash over his remarks, sparking speculation that the GOP could even swap him out for a candidate with less baggage. Democrats may seek to keep Vance’s missteps in the public eye as Harris considers making her own vice presidential pick as early as this week. She was catapulted into the top spot on the Democratic ticket when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and backed her. Top candidates for the No. 2 Democratic slot include more experienced political figures like Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Buttigieg and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.","summary":"Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has falsely accused Vice President Kamala Harris of opposing the child tax credit as he seeks to turn the page from his rocky debut on the national stage.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/29/breaking-news/vance-falsely-claims-harris-opposes-child-tax-credit-in-walkback/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_20240729_brk_jdv01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 23:00:00","author":"Tribune News Service","authors":["Tribune News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":252919250,"title":"Biden unveils plan for Supreme Court changes, calls for term limits and ethics rules","text":"US President Joe Biden has unveiled a long-awaited proposal for changes at the US Supreme Court, calling on Congress to establish term limits and an enforceable ethics code for the court’s nine justices. He is also pressing lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity. The White House on Monday detailed the contours of Biden’s court proposal, one that appears to have little chance of being approved by a closely divided Congress with just 99 days to go before election day. Still, Democrats hope it will help focus voters as they consider their choices in a tight election. The likely Democratic nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has sought to frame her race against Republican ex-president Donald Trump as “a choice between freedom and chaos’, quickly endorsed the Biden proposal. She added that the changes are needed because “there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court”. The White House is looking to tap into the growing outrage among Democrats about the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, issuing opinions that overturned landmark decisions on abortion rights and federal regulatory powers that stood for decades. Liberals also have expressed dismay over revelations about what they say are questionable relationships and decisions by some members of the conservative wing of the court that suggest their impartiality is compromised. “I have great respect for our institutions and separation of powers,” Biden argues in a Washington Post article published on Monday. “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms. We now stand in a breach.” Harris in a statement said the reforms being proposed “will help to restore confidence in the Court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law”. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called the proposal a “dangerous gambit” that would be “dead on arrival in the House”. The president planned to speak about his proposal later on Monday during an address at the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. Biden is calling for doing away with lifetime appointments to the court. He says Congress should pass legislation to establish a system in which the sitting president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in service on the court. He argues term limits would help ensure that court membership changes with some regularity and adds a measure of predictability to the nomination process. He also wants Congress to pass legislation establishing a court code of ethics that would require justices to disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest. Biden also is calling on Congress to pass a constitutional amendment reversing the Supreme Court’s recent landmark immunity ruling that determined former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. That decision extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against Trump on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss and all but ended prospects the former president could be tried before the November election. Most Americans supported some form of age limit for Supreme Court justices in an AP-NORC poll from August 2023. Two-thirds wanted Supreme Court justices to be required to retire by a certain age. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to favour a mandatory retirement age, 77 per cent to 61 per cent. Americans across age groups tend to agree on the desire for age limits – those age 60 and over were as likely as any other age group to be in favour of this limit for Supreme Court justices. The first three justices who would potentially be affected by term limits are on the right. Justice Clarence Thomas has been on the court for nearly 33 years. Chief Justice John Roberts has served for 19 years, and Justice Samuel Alito has served for 18. Supreme Court justices served an average of about 17 years from the founding until 1970, said Gabe Roth, executive director of the group Fix the Court. Since 1970, the average has been about 28 years. Both conservative and liberal politicians alike have espoused term limits. “If justices have this much power, then they should be individuals who reflect America as it currently is, not the America of 30 or 40 years ago, the dead hand of the president who appointed them still influencing policy,” Roth said. An enforcement mechanism for the High Court’s code of ethics, meanwhile, could bring the Supreme Court justices more in line with other federal judges, who are subject to a disciplinary system in which anyone can file a complaint and have it reviewed. An investigation can result in censure and reprimand. Last week, Justice Elena Kagan called publicly for creating a way to enforce the new ethics code, becoming the first justice to do so. Still, when it comes to the Supreme Court, creating an ethics code enforcement mechanism is not as easy as it sounds. The attorney general has always had the power to enforce violations of the financial and gift disclosure rules but has never apparently used that power against federal judges, said Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert at NYU School of Law. The body that oversees lower court judges, meanwhile, is headed by Roberts, “who might be reluctant to use whatever power the conference has against his colleagues”, Gillers wrote in an email. The last time Congress ratified an amendment to the Constitution was 32 years ago. The 27th Amendment, ratified in 1992, states that Congress can pass a bill changing the pay for members of the House and the Senate, but such a change cannot take effect until after the next November elections are held for the House. Trump has decried court reform as a desperate attempt by Democrats to “Play the Ref”. “The Democrats are attempting to interfere in the Presidential Election, and destroy our Justice System, by attacking their Political Opponent, ME, and our Honourable Supreme Court. We have to fight for our Fair and Independent Courts, and protect our Country,” Trump posted on his Truth Social site this month. There have been increasing questions surrounding the ethics of the court after revelations about some of the justices, including that Thomas accepted luxury trips from a Republican megadonor. Democrats say the Biden effort will help put a bright spotlight on recent High Court decisions, including the 2022 ruling stripping away women’s constitutional protections for abortion, by the conservative-majority court that includes three justices appointed by Trump. The announcement marks a remarkable evolution for Biden, who as a candidate had been wary of calls to reform the High Court. But over the course of his presidency, he has become increasingly vocal about his belief that the court has abandoned mainstream constitutional interpretation.","summary":"US president is also pressing lawmakers to ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272392/biden-unveils-plan-supreme-court-changes-calls-term-limits-and-ethics-rules","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/30/d880e393-eb2b-405c-8a86-534cd13f26b5_5ee1d6b5.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/WEB%20-%20Biden%20drop.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:59:39","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":252919626,"title":"Odd moment Biden calls lawmaker ‘dead on arrival’ for ripping his Supreme Court reform plan","text":"President Joe Biden (right) bizarrely called Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson (left) ‘dead on arrival’ after the lawmaker slammed his Supreme Court overhaul proposal (Pictures: AP/REX) President Joe Biden had some strong words for a US lawmaker who called his proposal to drastically reform the Supreme Court ‘dead on arrival’.

It's time for us to come to see that every American gets a decent break and a fair chance to make good,\" Biden said in remarks at the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas. The Civil Rights Act was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and outlawed segregation in business establishments, public schools and other public places, while prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The act also established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \"A defining moment that has since opened doors for all Americans regardless of race, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religion, national origin. Together with the Voting Rights Act and the Fair Housing Act, these three landmark laws he signed are remarkable,\" Biden said. \"Now, we live in a different era. In recent years, extreme opinions that the Supreme Court has handed down have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.\" \"In 2022, the court overrode Roe v. Wade and the right to choose. It had been the law of the land for 50 years,\" Biden said. \"And most recently and most shockingly, the Supreme Court established in Trump v. The United States a dangerous precedent. They ruled as you know that the president of the United States has immunity for potential crimes he may have committed while in office.\" Earlier Monday, Biden proposed major changes to the Supreme Court and called on Congress to pass limits on presidential immunity, in the wake of the court's recent ruling on a case brought by former President Donald Trump, in addition to a \"binding\" code of ethics to curb conflicts of interest and term limits for Supreme Court justices. \"I served as a U.S. senator for 36 years, including as a chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I have overseen more Supreme Court nominations as senator, vice president and president than anyone living today,\" Biden said. \"We've had term limits for presidents of the United States for nearly 75 years after the Truman administration. And I believe we should have term limits for Supreme Court justices of the United States, as well.\" While there are no term limits for the U.S. House or Senate, Biden is proposing term limits for the Supreme Court of 18 years, with presidential appointments every two years. \"I'm also calling for a constitutional amendment, called 'No one is Above the Law Amendment,'\" Biden added. \"It holds there is no immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office.\" \"And I'm calling for a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court.

Originally scheduled to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, the event became a platform for Biden to outline his vision for reforming the nation's highest court.The President's package, which demands \"bold reforms\" in an opinion piece for The Washington Post, represents one of the most significant attempts to modify the Supreme Court's structure since its inception.Newsweek contacted Biden's office via email on Monday for comment.Biden expressed grave concerns about recent court decisions, particularly regarding presidential immunity. \"For all practical purposes, the court's decision almost certainly means that the president can violate the oath, flout our laws and face no consequences,\" he said. \"Folks, just imagine what a president could do trampling civil rights and liberties, given such immunity.\"\"I believe the best structure is the 18-year term limit that would help ensure the country would not have what it has now: an extreme court,\" Biden stated. He described these proposals as \"common sense reforms that a vast majority of Americans support.\"Biden also warned about the potential consequences of conservative plans for sweeping policy changes in a potential second Donald Trump administration, known as Project 2025. \"They're serious, man,\" he cautioned. \"They're planning another onslaught attacking civil rights in America.\"The President praised landmark legislation passed during the Johnson administration, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act. \"Taken together, these three acts have made this nation fundamentally more fair, fundamentally more just and, most importantly, fundamentally more consistent with our founding principles,\" Biden said.However, he shared concern that recent court decisions had \"eviscerated\" efforts from affirmative action to voting rights, warning that another Trump presidency would push the court into more extreme territory.Former President Trump has called the plan to reform \"unconstitutional\" and \"illegal\" in a post on Truth Social.\"The Radical Left Democrats are desperately trying to 'Play the Ref' by calling for an illegal and unConstitutional attack on our SACRED United States Supreme Court.

The warning comes after a tumultuous few weeks in U.S. politics that have prompted Russia, Iran and China to revise their propaganda playbook rapidly. What hasn’t changed, intelligence officials said, is their determination to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims about American democracy to undermine faith in the election. “The American public should know that content that they read online — especially on social media — could be foreign propaganda, even if it appears to be coming from fellow Americans or originating in the United States,” said an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director. Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, authorities said, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024. Groups linked to the Kremlin are increasingly hiring marketing and communications firms located within Russia as both a way to outsource the work of creating campaigns and as a way to hide their tracks, the officials said during the briefing with reporters. Two such firms were the subject of new U.S. sanctions announced in March. Authorities say the two Russian companies created fake websites and social media profiles to spread Kremlin disinformation. The disinformation can focus on the candidates or voting, or on issues that are already the subject of debates in the U.S., such as immigration, crime or the war in Gaza. The ultimate goal, however, is to get Americans to spread Russian disinformation without questioning its origin. People are far more likely to trust and repost information that they believe is coming from a domestic source, officials said. Fake websites designed to mimic U.S. news outlets and AI-generated social media profiles are just two methods. In some cases, Americans and American tech companies and media outlets have willingly amplified and parroted the messages of the Kremlin. “Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand, and getting Americans to do it,” said the official, who spoke alongside officials from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last month that he worries the U.S. may be more vulnerable to foreign disinformation this year than it was before the 2020 election. On Monday he said the warning from intelligence officials shows the U.S. election is “in the bullseye of bad actors across the globe.” “It also, disturbingly, emphasizes the extent to which foreign actors – and particularly Russia – rely on both unwitting and witting Americans to promote foreign-aligned narratives in the United States,” Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement. In one measure of the threat, officials tracking foreign disinformation say they have issued twice the number of warnings to political candidates, government leaders, election offices and others targeted by foreign groups so far in the 2024 election cycle than they did in the 2022 cycle. Officials won’t disclose how many warnings were issued, or who received them, but said the significant uptick reflects heightened interest in the presidential race by America’s adversaries as well as improved efforts by the government to identify and warn of such threats. The warnings are given so the targets can take steps to protect themselves and set the record straight if necessary. Russia and other countries are also quickly pivoting to exploit some of the recent developments in the presidential race, including the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump as well as President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Following the attack on Trump, for instance, Russian disinformation agencies quickly amplified claims that Democratic rhetoric led to the shooting, or even baseless conspiracy theories suggesting that Biden or the Ukrainian government orchestrated the attempt. “These pro-Russian voices sought to tie the assassination attempt with Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine,” concluded the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which tracks Russian disinformation. Intelligence officials have in the past determined that Russian propaganda appeared designed to support Trump, and officials said Monday they have not changed that assessment. Eroding support for Ukraine remains a top objective of Russian disinformation, and Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past and is seen as less supportive of NATO. While China mounted a sprawling disinformation campaign before Taiwan’s recent election, the nation has shown much more caution when it comes to the U.S. Beijing may use disinformation to target congressional races or other down-ballot contests in which a candidate has voiced strong opinions on China. But China isn’t expected to try to influence the presidential race, the officials said Monday. Xie Feng, the Chinese ambassador to the U.S., said Monday that his government has no intention to interfere with U.S. politics. Iran, however, has taken a more aggressive posture. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said earlier this month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and have provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said. Iran opposes candidates likely to increase tension with Tehran, officials said. That description fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of a top Iranian general. Messages left with representatives from the Russian and Iranian governments were not immediately returned Monday. « Previous Next","summary":"Tumultuous U.S. politics in recent weeks have prompted Russia, Iran and China to revise their propaganda playbook rapidly.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/07/29/russia-relies-on-unwitting-americans-to-spread-election-disinformation-u-s-officials-say/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Election_2022_Fighting_Misinformation_22584_f8cdd7-1722297162.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:51:45","author":"David Klepper,DAVID KLEPPER - Associated Press","authors":["David Klepper","DAVID KLEPPER - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.069},{"id":252919878,"title":"A man from Florida reportedly made violent threats against Trump on Facebook.","text":"Disturbing new details have been revealed in the case of a Florida man who allegedly posted a series of Facebook threats to kill former President Donald Trump, and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Michael Martin Wiseman, 68, stands accused of one count of written or electronic threats to kill or do bodily harm, according to court documents obtained by Law&Crime from the Jupiter Police Department through a public records request. Earlier this month, the outlines of the allegations in the case were sketched out in less-descriptive Palm Beach County Jail records. The threats in question were made mere days after an assassin’s bullet narrowly avoided taking Trump’s life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Some of the pro-violence comments cited by law enforcement appear to reference the assassination attempt. An investigation into Wiseman began after law enforcement received “multiple online crime tips” about the alleged threats, according to police. Residents of the Sunshine State coastal city also expressed “in person” concerns about the defendant, police say. “Trump and Vance should be murdered before turning us in to West Russia,” one alleged Facebook post reads, according to the probable cause affidavit filed in the case. Law enforcement cited three additional Facebook posts. The affidavit reads: “READY, AIM, FIRE. RINSE AND REPEAT” (with an image of President Donald J. Trump’s face in the crosshairs of a sniper scope) “I am advocating Trump and Vance’s daughters get raped and THEN tell me they won’t fly their kids out of the USA for an abortion.” “Some people need to be better shots if they know they are going to kill a monster.” “Several other recent Facebook posts were noted, which praised the July 13, 2024 attempted assassination of President Donald J. Trump, and were encouraging in nature for others to attempt the same,” the court document continues. Police also identified a Threads social media account — which is a feature on Instagram that aims to compete with X (formerly Twitter) in the microblogging online landscape — and attributed Wiseman to posts that, by all measures, glorify the Butler shooting. “The shooter missed,” one post begins. “He can’t be the only patriot. ––––sucker, mother and daughter ––––er Trump.” The second Threads post cited in the affidavit reads: “Why is Trump allowed to be alive? We need to train patriots. Thomas Matthew Crooks deserves a posthumous Congressional Medal of Honor, a stamp, and a national holiday.” In the affidavit, police describe Mirandizing Wiseman and discussing the Facebook posts “which were threatening in nature” but several portions of the document are redacted. Wiseman was interviewed and arrested on July 19. He was arraigned the next morning with his wife present, according to court records. Dozens of documents have already been filed in the case, but few are available on the public docket. Prosecutors moved for the defendant to remain in pretrial detention — arguing he is a threat to the community and that he is charged with a “dangerous crime,” which, in Wiseman’s case, means a felony in the first degree. Typically, under Florida law, the crime Wiseman is charged with is considered a second-degree felony punishable by up to 40 years in prison. Judge Cymonie Rowe agreed with the state and ordered the defendant to remain in jail pending a hearing. He is also ordered not to have any contact with the alleged victims or their families. Wiseman has pleaded not guilty to the lone count against him. Several previous court dates have been canceled or reset in the case so far. The final form of the charges appears to be up in the air — the state has until Aug. 29 to file additional charges.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeft: Michael Wiseman (Palm Beach County Jail).

But he used his speech in Texas, part of the library’s commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, to also criticize former President Donald Trump and Project 2025, in addition to promoting Vice President Kamala Harris, now his party’s presumptive standard-bearer. “The president is no longer constrained by the law,” he said. “The only limits on abuse of power will be self-imposed by the president alone. That’s a fundamentally flawed view and a fundamentally flawed principle.” Biden’s Supreme Court reforms include term limits and a binding code of conduct for justices, as well as a constitutional amendment ensuring former presidents are not immune from prosecution for crimes committed in office, a direct response to the court’s decision in Trump v. United States. Biden opened by praising Johnson, whose footsteps he followed last week when he, like Johnson before him in 1968, delivered an Oval Office address confirming that, as an incumbent president, he would not seek reelection months before voters begin casting their ballots. “As a kid coming up, I always admired President Johnson for his public service, whether as a school teacher in South Texas, a master of the United States Senate, a historic vice president and president,” he said. “His philosophy was simple: in a great society, no one, no one should be left behind.” Biden was warmly welcomed by the audience and detoured from his prepared remarks to speak at length about his decision to pursue politics. Biden was supposed to appear at the library on July 15, but the event was rescheduled due to the attempt on Trump’s life the weekend before. Instead, the president taped an interview with NBC‘s Lester Holt before being diagnosed with COVID-19 later that week. The White House conceded en route to Texas that Biden’s reforms would be difficult to turn from recommendations into reality, particularly as some would require congressional approval and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has already described them as “dead on arrival.” “We’re going to have to count on members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, outside of the aisle, listening to the constituents here,” Office of Public Engagement Director Steve Benjamin told reporters on Air Force One. At Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Biden told the same reporters the White House and congressional Democrats would find “a way” to pass the reforms. At the library, he added Johnson’s thinking was “dead on arrival.” In an opinion piece published by the Washington Post, Biden wrote that, as a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he has a “great respect for our institutions and separation of powers.” “What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms,” Biden wrote Monday morning. “We now stand in a breach.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “We can and must prevent the abuse of presidential power,” he continued. “We can and must restore the public’s faith in the Supreme Court. We can and must strengthen the guardrails of democracy. In America, no one is above the law. In America, the people rule.” Harris has also expressed support for Biden’s reforms, indicating she would advocate them next year if she becomes president.","summary":"President Joe Biden has embarked on his long goodbye to the White House, calling for the Supreme Court to be reformed one week after stepping down as the 2024 presumptive Democratic nominee. &#8220;I have great respect for our institutions and the separation of powers laid out in our Constitution, but what&#8217;s happening now is not [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3103280/biden-dings-supreme-court-trump-lbj/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/biden-supreme-court-1-scaled.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:42:51","author":"Naomi Lim","authors":["Naomi Lim"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.226},{"id":252922008,"title":"Venezuelan elections impact felt all across the Americas","text":"Venezuelan elections impact felt all across the Americas Sunday's elections in Venezuela are rapidly shedding their consequences in other parts of the Americas as reactions from leaders everywhere shape up the geopolitical landscape for the months to come. Former Argentine President Mauricio Macri (2015-2019) said that he hoped that the leftwing Brazilian Government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva would stand by the Venezuelan people after Sunday's elections which Nicolás Maduro claimed to have won with 51.2% of the vote according to the National Electoral Council (CNE). “I hope that President Lula, whom I consider a democrat, regardless of our ideological differences, will not remain silent,” Macri wrote on X. “What is happening in Venezuela is an attack against democracy and it is an enormous risk that this dictatorship will last in our region. Venezuelans and many leaders of Latin America and the world are waiting for your word in this difficult moment.” “What happened today in Venezuela was a disgrace. Dictator Nicolás Maduro used military force for cheating after losing to Edmundo González. I am calling on Dictator Maduro to resign! We must have voter ID and Paper ballots or the same will happen here!,” warned former US President Donald Trump, who is campaigning to return to the White House. Joining Presidents Daniel Noboa of Ecuador, Gabriel Boric Font of Chile, and Argentina's Javier Milei among others who already said they would not acknowledge Maduro's victory, Uruguay's head of state Luis Lacalle Pou stressed: “Not like that! It was an open secret. They were going to 'win' regardless of the actual results.” “The process up to the day of the election and the scrutiny was clearly flawed. A triumph cannot be recognized if there is no confidence in the manner and mechanisms used to reach it,” he added. Senator and former Defense Minister Javier García pledged to “gather the necessary signatures to call for an extraordinary, serious, and urgent” Senate session in Montevideo “to pronounce ourselves on the fraud in Venezuela.” Those who did congratulate Maduro were Cuban President President Miguel Díaz-Canel and his predecessor Raúl Castro. “I spoke with brother Nicolás Maduro to convey warm congratulations on behalf of the Cuban Party, Government, and people for the historic electoral triumph achieved, after an impressive demonstration by the Venezuelan people,” wrote Díaz-Canel on social media. “Today the dignity and courage of the Venezuelan people triumphed over pressures and manipulations. I convey to brother President Maduro, our warm congratulations for this historic victory and Cuba's commitment to stand by the Bolivarian and Chavista Revolution,” he also noted. Maduro's victory “is that of the Bolivarian and Chavista people, they defeated the pro-imperialist opposition unequivocally. Thus, they also defeated the regional right-wing, the interferenceist and the Monroist right-wing. The people spoke and the Revolution won,” he underlined. “The triumph achieved by the Venezuelan people constitutes a convincing demonstration of the Civic-Military Union of the Bolivarian and Chavista people that has resisted the negative effects of the unjust unilateral coercive measures imposed by the Government of the United States, the violent acts and interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela,” Castro said. The Governments of Paraguay, Argentina, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay, issued a communiqué demanding a complete review of the electoral results in Venezuela, requesting the presence of independent observers. In response, Caracas expelled these countries' ambassadors from Venezuelan territory.","summary":"Sunday's elections in Venezuela are rapidly shedding their consequences in other parts of the Americas as reactions from leaders everywhere shape up the geopolitical landscape for the months to come.","url":"https://en.mercopress.com/2024/07/29/venezuelan-elections-impact-felt-all-across-the-americas","image":"https://en.mercopress.com/data/cache/noticias/100718/600x315/mugri.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-29 22:41:00","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"uy","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":252918762,"title":"I am convinced Kamala Harris will be our next president","text":"Something like 65% of voters wanted candidates other than Joe Biden and Donald Trump running for President.
