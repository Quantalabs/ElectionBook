Fearing that someone was injured, some moved toward the sound to help, but were met with gunfire. \n\nA man police have identified as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, of Burton, Michigan, rammed his Chevy Silverado truck — adorned with a pair of American flags in the bed — through the church’s front door and began firing an assault rifle at the hundreds of gathered worshippers. At some point, he set the church ablaze while terrified congregants were still trapped in the building.\n\nBy the time the shooting was over, one victim was dead, 9 others were wounded, and Sanford was killed in a gunfight with police. Later in the day, a three more victims were declared dead; one from a gunshot wound, and two others who were found later in the evening inside the burned remains of the church. \n\nGrand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said during an 8pm press conference that there were still individuals unaccounted for, and that the church had not fully been cleared by first responders. Additional victims may be found. \n\nPhillip Cotter, who was a member of the church, teared up as he spoke to the Detroit Free Press. He did not attend services this morning, “I know everyone who was there,” he said. \n\n“I don't know what God has planned for us, but I trust him. Evil is alive; it's active. People are too casual to throw out terms that inflame others, weak minds.”\n\nAt 10:25 am, the Grand Blanc Police Department received a call that a mass shooting was underway. Within a minute, officers were on scene and responding to the situation. At some point during the attack, Sanford exited the church and began firing at cars and churchgoers in the parking lot. A Grand Blanc Township police officer and an officer from the state’s Department of Natural Resources were on-scene and fired at Sanford, killing him at 10:33 am. \n\nFirefighter first responders raced to the scene to help stop the blaze at the church while police and EMS workers tended to the wounded. \n\nJames Deir, the Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Detroit Field Division, said during the Sunday night press conference that agents located explosives during their investigation, though he did not say where the explosives were found. He did confirm that Thomas Jacob Sanford used gasoline to start the fire in the church.\n\nIn the hours after the shooting, there were also reportedly bomb threats called in to other area churches, according to Specialist Lieutenant Kim Vetter of the Michigan State Police. When asked if there was an active threat to the community, she advised residents to stay vigilant and report any unusual behavior, but did not confirm that there was an ongoing threat. \n\nOnce officers identified the shooter, a convoy of law enforcement officers traveled to his home in Burton to begin an investigation into his potential motives. Police deployed a bomb squad unit, including a robot, and used drones to search Sanford’s home, fearing that he may have rigged its interior with explosives. \n\nThe shooting came out of nowhere; one man, who was injured when the gunman fired a bullet through his windshield as he tried to escape with his wife, told Detroit 2 News that no one he had spoken with had ever seen Sanford before. \n\nReyne commended the members of the church for their bravery in the face of unimaginable violence, noting that many were shielding the children inside the building as they rushed them to safety. \n\n“Just hundreds of people, just practicing their faith,” Reyne said on the congregants. \n\n“We do believe that there were people up there that were near that fire and they were unable to get out of the church. So, we do believe we will find additional victims once we’re able to search that, once there’s no signs of a fire reigniting,” Reyne said. \n\nHe said he believes that the fire was intentionally started by Sanford. \n\nAt 5 pm, Reyne provided a second update, where he named the shooter and gave a brief update on the conditions of the wounded. At that time, no additional victims were added to the previous count. \n\nLittle is known of Sanford at this time. According to the New York Times, Sanford graduated from a high school near the church before joining the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nOne of Sanford’s neighbors, Randy Thronson, 71, told the Times that he knew the shooter, and said during the winter Sanford would plow his and his neighbors’ driveways for free. He noted that he had not spoken to the man for two years, but said he “seemed like a nice guy.”\n\nThe Clarkston News, a local paper in the area, published an article about Sanford in 2007 lauding his “stellar” military service, noting that he had reached the rank of sergeant at his duty station in Okinawa, Japan, before he was deployed to Fallujah, Iraq. \n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps released further information about Sanford’s service to NBC News. He was an organization automotive mechanic and vehicle recovery operator, and received the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal before he left the service. \n\nHis final posting was in the 2nd Maintenance Battalion of Combat Logistics Regiment 25 at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. \n\nHe reportedly was a father, and his son — who was born approximately 10 years ago – was diagnosed with hyperinsulinism, according to USA TODAY. Individuals with the rare disease have higher-than-normal levels of insulin, which can increase the risk of brain-related complications. \n\n“We found out Brantlee was having problems shortly after his birth,” Sanford said in a 2016 interview about his family’s medical struggles. “It was a nightmare for us. We were slowly realizing that Brantlee wasn’t a typical premature baby.\"\n\nThe child’s condition today and the state of Sanford’s family in the wake of the attack are currently unknown. \n\nPolice are still investigating a possible motive for the attack. \n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the violence shortly after the shooting occurred. \n\n“My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community,” Whitmer said in a social media post. “Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc close.”\n\nBy 1:08 pm, President Donald Trump acknowledged that he had been briefed on the shooting and provided the following statement in a post on Truth Social: \n\n“I have been briefed on the horrendous shooting that took place at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The FBI was immediately on scene, and will be leading the Federal Investigation, and providing full support to State and Local Officials. The suspect is dead, but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do. In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!”\n\nThe shooting marks the 324th mass shooting this year, according to data kept by the Gun Violence Archive. The archive defines a “mass shooting” as one in which four or more people, not including the shooter, are shot. \n\nLess than 24 hours before the church attack, Nigel Edge, another Marine veteran who deployed to Iraq, shot and killed three people and wounded five others at a crowded waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina. \n\nThe shooting is also the latest in a number of attacks focused on places of worship. \n\nOn August 27 — just a little over a month before Sanford’s attack — Robin Westman, 23, fired a gun through the windows of a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and wounding 14 others, as well as an elderly congregant. The group was praying at the time of the attack. Westman graduated from the school in 2017, and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. \n\nOn September 19, just over a week before the Michigan shooting, a 31-year-old man allegedly set fire to a synagogue in southwestern Florida. That individual has been charged with felony arson and felony criminal mischief to a house of worship.","summary":"Authorities believe the gunman, Thomas Jacob Sanford, deliberately started the fire after crashing truck into the church","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/michigan-lds-shooting-church-suspect-b2835403.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/28/19/14/SEI268107401.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gZZkottx-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-29 00:31:41","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.676},{"id":364331502,"title":"Academic calls for gradual growth of Hong Kong’s non-local university students","text":"Hong Kong should gradually expand its non-local university student numbers to carefully balance their learning experience, social acceptance and potential effects on the rental market, according to an academic specialising in education policy.\nJoshua Mok Ka-ho, provost and vice-president of Hang Seng University, also said the city had to increase efforts to attract more top-quality scholars and address high rental prices if it aimed to become an education hub.\nIn his annual policy address earlier this month, Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu proposed raising each public university’s enrolment cap for non-local undergraduate students to 50 per cent of local students, up from the current 40 per cent, starting from the next academic year.\nThis measure forms part of efforts to develop Hong Kong into an international education hub.\nMok said the new policy was on the right track but called for a progressive increase in the intake of non-local students, warning that a “bottleneck” in hostel availability would make it difficult for them to secure accommodation, thereby affecting their learning experience.\nHe added that a gradual expansion, rather than a sharp influx, would also help improve inclusiveness within society.\n“Readiness is not only about recruiting quality students, it’s about readiness in the society, whether the local community would be supportive, whether the housing market is good enough for supporting them,” Mok said.\nHe referred to Australia, where an excessive number of non-local students had caused public discontent, suggesting Hong Kong learned from overseas experiences as these challenges were common worldwide.\nThe Australian government introduced limits on international student enrolment last year in response to rising rental prices driven by record immigration.\nMok also cautioned against treating the 50 per cent quota as a “performance indicator,” emphasising that universities should prioritise quality of learning and integration.\nHang Seng University, a self-financing institution not funded by the University Grants Committee, does not benefit from the increased quota for non-local students.\nIn February, the Education Bureau announced a phased increase in the quota for students from mainland China, Macau and Taiwan at six self-financing institutions, from between 10 and 20 per cent to 40 per cent, starting this academic year.\nHang Seng University admitted around 600 non-local students in 2025–26, accounting for 26 per cent of its 2,300 new undergraduates, a 10-point increase from the previous year, according to Mok.\n\nMok, also chair professor of comparative policy at the university, has been conducting a research project funded by the Chief Executive’s Policy Unit since June. The study examines factors influencing PhD students’ choice of destination and strategies adopted by foreign countries to attract them.\nIt involves interviews with more than 50 professors, administrators and students, alongside a global survey.\nPreliminary findings revealed that high rental prices in Hong Kong deterred some interviewees, while others expressed concerns about the availability of school places for their children. Mok called for more housing support for researchers and postdoctoral fellows.\nPolitical stability and policy certainty were key factors in PhD students’ decisions, with some interviewees expressing pessimism due to United States President Donald Trump’s policies targeting international students and rising far-right sentiment in Britain.\nMok said Hong Kong should seize the opportunity to promote itself as an education hub and attract more world-leading scholars, which was vital for drawing PhD students from abroad.\n“Education is about whether we have very strong professors, we have to invest in people, and then we draw the students,” he said.\nHe added that the city also needed to improve its research environment and build well-established laboratory facilities.\nIn July, Mok released another study he led, which found that 85 per cent of children of talent scheme professionals were dissatisfied with life in Hong Kong, citing a lack of social recognition and struggles with Cantonese as major concerns.\nHe suggested the government and universities collaborate with NGOs and churches to help non-local students adapt to life in Hong Kong.\nMok recalled a visit by mainland students to a retirement home, where they felt encouraged to realise that the residents also spoke Cantonese with a strong accent, just like them.\nApart from facilities, it was also important to provide newcomers with sufficient language and social support as “cultural integration matters”, he said.\nNon-local students in Hong Kong are predominantly from the mainland. In 2024–25, 17,161 non-local students attended Hong Kong’s eight publicly funded universities, with 12,386 of them, or 72 per cent, from the mainland.\nThe city’s leader has vowed to diversify local campuses by attracting more overseas students, especially from Belt and Road Initiative countries.\nMok echoed the need to diversify local campuses, saying the city could also draw students from African countries, which had strong ties with the mainland.","summary":"Hong Kong should gradually expand its non-local university student numbers to carefully balance their learning experience, social acceptance and potential effects on the rental market, according to an academic specialising in education policy.\nJoshua Mok Ka-ho, provost and vice-president of Hang Seng University, also said the city had to increase efforts to attract more top-quality scholars and address high rental prices if it aimed to become an education hub.\nIn his annual policy address...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3327148/academic-calls-gradual-growth-hong-kongs-non-local-university-students","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/28/6baf4f21-24a3-41b4-ada9-2cb3b753cc6e_b4fbc51e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 00:30:11","author":"Matthew Cheng","authors":["Matthew Cheng"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":364333572,"title":"Pentagon sends National Guard troops to Portland to support ICE","text":"Department of homeland security officials patrol the gates of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. (AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to be deployed under federal authority while the state filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's move to send military forces into the Democratic-run city of Portland.\nThe Republican president on Saturday announced plans to send troops into Portland, saying they would be used to protect federal immigration facilities against \"domestic terrorists\" and that he was authorising them to use \"full force, if necessary.\"\nTrump's deployments of military forces into other municipalities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles and Washington, DC, have spurred legal challenges and protests.\nOregon's suit was filed against Trump, Hegseth and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem in federal court in Portland on Sunday by Democratic Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield. The suit accused Trump of exceeding his powers.\n\"Citing nothing more than baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext - the President says Portland is a 'War ravaged' city 'under siege' from 'domestic terrorists.' Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon's sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,\" the lawsuit said.\nThe lawsuit stated that protests against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in Portland have been small and relatively contained since June.\nTrump's planned deployment caught many at the Pentagon by surprise, six US officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Sunday, Hegseth signed a memo ordering 200 Oregon National Guard troops deployed under federal authority. The memo was made public as an attachment to Oregon's lawsuit.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal,\" Rayfield said in a statement, apparently referring to an ICE facility.\nViolent crime in Portland has dropped in the first six months of 2025, according to preliminary data released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association in its Midyear Violent Crime Report. Homicides fell by 51% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to these statistics.\nSince returning to the presidency in January, Trump has made crime a major focus of his administration even as violent crime rates have fallen in many US cities.\nIn 2020, protests erupted in downtown Portland, the Pacific Northwest enclave with a reputation as a liberal city, following the killing in Minneapolis of a Black man named George Floyd by a white police officer. The protests dragged on for months, and some civic leaders at the time said they were spurred rather than quelled by Trump's deployment of federal troops.\nIt was unclear whether Trump's warning that US troops could use \"full force\" on the streets of Portland meant he was somehow authorising lethal force and, if so, under what conditions. US troops are able to use force in self-defence on domestic US deployments.\nPortland mayor Keith Wilson, like other Oregon officials, learned of Trump's order from social media on Saturday.\nMany in Trump's own Pentagon were caught off guard.\n\"It was a bolt from the blue,\" one of the US officials said, adding that the military was previously focused on carrying out prudent planning for potential deployments of troops by Trump into cities such as Chicago and Memphis.\nThere have been growing tensions in major US cities over Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown days after a shooting targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others seriously wounded.","summary":"President Donald Trump says troops will defend federal facilities against 'domestic terrorists' and may use full force if needed.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/09/29/pentagon-sends-national-guard-troops-to-portland-to-support-ice","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aa49af42-portland.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 00:28:03","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.298},{"id":364332796,"title":"Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy urges west to cut off Russia’s energy revenues, saying decisive action ‘long overdue’","text":"The Ukrainian president noted the bombardments came at the close of UN general assembly week in New York, during which Donald Trump expressed support for Kyiv. A missile wiped out most of a street in Kyiv’s Petropavlivska Borshchahivka district, while a falling concrete slab killed a 12-year-old girl. Two of the other deaths occurred at a cardiology clinic in the capital. Across Ukraine 67 people were reported wounded, according to local authorities. Zelenskyy described the attack on the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia as “extraordinarily fierce”, with nearly 40 injured, while footage on social media showed several buildings badly damaged and on fire.\n\nZelenskyy promised his country would “strike back”. “This is precisely how Russia shows its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing and deserves only the harshest pressure in the world,” he said on Telegram. “The Kremlin benefits from continuing this war and terror as long as energy revenues flow and the shadow fleet operates.”\n\nThe US is considering Ukraine’s request to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for its war effort, vice-president JD Vance said. Zelenskyy has asked the US to sell Tomahawks to European nations that would send them to Ukraine. Vance told Fox News on Sunday that Donald Trump would make the “final determination” on whether to allow the deal. Trump has denied Ukraine’s requests for use of long-range missiles in the past – Tomahawks have a range of 2,500km (1,550 miles) – but is frustrated at Moscow’s refusal to reach a peace deal. Vance also said Russia’s invasion had stalled, with little in the way of territorial gains in Ukraine recently. “The Russians have got to wake up and accept reality here. A lot of people are dying. They don’t have a lot to show for it.”","summary":"President’s plea comes after Russia bombards Kyiv and elsewhere in one of its most sustained attacks of the war.

That's all I've ever tried to do, is just be the best prepared I can be,\" said Donald, the first European captain to win back-to-back since Tony Jacklin in 1985 and 1987. \n\nAsked how he would feel about two more years at the helm, with the competition set for Adare, Ireland, in 2027, he responded: \"I'm going to enjoy tonight first.\" \n\nThe tournament opened on Friday with the spotlight on U.S. President Donald Trump in a much-anticipated visit to Bethpage Black. \n\nBut the headlines quickly steered to another Donald - Luke - as his team became the first to lead by more than 11 points heading into the final session since the Ryder Cup adopted the 28-point format in 1979.\n\n\"He's the best European Ryder Cup Captain of all time, Luke Donald,\" said U.S. captain Keegan Bradley.\n\nDonald's tenure started inauspiciously, as he replaced Henrik Stenson for the 2023 competition after the Swede joined LIV Golf and was relieved of his duties. \n\nBut Europe's 16-1/2–11-1/2 win in Rome had players chanting \"two more years\" and Donald answered the call to what some considered a fool's errand, with Ryder Cup home teams historically enjoying a huge advantage.\n\nThe choice to keep him on for 2025 was met with broad approval, as he became the first repeat captain since Bernard Gallacher coached his third in a row in 1995.\n\n\"A big part of my captaincy is to create an environment where these guys are having the best weeks of their lives, honestly.

(AP pic)\nNEW YORK: New York mayor Eric Adams announced Sunday he was abandoning his reelection bid after failing to gain momentum against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, a self-described socialist who has been fiercely criticised by US President Donald Trump.\nA once-popular mayor, Adams, 65, was dogged by a slew of corruption allegations and criticised over cooperating with Trump's immigration crackdown.\nFederal criminal charges were dropped against Adams earlier this year, prompting resignations at the Manhattan US attorney's office and at the justice department in protest against alleged political interference by the Trump administration.\nAdams's dropping out leaves the field open for a battle between Mamdani, 33, and fellow Democrat Andrew Cuomo, 67, who is running as an independent after being beaten in the Democratic primary.\nAlso in the race is Republican Curtis Sliwa, 71, a red beret-wearing anti-crime activist whom Trump has dismissed as not ready for \"prime time.\"\n\"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign,\" Adams said in a video statement posted to X on Sunday.\n\"The constant media speculation about my future and the campaign finance board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign.\"\nThe mayoral election will take place on Nov 4. Adams had been polling at less than 10% of the vote.\nVeiled criticism\nAdams became mayor of the largest US city in 2022, and said in April he would run as an independent, a move that spared him from the competitive Democratic primary won by Mamdani.\nIn that election, Mamdani also swept past former New York governor Cuomo, who resigned from his post in 2021 over sexual misconduct allegations.\nIn his statement, Adams issued a veiled criticism of Mamdani, who has zeroed in on the high cost of living by promising regulated rents, free bus travel and daycare to cement his appeal.\n\"Major change is welcome and necessary, but beware of those who claim the answer (is) to destroy the very system we built together over generations. That is not change, that is chaos,\" he said.\nRumours have swirled for weeks that Adams would drop out of the mayoral race to allow space for Cuomo.\nThere were also reports the Trump administration was considering a job for Adams if he backed out of the election to give Cuomo a better chance of beating Mamdani.\nIn a statement responding to the mayor dropping out, Mamdani referenced those allegations of collusion between Trump, Adams and Cuomo.\n\"Donald Trump and his billionaire donors might be able to determine Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo's actions but they will not dictate the results of this election,\" he said.\nCuomo welcomes move\nCuomo, however, welcomed Adams's decision and struck an alarmed tone at Mamdani's rise.\n\"We face destructive extremist forces that would devastate our city through incompetence or ignorance, but it is not too late to stop them,\" he said.\nA former police officer from a modest family and New York's second African-American mayor, Adams was initially popular but saw his star wane under the weight of the corruption allegations, rising costs of living and other challenges.\nThe mayor was accused of wire fraud, soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations and a bribery conspiracy involving Turkish citizens and at least one Turkish official. He denies the charges.\nEmil Bove, who as a top justice department official ordered the charges dropped, has denied allegations that the decision was a \"quid pro quo\" in exchange for the Democratic mayor's support for Trump's immigration crackdown.","summary":"The once-popular mayor’s departure clears the way for a showdown between Zohran Mamdani and former governor Andrew Cuomo.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/09/29/new-york-mayor-eric-adams-abandons-reelection-bid","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54b3ed5f-eric-adams-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 00:15:30","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":364336568,"title":"GRAHAM J NOBLE: Escalating Violence Against ICE Demands Accountability","text":"On the morning of Sept. 24, Americans were reminded again that one political group in this country doesn’t seem to be interested in coming together, preferring instead to use fear and bloodshed to impose its agenda.\n\nAs an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) van entered a processing site in Dallas, Texas, a sniper opened fire from a nearby rooftop. Three illegal aliens being transferred to the center were hit, and one of them died – a cruel irony. The shooter was found dead shortly after the incident. He had apparently killed himself. He was 29 years old. (RELATED: Trump Sending Troops To Portland To Protect ICE Facilities Amid Antifa Threat)\n\nThis isn’t the first attack on ICE agents, of course, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for anyone to dismiss a link between the left’s demonization of the agency as fascist stormtroopers and the violence perpetrated against them. A further demonstration of that link was found at the crime scene: A stripper clip containing five rifle rounds – at least one of which had “ANTI-ICE” written on it.\n\nFor months, left-wing activists have likened ICE agents to Nazis and to Nazi Germany’s secret state police, the Gestapo. Certain elected Democrats have employed similar rhetoric. Earlier this year, Minnesota’s Democrat governor and former vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz called Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents a “modern-day Gestapo.”\n\nThe Deadly Demonization Of ICE\n\nIn July, after ICE agents apprehended an illegal alien MS-13 member in Providence, R.I., progressive Democrat Rep. Enrique Sanchez claimed that “Nazi Gestapo ICE thugs” had “kidnapped” one of “our neighbors,” describing the arrest as an “act of terror.”\n\nAt this point, to say there is no evidence that these incendiary accusations are inciting physical assaults and armed attacks on this branch of the Department of Homeland Security is a stretch.\n\nLeft-wing activist sites are awash with articles that draw comparisons between ICE and the Nazis. One such article, published on the website Left Voice, is even written in the style of a serious academic piece, making the argument that ICE can indeed be likened to the Gestapo.\n\nSo, it’s not correct to assume that loaded language thrown around by Democrat officeholders is solely to blame for the rise in left-wing political violence – whether one is thinking of the attacks on ICE, the assassination of Charlie Kirk, or the two attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump’s life. There is a whole propaganda machine at work, spreading and inciting hate and violence against the Trump administration.\n\nLittle wonder that impressionable and – probably in most cases – mentally unstable young men and women are being conditioned to believe they are up against the forces of tyranny. Such a mind might easily be driven to react violently, even at the cost of their own lives.\n\nCooler Heads Are Not Prevailing\n\nAfter the Dallas shooting, Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill posted on X: “The unprovoked shooting at a Dallas ICE facility this morning was another example of brazen left wing political violence.” He added, “Leftist rhetoric calling ICE agents Nazis and the Gestapo has to end. There is a serious and widespread problem with tolerance for political violence on the Left.”\n\nBack in June, Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer observed that the DHS reported a 413% rise in assaults against ICE officers.\n\nThere appears to be no intention among left-wing extremists – or elected Democrats, for that matter – to tone down the vitriol. One might have assumed that Charlie Kirk’s murder – as profound an effect as it had on the nation – would have inspired some introspection.\n\nOn the contrary, it does appear that the extreme left is driving a campaign of growing hostility and violence. Perhaps the goal is to push President Trump to the point where he takes action that his opponents can use against him – claiming that they were right all along to describe him as a dictator and a threat to democracy.\n\nAmericans should perhaps hope that, if this is the agenda, Trump doesn’t take the bait – but a robust response to political violence and holding those who incite it accountable are now overdue.\n\nGraham J.

LDP showdown pits Abe protégé against reformist scion","text":"As Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party begins the process of selecting a new leader – and by extension, the country’s next prime minister – the race is quickly shaping into a duel between a conservative heir to Shinzo Abe’s legacy and a reformist standard-bearer promising broader appeal within the divided party.\nThe party’s internal election on October 4 follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation after barely a year in office, with the winner expected to assume leadership through a parliamentary vote.\nWhoever takes the helm will face a daunting set of challenges – from stubborn inflation and a volatile regional security environment to managing ties with US President Donald Trump.\nThe five contenders are Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi; former economic security ministers Sanae Takaichi and Takayuki Kobayashi; Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi; and former LDP secretary general Toshimitsu Motegi.\n\nBut early polls suggest a two-horse race. Koizumi leads with 23.8 per cent support, followed closely by Takaichi at 21 per cent, according to recent surveys. The remaining candidates trail in the single digits.\nRaymond Yamamoto, an associate professor at Aarhus University in Denmark, said Takaichi’s appeal stems from two key factors: her potential to become Japan’s first female prime minister and her close ties to the late Abe.\nAfter announcing her candidacy for the LDP leadership in 2021, Takaichi – who had served as the party’s policy chief under Abe – pledged to carry forward his economic agenda. Known as “Abenomics”, it is defined by aggressive monetary easing, government stimulus spending and structural reforms aimed at spurring growth.\nShe also pledged to push for a new constitution and to visit Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine – which honours Japan’s war dead, including convicted Class A war criminals – a move that has historically drawn strong condemnation from China and South Korea when made by sitting or former prime ministers.\nKoizumi, by contrast, is seen as a reformist with broader crossover appeal. He earned plaudits for helping stabilise rice prices as agriculture minister and, as Yamamoto noted, he also benefits from his family name.\n“One should also not overlook the significance of being the son of Junichiro Koizumi, one of the most popular prime ministers of Japan,” Yamamoto added.\nKoizumi senior, known for his maverick style and reformist agenda, remains one of Japan’s most widely admired political figures.\n\nDescribing the race as a “very tight” one, Yamamoto noted that both candidates were actively working to gain support from various ideological camps within the LDP.\n“While Takaichi is a well-known nationalist, it is Koizumi, who has a more liberal stance, that has succeeded in gaining the backing of Katsunobu Kato, one of the party’s key conservatives,” Yamamoto said.\nKato, the current finance minister, was a close ally of the late Abe and a staunch proponent of Abenomics. He previously held several senior cabinet roles, including health minister, and was considered part of Abe’s inner circle.\nHe ran in the September 2024 LDP leadership race alongside Koizumi and former foreign minister Taro Kono, but all three were defeated by Ishiba.\nStephen Nagy, professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo’s International Christian University, said Takaichi was the most likely candidate to become the next prime minister, citing her role as chair of the LDP’s policy committee, which helps mediate between party factions.\nHe also noted that she is a protégé of Abe, who helped forge a stable approach to balancing Japan’s relations with both China and the United States.\n“My bet is on Takaichi forming a strong conservative cabinet that includes many of the individuals she’s competing with today, such as Hayashi, Motegi and others,” Nagy said.\n“Koizumi, while an attractive young man, does not have the ideological centre and experience to negotiate the LDP’s ageist politics,” he added.\nAlthough Hayashi is a seasoned foreign minister with broad experience in the LDP, he is perceived by some as being too pro-China – a view that may not be accurate, according to Nagy.\nHe said the more pressing issue was whether Takaichi could unify the party’s conservative wing and remain in power long enough to provide stable leadership.\n\n“I think that’s where the LDP would like to go. The question is whether she will be able to do it or not,” Nagy said.\nIt was essential for the party to select a prime minister with strong public support, as the LDP was under significant pressure to improve its image, Yamamoto said.\n“It is also key to securing backing from opposition parties, especially under the current minority government,” he added.\nThe LDP has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, including the failure of party factions to properly declare their finances and the re-routing of political funds to lawmakers as kickbacks.\nAs a minority government, the LDP now struggles to govern effectively, often being forced to make concessions to opposition parties to pass legislation.\n“The party’s top priority is to regain a stable majority, with a strong and popular leader who can restore public trust,” Yamamoto said.\n“While the outcome is uncertain, Koizumi may have a slight edge given the broad support in the LDP and his track record of delivering tangible results.”","summary":"As Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party begins the process of selecting a new leader – and by extension, the country’s next prime minister – the race is quickly shaping into a duel between a conservative heir to Shinzo Abe’s legacy and a reformist standard-bearer promising broader appeal within the divided party.\nThe party’s internal election on October 4 follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation after barely a year in office, with the winner expected to assume leadership through a...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3327041/japans-next-leader-ldp-showdown-pits-abe-protege-against-reformist-scion","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/09/26/9108bb74-5295-486c-a258-7cc63ac9ed3b_216e3b88.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-29 00:00:14","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.298},{"id":364329386,"title":"Oregon leaders say Trump is deploying 200 National Guard troops within state","text":"Washington, Sep 29 (AP) Two hundred members of the Oregon National Guard are being placed under federal control and deployed to protect immigration enforcement officers and government facilities, according to a Defense Department memo received by state leaders on Sunday.\nThe deployment is being made over the objections of state leaders and is similar to one last summer in Los Angeles, where protesters demonstrated against deportation operations, but is on a much smaller scale.\nThere was no immediate comment from the White House. Multiple Pentagon officials were contacted, but none would confirm or deny the authenticity of the memo.\nPresident Donald Trump had announced on Saturday that he would send troops to Portland. The state’s governor, Democrat Tina Kotek, said Sunday that she objected to the deployment in a conversation with the president.\n“Oregon is our home — not a military target,” she said in a statement.\nDan Rayfield, the state attorney general, said he was filing a federal lawsuit arguing that Trump was overstepping his authority.\n“What we’re seeing is not about public safety,” he said. “It’s about the president flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community.” The Pentagon memo provided by Oregon leaders drew a direct comparison between the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June and the proposed deployment to the state, adding “This memorandum further implements the President’s direction.” While the memorandum does not specifically cite Portland as the target of the proposed deployment, Trump, in a social media post on Saturday, said he directed the Pentagon, at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, “to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.” “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” Trump added.\nUnlike in Los Angeles, it does not appear that Trump or Hegseth are currently directing the deployment of active-duty troops to the state. The Trump administration deployed about 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles though they were withdrawn just over a month later.\nThe action also would be far less than Trump’s deployment to Washington, DC, where more than 1,000 National Guard troops, including units from other states, have patrolled the streets for weeks. He also has been suggesting that he will send troops into Chicago, but so far has not done so.

Tina Kotek speaks at a news conference in Portland, Oregon, on September 27 after President Donald Trump said he would send troops to the city.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nA press conference was held on Saturday where Oregon officials stressed that they oppose any troop deployments to Portland and reject the Trump administration’s argument that it has the authority to do so.\n\nOregon Governor Tina Kotek on Sunday then escalated the matter and filed a lawsuit in the District of Oregon, Portland, division on behalf of the state and city. The lawsuit names Trump as well as Hegseth and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and seeks injunctive relief against the administration.\n\nThe 41-page filing delves into several arguments against the move to federalize the state’s National Guard troops and criticizes the administration for using “baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext” to justify the moves.\n\n“Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource. Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry,” the lawsuit states, adding that deploying troops against the wishes of state and local officials is “patently unlawful.” \n\n“For these and other reasons discussed below, Defendants’ actions should be declared unlawful and preliminarily and permanently enjoined,” the lawsuit added.\n\nThe lawsuit names the following Causes of Action: Violation of 10 U.S. code 12406 (the president’s attempt to federalize troops without appropriate cause); Violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents deploying armed forces for law enforcement; Violating the Tenth Amendment for trying to “usurp the Governor of Oregon’s role as Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard in Oregon”; Violation of the Administration Procedure Act; and Violation of the Constitution Separation of Powers and the Militia and Take Care Clauses.\n\nOregon is calling for the court to declare Hegseth’s order unlawful and to enjoin the federalization of troops, as well as permanently enjoin the defense secretary and the Pentagon from calling upon Oregon National Guard members for federal service.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Newsweek: “President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters. The President’s lawful actions will make Portland safer.” \n\nOregon Governor Tina Kotek in statement on Saturday to Newsweek: “My office is reaching out to the White House and Homeland Security for more information.

Democrats say they want immediate talks on health care, and they are willing to shut down the government if they don’t get concessions.\n\nA shutdown is “totally up to the Democrats,” Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“The ball is in their court.” Thune said. “There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now, we could pick it up today and pass it, that has been passed by the House that will be signed into law by the president to keep the government open.”\n\nSchumer, D-N.Y., said on the same program that “it’s up to them” whether Republicans will negotiate when the two sides meet at the White House on Monday.\n\n“God forbid the Republicans shut the government down,” Schumer said. “The American people will know it’s on their back.”\n\nThe Senate standoff is just the latest in annual disagreements over funding, but hopes are dimming for a quick resolution. Democrats have suggested they are more willing than ever to allow a shutdown as they face demands from their base voters to fight harder against Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Some even argue that a shutdown might not make much difference because Trump has slashed so many government jobs already.\n\n“We’re hearing from the American people that they need help on health care,” Schumer said. “And as for these massive layoffs, guess what? Simple, one-sentence answer: they’re doing it anyway.”\n\nThe Senate is expected to vote on the House-passed bill to extend government funding on Tuesday, ahead of the 12:01 a.m. Wednesday deadline to avert a shutdown. The bill would keep the government open for another seven weeks while Congress finishes its annual spending bills.\n\nRepublicans will likely need at least eight Democrats to approve a short-term fix, as Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is expected to vote against it. Majority Republicans hold 53 seats and they need 60 votes to end a filibuster and pass the legislation.\n\nSchumer said Democrats need “a serious negotiation” at the White House meeting with Trump and the four top congressional leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nTrump last week abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Democrats after “reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands” of Democrats, Trump said on social media.\n\nSchumer said the rescheduled White House meeting is “a good first step.”\n\n“Now if the President at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done. But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation,” Schumer said.\n\nAhead of the last potential government shutdown in March, many Democrats called on Schumer to resign after he provided support for Republicans to keep the government open.\n\nDemocrats now fear, among other things, that Republicans will allow Affordable Care Act tax credits expire that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe tax credits for the expanded health coverage program go to low- and middle-income people and are set to expire at the end of the year and open enrollment starts in November.","summary":"Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Majority Leader John Thune are digging in ahead of this week's deadline to keep the government open, showing little evidence of budging even as both sides have agreed to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/28/shutdown-standoff-deepens/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25262674468976.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:41:23","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.475},{"id":364329764,"title":"On The Shameful, Incompetent Decision On Palestine","text":"the daily horrors of the Gaza genocide, there could hardly\nbe a more appropriate time for New Zealand to join the\ncommunity of nations in recognising that Palestine – and\nPalestinians – have a right to exist.

In the same week as\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu was being treated -\njustifiably - as a global pariah, Winston Peters and\nChristopher Luxon have chosen to give comfort to the\nperpetrators of the Gaza genocide, while simultaneously\nclaiming to support a peaceful end to the conflict. The only\npeace that Israel is offering Palestinians is the peace of\n\nIn New York, Foreign Minister Winston\nPeters even had the gall to lecture the UN about its failure\nto provide leadership on serious issues, before offering\nnone himself on the Israel/Palestine conflict. For his part,\nour Prime Minister then suggested that whatever New Zealand\nsays or does on this issue won’t make any difference.\nLuxon not only failed to attend the 80th anniversary\nfounding of the UN in New York last week. Rather than front\nthe announcement on Palestine, Luxon chose instead to attend\nthe Wallabies rugby match at Eden Park. Truly, a statesman\nfor our time.\n\nBad faith diplomacy\n\ntogether, the Peters\nspeech in New York and the Luxon\npress conference were a jumble of cliches, distortions,\nselective morality, and brazen recycling of Israeli\npropaganda points. Over the past month, Luxon and Peters\nhave repeatedly insisted that it only a matter of “when,\nnot if” that New Zealand would recognise the state of\nPalestine. Yet in reality, the pre-conditions they are\ndemanding amount to “never.” Incredibly, New Zealand is\nrequiring that there would need to be a fully formed and\nviable Palestinian state in existence, totally in command of\nits own territory. New Zealand is a global outlier in taking\nthis extreme position as a pre-condition for recognising\n\nUnlike us, the vast bulk of UN member\nnations are acting on the premise that as the world\nprogressively recognises the legitimacy of Palestine’s\nnational cause, this will serve to isolate Israel’s\nextremist government, and exert positive pressure on it to\nagree to a lasting ceasefire and an end to its illegal\noccupation – thereby bringing a two state solution closer\nto reality. Moreover, as Helen Clark pointed out, the\nrecognition of Palestine is serving to bolster the position\nof the Palestinian Authority, the Hamas rival that the West\nis looking to as being the future governing body in Gaza.\nOur decision has undercut that process.\n\nOur decision\nalso runs counter to the logic accepted in recent weeks by\nCanada, France, the UK Australia, Portugal, Spain, Norway,\nIreland etc etc. Basically, those countries are treating the\nrecognition of Palestinian statehood as a positive step\ntowards peace and an eventual resolution to the conflict. In\nthe absence of any willingness to impose sanctions and\nboycotts on Israel, the recognition of Palestine’s right\nto exist is the least confrontational way of isolating the\nNetanyahu government that is (a) carrying out a genocide in\nGaza, and that is (b) implacably opposed to the two state\nsolution that New Zealand claims to support. Inexplicably\nand stupidly, Peters and Luxon have just thrown\nNetanyahu’s extremist government a diplomatic\n\nHere are a few examples of the selective\nmorality/Israeli propaganda lines that Peters and Luxon are\nembracing in our name.\n\n1. Bizarrely, Luxon has\nrepeated the Israeli propaganda line that recognising\nstatehood would be a reward to Hamas. This is untrue. It\nwould be an overdue recognition of the legitimate\naspirations of the Palestinian people. Using Luxon’s own\nlogic, you could equally say that our refusal to recognise\nPalestine is a reward to Israel for committing a genocide.\nHow Hamas might react is simply not a valid – or relevant\n- reason to refuse the recognition of Palestine. After all,\nwe allegedly have an independent foreign policy.\n\nThe bias towards Israel has been evident in the language\nused by Peters and Luxon, and in their selective moral\ncompass. At his press conference, Luxon spoke of the “1200\ninnocent lives” taken by Hamas in the October 7, 2023\nattacks. (For the record, almost 400 of the 1200 people\nkilled by Hamas on October 7 were armed Israeli\nmilitary/security forces. That is not said to exonerate\nHamas. It is a judgement on Luxon’s moral arithmetic.)\nTellingly, Luxon did not even mention (let alone lament) the\n60,000+ Palestinians killed by the IDF, 50 % of whom have\nbeen women and children. At least sixteen times more\nchildren have been killed by the IDF than the total number\nof Israelis and foreigners killed by Hamas on October\n\nIn similar vein...at his initial press conference\nand since, Luxon has made repeated mention of the remaining\n48 Israeli hostages (20 of whom are believed to be still\nalive) held by Hamas, and the need to immediately release\nall of them unconditionally. Yet Luxon has made no demands\non Israel at all. He has made no similarly compassionate\nmention of the large numbers of Palestinian prisoners being\nheld in Israeli jails in\ninhuman conditions – nor of the Gaza population being\nsubjected to a deliberate famine, nor of the repeated\ndisplacements of an entire civilian population weakened by\nmalnutrition. Luxon and Peters have also made no mention the\nsystematic destruction of Gaza’s medical facilities, or\nthe targeted killings of its medical professionals and\njournalists.\n\nThe only conclusion that can be drawn\nfrom Luxon’s selective emphasis on the evil perpetrated by\nHamas is that our current political leaders regard Jewish\nlives as being more precious than the lives of\nPalestinians.\n\n3.Despite the claims by Peters/Luxon to\nthe contrary, Hamas has not been the chief obstacle to\nreaching a deal to end this conflict. Hamas has repeatedly\nagreed to proposals for a permanent end to the\nfighting, for a gradual exchange of hostages in return for\nPalestinians prisoners held by Israel, and for the setting\nup of a transitional administration in which Hamas has\nagreed not to participate.\n\nJust as repeatedly, Israel\nhas either undermined the terms agreed, refused to commit to\nanything beyond a temporary ceasefire and/or has ramped up\nits military onslaught even while the terms for a lasting\npeace are still being discussed. When taken together with\nIsrael’s demands that (a) Hamas agree to immediately and\nunconditionally release all the hostages and (b)\nunilaterally hand over all of its defensive weapons and (c)\naccept Israel’s agreement to only a temporary\nceasefire, one can readily see why Hamas has baulked at such\na one-sided “deal.”\n\nRegardless, Peters and Luxon\nseem to be unfazed about putting the onus entirely on\nHamas to negotiate on Israel’s terms. There has also\nbeen no criticism levelled at Israel for trying to murder\nthe Hamas negotiating team right in the middle of the talks\nthat were meant to be brokering “peace” in\n\n4. Luxon has claimed that now is not the\nright time to recognise Palestine, because in his view,\nHamas is still “the de facto government” of Gaza. This\nmay come as news to Luxon, but Gaza has been reduced to\nrubble by the IDF. There is no functioning society left for\nHamas, or for anyone else, to govern. This is another\nexample of our government being a willing echo chamber for\nIsraeli propaganda, since – apparently – only the\nkilling (or forced removal) of every single Palestinian in\nGaza can qualify as signalling the conclusive defeat of\n\nWhy are we so insistent on inflating the\ncurrent threat posed by Hamas, whose military and\ngoverning wings have both been so severely degraded over the\npast 18 months? In every conceivable sense, the ruling power\nin Gaza is Israel, not Hamas. Israel is an illegal occupying\nforce, but it is the de facto ruler of the territory,\nnonetheless. For reasons about which one can only speculate,\nLuxon seems to be religiously determined to keep alive the\nevil phantom of a palpable military/governmental threat\nposed by Hamas. The only beneficiary of this fixation is\nIsrael, since it provides a pretext for the ongoing genocide\nin Gaza. In classic Vietnam War logic, Israel is currently\nintent on destroying Gaza City in order to save it.\n\nNew Zealand’s stance on Palestine marks a sharp turnaround\nin the conduct of our foreign policy. In the early 1990s,\nNew Zealand had valiantly used our UN platform to raise\nworld awareness of the looming genocide in Rwanda. Likewise\nin the 1980s we eventually managed to atone for the 1976\nrugby tour that left New Zealand such an outcast on the\nworld stage that 29 nations boycotted the Montreal Olympics\nin protest at our presence. In future, we will have to find\na way to repair the damage done to our international\nreputation by Peters and Luxon.\n\n6. In narrow economic\nterms, any trade advantage Luxon might be hoping to gain\nfrom sucking up to the Trump administration over Palestine,\nwill be outweighed by the damage this decision will do to\nour reputation in Europe, Asia, Africa and across the Middle\nEast. This country used to be regarded as a reliable\ndefender of international humanitarian law, and as a force\nfor positive change in the world. Not any more,\n\nThis decision will go a long way towards\ntrashing the progressive image that New Zealand has earned\nover the past 40 years via our anti-nuclear policy, and via\nthe humane response that previous leaders made to the mosque\nshootings. Make no mistake. The decision to refuse statehood\nfor Palestine is not only a disaster in moral, intellectual\nand reputational terms. It will also do harm to our trading\nrelationships with almost every other country apart from the\nUnited States. Even on its own narrow terms, this attempt to\nmonetise our foreign policy is likely to back-fire on\n\nTrumpadelic!\n\nOver the past decade in\nparticular, there has been a lot of music written about\nDonald Trump, and almost all of it has\nbeen pretty bad.

Democrats need to gain just three seats to flip control, which would allow them to obstruct the president’s agenda and possibly launch investigations into his administration.\n\nMissouri’s redistricting move is part of a broader national battle over congressional maps, following similar efforts in Republican-led Texas where GOP lawmakers passed a new map, backed by Trump that is expected to grant Republicans another five seats. Democrats in California, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, responded with their own proposed map aimed at giving their party five new seats, which will go to vote later this year.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe new map eliminates a Democratic stronghold that has been held by the party for 76 years, since 1949. \n\nCleaver’s Fifth District, which encompasses much of Kansas City, will be split across three different districts, diluting Democratic voting strength by incorporating Republican-leaning rural areas.\n\nThe redistricting specifically targets minority communities, reducing the number of Black and minority residents in Cleaver’s district. The plan uses Kansas City’s Troost Avenue as a boundary line, a street that has historically served as a racial dividing line separating predominantly Black and white neighborhoods. Cleaver, who served as Kansas City’s first Black mayor before taking office in 2005, has represented the district for nearly two decades.\n\nThe Missouri Senate approved the redistricting plan in a 21-11 vote earlier this month, following earlier House approval. Kehoe signed the legislation during a ceremony closed to the public, drawing support from Trump, who previously praised Missouri’s action on Truth Social. Multiple legal challenges emerged following the initial announcement, with the Campaign Legal Center filing suit earlier this month and the NAACP contending no “extraordinary occasion” existed for the special legislative session. \n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) also challenged the redistricting, noting that legislation lists a “KC 811” voting precinct in both the fourth and fifth congressional districts.\n\nA man waves an American flag as he walks outside the Missouri State Capitol building on January 20, 2021, in Jefferson City, Missouri. (Photo by Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMissouri Governor Mike Kehoe said in a statement: “Missourians are more alike than we are different, and our values, across both sides of the aisle, are closer to each other than those of the congressional representation of states like New York, California, and Illinois. We believe this map best represents Missourians.”\n\nMissouri Senate Democrats posted on its official X account on Sunday: “Republicans are so determined to block passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that they just redrew Missouri’s congressional map to eliminate a ‘YES’ vote.”\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin released the following statement: “At the order of Donald Trump, Governor Kehoe and Missouri Republicans have shown they care more about holding onto power at all costs than the fundamental rights of the Missourians they were elected to represent. This is a right-wing power grab so Republicans can avoid accountability for voting to take away the health care of hundreds of thousands of Missourians. But the battle in Missouri isn’t over. Missourians have the opportunity to put this craven power grab up for a vote. The DNC supports Missouri organizers collecting ballot signatures to take democracy back into their own hands and defeat these rigged maps once and for all.”\n\nRepresentative Emanuel Cleaver told Newsweek on September 12: “Despite tens of thousands of Missourians taking the time to call their state lawmakers and travel to Jefferson City to voice their opposition, Republicans in the Missouri Legislature followed the marching orders dictated by power brokers in D.C. and took the unprecedented step of enacting mid-decade redistricting without an updated census.”\n\nHe continued: “While I’m grateful to the lawmakers in both parties who refused to go along with thi...","summary":"The new map eliminates a Democratic stronghold that has been held by the party for 76 years, since 1949.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/missouri-governor-signs-new-house-map-targeting-democratic-seat-into-law-10795092","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1230693831.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:39:30","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.054},{"id":364330148,"title":"Oregon sues Trump over military deployment to Portland","text":"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered 200 Oregon National Guard troops to be deployed under federal authority while the state filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's move to send military forces into the Democratic-run city of Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe Republican president on Saturday announced plans to send troops into Portland, saying they would be used to protect federal immigration facilities against \"domestic terrorists\" and that he was authorising them to use \"full force, if necessary\".\n\nTrump's deployments of military forces into other municipalities led by Democrats, including Los Angeles and Washington DC, have spurred legal challenges and protests.\n\nOregon's suit was filed against Trump, Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in federal court in Portland on Sunday by Democratic Oregon Attorney-General Dan Rayfield. The suit accused Trump of exceeding his powers.\n\n\"Citing nothing more than baseless, wildly hyperbolic pretext - the president says Portland is a 'War ravaged' city 'under siege' from 'domestic terrorists.' Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon's sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that protests against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in Portland have been small and relatively contained since June.\n\nTrump's planned deployment caught many at the Pentagon by surprise, six US officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. On Sunday, Hegseth signed a memo ordering 200 Oregon National Guard troops deployed under federal authority. The memo was made public as an attachment to Oregon's lawsuit.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal,\" Rayfield said in a statement, apparently referring to an ICE facility.\n\nViolent crime in Portland has dropped in the first six months of 2025, according to preliminary data released by the Major Cities Chiefs Association in its Midyear Violent Crime Report. Homicides fell by 51 per cent compared to the same period a year earlier, according to these statistics.\n\nSince returning to the presidency in January, Trump has made crime a major focus of his administration even as violent crime rates have fallen in many US cities.\n\nIn 2020, protests erupted in downtown Portland, the Pacific Northwest enclave with a reputation as a liberal city, following the killing in Minneapolis of a Black man named George Floyd by a white police officer. The protests dragged on for months, and some civic leaders at the time said they were spurred rather than quelled by Trump's deployment of federal troops.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump's warning that US troops could use \"full force\" on the streets of Portland meant he was somehow authorising lethal force and, if so, under what conditions. US troops are able to use force in self-defence on domestic US deployments.\n\nPortland Mayor Keith Wilson, like other Oregon officials, learned of Trump's order from social media on Saturday.\n\nHe condemned the move outright.\n\n\"This is an American city,\" Wilson said on Saturday.\n\n\"We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target.\"\n\nMany in Trump's own Pentagon were caught off guard.\n\n\"It was a bolt from the blue,\" one of the US officials said, adding that the military was previously focused on carrying out prudent planning for potential deployments of troops by Trump into cities such as Chicago and Memphis.\n\nThere have been growing tensions in major US cities over Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown days after a shooting targeting an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others seriously wounded.","summary":"Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing the US president of exceeding his powers by sending the National Guard to Portland.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/oregon-sues-trump-over-military-deployment-to-portland-c-20174198","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-20174198/12579cd37cda196f79c3734001d3a1467b44c46c-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:38:50","author":"Democratic Oregon Attorney,Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart and Nate Raymond","authors":["Democratic Oregon Attorney","Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart and Nate Raymond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.35},{"id":364327998,"title":"Former MI5 chief believes Britain may already be at war with Russia","text":"A former head of MI5 has said Britain may already be at war with Russia.\n\nBaroness Manningham-Buller, who led the Security Service between 2002 and 2007, cited cyberattacks, espionage and covert operations on British soil as evidence for her claim.\n\nLady Manningham-Buller said she was inclined to agree with Fiona Hill, a foreign policy specialist and former adviser to Donald Trump, who has said previously that Britain is already at war with Russia.\n\nShe told the Lord Speaker’s Corner podcast: “Fiona Hill may be right in saying we’re already at war with Russia.\n\n“It’s a different sort of war, but the hostility, the cyberattacks, the physical attacks, intelligence work is extensive.”\n\nLady Manningham-Buller said Vladimir Putin had moved to a position of sustained hostility to the West since the invasion of Ukraine three years ago and was engaging in sabotage and intelligence collection, as well as attacking people in Britain.\n\nShe also suggested previous governments were wrong to believe Russia could join the club of Western democracies.\n\nSpeaking of her meeting with Mr Putin in 2005, Lady Manningham-Buller said: “We all hoped that at the end of the Soviet Union we would have a potential partner.

Hasan al-Sha’ir, the hospital’s medical director, said that staff have continued to work “despite the harsh conditions and overwhelming fear”.\n\nAccording to al-Sha’ir, at least 100 patients are receiving treatment in “extremely difficult circumstances”, with shortages of life-saving drugs and medical equipment.\n\nResearchers at the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights confirmed Israel’s use of fire belts, which are incendiary weapons that cause flames to rise across a strip of land. The military also deployed explosive-laden vehicles around the hospital as military units advanced from the northern and eastern sides of the facility.\n\nAccording to medical sources cited by the Palestinian Wafa news agency, the Israeli army shelled another medical facility, the Al Helou Hospital in Gaza City, which hosts a cancer ward and a neonatal unit where 12 premature babies are being cared for.\n\nMedical staff told Wafa that more than 90 people, including doctors, nurses and patients, remained trapped inside the hospital as Israeli tanks surrounded the facility, blocking both entry and exit.\n\nThe Israeli army on Sunday also bombed a multistorey building, the Mecca Tower, after issuing an evacuation threat for the Remal and Sabra neighbourhoods of Gaza City, as well as the port area and parts of Beirut Street.\n\nAt least 50 multistorey buildings have been destroyed in recent weeks as Israeli forces press their assault on the city, flattening entire blocks that once housed thousands of people.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAl Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud described the attacks in Gaza City as “massive” and “relentless”.\n\n“They’re a mix of heavy artillery, drone strikes [and] quake bombs that are dropped on areas and destroy the very foundations of buildings,” he said.\n\nThe Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said in a statement on Sunday that it had lost contact with two of the captives taken from Israel during the Palestinian armed group’s attacks on October 7, 2023.\n\n“The risk that those captives have gone missing under rubble is very high, given that that area has been subjected to relentless bombardment in recent days,” Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud said.\n\nDiplomatic push to end the war\n\nAs the death toll since October 2023 in Gaza tops 66,000, the past few days have seen increasing talk of a diplomatic resolution to the nearly two-year-old war that a UN inquiry panel dubbed genocide.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Reuters news agency that he hoped to finalise a Gaza peace plan proposal in a meeting on Monday with Israel’s prime minister.\n\nTrump said he had received a “very good response” from Israel and Arab leaders to the Gaza peace plan proposal, and that “everybody wants to make a deal”. Hamas said the group had not yet received any proposal from Trump, nor from mediators.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is working on a ceasefire plan on the eve of his meeting with Trump.\n\n“We’re working on it,” Netanyahu said. “It’s not been finalised yet, but we’re working with President Trump’s team, actually, as we speak, and I hope we can – we can make it a go.”\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said that Hamas must lay down its arms or be defeated. He told Fox News on Sunday that he was willing to negotiate a deal in which Hamas leaders would be escorted out of Gaza.\n\nHamas has said it will not give up its weapons as long as Palestinians are struggling for a state, and has refused any expulsion of its leaders from Gaza.\n\nJordan’s King Abdullah II expressed optimism about Trump’s proposal, saying many of its details align with “what has been agreed upon”. The details of the 21-point plan for Gaza that was presented to Arab and Muslim leaders on Tuesday have not been disclosed, but the plan is reportedly designed to bar Hamas from any future role in governing the territory.\n\nIt is also said to include a promise from Trump that Israel will not annex the occupied West Bank, and involves military contributions from Arab and Muslim countries to guarantee security.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance has expressed cautious optimism over the deal. “I feel more optimistic about where we are right now than where we have been at any point in the last few months,” Vance said in an interview with Fox News. “But let’s be realistic, these things can get derailed at the very last minute. So while I remain very hopeful, I am cautiously hopeful.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said the original draft deal was changed after Trump’s meeting with Arab leaders to reflect Palestinian requests.\n\nWhile Trump is for the first time “talking seriously about the Palestinian state”, several questions remain unanswered, Bishara said.\n\n“Where is that Palestinian state? Will it be sovereign? Will it include Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem? None of that is mentioned there, but there are a number of elements to the liking of those other participants who want to see a pathway to a Palestinian state.”","summary":"The Israeli military targets hospitals and multistorey buildings as it intensifies its offensive to seize Gaza City.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/28/horrific-israel-bombs-hospitals-residential-towers-amid-gaza-onslaught?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-21T101859Z_243423749_RC27WGANBZFJ_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-1758463684.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:28:17","author":"Apps Support,Federica Marsi","authors":["Apps Support","Federica Marsi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.422},{"id":364325700,"title":"Portland residents mercilessly mock 'war prep' as protesters gather after Trump's plan to send in troops","text":"Portland residents have mercilessly mocked how they will deal with Donald Trump's plan to send in the National Guard to the Oregon city to handle 'domestic terrorists'. \n\nThe deployment is the latest in the US president's campaign to improve crime rates, targeting Democrat-led cities including Washington DC and Los Angeles. \n\nTrump said on Saturday that he was directing the Department of Defense to 'provide all necessary troops to protect war ravaged Portland'. \n\nOregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek responded, saying that Trump was abusing his authority by sending troops into a city which was doing 'just fine' on its own. \n\nResidents went a step further by posting images of Portland looking sunny and peaceful on social media while sarcastically describing it as 'war ravaged'. \n\nOne local @cheryl_v_w posted a photograph of the therapy llamas stationed at Portland International Airport where the troops will be landing. \n\n'Imagine the look on the faces of the troops landing in Portland when they're being greeted by the therapy llamas at the airport,' she wrote. \n\n'Yes, that's a real thing we have here.' The post showed two llamas wearing light blue deely boppers and matching saddles at the airport. \n\nAnother resident posted an image of a street lined with trees cloaked in rainbow-colored crochets with the caption: 'Makers unite. We knit at dawn. Portland prepares for war.' \n\n'Portland is a beautiful, safe, fun, and clean city. And anyone who says otherwise hasn't visited or enjoyed our food trucks,' another local wrote alongside a photograph of himself in a public park. \n\nSeveral government, police and business leaders have also said soldiers are not needed in Oregon and Trump is presenting a patently false picture of the city. \n\nPortland Mayor Keith Wilson on Saturday said there was no lawlessness or violence in his city. \n\nWilson said during a news conference the number of necessary troops is 'zero' in Portland, 'and any other American city'. \n\n'This is an American city,' Wilson said. 'We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target.'\n\nWilson claimed that video footage showing violence in the city was from five years ago. He said the footage had been 'recycled'. \n\nWilson told the news conference: 'If President Trump came to Portland today, what he would find is people riding their bikes, playing sports, enjoying the sunshine, buying groceries or produce from a farmers’ market.\n\n'We’ve had hard conversations, and we’ve done important work in the years since that footage was taken, we reformed our public safety system. \n\n'We’ve refocused our community and on our economy, and we’ve redoubled our efforts to help our most vulnerable.'\n\nTrump said the decision was necessary to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, which he alleged are 'under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists'.\n\n'I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,' Trump wrote.\n\nTrump also said he is authorizing 'full force, if necessary', but did not further elaborate. \n\nThere have been numerous protests at the ICE building in South Portland over the last several months. \n\nPeople frustrated with Trump's mass deportation policies began protesting in June, with one of the demonstrations morphing into a riot, according to police. Heavily armed law enforcement officers hit protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nThere have been more protests in July and this month at the same facility, The Oregonian reported. \n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment on the size and scope of the upcoming military deployment in Portland. There is also no further information on when troops are scheduled to arrive.\n\nPortland is the latest city Trump has sent troops to, with Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. getting boots on the ground over the summer.\n\nIn June, Trump deployed the National Guard and the Marines to quell rowdy protests in Los Angeles, again over his administration's immigration policies.\n\nIn August, he federalized Washington D.C.'s local police force while also activating the National Guard, claiming that the nation's capital had been 'overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people'.\n\nFollowing these actions, Trump has openly mused about sending troops to other cities, including New York City and Chicago.\n\nAfter Trump said earlier in September that he would be sending soldiers to Memphis, the city with the highest crime rate in the United States, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee confirmed Friday that federal agents are scheduled to arrive this coming Monday.\n\nOfficers from 13 federal agencies will join roughly 150 National Guard troops and state police troopers to support local law enforcement, Lee added.\n\nPortland, though not nearly as crime-ridden as Memphis, has had its fair share of problems over the last several years.\n\nThe city is known for its homeless problem, with many encampments crowding the formerly desirable downtown area.\n\nDrug use was rampant in these encampments, something exacerbated by Oregon's attempt to decriminalize formerly illicit substances.\n\nThe new law reduced possession of heroin, fentanyl and meth to the level of a parking ticket.\n\nFatal opioid overdoses surged, from 280 in 2019, to 628 in just the first six months of 2023 as homeless encampments and open-air drug markets spread throughout the city.\n\nAfter intense pressure, state lawmakers reversed the decriminalization with a law that went into effect on September 1, 2024.\n\nAnother factor in Portland's troubles in recent years, according to critics, was the election of Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt in May 2020.\n\nSchmidt was sworn in just before the death of George Floyd and once costly racial justice riots began to spread across the country, including to Portland, he took a soft approach.\n\nHe vowed not to prosecute rioters unless there was evidence of 'deliberate' property damage, theft, or threat of force. Of 550 cases referred by police, just 47 went to trial.\n\nMore than 2,600 businesses had fled the city center by September 2022 as shoppers avoided downtown areas and retail theft began to spiral. \n\nHowever, the new district attorney for the county, Nathan Vasquez, has been focused on reducing crime, an effort he believes will help the city's economy can recover.","summary":"Trump said on Saturday that he was directing the Department of Defense to 'provide all necessary troops to protect war ravaged Portland'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15142043/war-ravaged-portland-mocks-donald-trump-national-guard-troops.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/28/21/102524291-0-image-m-22_1759090869277.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/09/27/4923198901300447416/1024x576_MP4_4923198901300447416.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:25:32","author":"Editor,James Cirrone,Laura Parnaby","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone","Laura Parnaby"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.076},{"id":364324936,"title":"U.N. arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran over nuclear programme","text":"The United Nations has reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program following a process triggered by European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.\n\nBritain, France and Germany initiated the return of sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council over accusations it had violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nThe end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nU.N. sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8 p.m. EDT on Saturday (0000 GMT on Sunday). Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. this week.\n\n\"We urge Iran and all states to abide fully by these resolutions,\" the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany said in a joint statement after the deadline passed.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the bloc would \"now proceed to implement the re-imposition of all previously lifted U.N. and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay\".\n\nIsrael hailed the reimposition of sanctions on its arch foe as a \"major development\", citing what it called Tehran's ongoing violations over the nuclear program.\n\n\"The goal is clear: prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The world must use every tool to achieve this goal,\" the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a post on X.\n\nTehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions. Iran said on Saturday it was recalling its ambassadors to Britain, France and Germany for consultations. But Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Friday Iran had no intention of leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nRussia has disputed the return of U.N. sanctions on Iran.\n\n\"It is unlawful, and it cannot be implemented,\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters at the U.N. earlier on Saturday, adding that he had written to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warning that it would be \"a major mistake\" for him to acknowledge a return of U.N. sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe European powers had offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restored access for U.N. nuclear inspectors, addressed concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engaged in talks with the United States.\n\n\"Our countries will continue to pursue diplomatic routes and negotiations. The reimposition of U.N. sanctions is not the end of diplomacy,\" the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said, urging Iran to \"return to compliance\".\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement President Donald Trump has been clear that diplomacy is still an option for Iran and a deal remains the best outcome for the Iranian people and the world.\n\n\"For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks, held in good faith, without stalling or obfuscation,\" Rubio said, adding that until there was a new deal it was important for countries to implement sanctions \"immediately in order to pressure Iran's leaders\".\n\nIran's economy is already struggling with crippling U.S. sanctions reimposed since 2018 after Trump ditched the pact during his first term.\n\nIran's rial currency continued to weaken over fears of new sanctions. The rial fell to 1,123,000 per U.S. dollar, a new record low, on Saturday, from about 1,085,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange websites, including Bon-bast.com.\n\nWith the return of U.N. sanctions, Iran will again be subjected to an arms embargo and a ban on all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as well as any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\n\nOther sanctions to be reimposed include a travel ban on dozens of Iranian citizens, asset freezes on dozens of people and entities and a ban on the supply of anything that could be used in the nation's nuclear program.\n\nAll countries are authorised to seize and dispose of any items banned under U.N. sanctions and Iran will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in any commercial activity in another country involving uranium mining, production or use of nuclear materials and technology.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"The United Nations has reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program following a process triggered by European powers that Tehran has warned…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/un-arms-embargo-other-sanctions-reimposed-on-iran-over-nuclear-programme1","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/1d/7a/caf15b6321743c1154421885192b1c77e16a/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:20:42","author":"Japan Today Editor,Michelle Nichols","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Michelle Nichols"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":364334558,"title":"Trump: 'Peluang sebenar untuk kemajuan di Asia Barat'","text":"ISTANBUL: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump semalam berkata terdapat \"peluang sebenar untuk kemajuan di Asia Barat' lapor Anadolu Ajansi.\n\n\"Semua pihak bersama untuk sesuatu yang istimewa, buat pertama kali,\" tulis Trump di platform media sosialnya, Truth Social.\n\n\"Kami akan melaksanakannya,\" tambah beliau.\n\nKenyataan itu dibuat susulan mesyuarat pelbagai hala hari ini dengan beberapa pemimpin negara majoriti Islam di luar sidang Sesi ke-80 Perhimpunan Agung Pertubuhan Bangsa-Bangsa Bersatu (UNGA) di New York.\n\nMesyuarat bersama pemimpin Turkiye, Qatar, Arab Saudi, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mesir, Emiriah Arab Bersatu (UAE) dan Jordan itu memberi tumpuan utama kepada konflik Gaza serta usaha damai.\n\nTrump membentangkan pelan 21 perkara yang bertujuan menamatkan perang Gaza, memastikan pembebasan tawanan serta memulihkan wilayah berkenaan di bawah pentadbiran tanpa Hamas.\n\nPresiden AS itu juga berkata beliau tidak akan membenarkan Israel mengilhakkan Tebing Barat.\n\nTrump dijadualkan bertemu secara berasingan dengan Perdana Menteri Israel Benjamin Netanyahu semalam bagi membincangkan cadangan berkenaan.\n\nTentera Israel telah membunuh lebih 66,000 rakyat Palestin, kebanyakannya wanita dan kanak-kanak, di Gaza sejak Oktober 2023. \n\nPengeboman berterusan telah menjadikan wilayah itu tidak lagi boleh didiami serta mengakibatkan kebuluran dan penularan penyakit.","summary":"ISTANBUL: Presiden Amerika Syarikat (AS) Donald Trump semalam berkata terdapat “peluang sebenar untuk kemajuan di Asia Barat’ lapor Anadolu Ajansi.","url":"https://www.bharian.com.my/dunia/asia/2025/09/1451774/trump-peluang-sebenar-untuk-kemajuan-di-asia-barat","image":"https://assets.bharian.com.my/images/articles/BH29peluang-o_BHfield_image_listing_featured.var_1759101473.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:17:59","author":"BERNAMA-ANADOLU","authors":["BERNAMA-ANADOLU"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.685},{"id":364329748,"title":"Michigan Church Shooting: Are Attacks on Religious Institutions on the Rise in US?","text":"A man rammed his vehicle into a church in Michigan on Sunday before opening fire on the congregation, killing at least two people and wounding at least eight others, authorities said. Officials believe the suspect also set fire to the church before dying in an exchange of gunfire with responding officers. Hours later, US President Donald Trump described the incident as \"another deliberate attack on Christians\" and said the FBI would lead the federal investigation while assisting state and local authorities. The deadly attack in Michigan is the latest in a series of violent incidents targeting religious institutions across the United States. Catholic Church in Minnesota Two children were killed when gunfire erupted during a back-to-school Mass at the Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis on August 27. An assailant fired through the church's windows, killing an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuring 19 others, including 16 children.

Authorities said the attacker, a former student, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Baptist Church in Kentucky Two women were fatally shot and two others wounded on July 13 on the grounds of the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. Police said the gunman had earlier shot a state trooper during a traffic stop near Lexington's airport before carjacking another vehicle and driving 16 miles to the church, where he opened fire. The suspect was killed by officers at the scene. Authorities believe he may have had a personal connection to individuals at the church. Bible School in Michigan On June 22, a man wearing a tactical vest and carrying an AR-15-style rifle and a semiautomatic handgun opened fire inside a church in Wayne, Michigan, about 25 miles west of Detroit. The building was filled with children attending Vacation Bible School. One church employee was injured before members of the church's security team fatally shot the gunman. Police said the attacker's mother was a member of the church, and he had attended services there several times in the past year. Investigators said the motive remains unclear but noted the man may have been experiencing a mental health crisis. Christian School in Wisconsin In December 2024, a 15-year-old student opened fire at the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, killing a 14-year-old student and a teacher. Six others, including a teacher and five students, were wounded before the shooter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. The attack took place during the final week of classes before the Christmas break. Religious School in Tennessee Three students and three staff members were killed in March 2023 when a gunman opened fire at the Covenant School, a private Christian institution in Nashville. The victims included three 9-year-old students. Police identified the attacker as a former student who had planned the assault for several months. Investigators said the suspect fired 152 rounds during the attack, starting by shooting through the school's glass doors to gain entry.

As the S&P 500 Soared, He Made This 1 Stunning Move.","text":"When Warren Buffett speaks or makes a move, investors sit up and take notice. That's because this top investor steering the wheel at Berkshire Hathaway has driven the holding company to market-beating returns over nearly 60 years. Berkshire Hathaway has delivered a compound annual gain of almost 20% compared to the S&P 500's 10% such gain during that time period. It's not surprising that investors call Buffett \"the Oracle of Omaha,\" with Omaha referring to his hometown.\n\nIn recent times, Buffett, like all of us, has been investing amid a backdrop of enthusiasm. Though the S&P 500 slipped back in April on concerns about President Donald Trump's import tariffs, the index quickly rebounded and charged ahead, even reaching record levels in recent days. Investors have been piling into technology stocks, another move that signals optimism -- these players generally do well in a growth environment.\n\nBut Buffett, as usual, isn't investing like the masses. He doesn't follow trends, and often he makes moves that are quite different from those considered popular at a particular moment in time. This clearly has worked out for him, and likely for those who have followed some of his key decisions.\n\nSo, what's Warren Buffett doing now? In recent quarters, as the S&P 500 climbed, Buffett made this one stunning move. Does the billionaire know something Wall Street doesn't?\n\nBuffett's investment strategy\n\nFirst, let's talk a bit more about Buffett's general investment strategy. The billionaire, as mentioned, doesn't chase trends and avoids investing in companies or industries he doesn't know well. When investing he pays close attention to the price of a particular stock and aims to uncover quality companies that are currently undervalued by the rest of the market -- or at least trade for a reasonable price.\n\nFinally, Buffett is known for holding on to stocks for the long term. He's joked in the past about the subject, saying his ideal holding period is \"forever.\" Buffett truly follows through on this, as he's held one of his favorite stocks, Coca-Cola, since the late 1980s and hasn't expressed any interest in selling.\n\nNow, let's consider the stunning move Buffett made in recent quarters, as the S&P 500 soared. The top investor has built up a record level of cash, reaching a peak of more than $347 billion in the first quarter of this year and finishing the second quarter a bit lower, at about $344 billion.\n\nBRK.B Cash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nBuffett has bought some stocks in recent times. For example, he picked up health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group for a bargain in the second quarter -- the stock had declined amid headwinds but could represent an interesting recovery story. But for almost a dozen consecutive quarters, Buffett has been a net seller of equities.\n\n\"Nothing looks compelling\"\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote in his latest letter to shareholders.\n\nAnd that's likely the reason Buffett's cash levels have climbed. So, does Warren Buffet know something that Wall Street doesn't? It may be that Buffett has chosen to focus more on the following: Valuations have jumped in recent months as stocks have exploded higher, particularly in the area of technology.\n\nNVDA PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nTechnology stocks may bring great returns over the long term, but as a value investor, Buffett isn't seeking to get on that train. Instead, he aims to grow his cash level as the market becomes pricey and scoop up under-the-radar opportunities that Wall Street may be missing. Though Buffett's choices might not soar overnight, they could help him score a win over the long term -- as they've done in the past.\n\nBuffett's lesson for investors\n\nWhat does this mean for you? If you're an aggressive investor, you still may find opportunities to buy growth stocks -- even some of today's surging tech players. After all, the AI market may reach into the trillions in a few years, according to analysts' estimates, and many of today's quality tech companies are on track to benefit.\n\nWhether you're aggressive or cautious, it's still a great idea to, like Warren Buffett, look beyond current trends and Wall Street comments -- and consider undervalued players that might be tomorrow's winners. By carefully investing in some of today's hot stocks but also diversifying across Buffett-style stocks you could supercharge your portfolio over the long run.","summary":"When it comes to investing, Buffett doesn't follow the crowd.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/28/does-warren-buffett-know-something-wall-street-doe/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F835232%2Fwarren-buffett-4-tmf-may-2014.jpg&amp;op=resize&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:05:00","author":"Adria Cimino","authors":["Adria Cimino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.213},{"id":364333460,"title":"Harris claims Trump caused Kimmel suspension because he 'couldn't take a joke'","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n3 Play Sameday September 28, 2025 00:22 \n\n Harris claims Trump caused Kimmel suspension because he 'couldn't take a joke' \n Former Vice President Kamala Harris blamed President Donald Trump's \"fragile ego\" for Disney temporarily suspended Jimmy Kimmel's show after controversy.\n Tags V-VIDEOMEDIA","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris blamed President Donald Trump&apos;s &quot;fragile ego&quot; for Disney temporarily suspended Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s show after controversy.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6380229439112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/2d47736c-98e5-4aa8-ab98-dc23947b041a/9ed5e535-4297-4558-ba5b-7cbd4c190461/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:02:11","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-1},{"id":364333146,"title":"London mayor hits back at ‘misinformation’ as data shows fall in crimes","text":"The mayor of London has hit back at politicians “spreading misinformation” about safety in the capital as new data showed the number of violent crimes leading to injury has fallen in every borough over the past year.\n\nFigures from the mayor’s office for policing and crime, which compare the 12 months ending in August with the previous 12 months, showed there were 8,749 fewer crimes which resulted in someone being hurt – a drop of nearly 12% – across the capital over that time.\n\nWhile all 32 boroughs have seen a reduction, Havering in east London recorded the largest drop, with such crimes down by 16.3%, followed by Enfield in north London where they fell by 16.1%.\n\nGreenwich saw the smallest decrease with 4.3%, followed by Kensington and Chelsea with a drop of 4.6%.\n\nMayor Sir Sadiq Khan said: “We’ve seen a number of politicians here and across the globe talking down London and spreading misinformation about crime and safety in the capital.\n\n“The evidence is clear, our approach to tackling crime and its complex causes works. It’s driving down violence right across the capital.”\n\nEarlier this month, US President Donald Trump accused Sir Sadiq of doing a “terrible job”, adding that “crime in London is through the roof”, in their long-running war of words.\n\nSir Sadiq continued: “Violent crime with injury is down in every single London borough and that is testament to the incredible work of our brave police officers – who are arresting more than 1,000 additional suspects each month and solving crimes that involve victims at double the rate they were a year ago.\n\n“This is alongside the prevention work in our communities led by London’s violence reduction unit which has delivered over 450,000 positive opportunities and activities to divert young people away from violence and exploitation.\n\n“One death and one crime will always be one too many and that’s why I’m working with partners and the Government, to build on this progress and enhance our collective efforts to drive down every single crime wherever it happens in our great capital city to deliver a safer London for everyone.”\n\nAccording to the mayor’s office, overall homicides in London are at a 10-year low, with the capital’s rate lower than in Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Madrid and all major US cities.\n\nThe rate of homicide was down by 17% in the 12-month period to June this year compared with the 12-month period to May 2016.\n\nAnalysis of Office for National Statistics data, recorded in the 12 months to March this year, showed Londoners are less likely to be a victim of violent crime (26.4 offences per 1,000 population) than across the rest of England and Wales (31.9 offences per 1,000 population).\n\nMetropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Rachel Williams said: “Violence with injury is down in every single borough – a clear sign that our approach is making a difference. Homicide is now at its lowest level in a decade, violent crime resulting in injury has fallen and firearms discharges are less than half what they were seven years ago.\n\n“We’re targeting the most dangerous individuals, disrupting criminal networks, and investing in prevention to protect those most at risk.\n\n“That’s why fewer people are being hurt, fewer lives are being lost, and London is becoming a safer city.\n\n“We won’t stop until every Londoner feels safe, wherever they live, work, or go to school. We’re committed to listening, learning, and improving, so that our progress is not just sustained, but accelerated.”\n\nThe Tories rejected the suggestion that London is safer.\n\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said: “Sadiq Khan seems to be the only person who thinks there is no crime problem in London.\n\n“He cherry-picks his numbers and hopes Londoners will forget the reality that knife crime is up 86% on his watch, stop and search collapsed by more than half, and London now accounts for nearly half of all knife-point robberies in England.\n\n“Under this Labour mayor, criminals know the odds are stacked in their favour.\n\n“Only one in 20 robberies is solved, fewer offenders are being jailed, and more than a thousand police officers have been cut from the Metropolitan Police, with Sir Mark Rowley warning of further losses this year.\n\n“Londoners don’t feel safer because London isn’t safer.\n\n“Labour are weak on crime, soft on criminals, and too scared to confront the reality on our streets.

looming crisis as US trade war with China cripples sales","text":"Kennard, Nebraska, feels a long way from Beijing or even Washington, D.C.\n\nBut as the United States and China remain locked in a trade war, the Cornhusker State and its farmers like Scott Thomsen are caught in the middle of the conflict.\n\nThomsen, a fourth-generation farmer who farms corn, cattle and soybeans, was preparing to harvest soybeans planted last winter – at a moment when China has stopped purchasing American soybeans in response to the Trump administration's tariffs.\n\n\"China has not bought a single export cargo of beans so far this year, which is not very typical,\" Thomsen told ABC News on his family's farm in Kennard, in eastern Nebraska.\n\n\"When China quits buying, our prices go down,\" he said.\n\nA looming crisis\n\nChina is the world's largest soybean buyer, importing more soybeans over the last five years than every other country combined, according to the American Soybean Association.\n\nIn the seven years leading up to the 2018 trade war during the first Trump administration, roughly 60% of all U.S. soybean exports went to China.\n\nToday, Beijing is turning to South America, and particularly to Brazil, for soybeans amid trade negotiations with the United States.\n\nFor American farmers who export their harvests directly to Asia, the evaporation of Chinese demand for soybeans -- at a time when fertilizer and other inputs have become more expensive -- could potentially be devastating, and lead to bankruptcies and foreclosures.\n\n\"It's just a massive shock to our markets,\" Cory Walters, a professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at the University of Nebraska, told ABC News.\n\nIn conversations across eastern Nebraska and in Washington, D.C., where some farmers lobbied lawmakers and the Trump administration for financial assistance ahead of the harvest, more than a dozen farmers told ABC News they felt like bargaining chips between the U.S. and China.\n\nThey said they were worried about how the potential crisis could reverberate across rural America.\n\n\"We're in the middle of the worst economic downturn that I've seen in my 50 years,\" John Hansen, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, said at a regional meeting in Beatrice, Nebraska, last week.\n\n\"Agriculture is our foundation here in Nebraska and many states in the Midwest,\" Don Schuller, a corn and soybean farmer, told ABC News. \"If agriculture is failing here everything is going to fail.\"\n\nIn some areas, farmers who can't sell their crops to crushing plants producing oil used for cooking and biofuels say they are worried that grain elevators and storage facilities will stop purchasing soybeans.\n\nA lack of space and concerns about being able to resell the crop-- and that soybean farmers from other states that are unable to sell to China will flood their local markets -- will further depress prices, the farmers say.\n\nTrump offers help, but no concrete solutions so far\n\nIn conversations with ABC News, some farmers who said they supported President Donald Trump felt frustrated by the soybean crisis, in part because Trump had promises to support farmers.\n\n\"I won 80%, 85% of the farmers. And I love them,\" Trump said in June. \"I'm never going to do anything to hurt our farmers.\"\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, when China first tightened soybean purchases from the U.S. for trade leverage, the White House delivered tens of billions in payouts to farmers to help them bridge the gap in demand.\n\nIn August, Trump urged China to start buying soybeans again, posting on social media, \"I hope China will quickly quadruple it's soybean orders.\"\n\nOn Thursday, he told reporters at the White House he hoped to take some of the money raised by tariffs and \"give it to our farmers,\" even though the Department of Agriculture has not yet unveiled a plan.\n\nRepresentatives from the USDA told ABC News that discussions are still ongoing.\n\n\"Soybean, corn, wheat, sorghum, cotton farmers are facing very difficult times,\" Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \"We are currently in conversations here at the White House, across the government, on a farmer aid package.\"\n\nChinese commerce ministry spokesperson He Yadong said in a statement, \"Regarding the trade of soybeans, the United States should take positive action to cancel the relevant unreasonable tariffs to create conditions for expanding bilateral trade.\"\n\nThomsen, who said he voted for Trump, said he still supports the administration's position amid negotiations with China.\n\n\"I voted for him because I'd like to see manufacturing come back to this country. I'd to see good paying jobs. I want to see everybody do better. And I think this is some short-term pain for a long-term gain,\" he said.\n\nFarmers are more resilient than most people, Thomsen added, used to weathering the boom-and-bust cycles of years past.\n\n\"This is not an easy life. Why do you guys choose this? Why does this matter?\" ABC News' Matt Rivers asked Thomsen.\n\n\"I would say there's a few days in the middle of winter and middle of summer that everybody asks themselves that question,\" Thomsen replied.\n\n\"But you stick with it,\" Rivers said.\n\n\"It's a passion. It's a tradition. It' a hobby,\" Thomsen said.\n\n\"There's farmers in our area that have full-time jobs and they'll do it after working on the weekends. That's what they grew up doing and people have a lot of passion for it,\" he added.","summary":"Soybean farmers say they've been dealing with huge surpluses and lower sales after China halted their purchases due to Trump's trade policies.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/soybean-farmers-caught-looming-crisis-us-trade-war/story?id=125943171","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d60fbbc0-17b7-4fb6-adc1-d33acad13e79/soybean-farmer-abc-jt-250927_1758988629373_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 23:00:47","author":"Benjamin Siegel,Matt Rivers","authors":["Benjamin Siegel","Matt Rivers"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":364327380,"title":"2 dead, 8 wounded in shooting and fire at Michigan church, police say","text":"Grand Blanc Township (US), Sep 29 (AP) A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service before apparently setting the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring eight others before police shot him, authorities said Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a pickup truck through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters.

He also apparently set the building on fire. The attacker was killed by police in the parking lot about eight minutes after the first 911 call, Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said.In addition to the two fatalities, one person was in critical condition and seven others were wounded and listed in stable condition, Renye added.Authorities identified the suspected gunman as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40. Renye did not offer a motive during an initial press conference and declined to take questions, saying a second briefing would follow later Sunday.Images from the scene show the church largely reduced to ashes. Renye said that hundreds were inside when the attack began, and that additional victims might be discovered amid the debris.Trump described the shooting as “horrendous” and “yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America.” FBI teams are assisting the probe, with the agency’s head, Kash Patel, calling violence in places of worship a “cowardly and criminal act.” Attorney General Pam Bondi said she has been briefed.The LDS Church said the attack was a “tragic act of violence,” noting that “places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved.”Sunday’s massacre adds to a wave of high-profile shootings in recent weeks, including an attack at a Catholic church and school in Minnesota, and a deadly shooting at a federal immigration facility in Texas.

El Congreso tiene como fecha límite el 30 de septiembre para aprobar un nuevo presupuesto y evitar un cierre del gobierno.\n\nEstudios estiman que alrededor de 5 millones de estadounidenses no renovarían su cobertura a través de los mercados de seguros médicos de la Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio, como Covered California, si estos pagos no se renuevan antes de fin de año. El mercado calculó que los consumidores de California con planes de intercambio verían un aumento promedio de la prima del 97 % si no se extienden los créditos.\n\nUn desglose publicado por Covered California muestra que alrededor de 120.000 afiliados en el condado de San Diego se verían afectados, y las primas mensuales aumentarían $125 en promedio.\n\nFuncionarios declararon durante la conferencia de prensa del jueves que cerca de 660,000 californianos se verán afectados si no se renuevan los créditos.\n\nDado que el estancamiento en el Congreso ha impedido la aprobación del presupuesto federal, los demócratas han atraído cada vez más atención por su postura sobre este tema en particular. Los líderes del partido han indicado que están dispuestos a permitir que se lleve a cabo un cierre gubernamental la próxima semana si no se toman medidas para renovar los créditos.\n\nLos líderes del Congreso, según Levin, tenían previsto reunirse con el presidente y los líderes republicanos para discutir la preservación de los créditos, pero dicha reunión no se materializó.\n\n“En mi opinión, toda esta situación recae sobre él (Trump) y sobre los líderes republicanos del Congreso, quienes lo empoderan sin importar el costo”, declaró Levin.\n\n“Lo que buscamos en estas negociaciones sobre el presupuesto, que vencen en unos días, es bastante simple y, en mi opinión, bastante razonable: no aumentar el seguro médico de millones de personas”, añadió Schiff. “No dejarlos sin seguro médico por el alto precio”.\n\nJonathan Wilcox, subjefe de gabinete del representante Darrell Issa, el republicano más prominente del condado de San Diego en el Congreso, no le dio muchas posibilidades de éxito a la estrategia de vincular la renovación del crédito fiscal a la aprobación del presupuesto.\n\n“Mike Levin y Adam Schiff exigen el cierre del gobierno si no consiguen miles de millones más en gasto público. Estoy seguro de que el público concluiría que esto es un chantaje político clásico si no fuera tan falso y carente de fundamento. El congresista Issa trabajó arduamente para mantener el gobierno abierto y cree que este engaño demócrata no llegará muy lejos”, declaró Wilcox en un correo electrónico.\n\nSchiff y Levin eligieron un centro de salud TrueCare en Mesa Drive, Oceanside, para transmitir su mensaje. Anteriormente conocido como Servicios de Salud del Condado Norte, este centro de salud con certificación federal cuenta con 22 ubicaciones en la región. Estas organizaciones generalmente brindan servicios de atención primaria a residentes con cobertura de Medi-Cal, el programa estatal de seguro médico de último recurso para residentes necesitados o con discapacidades.\n\nMichelle Gonzalez, presidenta y directora ejecutiva de la organización, señaló que el sistema no está preparado para absorber la atención de tantos residentes adicionales sin cobertura médica.\n\n“Los centros de salud se enfrentan a costos exorbitantes, operan con márgenes de beneficio muy ajustados y enfrentan una financiación incierta, todo ello mientras trabajan bajo el mandato de atender a todos los que entran por nuestras puertas”, declaró Gonzalez.\n\nSchiff instó al presidente a negociar el tema.\n\n“No sé por qué luchan con tanta fuerza por el derecho a aumentar los costos del seguro médico”, dijo Schiff. “Me parece insostenible, pero ahí están”.\n\nThe Hill, una publicación que cubre política y políticas públicas en Washington, publicó el jueves por la mañana un artículo sobre la estrategia de los demócratas en torno a los créditos fiscales para las primas, que citaba al líder de la mayoría del Senado, John Thune, republicano por Dakota del Sur, al respecto.\n\n“Este es un programa que necesita una reforma, pero creo que todos están dispuestos a sentarse y hablar sobre cómo lograrlo en un contexto donde se debe discutir, no como rehén para mantener abierto el gobierno”, dijo Thune a The Hill.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"Trump y sus partidarios no han estado dispuestos a negociar la preservación de los subsidios de Obamacare que expirarán pronto.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/09/28/los-democratas-destacan-su-demanda-de-que-se-restablezcan-los-subsidios-al-seguro-medico-en-el-estancamiento-presupuestario/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SUT-L-LEVINHEALTH004.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 22:24:04","author":"Paul Sisson","authors":["Paul Sisson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":364327372,"title":"What to know about Michigan Mormon church shooting","text":"The church was also set on fire, although it’s unclear how it started.

Armed agents and National Guard personnel have been deployed in response to immigration enforcement and crime-fighting initiatives announced by President Donald Trump, prompting protests and criticism that the presence is more intimidating than protective. Chicago Armed federal agents patrolled downtown Chicago on Sunday as part of an expanded immigration enforcement operation, following President Donald Trump’s announcement that he would deploy troops to Portland. The move marks a growing federal law enforcement presence in multiple US cities. Dozens of agents, wearing full tactical gear, walked through prominent tourist and shopping areas, drawing the attention of shoppers and diners. Some filmed the agents while activists trailed them, blowing whistles and shouting. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticised the show of force, saying: \"While Chicagoans and visitors are enjoying another gorgeous Sunday, they are being intimidated by masked federal agents flaunting automatic weapons for no apparent reason.\" Illinois Governor JB Pritzker echoed the concerns, adding: \"This is not making anybody safer — it’s a show of intimidation, instilling fear in our communities and hurting our businesses.\" Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol agent involved in the Los Angeles immigration crackdown, confirmed that agents made \"several arrests\" but did not specify whether the downtown patrols targeted particular individuals. \"We’ve always got a target that’s anyone who is here illegally,\" he said. Tensions also flared outside an ICE building in suburban Broadview, about 12 miles west of Chicago, where agents fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters over the weekend. Broadview Mayor criticised ICE for endangering local responders and residents. Activists have also raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which they say operates as a de facto detention centre. Portland Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said Trump was abusing his authority by suggesting the deployment of troops to Portland to handle so-called \"domestic terrorists.\" \"There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security,\" she said. Small demonstrations continued outside an ICE facility late Saturday, where one person was arrested after a brief confrontation with federal agents clearing a vehicle path. Officials say several protesters and federal personnel have been injured during previous demonstrations. A Pentagon spokesperson said the Department of Defense would provide updates when available. The Oregon National Guard noted that any requests for support would be coordinated through the governor’s office. Memphis Earlier this month, Trump announced the creation of a federal law enforcement task force to tackle crime in Memphis, a city with high rates of violent crime in recent years. Governor Bill Lee said up to 150 National Guard members may be sent, though he added that they would not make arrests and would remain unarmed unless local authorities requested it. Lee also confirmed that 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol officers would be deployed. Community members have expressed concern that increased ICE activity could lead to detentions of legally residing residents. On Saturday, dozens of people marched to City Hall to protest, calling instead for more funding for education, crime prevention, youth services and healthcare. Federal law enforcement operations in Chicago, Portland and Memphis highlight growing tensions between local and federal authorities, particularly regarding immigration enforcement and public safety strategies.

It’s just a good message,” he said in a phone call. Hegseth last week summoned hundreds of senior military leaders, who are stationed all over the world, for a meeting of the Defense Department’s top brass. An official familiar with the plans for the meeting told NBC News last week that its purpose is for Hegseth to highlight military accomplishments and to discuss the future of the Pentagon under his leadership. Church attack kills 2; suspect also killed A 40-year-old man drove a vehicle through the front doors of a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints building Sunday in Grand Blanc, Michigan, and opened fire. At least two people were killed and multiple others were injured, authorities said. The suspect, identified as a man from Burton, was also killed in the shooting. He got out of his vehicle and began firing rounds at people who were attending a church service, police said. A fire, believed to have been deliberately set by the gunman, also broke out at the church, authorities said. It has been contained, and more victims might be found inside the church. As many as three improvised devices were found at the scene, according to two senior U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. However, the investigation is still in its early stages, and it’s not clear whether they were incendiary devices or explosive devices, according to the people who were briefed. The shooting occurred hours after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, died at the age of 101. Trump directs defense secretary to deploy troops to Portland President Donald Trump said he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “provide all necessary Troops” to Portland, Oregon. Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social that the troops would “protect War ravaged Portland” and protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities that he claimed are “under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists.” Trump added that he is “authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” but didn’t clarify what that meant. Pentagon officials appeared to be surprised by the post and told NBC News they weren’t aware of any new orders to send troops into Portland. The officials said they had no immediate information about any potential operation, including the size and scope of the mission or who — National Guard or active-duty forces — would be deployed. Meet the Press A defiant Senate Majority Leader John Thune vowed that Republicans will hold firm on their seven-week funding bill, insisting that the only way to prevent a government shutdown Tuesday is for Democrats to support it. In an interview with “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker, Thune, R-S.D., said it’s “totally up to the Democrats” whether a shutdown will be avoided, likening the party to hostage-takers who are “hijacking” the process to pursue ideological demands. He said Republicans won’t compromise on the short-term bill, calling it a mechanism to keep pursuing a long-term deal. Democrats have pushed for an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies, which Thune said he’s open to discussing, but not as part of the funding bill and only with reforms. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Congress can still avert a shutdown, but only if Republicans engage in a “serious negotiation.” President Donald Trump will meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday. “We need the meeting. It’s a first step, but only a first step. We need a serious negotiation,” Schumer said. “Now, if the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done.” Politics in brief Adams drops out: New York Mayor Eric Adams announced he is dropping his third-party bid for re-election, narrowing the field for November’s election.

In South Texas, a town struggles for water A small town in South Texas is scrambling to find alternative sources of drinking water as severe drought grips the region and threatens to dry up its main supply. The city of Mathis typically pumps its drinking water from Lake Corpus Christi, but water levels are expected to plunge too low to safely extract anything usable, City Manager Cedric Davis said. “It’s going to be difficult to pull clear water out of the lake because we’ll be pulling up mud with the water,” he said. All that mud could damage the city’s filtration and water treatment systems, used to service 4,300 residents, he added. The situation in Texas highlights a growing problem in drought-prone parts of the country — and the world — as climate change alters precipitation patterns, intensifies drought and saps the availability of safe drinking water. Malik Nabers injury casts pall over Giants’ first victory New York Giants star wide receiver Malik Nabers was carted from the field after he apparently injured his right leg in the second quarter against the Los Angeles Chargers. Quarterback Jaxson Dart, making his first NFL start, launched a deep pass down the right sideline — a free play after the Chargers’ Troy Dye jumped offside — toward a streaking Nabers, whose right leg appeared to buckle as he went up to try to catch the pass, which fell incomplete. The apparent injury to the second-year receiver cast a cloud over the Giants’ 21-18 win in East Rutherford, New Jersey, New York’s first victory of the season and Los Angeles’ first loss.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala was puzzled because she had received two versions of the indictment, both signed by the grand jury's foreperson, that seemed inconsistent with each other.\n\nHalligan, a defense lawyer with no prosecutorial experience whom President Donald Trump had appointed as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia just a few days earlier, said she had \"only reviewed\" one of the indictments, \"did not see the other one,\" and didn't \"know where that came from.\" When Vaala pointed out that the document Halligan claimed she never saw \"has your signature on it,\" the neophyte prosecutor was nonplussed. \"OK,\" she said. \"Well.\"\n\nThat embarrassing episode reinforced the impression that Trump, in his eagerness to pursue a personal vendetta against Comey, had settled on an agent who was manifestly unqualified to run one of the country's most prominent U.S. attorney's offices. Trump's desperate thirst for revenge, which was also evident in his public comments about the case, supports an argument that Comey's lawyers are apt to make in seeking dismissal of the charges against him: that he is a victim of selective or vindictive prosecution.\n\nA claim of selective prosecution alleges that the defendant was singled out for punishment when \"similarly situated individuals\" were not charged. Vindictive prosecution entails punishing a defendant for exercising his procedural rights. If Halligan files additional charges against Comey, for example, he could argue that she was retaliating against him for challenging the original indictment.\n\nSuch claims are rarely successful because they require evidence that a prosecutorial decision was influenced by improper motives. But in this case, there is no shortage of evidence that the decision to accuse Comey of lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020 was driven by presidential pique.\n\nTrump fired Comey in 2017 out of anger at the FBI investigation of alleged ties between his 2016 campaign and the Russian government. In the years since, Trump has made no secret of his desire to punish Comey for that \"witch hunt,\" which FBI Director Kash Patel cited in defending the indictment even though the charges are legally unrelated to the Russia probe.\n\nThose charges, which include one count of \"willfully and knowingly\" making \"a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement\" to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding, were filed just five days before they would have been barred by the five-year statute of limitations. The Justice Department nearly missed that deadline because neither career prosecutors nor Halligan's predecessor, Erik Seibert, thought there was sufficient evidence to justify the charges announced on Thursday.\n\nAccording to news reports citing unnamed sources, top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, were also skeptical. But the president was clear about what he wanted to happen.\n\n\"We can't delay any longer,\" Trump declared in a September 20 Truth Social post that directly addressed Bondi. \"It's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"\n\nWho were \"they\"? Trump specifically mentioned Comey, along with two other nemeses: Sen. Adam Schiff (D–Calif.) and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nBy that point, Trump had already fired Seibert and picked Halligan, who was sworn in two days later, to replace him. Trump described Halligan, who had served on his personal defense team, as \"a really good lawyer.\"\n\nJudging from Halligan's encounter with Vaala, that may have been an overstatement. \"This has never happened before,\" Vaala remarked. \"I've been handed two documents [in the Comey case] that are inconsistent with one another. There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the [grand jury] foreperson.\"\n\nOne indictment listed the two charges approved by the grand jury, while the other mentioned a third count that the grand jury rejected, involving allegedly false statements during the same Senate hearing. The latter document, Vaala noted, described \"a failure to concur in an indictment\" but did not specify which count was rejected, so \"it looks like they failed to concur across all three counts.\" The judge said she was \"a little confused as to why I was handed two things with the same case number that are inconsistent.\"\n\nThe fact that the grand jury rejected any of the charges against Comey was itself remarkable. Because such proceedings entail a one-sided presentation of allegations that the government claims establish probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, grand juries almost never decline to indict. In fiscal year 2016, according to a Justice Department report, U.S. attorneys opened about 152,000 cases, just six of which ended in \"no bill\" from a grand jury.\n\nIt was even more striking that a U.S. attorney, confronted by such a rare situation, would accidentally submit two seemingly contradictory grand jury reports. Halligan's confusion reflects both her inexperience and the unseemly haste with which she rushed to obtain the indictment demanded by the president before it was too late. Tellingly, that indictment was signed by Halligan alone, without the signatures of any underlings who agreed that the charges were legally justified.\n\nAfter the indictment was announced, Trump publicly gloated. That evening, he described Comey as \"one of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to,\" adding that \"he has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation.\"\n\nThe next morning, Trump called Comey \"A DIRTY COP.\" That evening, he thanked Patel and \"the outstanding members of the FBI\" for \"their brilliant work on the recent Indictment of the Worst FBI Director in the History of our Country, James 'Dirty Cop' Comey.\" He said \"the level of enthusiasm by the FBI was incredible\" but understandable because \"they knew Comey for what he is, and was\"—i.e., \"a total SLIMEBALL!\"\n\nTrump added an even worse insult while speaking to reporters on Friday. \"James Comey essentially was a Democrat,\" the president said. \"He was worse than a Democrat.\"\n\nAlthough Trump suggested that Comey was getting what he deserved for being a terrible person, a \"SLIMEBALL,\" and \"worse than a Democrat,\" none of those is actually a crime. The accusation that Comey was \"A DIRTY COP\" came closer to conduct that might justify a criminal charge. But the indictment does not allege corruption or abuse of power. And despite Patel's framing, it is not even legally related to \"Russiagate.\"\n\nRather, the indictment involves Comey's reaffirmation of his earlier testimony that he never authorized anyone at the FBI to be \"an anonymous source in news stories about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation\"—i.e., the FBI probe that examined Hillary Clinton's handling of classified material as secretary of state, including her use of a private email server. That denial was a lie, the indictment says, because Comey \"then and there knew\" that \"he in fact had authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation concerning PERSON 1.\"\n\nThe rejected count indicates that \"PERSON 1\" is Clinton, and the exchange with Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas) cited in the indictment suggests that \"PERSON 3\" is former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who in 2016 authorized the disclosure of information about an FBI probe of the Clinton Foundation to The Wall Street Journal. The day after the Journal's story ran, McCabe claimed, he informed Comey of what he had done, and his boss expressed approval.\n\nWhen the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigated the leak, Comey contradicted that account, and the OIG credited his version of events. The resulting OIG report concluded that \"McCabe did not tell Comey on or around October 31 (or at any other time) that he (McCabe) had authorized the disclosure of information about the [Clinton Foundation] Investigation to the WSJ.\" It added that \"had McCabe done so, we believe that Comey would have objected to the disclosure.\"\n\nIn addition to that assessment, the case against Comey is complicated by doubts as to exactly what Comey was denying when he told Cruz that he stood by his earlier testimony, which involved the email investigation rather than the Clinton Foundation probe. It is not hard to see why Seibert and the prosecutors working for him did not think the case was worth pursuing.\n\nNone of that mattered to Trump, who was determined to get Comey one way or another. \"The whole thing is just bizarro,\" former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy, a legal analyst at National Review, told Politico. \"This is the kind of thing that should never ever happen.…This case should never go to trial because it's obvious from the four corners of the indictment that there's no case.\"\n\nMcCarthy elaborates on that point in a National Review essay. \"The vindictive indictment the Trump Justice Department barely managed to get a grand jury to approve on Thursday is so ill-conceived and incompetently drafted, he should be able to get it thrown out on a pretrial motion to dismiss,\" McCarthy writes, noting that the skimpy two-page indictment lacks \"any description of the incident involving McCabe, Clinton, and Comey out of which the perjury charge supposedly arises.\"\n\nIn any case, McCarthy says, McCabe \"is not a credible witness, particularly on this subject.\" The OIG, he notes, \"found that Comey's account that he did not approve the leak was overwhelmingly corroborated while McCabe's account was full of holes.\" And even if Halligan believes (or claims to believe) McCabe rather than Comey, McCabe did not claim that Comey \"authorized\" the Wall Street Journal leak—only that he expressed approval after the fact.\n\nHalligan overlooked these problems in her eagerness to do what Trump wanted. The case against Comey is \"the very definition of selective and vindictive prosecution,\" says Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. \"By demanding the prosecutions, Trump may have undercut any possibility of success by providing the people on his 'enemies list' with a built-in defense.\"\n\nDuke University law professor Samuel W. Buell was skeptical of that argument in an interview with The New York Times. \"Trump's being really crass and blatant about the ways he is talking about all that stuff,\" Buell said. \"But I don't know that that's going to give rise to a motion that would invalidate a whole prosecution.\"\n\nJessica Roth, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, likewise noted that the case against Comey is \"not like other cases where we typically see such claims.\" But \"that doesn't mean it can't fall within the concerns and the legal standards for vindictive and selection prosecution,\" she added.\n\nAt the very least, Trump has given Comey's lawyers ammunition they would not otherwise have. A former Eastern District of Virginia prosecutor, who \"was granted anonymity because he fears retaliation for speaking about the case,\" thinks Trump's statements pose a serious problem for Halligan. \"If I'm defending Comey, that Trump order to Pam Bondi to prosecute him, that's a big problem,\" he told Politico. \"That's going to bite them in a big way.…Comey could become the poster child for selective prosecution.\"","summary":"By demanding that the Justice Department punish the former FBI director for wronging him, the president provided evidence to support a claim of selective or vindictive prosecution.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/09/28/trumps-public-comments-could-further-complicate-the-shaky-case-against-james-comey/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/09/James-Comey-6-8-17-Newscom-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 22:15:40","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.401},{"id":364329750,"title":"'Everybody Wants To Make The Deal': Donald Trump On Gaza Peace Plan","text":"US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he has received a “very good response” to his proposal to end the war in Gaza.

Trump said that US special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who served as a Middle East envoy during Trump’s first term, are already discussing the plan with Netanyahu in New York, as per Reuters report. US Unveils 21-Point Peace Plan The US unveiled a 21-point Middle East peace proposal at the United Nations in New York this week, aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. The plan calls for the return of all hostages, living or dead, a halt to Israeli attacks on Qatar, and a renewed dialogue between Israel and Palestinians for peaceful coexistence. A Hamas representative said on Saturday that the group has not seen the US plan. Trump credited leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan for helping with the process. He added that the deal could not only end the Gaza conflict but also contribute to broader peace in the Middle East. “Everybody’s involved,” Trump said. “Everybody wants it, and Hamas wants it, and one of the reasons is because everybody’s tired of war.” Trump did not provide details about a potential ceasefire-for-hostages agreement. Earlier, Vice President JD Vance said top US officials are engaged in “very complicated” negotiations with Israeli and Arab leaders. Netanyahu said amnesty might be possible for Hamas leaders under the agreement if they finish the war and release all hostages. Key Objectives Of Plan Vance described the plan’s three main goals -- returning all hostages, stopping the Hamas threat to Israel, and increasing humanitarian aid in Gaza. “I feel more optimistic about where we are right now than where we have been at any point in the last few months,” Vance said, adding that negotiations could still be derailed at the last minute.

Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) condemned the removal of national park signage as a blatant attempt to “whitewash history” and “limit the exchange and expression of factual information about climate science.” \n\n“Our national parks are not billboards for propaganda,” she wrote. “They are places where millions of people come each year to learn, reflect, and confront both the beauty and the difficult truths of our shared history. Stripping away this context erodes the very mission of the Park Service and insults the public’s right to know.”\n\nPingree noted that the signs — six tripods at Cadillac Mountain, four at Great Meadow — were created with local partners and “meant to underscore the impacts of climate change — which are well-documented, increasingly visible, and not in dispute within the scientific community.”\n\nThe Interior Department, which oversees the National Park Service, did not answer questions from The Maine Monitor about what information on the signs warranted their removal.\n\n“Thanks to President Donald Trump, Interior is ensuring that the American people are no longer being fed the lies of the delusional Green New Scam,” Interior spokesperson Aubrie Spady wrote in an email, referring to the Green New Deal, a broad set of environmental proposals that never passed into law. “The content was taken down because this administration believes in only administering facts based on real science to the American public, not brainless fear-mongering rhetoric used to steal taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe ongoing effort to rid national park sites of certain interpretive signage stems from an executive order Trump signed in March, which tasked the Interior Department with removing items that “perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.” \n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum followed up with his own secretarial order in May, ordering agencies within Interior to remove any content that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living” or “emphasizes matters unrelated to the beauty, abundance, or grandeur” of a natural feature.\n\nOver the summer, the agency went as far as to put up new signs calling on members of the public to report “any signs or other information that are negative about either past or living Americans or that fail to emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.”\n\nMore than 100 organizations, including Friends of Acadia, signed on to a letter late last month that implored Burgum to rescind his order, which they argue “undermines the Department of the Interior’s responsibility to steward not only the landscapes we all share but also the layered histories embedded within them.” (Friends of Acadia partnered with the National Park Service and other organizations to erect the interpretive signs.)\n\nAt other sites around the country, the National Park Service has removed information related to slavery, the forced incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II and conflicts with Native Americans, The Washington Post reported last week.\n\nTodd Martin, northeast senior program manager at the National Parks Conservation Association, told The Maine Monitor that when people visit a national park, they deserve to see uncensored information about that place and its history — the good and the bad.\n\n“That’s exactly what these signs at Acadia were trying to do,” he said. “We have decades of scientific research that demonstrate the impact of climate change on Maine and Acadia National Park — longer droughts, more intense precipitation events, more intense coastal storms, sea level rise. We have the science to back that up.

(AP pic)\nWASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump told Reuters on Sunday that he has received a \"very good response\" to his proposal for ending the war in Gaza and is optimistic about getting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to back it when the two meet on Monday.\nHe said US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who was a Middle East envoy during his first term, were having talks with Netanyahu in New York ahead of the Monday meeting at the White House.\n\"We’re getting a very good response because Bibi wants to make the deal too,\" Trump said in a telephone interview, using Netanyahu's nickname. \"Everybody wants to make the deal.\"\nWhen international leaders gathered at the United Nations in New York this week, the US unveiled a 21-point Middle East peace plan to end the nearly two-year-long war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\nThat plan calls for the return of all hostages, living and dead, no further Israeli attacks on Qatar and a new dialogue between Israel and Palestinians for “peaceful coexistence,” a White House official said.\nA Hamas representative said on Saturday that the group had not seen the US plan that was presented at the UN.\nTrump on Sunday credited the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan, among others, for helping in the process.\nHe said the deal would not only end the Gaza conflict but would work toward a broader peace in the Middle East.\n\"Everybody's involved,\" he said. \"Everybody wants it, and Hamas wants it, and one of the reasons is because everybody's tired\" of war.\nTrump did not provide specific details of a prospective ceasefire-for-hostages agreement in Gaza, but vice president JD Vance told “Fox News Sunday” that top US officials are immersed in \"very complicated\" negotiations with Israeli and Arab leaders.\nNetanyahu, in an interview on Fox News Channel's \"The Sunday Briefing,\" said it is possible to have amnesty for Hamas leaders under terms of the agreement.\n\"The details of this have to be worked out. But in previous statements, I said that if leaders, if Hamas leaders, for example, are escorted out of the country, yeah, if they finish the war, release all the hostages.

Hezbollah maintains that the disarmament plan approved by the Lebanese government only serves Israel’s interests.\n\nThe US and its closest regional ally, Israel, have been seeking the complete disarmament of Hezbollah, which started firing rockets at Israel a day after Israel launched its war on Gaza on October 7, 2023. By the time a ceasefire was agreed to on November 27, Israel’s strikes on Lebanon had crippled Hezbollah’s military capability and killed more than 4,000 people.\n\nThough weakened by the war, Hezbollah remains a major political force representing the Shia community, and its allies hold seats in the parliament.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera Arabic, Barrack said that Hezbollah is “a legitimate political party in Lebanon”, adding that its legitimacy within the confessional power-sharing system, where political position is divided among sects, complicates ending the ongoing conflict with Israel.\n\nNear-daily Israeli attacks\n\nThe US envoy described Hezbollah, which the US classifies as a foreign “terrorist” organisation, as “an essential part of the Lebanese political system”.\n\nThis constitutes “a complex problem for Lebanese political leaders”, who agreed to the objectives of a US-backed plan for Hezbollah to hand in their arsenal.\n\nLebanon’s cabinet approved the plan on August 7, despite Hezbollah’s outright refusal to disarm, raising fears that Israel could intensify attacks on Lebanon.\n\nIsrael continues to occupy Lebanese territory and has carried out near-daily attacks in southern Lebanon since the November ceasefire agreement.\n\nLebanon’s state-run National News Agency on Sunday reported “a series” of Israeli air strikes near the towns of Kfar Rumman and Jarmak, and a drone strike on a home in Humin, all in the country’s south.\n\nBarrack, the US envoy, said the US was ready to help Lebanon “resolve the conflict”, but that it was “not our responsibility”. “We don’t pressure anyone, and we won’t dictate what Lebanon should do, nor will Israel,” he said.\n\n“As for Lebanon, we said this is your internal problem. If you want a unified army and a real state, you have to disarm the parties and groups that don’t comply.”\n\nThe envoy said the simmering conflict with Israel would continue “as long as Israel feels that Hezbollah is hostile, rebuilding and rearming”.\n\nUS looking at future of Syria, Gaza\n\nBarrack said that US President Donald Trump was “eager” to end the war in Gaza, and was looking for “the right answer” that would deliver that result.\n\n“I believe that the president, after listening to the Arab leaders, realised the importance of moving forward and getting it done quickly,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe envoy also welcomed Syria’s first appearance at the United Nations General Assembly in nearly 60 years, after the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad paved the way for the country’s readmission.\n\nSyria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has taken several steps in the months since al-Assad’s removal in January, including establishing new institutions, planning to hold elections and encouraging foreign investment.\n\nThe US removed the Syrian armed group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which al-Sharaa headed, from its list of “foreign terrorist organisations” in July, reflecting a shift in policy towards post-Assad Syria.\n\nBarrack said that Trump had chosen to “give them a chance” and welcomed al-Sharaa’s efforts to solve lingering conflicts in the southern and northeastern parts of the country.\n\n“It takes time, but they’re doing everything they can do,” the envoy said.","summary":"Tom Barrack says Hezbollah’s legitimacy within Lebanon’s political system makes solving conflict with Israel difficult.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/28/hezbollah-a-legitimate-political-party-within-lebanon-us-envoy-says?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/afp_68a300b4a1dd-1755513012.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-28 22:03:52","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.164},{"id":364330262,"title":"Fetterman rejects 'Nazi,' 'fascist' labels for opponents while affirming party loyalty","text":"Sen.
