President Donald Trump's move to federalize parts of the District of Columbia's police force began earlier in the week, but troops from the National Guard scaled up their presence Thursday, with several stationed around the National Mall, at metro stations, at Union Station, near a U.S. Park building in Anacostia, D.C., and other places around the nation's capital. As of Thursday, 800 National Guard members have been mobilized to Washington, D.C., according to the Defense Department. According to Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson, the troops are unarmed and are supporting other federal law enforcement agencies that have been called up to D.C. to quell the violence there. TRUMP'S FEDERAL CRIME OPERATION BRINGS 100 ARRESTS, 800 NATIONAL GUARD \"The scope of support may be adjusted based on the needs of our partners,\" Wilson said. \"This would be very similar to the [Los Angeles] mission, where we can temporarily detain someone and then turn them over to the law enforcement.\" At Union Station specifically, Fox News Digital counted around 25 to 30 National Guard personnel, all military police, four Humvees and three MATVs early Thursday evening. Fox News Digital only saw riot batons carried by the troops.

Operations aimed at reducing crime in the nation's capital were initially focused on night patrols, but on Thursday they are going to begin patrolling 24/7.

But that's only a fraction of its circulation – clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.\n\nSwift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, The Life Of A Showgirl, and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work – a yearslong quest.\n\nIt was a revelation for fans with whom she's primarily communicated through her music and social media Easter eggs, a treasure hunt of clues about what she's doing professionally.\n\n“We have not heard Taylor speak in like a long-form interview like that in about five years,” Alex Antonides, a superfan from Dallas, told The Associated Press. “She’s never been in that comfortable of a situation, either. It’s always been like more professional, like a professional interviewer asking her questions. And then this is like with her boyfriend and his brother. So that was ... an environment we’ve truly never seen her in before.”\n\nCELEBRITIES LIKE A FRIENDLY FACE FOR PUBLIC TALKS\n\nSwift cemented a trend that's been seen in recent years among entertainers, sports figures and politicians who seek to deliver particular messages. A visit to friendly faces for a long-form conversation beats questions from nosy, prying journalists. In this case, Swift and Travis Kelce locked arms and cooed at each other between admiring queries. “My boyfriend says,” Swift said in asides when Kelce laid things on too thick.\n\n“The Kelce brothers have become the Barbara Walters of their generation,” said Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, which studies the podcast industry.\n\nFans ate it up. “I think it's really nice and refreshing, especially for a woman whose primary fan base is young women, to see somebody that is so celebratory of their partner and also not self-deprecating in a bad way, but also really admires what they do, and they don't try to minimise that,” one fan, Britton Copeland, who goes by Britton Rae on TikTok, said in a Zoom interview.\n\nSwift interpreters immediately began online discussions about What It All Means. One fan discussed theories about the still-unheard song, The Fate Of Ophelia, listed as the new album's first cut. Others pointed out that the album release date of Oct 3 coincided with National Plaid Day – apparently a Swift obsession – and National Boyfriend's Day.\n\nSuch Easter eggs are likely to bring listeners back to the New Heights interview again and again, meaning it could eventually stand as the most listened-to podcast episode on YouTube ever. “It's got a chance,” Cicero said.\n\nPodcasts emerged in the 2000s as an audio-only programming format tied to Apple's now-defunct iPod. The New Oxford American Dictionary called “podcast” its word of the year in 2005, even as many in the industry sought an alternative name almost as soon as it was coined.\n\nThe well-regarded Serial podcasts helped bring the format into the mainstream a decade ago. Particularly since the pandemic, and with the explosive growth of YouTube and personalities like Joe Rogan, video podcasts have become far more popular. Like most interview podcasts, New Heights can also be enjoyed in an audio format – and it's background noise even for many who air it on YouTube – but being able to see Swift and the Kelces interact has its benefits.\n\nWILL SWIFT OUTDRAW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPEARANCE WITH ROGAN? \n\nRogan's interview with US President Donald Trump was a key moment in the 2024 presidential campaign, and has been seen 59 million times on YouTube in nine months. Certainly Swifties – and possibly Trump himself – will be eager to see if the New Heights interview exceeds that number. Swift is among the celebrities who has drawn the president's ire.\n\nIt has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is Abdulrahman Abu Maleh's interview with relationship coach Yasser Hazimi for “Secrets to Thriving Relationships” from the Saudi Arabian company Thmanyah. It has racked up 144 million views in two years.\n\nSwift's and the Kelces' teams were particularly skillful in creating a huge demand for the interview with its spread clips across various social media platforms, said Tom Webster, founder of Sounds Profitable, a firm that analyses the podcast industry. By Thursday morning, Instagram highlights alone from the interview were viewed more than 350 million times, Cicero said.","summary":"Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, The Life Of A Showgirl, and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work – a yearslong quest.","url":"https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-new-heights-podcast-travis-kelce-jason-469746","image":"https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--fWUETDlT--/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/bills_chiefs_football_98330.jpg?itok=5_rMlVSY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 00:31:13","author":"Cna Lifestyle","authors":["Cna Lifestyle"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.309},{"id":351183286,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Thursday, August 14","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode August 14, 2025 43:39 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Thursday, August 14 \n Donald Trump, Russia, Ukraine \n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Donald Trump, Russia, Ukraine","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376938771112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/79e4abb0-9b08-4152-b7ae-ec6ca97540c0/29a3fb8f-94e1-4a36-b277-a2601fd39ee6/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-15 00:30:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":351182846,"title":"Oil Prices 2% Higher at Settlement","text":"New York, August 15 (QNA) - Oil prices rose by about 2 percent today to their highest level in a week, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s warning of serious consequences if his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin fail, and amid expectations that demand for oil will increase if the US decides to cut interest rates next month.\n\nBrent crude futures gained $1.21, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $66.84 per barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $1.31, or 2.1 percent, to $63.96 per barrel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brent crude closed at its lowest level since June 5, while WTI recorded its lowest settlement price since Jun. 2.\n\nData from the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency attributed this partly to declines in inventories and supplies.\n\nOil prices are also receiving additional support from near-certain expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, after inflation rose moderately in July.

Where Donald Trump previously said that CEO Lip-Bu Tan should step down allegedly because of “ties to China,” Trump has now reversed course, praising Tan and suggesting that the Trump Administration may buy a stake in Intel, as well as investing in efforts to finish an Intel chip factory in Ohio.\n\nIt was only a week ago that Trump flamed Lip-Bu Tan in posts over on Truth Social.\n\n“The CEO of Intel is highly conflicted and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,” Trump posted, attacking Tan’s supposed Chinese ties alongside other Republicans such as Arkansas senator, Tom Cotton.\n\nIt might have come as a surprise then that just a week later, Trump seemingly reversed course, claiming Tan’s career leading up to Intel CEO is an “amazing story,” according to the Associated Press.\n\nTrump would then go on to tease that the US government could buy a stake in Intel. That sent Intel’s stocks up 10 percent, allowing the company to breathe following a lengthy period of losses and restructuring that saw it cut 15 percent of its workforce earlier this year. Trump’s interest and investment into Intel could also help the company expedite its plans, particularly regarding an Ohio chip factory that has already seen several delays and was a topic of scrutiny amid Trump’s previous calls for Tan’s resignation, as reported by Ohio Capital Journal.\n\nIntel is by no means out of its bad run of business, yet.

Mayor Karen Bass, who arrived at the scene after her office was alerted by a concerned member of the public about the Border Patrol presence, confirmed one person had been taken into custody without a warrant, though this remained unverified at the time. The news comes after a lip reader revealed exactly what Donald Trump and Keir Starmer said to each other on the golf course. \"Well, I think it's pretty sick and pathetic, and it said everything you need to know about the setting that we're under. That they chose the time, manner and place to send their district director outside right when we're about to have this press conference,\" Newsom told reporters. \"It said everything you know about Donald Trump's America, and that was top down, you know that for a fact.\" \"He did this intentionally to disrespect the governor, to disrespect this iconic museum, and to disrespect our state. Now, why is this helpful to anybody at all? At this point, this doesn't have anything to do with immigration at all. This is about causing trouble in our city,\" Bass told reporters outside the Japanese American National Museum, where the event occurred, reports the Mirror US . The White House refused to respond when questioned whether Trump had personally directed Border Patrol agents to target Newsom's gathering. Witnesses supported Bass' allegations about the arrest to the Mirror U.S., claiming they detained an individual without producing a warrant of any sort. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol did not immediately respond to the Mirror U.S.'s request for comment on the matter. Newsom's press conference was designed to unveil a proposed mid-decade congressional redistricting initiative in reaction to Texas's planned redistricting, which was launched at Trump's urging. Newsom announced the state will stage a Nov. 4 special election to seek voter backing of fresh congressional maps and attempt to secure Democrats an estimated five extra seats in the House of Representatives. Surrounded by numerous national and state-level Democratic figures, including Senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla, Newsom declared the state would abandon the redistricting if the various GOP-controlled states retreat from their schemes. \"We gotta win, I mean democracy is counting on us, the founding fathers did not live and die to see this moment. There's just too much at stake, and we can roll over and say 'boy, maybe if we don't, maybe they won't continue this process beyond Texas, ' you know, for a fact they will,\" Newsom said. \"At least California can push back and neutralize Texas.\" California stands among the handful of states boasting an independent redistricting commission that redraws congressional boundaries every decade. Newsom, alongside fellow Democratic lawmakers and campaigners present on Thursday, condemned gerrymandering as a matter of principle yet ultimately acknowledged it was essential to thwart Republican attempts to maintain their slender House majority. \"We can't stand back and watch this democracy disappear district by district all across the country,\" Newsom said. California legislators must formally announce the special election, which they intend to do next week following a vote on the fresh maps. Newsom and other key figures within the state legislature claim they possess the necessary votes to achieve this.","summary":"California Gov.

The Indian aquanauts - Raju Ramesh, Senior Scientist and Cdr. Jatinder Pal Singh (Retd)--completed the maiden dives for a total duration of about seven hours, gathering valuable experience and observations before making a safe return to the surface. Also Read | Kishtwar Cloudburst: 38 Feared Dead, Massive Rescue Operation Underway.\nAddressing the media, Jitendra Singh said that India now joins an elite group of fewer than half a dozen nations to have ventured so deep into the ocean. The expedition was conducted as a collaborative scientific activity with IFREMER, the French marine research institute, in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean, onboard IFREMER's submersible Nautile. This record-setting dive is a prelude to the activities under India's Samudrayan Mission, which aims to send three aquanauts to a depth of 6,000 meters in the indigenously developed submersible MATSYA-6000 by 2027.\nSamudrayan is part of the Government of India's flagship Deep Ocean Mission, launched to explore and sustainably harness deep ocean resources. Singh expressed personal pride in Cdr. Jatinder Pal Singh's achievement, noting that he hails from Jammu--\"a son of my neighbourhood achieving this for India is a personal moment of pride,\" he said.\nAlso Read | Donald Trump's Pakistan Endorsement Undermined US-India Defining Partnership Built Over Decades: Report.\nJitendra Singh also pointed out that this achievement comes barely four weeks after Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla successfully reached and returned from the International Space Station as part of the AXIOM-4 mission. \"With Indians now having made successful maiden trips to both the International Space Station and the deep ocean, we have demonstrated our scientific ambition, prowess, and mettle--moving closer to the vision of a Viksit Bharat as envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,\" he said.\nThe Earth Sciences Minister recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's patronage and priority accorded to the mission, noting that the Prime Minister had highlighted it in his Independence Day addresses from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2021 and 2023. He underlined that oceans and space will be the twin pillars of India's future economic growth and vital contributors to the nation's aspiration to become the world's leading economy.\nSingh particularly mentioned that in both missions, India has been offered collaboration, and now we beckon the world for futuristic missions, no longer mere followers but leaders in the field.\nJitendra Singh highlighted that India, with a coastline of 11,098 km and a vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), holds immense potential for both living and non-living marine resources--offering a natural advantage unmatched by any other country. He called for concerted efforts to explore and tap these unexplored resources to add value to the economy, particularly through the development of the blue economy. He further noted that India has already signed a contract with the International Seabed Authority for exploring deep-sea minerals at depths ranging from 4,000 to 5,500 meters.\nThe two Indian aquanauts are from the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Chennai, an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences entrusted with developing MATSYA-6000. With this submersible, India will become the sixth nation in the world to have developed its own deep-ocean human submersible.\nMATSYA-6000--a first-of-its-kind, fourth-generation scientific submersible--is designed for an operational endurance of 12 hours and an emergency endurance of up to 96 hours. It features state-of-the-art systems such as a high-density Li-Po battery, underwater acoustic telephone, drop-weight emergency escape mechanisms, and bio-vests for crew safety and health monitoring.\nThe MATSYA-6000 completed successful wet trials at L&T Shipyard, Kattupalli, Tamil Nadu, in January-February 2025 and is expected to undertake 500-meter shallow water trials by 2026.\nThe NIOT five-member team--comprising Sh. Palaniappan, Dr. D. Sathianarayanan, and G. Harikrishnan, led by Dr. Ramesh Sethuraman, Scientist G & Group Head for MATSYA-6000, boarded L'Atalante, IFREMER's research ship, on August 3, 2025, off Lisbon, Portugal.\nM. Ravichandran, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, shared valuable insights from the expedition, highlighting that the team gained extensive hands-on experience in a range of critical operations. These included pre-dive preparation and piloting operations; habitability and buoyancy management along with descent and ascent procedures; intervention tasks using manipulators such as flag placement and sample collection; deployment and retrieval during four dives; trajectory tracking from the ship; managing on-board support systems; operating acoustic telephone communication protocols; as well as dive planning, maneuvering, and other essential operational procedures.\nHe stated that the experiences gained by the NIOT crew will directly support the development of MATSYA-6000, outlining key project milestones such as:\nHe also reiterated the overarching objectives of the Deep Ocean Mission, which include deep-sea mining and human submersible development, as well as ocean climate change advisory services.\nIn the past, Indian scientists from CSIR-NIO had dived to 3,800 meters and 2,800 meters in 1997 and 2002 in the submersibles Alvin (USA) and Nautile (France), respectively. The current expedition marks a record-breaking milestone for India's deep ocean capabilities.\nProf. Balaji Ramakrishnan, Director, National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), Dr. M.V.

But that's only a fraction of its circulation — clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.\n\nSwift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work — a yearslong quest.\n\nIt was a revelation for fans with whom she's primarily communicated through her music and social media Easter eggs, a treasure hunt of clues about what she's doing professionally.\n\n“We have not heard Taylor speak in like a long-form interview like that in about five years,” Alex Antonides, a superfan from Dallas, told The Associated Press. “She’s never been in that comfortable of a situation, either. It’s always been like more professional, like a professional interviewer asking her questions. And then this is like with her boyfriend and his brother. So that was ... an environment we’ve truly never seen her in before.”\n\nCelebrities like a friendly face for public talks\n\nSwift cemented a trend that's been seen in recent years among entertainers, sports figures and politicians who seek to deliver particular messages. A visit to friendly faces for a long-form conversation beats questions from nosy, prying journalists. In this case, Swift and Travis Kelce locked arms and cooed at each other between admiring queries. “My boyfriend says,” Swift said in asides when Kelce laid things on too thick.\n\n“The Kelce brothers have become the Barbara Walters of their generation,” said Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, which studies the podcast industry.\n\nFans ate it up. “I think it's really nice and refreshing, especially for a woman whose primary fan base is young women, to see somebody that is so celebratory of their partner and also not self-deprecating in a bad way, but also really admires what they do, and they don't try to minimize that,” one fan, Britton Copeland, who goes by Britton Rae on TikTok, said in a Zoom interview.\n\nSwift interpreters immediately began online discussions about What It All Means. One fan discussed theories about the still-unheard song, “The Fate of Ophelia,” listed as the new album's first cut. Others pointed out that the album release date of Oct. 3 coincided with National Plaid Day — apparently a Swift obsession — and National Boyfriend's Day.\n\nSuch Easter eggs are likely to bring listeners back to the “New Heights” interview again and again, meaning it could eventually stand as the most listened-to podcast episode on YouTube ever. “It's got a chance,” Cicero said.\n\nPodcasts emerged in the 2000s as an audio-only programming format tied to Apple's now-defunct iPod. The New Oxford American Dictionary called “podcast” its word of the year in 2005, even as many in the industry sought an alternative name almost as soon as it was coined.\n\nThe well-regarded “Serial” podcasts helped bring the format into the mainstream a decade ago. Particularly since the pandemic, and with the explosive growth of YouTube and personalities like Joe Rogan, video podcasts have become far more popular. Like most interview podcasts, “New Heights” can also be enjoyed in an audio format — and it's background noise even for many who air it on YouTube — but being able to see Swift and the Kelces interact has its benefits.\n\nWill Swift outdraw President Trump's appearance with Rogan?\n\nRogan's interview with President Donald Trump was a key moment in the 2024 presidential campaign, and has been seen 59 million times on YouTube in nine months. Certainly Swifties — and possibly Trump himself — will be eager to see if the “New Heights” interview exceeds that number. Swift is among the celebrities who has drawn the president's ire.\n\nIt has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is Abdulrahman Abu Maleh's interview with relationship coach Yasser Hazimi for “Secrets to Thriving Relationships” from the Saudi Arabian company Thmanyah. It has racked up 144 million views in two years.\n\nSwift's and the Kelces' teams were was particularly skillful in creating a huge demand for the interview with how its spread clips across various social media platforms, said Tom Webster, founder of Sounds Profitable, a firm that analyzes the podcast industry. By Thursday morning, Instagram highlights alone from the interview were viewed more than 350 million times, Cicero said.","summary":"Since nothing Taylor Swift ever does is small, her two-hour conversation with boyfriend Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce on their 'New Heights' podcast is a watershed moment for a media format that has already outlived the device it was named for.

Bioactive peptides from fermented foods are gaining global attention for their health benefits. With advancements in biotechnology and a deeper understanding of individual differences, bioactive peptides could hold great promise for nutrition and health solutions. Also Read | Kishtwar Cloudburst: 38 Feared Dead, Massive Rescue Operation Underway.\nA recent study conducted by the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), Guwahati, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), emphasises the health benefits of traditional fermented foods. They showed that the bioactive peptides (BAPs), or short protein fragments consisting of 2 to 20 amino acids, can regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, immunity, and inflammation. The study published in Food Chemistry (2025), led by Prof. Ashis K. Mukherjee, Corresponding author and Director IASST, Dr. Maloyjo Joyraj Bhattacharjee, Dr. Asis Bala, and Dr. Mojibr Khan showed that foods such as yogurt, idli, miso, natto, kimchi and fermented fish contain high levels of these peptides. Also Read | Donald Trump's Pakistan Endorsement Undermined US-India Defining Partnership Built Over Decades: Report.\nThese short peptides, formed during fermentation, interact with biomolecules through electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions to exert antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antioxidant and immune-modulatory effects. This can influence cardiac function, immune response and metabolic health. However, their bioavailability and effectiveness vary across populations due to genetic polymorphisms, gut microbiota composition, dietary habits and health conditions. Gene variants in ACE or IL-6 may affect individual responses to these peptides. This data emphasises the necessity for precision nutrition and targeted health interventions customised to the diverse Indian population. The research published in the Journal of Food Chemistry can address challenges such as variability in fermentation methods, peptide stability and interactions with the microbiota. The study advocates incorporating traditional fermented foods into public health initiatives. It emphasises the need for omics-based (biological research that utilises high-throughput technologies to analyse large sets of molecules) research and innovation in rural food systems to establish India as a global leader in personalised nutrition, the release added.

These are days that especially remind us of our being proud Indians,\" President Murmu said at the beginning of her address. She remembered the horrors of 1947 partition and said that countrymen should never forget the pain inflicted due to it, adding that terrible violence was witnessed in the course of events and that the nation pays tributes to the victims of the follies of history. Addressing the nation on the eve of the 79th Independence Day, President Murmu paid tributes to the victims of the partition on the occasion of Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas (Partition Horrors Remembrance Day).\"As we look back on the past, we must not forget the pain inflicted by the Partition of the country. Today we observed Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas. Terrible violence was witnessed, and millions were forced to relocate due to Partition.

On August 14, India observes 'Partition Horrors Remembrance Day' to pay tribute to those who lost their lives and were displaced during the country's partition in 1947. At the exit of the British from India in August 1947, India was partitioned into two independent nation-states: India and Pakistan. The partition of India had devastated millions of lives across the Indian subcontinent. There were riots, unrest, violence, animosity, rapes, massacres, looting, starvation, and one of the largest forced mass migrations in human history that the world has ever witnessed. Millions of people suffered immense loss and endured horrific days and nights. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal have faced the consequences of the catastrophic riots that claimed thousands of lives and left an indelible mark on the psyches of millions of people. The repercussions and trauma as a result of partition are felt and experienced to date.

They remarked that this and other recent orders from Trump \"registered no public objection\" from top officers and warned that \"in the context of domestic theaters,\" the military can’t be politically neutral. \"Unfortunately, though we (and others) had hoped that the military would only respond to calls to action in American cities and states kicking and screaming, we no longer expect resistance from that institution,\" they wrote. \"Once, perhaps, traditionalist officers might have leaned on protocol and refused to heed a lawless order, taking inspiration from the generals — Mark Milley and James Mattis — who resisted the uprooting of established military standards in the first Trump term.\" NY TIMES REPORTER ADMITS TRUMP IS ‘WAY MORE EFFECTIVE’ IN SECOND TERM The essay continued, \"But today, general officers no longer seem to see themselves as guardians of the constitutional order. It now seems clear to us that the military will not rescue Americans from Mr. Trump’s misuse of the nation’s military capabilities.\" Commentators across X accused Simon and Stevenson and the New York Times of arguing in favor of a military uprising against Trump. \"The New York Times is pro-military coup against President Trump.

His vow to “match fire with fire” was as much a shot across the bow of his fellow party leaders as it was a threat to the Republicans.\n\nAs the midterms come into view, Newsom is seeking to establish a baseline standard of aggression and pugnacity among his party’s rising stars that could very well eliminate many would-be contenders who are simply too old or too committed to the image of the bipartisan statesman to be viable candidates in the 2028 field. At the same time, he’s trying to keep his response to Texas’s mid-decade redistricting plan measured by avoiding a push to abolish California’s redistricting commission altogether.\n\nOne expert posited to The Independent on Thursday that Newsom’s bold stance had likely forced other governors with similar ambitions for the limelight to suggest the possibility of redistricting in their own states, even where it likely wasn’t possible.\n\n“If Newsom is saying, ‘I'm going to go in and change California's districts,’ you know, I think others who are on the White House, including Governor Pritzker felt maybe a reflexive need to say, ‘Well, yeah, we'll consider that in Illinois as well,’” said John Shaw, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. He added in an interview with Inside Washington on Thursday that he didn’t see a feasible path for Pritzker and the state’s Democrats to gerrymander any of the state’s three congressional districts held by Republicans out of GOP hands.\n\nNewsom likely knows that even as he threatens to put up to nine congressional seats into Democratic hands with his own mid-decade redistricting, he’s putting other governors like Pritzker in a tough spot. Maryland, for instance, is another state run by a Democratic governor who is viewed as a possible White House contender. But even if Gov. Wes Moore gets behind a legislative push by Rep. David Moon, the state’s Democratic majority leader in the Maryland House of Delegates, his party would only see a maximum of one congressional seat change hands — assuming the courts even allowed Maryland Democrats to gerrymander the last GOP seat out of existence.\n\nThis is the moment that Gavin Newsom made his first real chess move of the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. And his press conference Thursday morning, flanked by local Democratic leaders, was as much of a campaign announcement as Donald Trump’s descent down a golden elevator in 2015.\n\nAs if hired to provide b-roll for Newsom’s eventual campaign ads, the presser was mildly disrupted by the arrival of what appeared to be dozens of ICE agents performing an immigration enforcement raid at the site of the governor’s event.\n\nIt’s no secret that the governor is testing the waters. He previously was spotted in South Carolina doing events alongside Jim Clyburn, the congressman and kingmaker most famous for breathing life into Joe Biden’s campaign in 2020. Clyburn’s star is fading within the party, as he faces criticism for his role in shutting down a primary in 2024 and his recent endorsement of Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. But he could still be the most important ally a Democratic hopeful could make in South Carolina, and in June introduced Newsom to a group of voters as one of “these candidates that are running for president,” per Politico.\n\nWith the redistricting fight, however, Newsom has found an issue where he has shown himself in clear contrast with the party’s more cautious, aging leaders in Congress, whom polling shows are facing plunging approval ratings among Democrats. \n\nTwo likely scenarios could happen from here. One, Republicans in Texas (facing national pressure from Republicans in other states fearful of seeing swing districts vanish overnight) may back down, handing Newsom a clear victory and allowing him to position himself as the first Democrat to score a tangible, unilateral victory against Republicans in 2025 — one where he wouldn’t have to share any of the glory.\n\nThe other is that Texas Republicans go through with their plans and Newsom, even potentially limited by the realities of state law and his ability to get voters to back his plan, comes out looking like the first, if not the only Democratic state leader who came back with an effective response.\n\nWith a quick response on a national issue, albeit from a position of opportunity, Newsom has set himself apart in the potential 2028 field. He may also have defined the terms of the race, something that will give him a clear advantage when the race beings in earnest.","summary":"California governor may have just defined the boundaries of the Democratic primary in 2028 by firing the first shot, writes John Bowden","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-presidential-campaign-trump-b2808109.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/22/54/GettyImages-2230173576.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/K9wl459s-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:58:54","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.056},{"id":351185704,"title":"Armed Border Patrol outside Newsom event as he reveals gerrymander gambit, while deep-pocketed foes take aim at plan","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday officially revealed his controversial gerrymandering plan to grab five or six U.S. House of Representatives seats now held by California Republicans and deliver them to Democrats in a bid to counter a similar move by Republicans in Texas that President Donald Trump pushed.\n\nNewsom touted his plan to create more Democrat-dominated districts shortly after about a dozen armed and masked U.S. Border Patrol agents in military-style fatigues appeared outside the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles where he was to speak, a move the governor called “pretty sick and pathetic.”\n\nMaps detailing the redistricting would be released in the next few days, Newsom said. He said he believed he would have the two-thirds vote in both houses of the state legislature necessary to put the measure before voters in a Nov. 4 special election.\n\n“These maps will completely neuter or neutralize what is happening in Texas,” Newsom said. Although similar bids to Texas’ gerrymandering are underway in other Republican dominated states, he said his initiative would only go ahead if Texas or another state carried out such plans.\n\n“We’ve got to meet fire with fire,” Newsom said. “This is a break-the-glass moment for our democracy, for our nation.”\n\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who led the creation of California’s independent redistricting commission, has expressed opposition to Newsom’s plan.\n\nThe “Election Rigging Response Act” would short-circuit official redistricting, which happens every 10 years, led by an independent commission since 2010. If approved by voters, it would temporarily replace the current commission-drawn district maps from the 2020 census with maps approved by lawmakers, but not prevent the commission from drawing new maps after the 2030 census. The commission realignment would have otherwise taken place in 2030.\n\nRocklin Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, whose seat would be at risk from redistricting, last week introduced legislation for a nationwide prohibition on early redistricting. In a Thursday news conference, Kiley said Californians voted to create the independent commission “to take the power out of the hands of politicians,” and Newsom’s plan represented “an attack on the voters of California.”\n\nCalifornia Republican Party chairwoman Corrin Rankin on Thursday slammed Newsom’s plan as “a calculated power grab that dismantles the very safeguards voters put in place.”\n\nBefore Newsom’s press conference, his office posted video on social media of Border Patrol agents outside the press conference venue. Newsom’s office suggested “Trump’s private army” had showed up at the event to intimidate. The clip showed the Border Patrol’s Los Angeles chief Gregory Bovino saying the agents were there “making Los Angeles a safer place.”\n\nThe White House responded to questions from this news organization by sending links to X posts by White House spokesman Steven Cheung, who described Newsom as a “coward” who gave an “incoherent” speech.\n\nRepublicans are expected to face headwinds in next year’s mid-term elections. Current district maps for the House in California and Texas suggest Democrats are within three seats of reclaiming a U.S. House majority after the midterms. New York, New Jersey, and Illinois are also considering redrawing Congressional maps to combat the Texas plan.\n\nNewsom’s plan appears headed into a costly battle. Schwarzenegger and prominent Republican donor Charles Munger, Jr., both billionaires, are credited with the initiatives that took the mapping of district boundaries away from state legislators in 2008 for the California Legislature and in 2010 for the U.S. Congress.\n\nA spokesman told Politico that Schwarzenegger is opposed to what Texas is doing, and “to the idea that California would race to the bottom to do the same thing.”\n\nMunger last month created an X account that has put up just a single post, saying, “Any attempt to undermine the nonpartisan California Redistricting Commission will be strongly opposed in the courts and at the ballot box.”\n\nBoth Munger and Schwarzenegger see the independent commission as part of their legacy, said Thad Kousser, a UC San Diego political science professor who studies state and national politics.\n\n“My guess is that they do fight it but there will be plenty of money on the other side,” Kousser said.\n\nOpponents of Newsom’s plan will likely take to the courts to stop it, said Dan Schnur, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and a former Republican political consultant.\n\n“It will almost certainly be an immense court fight both about whether the initiative can be on the ballot, or if it passes, whether it can take effect.” Schnur said. Still, Newsom’s biggest challenge appears “political, not legal,” he said.\n\nCalifornia voters like having an independent commission draw electoral boundaries for the House, a recent poll by UC Berkeley and Politico found. Almost two-thirds of respondents said they wanted to keep the panel, which is made up of five Republicans, five Democrats, and four people unaffiliated with either party.\n\nNewsom’s office on Thursday dismissed the survey’s significance, saying the commission would stay in place.\n\nResults of a second poll, released last week by Emerson College, showed just a third of voters supported the gerrymandering proposal.\n\n“It’s considered conventional wisdom in politics that an initiative that starts out with less than 50% support is going to have an uphill path to passage,” Schnur said.\n\nIf Newsom can make the redistricting plan “entirely a referendum on Donald Trump, he has a good shot,” Kousser said. “I think Californians will be eager for that fight.”\n\nThe announcement capped days of social media mockery of Trump by Newsom — widely believed to be angling for the next presidency — with a series of posts on social media platform X mimicking the President’s posts using all-capital letters and over-the-top language.\n\n“I, GAVIN CHRISTOPHER NEWSOM, AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR (MANY SAY), WILL HOST THE GREATEST PRESS CONFERENCE OF ALL TIME,” a post Thursday said. “AFTER THAT – “THE MAPS” WILL SOON BE RELEASED. VERY MUCH ANTICIPATED. HISTORY MADE. THE GOP’S RIGGED GAME IS OVER!!!!”\n\nNewsom’s newly combative and sometimes coarse social media posts — his press office has made fun of Trump’s medical condition that causes swollen ankles — and his response to the Texas gerrymandering plan, show a politician seeking to boost himself by adopting the tactics of Democrats’ primary adversary, experts said.\n\n“Newsom is fighting fire with fire and making this part of his growing political brand,” Kousser said.\n\nSchnur said Newsom’s move puts him “at the front of the national Democrats’ counter-offensive on redistricting,” and “it’s going to immensely help his profile, especially in Democratic circles, both at the state and national levels.”\n\nNewsom on Thursday said he was following Trump’s example, and, “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as President.”\n\nHowever, GOP strategist Matt Shupe called Newsom’s social media posts “rage bait” by a governor who “hasn’t come to grips with his looming irrelevancy yet.”","summary":"The 'Election Rigging Response Act' would short-circuit official redistricting, which happens every 10 years, led by an independent commission, and is not scheduled to start until 2030.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/14/armed-border-patrol-newsom-gerrymander-deep-pocketed-foes-take-aim/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SJM-L-NEWSOMGERRY-0815-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:55:51","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":351179830,"title":"‘ICE Barbie’ Kristi Noem claims 1.6M migrants have left the country.

Trump,” she said. “He said, ‘Kristi, if you’re gonna be my Homeland Security secretary, we’re gonna follow the law, you’re gonna do commercials, you’re gonna tell the world that no longer will we tolerate people being in our country illegally and that they need to go home.’”\n\nHomeland Security posted on X Thursday, sharing what it said was “unprecedented” data showing, “1.6 MILLION illegals are OUT of our country in the last 200 days.” \n\nThe data was from a release published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a non-profit research organization that describes itself as “low-immigration, pro-immigrant.” \n\nThe non-profit analyzed data from the government’s Current Population Survey and found the estimated number of the illegal immigrant population in the U.S. in January was 15.8 million and it decreased to 14.2 million by July. \n\nBut there were some caveats the non-profit mentioned including the possibility immigrants may now be more reluctant to respond to the government survey because of “the recent stepped-up enforcement efforts.”\n\n“If this is the case, then our estimate of illegal immigrants based on the survey may be overstating the decline in their actual numbers,” the non-profit warned.\n\nThe group also noted the July data is just preliminary as “some of the administrative data necessary to estimate illegal immigrants is not yet available.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to DHS for comment.\n\nDHS says the 1.6 million figure refers to those who left the U.S. on their own. \n\nThe agency has pushed for illegal immigrants to self-deport to avoid being arrested and to potentially return legally to the country in the future. It has even offered to pay for illegal immigrants’ travel expenses and give them an extra $1,000 if they self-deport.\n\nBut DHS has also more notably cracked down on illegal immigration through ICE raids across the country. \n\nMore than 352,000 illegal immigrants have been arrested, and more than 324,000 have been removed from the U.S., according to a Thursday press release from DHS.\n\nBut data shows the pace of daily immigration arrests fell nearly 20 percent in July. \n\nBetween July 1 and 27, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement averaged 990 daily arrests, down from 1,224 the previous month, according to government data analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan research project based at Syracuse University.","summary":"‘I think these numbers just show exactly the genius of Donald J.

But that's only a fraction of its circulation — clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.\n\nSwift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work — a yearslong quest.\n\nIt was a revelation for fans with whom she's primarily communicated through her music and social media Easter eggs, a treasure hunt of clues about what she's doing professionally.\n\n“We have not heard Taylor speak in like a long-form interview like that in about five years,” Alex Antonides, a superfan from Dallas, told The Associated Press. “She’s never been in that comfortable of a situation, either. It’s always been like more professional, like a professional interviewer asking her questions. And then this is like with her boyfriend and his brother. So that was ... an environment we’ve truly never seen her in before.”\n\nSwift cemented a trend that's been seen in recent years among entertainers, sports figures and politicians who seek to deliver particular messages. A visit to friendly faces for a long-form conversation beats questions from nosy, prying journalists. In this case, Swift and Travis Kelce locked arms and cooed at each other between admiring queries. “My boyfriend says,” Swift said in asides when Kelce laid things on too thick.\n\n“The Kelce brothers have become the Barbara Walters of their generation,” said Nick Cicero, founder of Mondo Metrics, which studies the podcast industry.\n\nFans ate it up. “I think it's really nice and refreshing, especially for a woman whose primary fan base is young women, to see somebody that is so celebratory of their partner and also not self-deprecating in a bad way, but also really admires what they do, and they don't try to minimize that,” one fan, Britton Copeland, who goes by Britton Rae on TikTok, said in a Zoom interview.\n\nSwift interpreters immediately began online discussions about What It All Means. One fan discussed theories about the still-unheard song, “The Fate of Ophelia,” listed as the new album's first cut. Others pointed out that the album release date of Oct. 3 coincided with National Plaid Day — apparently a Swift obsession — and National Boyfriend's Day.\n\nSuch Easter eggs are likely to bring listeners back to the “New Heights” interview again and again, meaning it could eventually stand as the most listened-to podcast episode on YouTube ever. “It's got a chance,” Cicero said.\n\nPodcasts emerged in the 2000s as an audio-only programming format tied to Apple's now-defunct iPod. The New Oxford American Dictionary called “podcast” its word of the year in 2005, even as many in the industry sought an alternative name almost as soon as it was coined.\n\nThe well-regarded “Serial” podcasts helped bring the format into the mainstream a decade ago. Particularly since the pandemic, and with the explosive growth of YouTube and personalities like Joe Rogan, video podcasts have become far more popular. Like most interview podcasts, “New Heights” can also be enjoyed in an audio format — and it's background noise even for many who air it on YouTube — but being able to see Swift and the Kelces interact has its benefits.\n\nRogan's interview with President Donald Trump was a key moment in the 2024 presidential campaign, and has been seen 59 million times on YouTube in nine months. Certainly Swifties — and possibly Trump himself — will be eager to see if the “New Heights” interview exceeds that number. Swift is among the celebrities who has drawn the president's ire.\n\nIt has further to go to be a record-setter, though. The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is Abdulrahman Abu Maleh's interview with relationship coach Yasser Hazimi for “Secrets to Thriving Relationships” from the Saudi Arabian company Thmanyah. It has racked up 144 million views in two years.\n\nSwift's and the Kelces' teams were was particularly skillful in creating a huge demand for the interview with how its spread clips across various social media platforms, said Tom Webster, founder of Sounds Profitable, a firm that analyzes the podcast industry. By Thursday morning, Instagram highlights alone from the interview were viewed more than 350 million times, Cicero said.\n\nAssociated Press journalist Alicia Rancilio contributed to this report from Detroit. \n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Sommer pleaded guilty to three counts of assaulting public officials, according to U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office.\n\nA trial for Sommer had been scheduled to start next Monday. Instead, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb accepted Sommer’s guilty plea and will sentence her.\n\nOn May 8, a Newsmax reporter was interviewing Martin on a sidewalk outside his office when Sommer approached him.\n\n“Are you Ed Martin? You are Ed Martin,” Sommer said before lunging at him and spitting on his left shoulder, according to prosecutors.\n\nAs she walked away, Sommer swore at Martin and called him “a disgusting man.”\n\n“My name is Emily Gabriella Sommer, and you are served,” she said.\n\nSommer later took credit for the spitting incident in a message replying to a social media post by Martin.\n\nThe encounter occurred on the same day that President Donald Trump pulled Martin’s nomination to remain U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Martin faced bipartisan opposition in the Senate after a turbulent stint in the nation’s largest U.S. Attorney’s office. A key Republican senator said he could not support Martin for the job due to his support for rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMartin roiled the office with a series of unorthodox moves, such as firing and demoting subordinates who worked on politically sensitive cases. Trump replaced Martin with former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, who was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 2.\n\nWhen U.S. Marshals Service deputies went to arrest Sommer at her apartment on May 22, she spit in a deputy’s face and kicked him, prosecutors said.\n\n“How is that spit? Taste good? I was just getting over a cold sore. I hope I gave you herpes,” Sommer told the deputy, according to prosecutors.\n\nSommer also kicked a second deputy during her arrest and told another deputy, “I would put a bullet in you if I had it. I would put a bullet in every one of you right now,” prosecutors said.\n\nDuring her initial court appearance in May, Sommer repeatedly disrupted the hearing with outbursts. Deputies picked her up and carried her out of the courtroom after one of her interruptions prompted a magistrate to suspend the hearing. Sommer later apologized to the magistrate for her courtroom conduct.","summary":"She pleaded guilty to three counts of assaulting government officials.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/14/prosecutor-assault-charges/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25176771071192.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:40:34","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":351179862,"title":"In Washington police takeover, federal agents and National Guard take on new tasks","text":"They typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals. This week, though, federal agents are fanning out across the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to clamp down on crime in the city. \n\nThe sometimes-masked agents joined members of the National Guard as well as the United States Park Police, whose responsibilities include protecting the country's monuments and managing crowds during demonstrations. \n\nSoldiers in fatigues kept watch near Union Station, while officers with the Drug Enforcement Administration patrolled along the National Mall. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives helped question a couple in northwest Washington who were parked illegally and eating McDonald’s takeout. \n\nTrump said Monday that he’s taking over Washington’s police department in hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed that crime is already falling. The District of Columbia’s status as a congressionally established federal district allows the president to take control, although he’s limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.\n\nAmid the takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD, here's a list of some of the federal agencies involved and what they typically do: \n\n The National Guard \n\nTHIS WEEK: The Pentagon said that 800 Guard members have been activated for missions in Washington that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the troops won’t be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren’t making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: The National Guard serves as the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, according to its website. But it also responds when “disaster strikes in the homeland” to protect life and property in communities.\n\n Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) \n\nTHIS WEEK: DEA agents have also fanned out across Washington, working with police on traffic stops and other enforcement efforts. The agency has touted this week that its agents have helped to recover guns and drugs.\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: The agency typically enforces the nation’s controlled substances laws and regulations, while going after drug cartels, gangs and traffickers in the U.S. and abroad. For example, a DEA-led investigation scored a record seizure of fentanyl in May, “dismantling one of the largest and most dangerous drug trafficking organizations in U.S. history,” the agency said in a news release. The DEA also operates a little-known research lab in northern Virginia that’s working to analyze seized narcotics to find ways to stop the supply. Its chemists identify the ever-evolving tactics employed by cartels to manufacture drugs flowing into the U.S. \n\n Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) \n\nTHIS WEEK: Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, could be seen on Wednesday alongside MPD officers as they conducted traffic checks at a checkpoint along 14th Street in northwest Washington.\n\nTHE BACKSTORY: HSI investigates a wide variety of crimes on a global scale – at home, abroad and online – with hundreds of offices across the country and abroad. Those crimes include “illegal movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology into, out of and through the United States,” the agency says on its website. In the last few months, as the Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts across the U.S., HSI agents have been out on raids and involved in immigration arrests at courthouses and other sites around the country. HSI agents also investigate a vast array of crime, including cyber and financial crimes and intellectual property offenses. \n\n United States Park Police \n\nTHIS WEEK: United States Park Police have been seen helping with traffic stops this week in the district and are a regular presence in Washington. D.C. The federal agency is actually one of the nation's oldest, being founded in 1791 by George Washington. \n\nTHE BACKSTORY: The police are part of the National Park Service and has jurisdiction in all federal parks, with offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco, according to the agency's website. Before this week's takeover, it already had the authority to make an arrest in the District of Columbia.\n\n Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) \n\nTHIS WEEK: ATF agents have been helping out with traffic stops. \n\nTHE BACKSTORY: The agency primarily focuses on the illegal use of guns and explosives, bombings and acts of terrorism, and the trafficking of illicit liquor or contraband tobacco.","summary":"Federal agents who typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals have fanned out across the nation’s capital","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/national-guard-washington-donald-trump-drug-enforcement-administration-national-mall-b2808106.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/14/18/APTOPIX_Trump_District_of_Columbia_86476.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:38:58","author":"Ben Finley","authors":["Ben Finley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":351180528,"title":"Trump does not back away from a fight: KT McFarland","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics August 14, 2025 05:26 \n\n Trump does not back away from a fight: KT McFarland \n Former Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland discusses the upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ‘The Bottom Line.’\n\nTags POLITICSV-VIDEOSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODES","summary":"Former Deputy National Security Advisor KT McFarland discusses the upcoming meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on ‘The Bottom Line.’","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6376936167112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/d3ac496b-48b7-4b7e-8766-c70bb7051267/d096ac89-2a7d-4528-b8c6-1696aed15caf/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:37:10","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.579},{"id":351183750,"title":"Canseco: Canada remains divided on current, future immigration policies (Opinion)","text":"In early July, immigration was identified by nine per cent of Canadians as the most important issue facing the country. Concerns about immigration reached double digits among Canadians who are members of Generation Z (16 per cent), Conservative Party voters in this year’s federal election (14 per cent), Quebecers (10 per cent) and those in the middle income bracket (also 10 per cent).\n\nThe issue is gaining prominence among seemingly disjointed groups of would-be voters. The federal Conservatives performed poorly in Quebec but are aching to win back the middle-class vote and solidify the connection established with young Canadians on issues such as housing. It was not surprising, then, to see Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre recently call for “very hard caps” on the number of immigrants allowed into Canada.\n\nAt first glance, our latest look at the perceptions of Canadians on immigration shows little change from our previous survey in 2024. The country can be split in two camps: Those who believe immigration is having a “mostly positive” effect in the country (43 per cent, up one point) and those who think it has been “mostly negative” (39 per cent, down five points).\n\nLast year, almost half of Canadians (46 per cent) expressed a desire for the number of legal immigrants who are allowed to relocate in Canada to decrease. Plenty has happened since then, including provincial initiatives to recognize the credentials of foreign-trained professionals, heightened concerns about economic growth, a discussion about the impact of tariffs and trade during the second term of U.S. President Donald Trump and a federal election.\n\nIn 2025, 41 per cent of Canadians endorse a reduction in legal immigration. About a third would retain the current levels, and 16 per cent advocate for an increase.\n\nThe notion that the country is “full” resonates vividly with two specific groups: Half of Canadians aged 55 and over (51 per cent) and half of Canadians of European descent (50 per cent) think Canada should admit fewer legal immigrants now than in years past.\n\nTwo in five Canadians aged 35 to 54 (40 per cent) are also in favour of a reduction in legal immigration. This group may be experiencing the health care and education systems through their parents or children, developing a different opinion on what is causing current service shortfalls or challenges. Among Canadians aged 18 to 34, similar proportions of respondents call for a decrease (30 per cent) or an increase (26 per cent).\n\nIn spite of the anti-American sentiment Trump’s statements have provoked in Canada, the U.S. “melting pot” approach to immigration has a four-point lead over Canada’s mosaic as the policy our country should adhere to (44 per cent to 40 per cent).\n\nIt is remarkable to see the mosaic lagging in public support after practically a decade of Liberal Party governments in Ottawa.\n\nOne could assume that newcomers to Canada and their descendants would be “all in” on the mosaic, but the numbers tell a different story. Support is highest among Canadians of East Asian origin (46 per cent), and drops among those whose heritage is South Asian (43 per cent), European (42 per cent) and Indigenous (35 per cent).\n\nMore than two-thirds of Canadians (68 per cent) think the hard work and talent of immigrants makes Canada better. An evident regional divide persists. More than three-quarters of British Columbia residents agree. The proportions are lower in Ontario (68 per cent), Quebec (also 68 per cent) and Atlantic Canada (54 per cent, down three points).\n\nThese last two questions outline the challenging nature of immigration as a policy concern for the government and the opposition. There is some animosity on the issue of amalgamation, but most residents—especially those in the west—continue to express positive feelings about the contributions of newcomers. A reduction in legal immigration is still preferred, but by a margin that is lower than in 2024, well before “nation-building” became the mantra of the federal government.\n\nMario Canseco is president of Research Co.\n\nResults are based on an online study conducted from July 26-28, 2025, among 1,000 adults in Canada. The data has been statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region in Canada. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.","summary":"In early July, immigration was identified by nine per cent of Canadians as the most important issue facing the country.

Over 50 Democratic members of the Texas House of Representatives fled the state to deny the legislature the quorum necessary to pass the bill. In response, Texas Republican leaders have filed legal action to compel the AWOL lawmakers to return and have also threatened to remove them from office if they continue refusing to participate in the legislative process. Texas House Democrats released a statement on Thursday in which they announced they will only return to the state if the legislature agrees to adjourn without plans to meet again or if California introduces its own redistricting legislation to \"neutralize\" the GOP seats gained in Texas.

This is a power grab that undermines our democracy.\" Wu told ABC News that the Democrats were \"especially excited\" to have Obama address them via Zoom. \"Having President Obama speak with us and support us is proof that when Texas House Democrats stand up and fight back, we don't stand alone -- we have the support of Democrats at every level who understand that when Republicans attack voting rights in Texas, they're attacking the foundation of our democracy everywhere,\" Wu told the outlet. He said that the meeting was held via Zoom because of \"Republican threats.\" NEWSOM UNVEILS CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING EFFORT TO COUNTER TRUMP-BACKED PUSH IN TEXAS \"The fact that we have to meet President Obama from an undisclosed location and via Zoom because of Republican threats and surveillance only proves how desperate Abbott and his extremist allies have become,\" Wu said. \"They know their racial gerrymandering scheme is falling apart, so they're resorting to intimidation tactics.

Jurecic explained that while Trump has prosecutors on his side, those prosecutors still have to convince a grand jury to indict, and for a jury to convict the people charged, which has lately proven difficult for the administration despite its inherent advantages.\n\n\"These are far from insurmountable barriers; on the contrary, as criminal-justice reformers have long argued, the deck is stacked in favor of the prosecution,\" Jurecic wrote. \"But the Trump administration keeps tripping up on them anyway.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Duty to disobey': A stunning number of US troops know they can defy Trump's orders\n\nIn Los Angeles, for example, the Trump administration filed 35 felony charges against people who were protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However, prosecutors were unable to convince a grand jury to indict defendants in several cases. Eight of those 35 charges were eventually dismissed, while another five were refiled as misdemeanors. When comparing these numbers to 2016 — the last year in which full federal data is available — Jurecic found that only six grand juries refused to indict out of more than 180,000 charges filed.\n\nJurecic also pointed to the DOJ's failed prosecution of Newark, New Jersey mayor Ras Baraka, who was initially charged in May with felonies while attempting to conduct oversight of an immigrant detention center before charges were eventually dropped. And she noted that Attorney General Pam Bondi has so far failed to make headway on efforts to prove that former DOJ special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on Russian election inference was a \"hoax.\" In addition to a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report finding that Russia did indeed attempt to influence the election to help Trump, any charges would be unlikely to stick, given that the statute of limitations for any relevant charges has likely already passed.\n\nAdditionally, the Trump DOJ's attempt to punish former special counsel Jack Smith for his 2024 criminal prosecutions of Trump's alleged election interference and alleged mishandling of classified documents is unlikely to go anywhere. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) — which is separate from the DOJ — is conducting a Hatch Act investigation into Smith based on a complaint from Sen. Tom cotton (R-Ark.) But the only penalty available for the OSC to levy is firing a government official, and Smith already resigned from his role. Jurecic argued that even as Trump commands vast resources to make life more difficult for his political opponents, actually jailing them is a much more difficult task.\n\n\"A jury is in essence a democratic institution, requiring citizens to exercise their judgment in a model of shared deliberation that is at odds with Trump’s autocratic tendencies,\" she wrote. \"... So far, the system has held up against Trump’s encroachment.

Trump hinted that he would be sending a package to Congress in the near future on Wednesday geared toward his administration’s continued push to make the district a \"beacon\" for other blue cities, but gave little detail as to what he may want to see in the legislation. REPUBLICANS READY TO SUPPORT TRUMP'S MOVE TO SKIRT CONGRESS IN DC CRIME CRACKDOWN \"We think the Democrats will not do anything to stop crime, but we think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously,\" Trump said. \"So we're going to need a crime bill that we're going to be putting in, and it's going to pertain initially to D.C.\" He also noted that \"we're going to seek a relatively small amount of money\" to fix potholes and generally spruce up the district. Shortly after Trump’s announcement, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that he had spoken with the president, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House staff on \"how Congress can help make Washington D.C. safe again.\" \"At the direction of President Trump,\" Bondi said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"This Department of Justice will continue to work with MPD, federal law enforcement and Congress to address the scourge of violent crime in Washington, D.C. and ensure the safety of all Americans visiting or living in our Nation’s capital.\" Graham noted that the White House was working on a package to send to him and Sen.

The White House referred Fox News Digital back to the president's prior comments on the bill. Lawmakers are not set to return to Washington until after Labor Day and will be met immediately by the fast-approaching deadline to fund the government on Sept. 30.

Trump made his comments after the White House sent a letter to the Smithsonian Tuesday unveiling plans to conduct a review of its museums and exhibits in preparation for the 250th birthday of the United States in 2026. \"We want the museums to treat our country fairly,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We want their museums to talk about the history of our country in a fair manner, not in a woke manner or in a racist manner, which is what many of them, not all of them, but many of them are doing.\" WHITE HOUSE REVIEWING ALL SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM, EXHIBIT CONTENT BEFORE AMERICA 250 CELEBRATION IN 2026 \"Our museums have an obligation to represent what happened in our country over the years. Good and bad,\" Trump said. \"But what happened over the years in an accurate way.\" The Smithsonian told Fox News Digital it was reviewing the Trump administration's letter and would work with the White House, Congress and its governing Board of Regents moving forward. \"The Smithsonian’s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research and the accurate, factual presentation of history,\" the Smithsonian said in a statement. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, weighed in on the matter earlier Thursday, saying left-wing activists had \"obscenely defaced\" the museum. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The Smithsonian is supposed to be a global symbol of American strength, culture and prestige,\" Miller posted to X Thursday. \"A place for families and children to celebrate American history and greatness. Instead, the exhibits have clearly been taken over by leftwing activists who have used the Smithsonian as yet one platform to endlessly bash America and rewrite / erase our magnificent story. \"These activists have obscenely defaced this beloved institution,\" Miller added. \"The Trump Administration will proudly and diligently restore the patriotic glory of America and ensure the Smithsonian is a place that once more inspires love and devotion to this nation, especially among our youngest citizens.\" The White House’s initial letter to the Smithsonian Tuesday said the review would evaluate social media, exhibition text and educational materials. This would be done to \"assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals,\" the letter said. \"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" the letter said. The review will focus on the following museums: the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. LIBERTY AND UNITY: WHAT AMERICA’S 250TH ANNIVERSARY ASKS OF US TODAY Trump has taken previous steps to alter what content is shown in the Smithsonian museums and signed an executive order in March that placed Vice President JD Vance in charge of overseeing the removal of programs or exhibits that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy.\" Vance has already moved to shake things up at the Smithsonian. Artist Amy Sherald canceled an exhibit scheduled to arrive at the Smithsonian in September that included a portrait of a transgender Statue of Liberty at the National Portrait Gallery after Vance claimed the show featured woke and divisive content, Fox News Digital first reported.

He was out of the country during the statewide blackouts in 2021 and during the flood disaster over the summer. O’Rourke suggested that the senator might just be cursing the state of Texas.\n\n“I think he’s a curse upon the people of Texas any way that you put it,” O’Rourke said. “It’s clear that he doesn’t care about the people that he purports to serve or represent. You know, that should be damning in and of itself. And for me, it is. Even worse – and you know, this wasn’t the case in 2018, but it certainly was in 2021 – his effort to incite an insurrection against the country’s government in which he serves, to try to overturn a lawfully, fairly, democratically decided election.”\n\nHe continued: “In my opinion, that should bar him from any public service and really should prompt an investigation by the Department of Justice into his role in that insurrection attempt on the 6th of January 2021. And I think it’s one of the big failings, honestly, of the previous administration and their Department of Justice. They didn’t prosecute those like Donald Trump or like Ted Cruz who are responsible for that insurrection. And the fact that we nearly lost what Lincoln called The Last Best Hope of Earth.”\n\nOn top of the ridicule over the summer Cruz got for being in Greece during the Texas flooding, the senator also went viral for getting in a shouting match with Tucker Carlson over Trump’s battle with Iran back in June.\n\n“How many people live in Iran, by the way?” Carlson asked. “I don’t know the population at all … I don’t know the population,” Cruz replied.\n\n“You don’t know the population in the country you seek to topple?” Carlson asked. He then clarified that Iran currently has an estimated population of 92 million. “How could you not know that?”\n\nWatch the full interview between Minhaj and O’Rourke above.","summary":"\"It's clear that he doesn't care about the people that he purports to serve or represent,\" he adds\n\n\nThe post Beto O’Rourke Calls Ted Cruz ‘A Curse Upon the People of Texas,’ Suggests His Vacations Incite Natural Disasters | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/beto-o-rourke-ted-cruz-texas-natural-disasters-vacation/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/BetoORourke.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-14 23:27:05","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.465},{"id":351176358,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Clear GOP Frontrunner Emerges For Wide Open Governor Race, Polling Shows","text":"Republican Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany is the clear favorite among likely Republican primary voters in the state’s open 2026 gubernatorial race, according to recent polling.\n\nTiffany holds a commanding lead over a hypothetical primary field with 40% of the vote, followed by Washington County executive Josh Schoemann at 13% and former Navy Seal and manufacturing executive Bill Berrien at 10%. Tiffany is well-positioned to secure the Republican nomination if he enters the race and would likely cruise to the general election with President Donald Trump’s endorsement, according to a polling memo conducted by Republican firm Fabrizio, Lee & Associates and exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: GOP Rep Goes After Loophole Allowing Chinese To Abuse Birthright Citizenship In Northern Mariana Island)\n\n“Tom Tiffany is in a solid position and is the clear front-runner in the Republican Primary for Wisconsin Governor,” the polling memo states. “An endorsement from President Trump and educating voters about Tiffany and his record would propel his lead even further, with either option essentially sealing the deal for the primary nomination.”\n\nTiffany, a three-term lawmaker and member of the conservative Republican Study Committee has said he will make a decision to run for governor by the end of September. Schoemann and Berrien have already declared for the race.\n\nRepublicans are seeking to take back the governor’s mansion in the key battleground state following two terms of Democratic rule under Governor Tony Evers. Trump narrowly won Wisconsin last November, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris by roughly 30,000 votes. Evers announced in July that he would not run for a third term.\n\nThe president has yet to publicly back a candidate in the Republican primary. The survey found that a Trump endorsement would grow Tiffany’s edge over the primary field to 60%, leaving his two declared opponents with less than 10% of the vote respectively.\n\nInforming voters about Tiffany’s record in Congress further expanded his lead over the other Republican candidates in the race, according to the polling memo. Voters were 92% more likely to vote for the three-term lawmaker after hearing about his “solid border record.”\n\nDemocrats are also likely to have a crowded primary field vying for the open seat. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Sara Rodriguez is the only well-known candidate in the race thus far, entering the race less than 24 hours after Evers’ announced his retirement.\n\nThe multimodal survey of 600 likely Wisconsin Republican primary voters was conducted between July 28 and 31. Tiffany holds a commanding lead well outside the poll’s margin of error of plus or minus 4%. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said they were undecided about their preferred candidate.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
