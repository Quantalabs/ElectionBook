A senior Israeli official said airstrikes would persist in the next few days, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nIsraeli planes have bombed at least three major Syrian army air bases that housed dozens of helicopters and jets near Damascus.\n\nQamishli airbase in northeast Syria, Shinshar base in Homs and Aqaba airport southwest of the capital were all hit.\n\nIsrael also launched strikes on a research centre on the outskirts and a centre for electronic warfare near the Sayeda Zainab area.\n\nIsrael told the United Nations that it is involved in 'limited' actions in Syria after the fall of al-Assad's regime.\n\nIsraeli troops took up positions in a buffer zone in Syria near the occupied Golan Heights to create a 'buffer zone'. A fresh wave of Israeli air strikes pummelled military buildings in the country yesterday.\n\n Iran has condemned Israel's 'repeated violations of Syrian infrastructure' and seizure of Syrian land.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel for almost 60 years, would perpetually remain part of Israel.\n\nHis comment came as criticism grew after Israel's takeover of a buffer zone along its border with Syria.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu thanked US President-elect Donald Trump for recognising Israel's 1981 annexation of the territory during his first term and said 'the Golan will be part of the State of Israel for eternity'.\n\nIsrael captured most of the mountainous plateau from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War and has occupied it ever since, repelling a Syrian attempt at reconquest in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nNetanyahu said Israeli control of the high ground 'ensures our security and sovereignty'.\n\nOver the weekend, he ordered troops to move into a UN-patrolled buffer zone - on the east of the Israeli-annexed Golan - after Islamist-led rebels toppled president Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n\nThe United Nations and Israel's neighbours denounced the move, with a UN spokesman on Monday saying Israel's actions were 'a violation' of the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria.\n\nSaudi Arabia's foreign ministry said seizure of the buffer zone confirms 'Israel's continued violation of the rules of international law, and its determination to sabotage Syria's chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.'\n\nNetanyahu said on Sunday that the collapse of the Assad government and the Syrian army abandoning its posts had invalidated the agreement.\n\nIsrael's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar on Monday said the takeover of the buffer zone was 'a limited and temporary step we took for security reasons.'\n\nUS State Department spokesman Matthew Miller voiced understanding of Israel's actions which, he said, 'are not permanent' and 'ultimately, what we want to see is lasting stability between Israel and Syria, and that means we support all sides upholding the 1974 disengagement agreement.'\n\nIsrael's incursion into Syria beyond the Golan Heights following Bashar al-Assad's overthrow must only be 'temporary,' the United States said Monday, after the United Nations said Israel was violating a 1974 deal.\n\n'This is a temporary action that they have taken in response to actions by the Syrian military to withdraw from that area. Now, what we want to see, ultimately, is that agreement fully upheld, and we'll watch to see that Israel does that,' State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\nAsked if the United States was calling on its ally to pull out, Miller said the agreement reached after the 1973 Yom Kippur War 'includes Israel's withdrawing to its previous position.'\n\nHe declined to set a timetable, pointing to the fast-changing situation on the ground in Syria.\n\n'Israel has said that these actions are temporary to defend its borders. These are not permanent actions, and so ultimately, what we want to see is lasting stability between Israel and Syria, and that means we support all sides upholding the 1974 disengagement agreement,' Miller said.","summary":"Israel's foreign minister said Israeli warplanes struck suspected chemical weapons facilities in Syria.Gideo Sa'ar said they attacked the sites so they wouldn't fall into the 'hands of extremists'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14175813/Israeli-airstrikes-hit-Syrian-chemical-weapons-not-fall-hands-extremists.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/12/10/00/92979747-0-image-a-59_1733791198026.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 01:05:55","author":"Editor,Emily Jane Davies","authors":["Editor","Emily Jane Davies"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.086},{"id":271875840,"title":"'Polarisation' is word of the year, according to oldest dictionary in US","text":"The results of this year's US presidential election rattled the country and sent shockwaves across the world — or were cause for celebration, depending on who you ask. Is it any surprise then that the Merriam-Webster word of the year is \"polarisation\"?\n\n(Officially \"polarization\", accounting for the American spelling of the US-based Merriam-Webster dictionary.)﻿\n\n\"Polarisation means division, but it's a very specific kind of division,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor at large, at Merriam-Webster, the oldest dictionary company in the US.\n\n\"Polarisation means that we are tending toward the extremes rather than toward the centre,\" he said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement.\n\nREAD MORE: Suspected CEO assassin behind bars after McDonald's arrest\n\nThe election was so divisive, many American voters went to the polls with a feeling that the opposing candidate was an existential threat to the nation.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters, about 8 in 10 Kamala Harris voters were very or somewhat concerned that Donald Trump's views — but not Harris' — were too extreme, while about 7 in 10 Trump voters felt the same way about Harris — but not Trump.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster entry for \"polarization\" reflects scientific and metaphorical definitions. It's most commonly used to mean \"causing strong disagreement between opposing factions or groupings.\"\n\nMerriam-Webster, which logs 100 million pageviews a month on its site, chooses its word of the year based on data, tracking a rise in search and usage.\n\nLast year's pick was \"authentic.\" This year's comes as large swaths of the US struggle to reach consensus on what is real.\n\nREAD MORE: Riot squad called in as teens run amok on island\n\n\"It's always been important to me that the dictionary serve as a kind of neutral and objective arbiter of meaning for everybody,\" Sokolowski said.\n\n\"It's a kind of backstop for meaning in an era of fake news, alternative facts, whatever you want to say about the value of a word's meaning in the culture.\"\n\nIt's notable that \"polarisation\" originated in the early 1800s — and not during the Renaissance, as did most words with Latin roots about science, Sokolowski said.\n\nHe called it a \"pretty young word,\" in the scheme of the English language. \n\n\"Polarised is a term that brings intensity to another word,\" he continued, most frequently used in the US to describe race relations, politics and ideology.\n\n\"Polarization\" extends beyond political connotations. It's used to highlight fresh cracks and deep rifts alike in pop culture, tech trends and other industries.\n\nREAD MORE: Noticed the cicadas are louder this year? There's a few reasons why\n\nAll the scrutiny over Taylor Swift's private jet usage? Polarising. Beef between rappers Kendrick Lamar and Drake? Polarising. The International Olympic Committee's decision to strip American gymnast Jordan Chiles of her bronze medal after the Paris Games? You guessed it: polarising.\n\nEven lighthearted memes — like those making fun of Australian breakdancer Rachael \"Raygun\" Gunn's performance — or the proliferation of look-alike contests, or who counts as a nepo baby proved polarizing.\n\nRounding out Merriam-Webster's top 10 words of this year:\n\nTikToker Jools Lebron's 38-second video describing her workday makeup routine as \"very demure, very mindful\" lit up the mid year with memes.\n\nTaylor Swift's song Fortnight, featuring rapper Post Malone, undoubtedly spurred many searches for this word, which means two weeks.\n\nThe solar eclipse in April inspired awe and much travel. There are tens of millions of people who live along a narrow stretch from Mexico's Pacific coast to eastern Canada, otherwise known as the path of totality, where locals and travelers gazed skyward to see the moon fully blot out the sun.\n\n\"Texts developed by AI have a disproportionate percentage of use of the word 'resonate,'\" Sokolowski said. This may be because the word, which means to affect or appeal to someone in a personal or emotional way, can add gravitas to writing.\n\nThe word was looked up 60 times more often than usual when, in March, a ship crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in the eastern US.\n\nOn the TV news show Morning Joe, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called Republican leaders \"weird.\" It may have been what launched his national career, landing him as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee.\n\nWhether the word was used to raise questions about PUS resident Joe Biden's debate performance or Trump's own age, it cropped up often. It refers to conscious intellectual activity — such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering.\n\nPander was used widely in political commentary, Sokolowski said. It means to say, do, or provide what someone — such as an audience — wants or demands even though it is not \"good, proper, reasonable, etc.\"\n\nIn 2003, Merriam-Webster decided to make \"democracy\" its first word of the year. Since then, the word — which, of course, means a form of government in which the people elect representatives to make decisions, policies and laws — is consistently one of the dictionary's most looked up.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Not just Gabbard, but other Trump nominees including Pentagon pick Pete Hegseth, were back at the Capitol ahead of what is expected to be volatile confirmation hearings next year.\n\nThe incoming president is working to put his team in place for an ambitious agenda of mass immigrant deportations, firing federal workers and rollbacks of U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO allies.\n\n“We’re going to sit down and visit, that’s what this is all about,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., as he welcomed Gabbard into his office.\n\nThe president-elect announced other appointments Monday, including his lawyer Harmeet Dhillon for assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Justice Department and Mark Paoletta as the returning general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Secretary pick Hegseth appeared to be picking up support from once-skeptical senators, the former Army National Guard major denying sexual misconduct allegations and pledging not to drink alcohol if he is confirmed.\n\nThe president-elect's choice to lead the FBI, Kash Patel, who has written extensively about locking up Trump's foes and proposed dismantling the Federal Bureau of Investigation, launched his first visits with senators Monday.\n\n“I expect our Republican Senate is going to confirm all of President Trump’s nominees,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on social media.\n\nDespite widespread concern about the nominees' qualifications and demeanors for the jobs that are among the highest positions in the U.S. government, Trump's team is portraying the criticism against them as nothing more than political smears and innuendo.\n\nShowing that concern, nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow for a full review of the government’s files on Gabbard.\n\nTrump's allies have described the criticisms of Hegseth in particular as similar to those lodged against Brett Kavanaugh, the former president's Supreme Court nominee who denied a sexual assault allegation and went on to be confirmed during Trump's first term in office.\n\nSaid Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., about Hegseth: “Anonymous accusations are trying to destroy reputations again. We saw this with Kavanaugh. I won’t stand for it.”\n\nOne widely watched Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself a former Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and sexual assault survivor who had been criticized by Trump allies for her cool reception to Hegseth, appeared more open to him after their follow-up meeting Monday.\n\n“I appreciate Pete Hegseth’s responsiveness and respect for the process,” Ernst said in a statement.\n\nErnst said that following “encouraging conversations,” he had committed to selecting a senior official who will \"prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks. As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.”\n\nErnst also had praise for Patel — “He shares my passion for shaking up federal agencies\" — and for Gabbard.\n\nOnce a rising Democratic star, Gabbard, who represented Hawaii in Congress, arrived a decade ago in Washington, her surfboard in tow, a new generation of potential leaders. She ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020.\n\nBut Gabbard abruptly left the party and briefly became an independent before joining with Trump's 2024 campaign as one of his enthusiasts, in large part over his disdain for U.S. involvement overseas and opposition to helping Ukraine battle Russia.\n\nHer visit to Syria to meet with then-President Bashar Assad around the time of Trump's first inauguration during the country's bloody civil war stunned her former colleagues and the Washington national security establishment. The U.S. had severed diplomatic relations with Syria. Her visit was seen by some as legitimizing a brutal leader who was accused of war crimes.\n\nGabbard has defended the trip, saying it's important to open dialogue, but critics hear in her commentary echoes of Russia-fueled talking points. Assad fled to Moscow over the weekend after Islamist rebels overtook Syria in a surprise attack, ending his family's five decades of rule.\n\nShe said her own views have been shaped by “my multiple deployments and seeing firsthand the cost of war and the threat of Islamist terrorism.”\n\nGabbard said, “It's one of the many reasons why I appreciate President Trump’s leadership and his election, where he is fully committed, as he has said over and over, to bring about an end to wars.”\n\nLast week, the nearly 100 former officials, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said in the letter to Senate leaders they were “alarmed” by the choice of Gabbard to oversee all 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nThey said her past actions “call into question her ability to deliver unbiased intelligence briefings to the President, Congress, and to the entire national security apparatus.”\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the nation’s intelligence agencies and act as the president’s main intelligence adviser.\n\nAssociated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\n© Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, under the leadership of Han, whose legal authority in the diplomatic realm remains unclear, significant challenges lie ahead for the nation’s diplomacy.\n\nIn a joint briefing with the prime minister, Sunday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon said his party will “pursue an orderly resignation” of Yoon. This means that the president is expected to step down before his five-year term ends in 2027.\n\n“There will be no confusion during the orderly early resignation process,” Han said. “Even before stepping down, the president will not be involved in state affairs, including diplomacy.”\n\nThe prime minister vowed continuity of diplomatic efforts.\n\n“Maintaining the strength of the South Korea-U.S. alliance and solidifying trilateral cooperation between South Korea, the U.S., and Japan are very important tasks. The entire Cabinet, led by the foreign minister, will do its utmost to preserve trust in our relationships with the U.S., Japan and other allies,” he said.\n\nThese developments come after the National Assembly failed to pass a motion to impeach Yoon on Saturday evening. The motion was nullified when 105 of the PPP’s 108 lawmakers boycotted the vote, leaving the Assembly short of the required quorum of 200 votes.\n\nThe impeachment motion was in response to Yoon’s surprise martial law declaration on Tuesday. The emergency military rule, which lasted for only six hours, thrust the already-unpopular president's political career to the rock bottom.\n\nAs the president steps aside from state affairs, the prime minister is expected to assume most of his domestic and diplomatic duties. But uncertainties linger regarding how the nation can navigate its diplomatic agenda with its image tarnished following the martial law debacle.\n\n2025 is a pivotal period for South Korea’s foreign relations.\n\nEfforts had been underway to arrange a meeting between Yoon and incoming U.S. President Donald Trump, while Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was reportedly considering a visit to Seoul in January — both plans now in jeopardy due to the political turmoil.\n\nAdditionally, South Korea is set to host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Gyeongju next October, a major event expected to attract around 20 world leaders and thousands of delegates. The APEC summit has been regarded as a key opportunity to revive the long-stalled summit diplomacy with China, as the two nations have been actively discussing Chinese leader Xi Jinping's participation.\n\nBut all these efforts are in peril amid a leadership vacuum.\n\n\"With the U.S. showing reluctance to further engage with the Yoon administration, this could be the end of South Korea's diplomacy under the current government,\" a diplomatic analyst in Seoul said on condition of anonymity.\n\n“The U.S. has been openly critical of Yoon’s martial law attempt. Under such circumstances, other like-minded nations will also be reluctant to engage with South Korea. The best we can do under the prime minister is to show the international community how Yoon’s resignation happens in a peaceful, democratic manner.\"\n\nAfter the failed impeachment vote, Sunday, the U.S. administration called for the \"proper functioning of South Korea’s democratic processes.\"\n\n“We continue to call for the full and proper functioning of the ROK’s democratic institutions and processes, in accordance with the Constitution,” a U.S. official was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency. ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's official name.\n\n“The right to peaceful protest is an integral element of a healthy democracy and must be respected in all circumstances,” the official added.\n\nIn a phone call with Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his expectation for \"the democratic process to prevail,\" a remark some analysts interpreted as subtle support for Yoon’s ousting.\n\nSeoul's diplomacy with the incoming Trump administration has become trickier.\n\nWhile Trump has not publically reacted regarding the martial law fiasco, his diplomatic approach preferring high-profile leader summits suggests that he may not be willing to engage actively with South Korea's weak president.\n\nYang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies, said Yoon’s diminished credibility will bring a long-lasting strain on the nation's foreign relations.\n\n“Credibility and predictability are the most important factors in diplomacy.

That may just be the brutal truth of awards season: The field narrows and suddenly great performances and wonderful films are simply left in the dust.\n\nThe Globes have always had quirks, like A-lister tunnel vision, and while there might not be anything quite as glaring as the infamous year of “The Tourist,” this batch is not without its oddities: Some good, some bad, some simply perplexing.\n\nHere are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the nominations.\n\nSnub: Danielle Deadwyler\n\nDanielle Deadwyler just can’t catch an awards season break. After being overlooked for “Till” by both the Globes and the Oscars, it seemed likely she’d be recognised for her turn in Malcolm Washington’s adaptation of August Wilson’s “The Piano Lesson” (which somehow got no nominations at all). Oscar nominations are still over a month away, however, so perhaps this is the spark needed to remind voters.\n\nSurprise: “All We Imagine as Light”\n\nIt may be fun to needle the Golden Globes, but every once in a while they get something very, very right — and this year, the proof is in the nominations for “All We Imagine as Light.” The Indian film from a small distributor is one of those gems that, more often than not, is mainly celebrated by critics groups. And yet here it was nominated not only alongside a truly great batch of films in the international category — which it won’t be at the Oscars because India controversially selected another film to represent the country — but also in directing, for Payal Kapadia.\n\nSnub: Saoirse Ronan\n\nFor an actor who has received four Golden Globe nominations in her lifetime and one win (“Lady Bird”), it was a bit of a shocker that Saoirse Ronan did not receive any this year. She had two major performances in notable films: as a recovering alcoholic in “The Outrun” and as a mother in wartime London in Steve McQueen’s “Blitz” (also entirely, bafflingly empty-handed). Recognition for both would not have been undeserved.\n\nSurprise: Sebastian Stan\n\nSebastian Stan managed to get a supporting and lead nomination for two different roles, however. His lauded portrayal of a young Donald Trump in “The Apprentice” is not awards season kryptonite, after all (Jeremy Strong was also nominated). Equally exciting is Stan’s recognition for “A Different Man,” and yet that also comes with a snub caveat: His breakout co-star Adam Pearson did not get the same.\n\nSnub: Marianne Jean-Baptiste\n\nAnother major oversight is Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who delivered the performance of a lifetime in Mike Leigh’s “Hard Truths” as Pansy, the very unpleasant, but very quotable English woman with a chip on her shoulder. She has been getting recognition from prominent critics groups — most recently from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association — so hopefully all is not lost for other nominations.\n\nSnub: Lots of directors\n\nWhere do we even start with this one? Certainly, when only six are nominated there are going to be some major exclusions, but the absences were glaring, including RaMell Ross (“Nickel Boys”), Denis Villeneuve (“Dune: Part Two”), Jon M. Chu (“Wicked”), Mohammad Rasoulof (“The Seed of the Sacred Fig”), and Jesse Eisenberg (“A Real Pain”).\n\nSnub: “Sing Sing”\n\nOne nomination for “Sing Sing,” for Colman Domingo, does not seem sufficient. Though it would have fit well in the best drama category, most glaring is the exclusion of Clarence “Divine Eye” Maclin from supporting. The former inmate was a revelation in this film about incarcerated men who participate in a theater program.\n\nSnub: June Squibb\n\nThe lead performance category for “musical or comedy” is, as always, all over the place. Unlike most years, there are actual musicals (Karla Sofía Gascón for “Emilia Pérez” and Cynthia Erivo for “Wicked”). While the others might have comedic elements, mostly of the dark or satirical variety, there’s not really a straight comedy in the batch, which is unfortunate in a year when June Squibb delivered such a great comedic performance in “Thelma” — also her first leading role. A real missed opportunity.\n\nSurprise: Pamela Anderson\n\nPamela Anderson’s renaissance is in full swing, with a nomination for “The Last Showgirl” that caught some off guard. She and Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres are up against the likes of heavy hitters like Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Tilda Swinton and Kate Winslet.\n\nSnub: Meryl Streep\n\nMeryl Streep has been nominated 34 times at the Golden Globes (including receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2017) and yet somehow her delightful turn in “Only Murders in the Building” was not one of them this year.\n\nSnub: Ryan Reynolds\n\nThe Globes love movie stars, especially the charismatic kinds who put on charm offensives at guild Q&As. Ryan Reynolds may not exactly be an Oscar contender for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” but he should have been a shoo-in for the Globes.\n\nIs it a sign of the reformed times of the Globes 2.0 that he didn’t make the cut? Or perhaps Glen Powell took the high-wattage charm spot this year? Either way, we’ll look forward to an inside joke the next time the merc with a mouth graces our movie theater screens.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/the-snubs-and-surprises-in-the-2025-golden-globe-nominations/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AP24344581976201.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 01:00:01","author":"Borneo Bulletin Ap Video","authors":["Borneo Bulletin Ap Video"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.179},{"id":271875532,"title":"Bryson DeChambeau teams up with Donald Trump's teenage granddaughter as golf trick goes wrong","text":"US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau found himself in a spot of bother when a golf stunt with Donald Trump's granddaughter, Kai, took an unexpected turn. The golfing sensation and staunch supporter of the president-elect planned to pull off a trick shot alongside Trump's golf whizz grandchild, but things didn't quite swing as hoped.\n\nAt just 17, Trump's granddaughter Kai has shown impressive skills on the green and is all set to tee off her college career at the University of Miami. Pairing up her prowess with the expertise of world-ranked No.4 DeChambeau seemed a good play. Posting on social media, Kai shared a clip where she tees up from behind LIV Golf star DeChambeau on the driving range.\n\n She skillfully clipped the ball towards him, expecting a seamless strike. Without glancing back, DeChambeau swung with precision, only for the driver's head to come clean off and hurtle toward a bunker.\n\nA bemused DeChambeau could only watch as his club was decapitated, with Kai laughing it off in the backdrop. Despite the mishap, the duo enjoyed chuckles while observing the SpaceX rocket blast off nearby.\n\nLater on, DeChambeau mused to Kai about a futuristic invention that might just give her game an extra edge: \"I'll design a rocketship golf club with boosters on the back so you increase your club head speed,\" he enthused, promising, \"Just for you.\"\n\nKai cheekily responded to DeChambeau's dig about her club head speed, saying: \"Just for me, yeah? I'm gonna need it. Wow that hurt,\" clearly taking the suggestion in her stride with a laugh.\n\nWhen Kai announced her big move to the University of Miami, she didn't forget her family roots, especially her grandad's part in her journey: \"I would like to thank my Grandpa for giving me access to great courses and tremendous support,\" she expressed with gratitude.\n\n\"I would also like to thank my entire family for always encouraging and pushing me to be the best person I can possibly be. I would like to thank my friends for always cheering me on.\"\n\nThe President-elect has been a familiar face to Kai, as they teamed up for a Pro-Am event ahead of the much-talked-about LIV Golf tournament at Trump's Doral course in sunny Florida.\n\nWith her commitment to the University of Miami, it seems Kai will remain within arm's reach of the lush fairways groomed by her grandfather, particularly at Biltmore Golf Club, where the university team flexes their golfing skills and competes, a mere stone's throw from Trump's Doral course.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of stars like DeChambeau, Kai is now entering the sports influencer sphere, having launched her own YouTube channel. The young golfer dives into golf content - and even gave viewers a peek at election night proceedings.","summary":"Bryson DeChambeau has been a vocal supporter of Donald Trump and the LIV Golf star teamed up with his granddaughter Kai for a trick shot that didn't go according to plan","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/bryson-dechambeau-teams-up-donald-34280606","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article34280599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DeChambeau.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 01:00:00","author":"Cameron Winstanley","authors":["Cameron Winstanley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.59},{"id":271876708,"title":"Breaking down the U.S. military implications of Assad's fall","text":"Breaking down the U.S. military implications of Assad's fall\n President-elect Donald Trump is now signaling that the U.S. military should not intervene in Syria, posting on social media over the weekend, \"this is not our fight.\" Charlie D'Agata has more on U.S. interests in Syria, which include hundreds of U.S. troops helping in the fight against ISIS and one of the longest-held American hostages.","summary":"President-elect Donald Trump is now signaling that the U.S. military should not intervene in Syria, posting on social media over the weekend, \"this is not our fight.\" Charlie D'Agata has more on U.S. interests in Syria, which include hundreds of U.S. troops helping in the fight against ISIS and one of the longest-held American hostages.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/breaking-down-the-u-s-military-implications-of-assads-fall/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/10/ff06824a-919c-4ab9-bc3d-ab909a0d18b0/thumbnail/1200x630/05a0ca1dfac21de2a21001546ea2f510/1209-en-dagata.jpg?v=d633d0331cc96a4353754b3de830df72","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 01:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":271876116,"title":"Zelenskyy warns Trump, Macron about risk of frozen conflict","text":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he raised the risk of a frozen conflict with Russia and pressed for security guarantees in weekend talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and France’s Emmanuel Macron.Zelenskyy said he sought to drive home his position that Ukraine can only enter into ceasefire talks from a position of strength — and told the leaders in Paris on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to end the war.'Nobody wants to end the war more than us,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Monday, as he weighed in on inducing Putin to back down.

Hochul’s new plan","text":"New York residents would receive checks for up to $500 next year as part of a new proposal from Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nThe Democratic governor unveiled a plan on Monday to send “inflation refunds” to New Yorkers who fall under a certain income threshold. The checks would cost the state $3 billion and are meant to partially offset an inflation-fueled boost in sales tax residents paid in recent years, according to the governor's office.\n\n“It’s your money,” Hochul said at Co-Op City in the Bronx, where she announced her proposal. “It should go back in your pockets.”\n\nFamilies who make less than $300,000 annually would be in line for a $500 check, according to the governor’s office. Individuals making less than $150,000 a year would be eligible for $300.\n\nHochul’s office estimates that 8.6 million New Yorkers would be eligible, including 3.6 million in New York City.\n\nHer proposal — the first of what she’s calling her “affordability agenda” for 2025 — would require legislative approval. She’s set to include the plan in her state budget proposal, which she will unveil in January.\n\nIf approved, the state would send out checks in the fall, according to the governor’s office.\n\nThe governor’s proposal drew mixed reaction from organizations that closely watch the state budget process in Albany.\n\nAndrew Rein, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a think tank that analyzes state and New York City finances, said Hochul’s effort is misguided.\n\n“A one-time rebate may feel good, but what New York needs is lower taxes to be more affordable and competitive,” he said.\n\nThe Invest in Our New York campaign, a group of organizations pushing for higher taxes on the wealthy, praised Hochul for recognizing that New Yorkers are struggling with affordability.\n\nBut Carolyn Martinez-Class, the campaign’s manager, said looming federal budget cuts from President-elect Donald Trump’s administration mean the state has to go “further than sending one-time payments.”\n\n\"Gov. Hochul and legislative leadership must meaningfully tackle the affordability crisis during the upcoming budget negotiations and take concrete steps to close New York’s wealth gap,” she said.\n\nIn unveiling her plan, the governor pointed to the rising cost of milk, eggs and diapers in recent years, though the overall Consumer Price Index, which tracks the price of goods and services, has steadied over the past year and a half.\n\n“We’re told inflation is getting better, it’s actually coming down,” Hochul said. “But let me ask this question: Do any of you feel like you have more money in your pocket these days? No? I didn’t think so.”\n\nThe governor’s proposal comes as she tries to set the stage for the annual legislative session at the state Capitol, which is slated to kick off next month.\n\nHochul has said her State of the State address, scheduled for Jan. 14, will include a major focus on issues of affordability. It comes as many voters pointed to the economy as the most important issue of the recent election cycle.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams last week laid out his own cost-cutting proposal: reducing or eliminating the city’s income tax for residents making below certain income thresholds. That proposal, however, would also require state legislative approval.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comments and information.","url":"https://gothamist.com/news/new-yorkers-could-get-a-500-inflation-refund-under-gov-hochuls-new-plan","image":"https://api-prod.gothamist.com/images/348575/fill-1200x800|format-webp|webpquality-85/","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:52:47","author":"Jon Campbell","authors":["Jon Campbell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":271876114,"title":"Trump Promises to End Birthright Citizenship: What is It, Could He Do It?","text":"Washington: President-elect Donald Trump has promised to end birthright citizenship as soon as he gets into office to make good on campaign promises aiming to restrict immigration and redefining what it means to be American.But any efforts to halt the policy would face steep legal hurdles.Birthright citizenship means anyone born in the United States automatically becomes an American citizen. It's been in place for decades and applies to children born to someone in the country illegally or in the US on a tourist or student visa who plans to return to their home country.It's not the practice of every country, and Trump and his supporters have argued that the system is being abused and that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen.But others say this is a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, it would be extremely difficult to overturn and even if it's possible, it's a bad idea.Here's a look at birthright citizenship, what Trump has said about it and the prospects for ending it: What Trump has said about birthright citizenship During an interview Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press” Trump said he “absolutely” planned to halt birthright citizenship once in office.“We're going to end that because it's ridiculous,” he said.Trump and other opponents of birthright citizenship have argued that it creates an incentive for people to come to the US illegally or take part in “birth tourism\", in which pregnant women enter the US specifically to give birth so their children can have citizenship before returning to their home countries.“Simply crossing the border and having a child should not entitle anyone to citizenship,” said Eric Ruark, director of research for NumbersUSA, which argues for reducing immigration. The organisation supports changes that would require at least one parent to be a permanent legal resident or a US citizen for their children to automatically get citizenship.Others have argued that ending birthright citizenship would profoundly damage the country.“One of our big benefits is that people born here are citizens, are not an illegal underclass. There's better assimilation and integration of immigrants and their children because of birthright citizenship,” said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the pro-immigration Cato Institute.In 2019, the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 5.5 million children under age 18 lived with at least one parent in the country illegally in 2019, representing 7 per cent of the US child population. The vast majority of those children were US citizens.The nonpartisan think tank said during Trump's campaign for president in 2015 that the number of people in the country illegally would “balloon” if birthright citizenship were repealed, creating “a self-perpetuating class that would be excluded from social membership for generations”.What does the law say?In the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress ratified the 14th Amendment in July 1868. That amendment assured citizenship for all, including Black people.“All persons born or naturalised in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the 14th Amendment says. “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” But the 14th Amendment didn't always translate to everyone being afforded birthright citizenship. For example, it wasn't until 1924 that Congress finally granted citizenship to all Native Americans born in the US.A key case in the history of birthright citizenship came in 1898, when the US Supreme Court ruled that Wong Kim Ark, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a US citizen because he was born in the states. The federal government had tried to deny him reentry into the county after a trip abroad on grounds he wasn't a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act.But some have argued that the 1898 case clearly applied to children born of parents who are both legal immigrants to America but that it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents without legal status or, for example, who come for a short-term like a tourist visa.“That is the leading case on this. In fact, it's the only case on this,” said Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Centre for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions. “It's a lot more of an open legal question than most people think.” Some proponents of immigration restrictions have argued the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment allows the US to deny citizenship to babies born to those in the country illegally. Trump himself used that language in his 2023 announcement that he would aim to end birthright citizenship if reelected.So what could Trump do and would it be successful? Trump wasn't clear in his Sunday interview how he aims to end birthright citizenship.Asked how he could get around the 14th Amendment with an executive action, Trump said: “Well, we're going to have to get it changed. We'll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it.” Pressed further on whether he'd use an executive order, Trump said “if we can, through executive action.\" He gave a lot more details in a 2023 post on his campaign website. In it, he said he would issue an executive order the first day of his presidency, making it clear that federal agencies “require that at least one parent be a US citizen or lawful permanent resident for their future children to become automatic US citizens”.Trump wrote that the executive order would make clear that children of people in the US illegally “should not be issued passports, Social Security numbers, or be eligible for certain taxpayer funded welfare benefits”.This would almost certainly end up in litigation.Nowrasteh from the Cato Institute said the law is clear that birthright citizenship can't be ended by executive order but that Trump may be inclined to take a shot anyway through the courts.“I don't take his statements very seriously. He has been saying things like this for almost a decade,\" Nowrasteh said. \"He didn't do anything to further this agenda when he was president before. The law and judges are near uniformly opposed to his legal theory that the children of illegal immigrants born in the United States are not citizens.\" Trump could steer Congress to pass a law to end birthright citizenship but would still face a legal challenge that it violates the Constitution.","summary":"Trump Promises to End Birthright Citizenship: What is It, Could He Do It?","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/trump-promises-to-end-birthright-citizenship-what-is-it-could-he-do-it","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/donald-trump-1731153679546-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:52:26","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":271873862,"title":"What fate awaits Syria after the fall of al-Assad?","text":"In light of the dramatic scenes in Syria and the acceleration of events over the course of a handful of days, it seems that the Middle Eastern country is about to enter an ambiguous phase, opening a myriad of possibilities. \n\nJust looking at the map of the country, the region and even beyond, there are several question marks that may not be answered soon.\n\nWho will rule the country? What about the ousted Bashar al-Assad regime’s allies in Tehran, Beirut and Moscow? What about his bitter enemies, and what fate awaits Syria after al-Assad?\n\nSyria’s soft underbelly, Lebanon, is preoccupied with its internal problems, the devastating Israeli war that claimed the lives of nearly 4,000 people. \n\nAl-Assad’s former ally Hezbollah is exhausted by the war it fought against Tel Aviv, which ended with the announcement of a fragile 60-day ceasefire that witnessed daily violations from the Israeli side that have so far resulted in destruction, deaths and injuries even among the Lebanese army, which is supposed to oversee the implementation of the ceasefire.\n\nWith the change in the political scene in Damascus, the supply line from Iran to Hezbollah through Syria will be cut off or, at best, not be easy. \n\nSyria will no longer be the backyard of Hezbollah, which was crucial to al-Assad’s restoration of control in his war against armed opposition groups after it intervened in the conflict in 2013 under the pretext of protecting Lebanese territory from attacks by these groups, as well as protecting the shrine of Sayyida Zainab in the outskirts of Damascus, which has a special status among Shiite Muslims and which, if compromised, would have caused further sectarian tension and rivalry between Sunnis and Shiites.\n\nTurkey and Israel to profit?\n\nTurkey has tried to distance itself from the spectacular advances of armed groups in recent days and has emphasised that it is not involved in the operation. \n\nThis is despite the support it has given to the opposition since the beginning of the uprising against al-Assad’s rule, opening its borders to displaced Syrians at the time. \n\nAnkara has also hosted opposition figures and provided support for the Syrian National Army. Yet, a solution to the dilemma of the estimated three million Syrian refugees in Turkey if security is restored in Syria and the country avoids entering a new cycle of chaos is still unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s also Israel. The neighbouring country occupied the contested Golan Heights region of Syria for more than 57 years before announcing its annexation. Washington recognised this annexation under the previous Trump administration despite clear international resolutions that consider the Golan Heights to be occupied territory. \n\nTwo days ago, Israel mobilised its air and ground forces in the Golan Heights in anticipation of any emergency and has since seized control of the entire territory. \n\nIsrael is likely to closely monitor what is happening in Syria, especially if a regime that emerges is inward-looking and preoccupied with its internal problems and does not claim its right to the Golan Heights or reach the shores of Lake Tiberias.\n\nIran, the biggest loser\n\nAs for Iran, it has lost an important and vital ally in the region.\n\nThe history of relations between the two countries goes back many decades before Bashar al-Assad even came to power. \n\nInterests converged between an Islamist regime that emerged from the Khomeini-led revolution that toppled the shah in 1979 and a secular nationalist regime led by the Ba’ath Party headed by Bashar al-Assad’s father, Hafez. \n\nAt the time, Hafez al-Assad supported Tehran in its war against Iraq in the 1980s. The two sides were united in their hostility to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and their rivalry with Washington, which was providing military support to Iraq in its eight-year war against Iran in the 1980s. \n\nThere is also the role Quds Force commander General Qassem Soleimani — who was killed by a US raid in Baghdad in early 2020 — played in preventing the fall of the regime and managing the military operations in Aleppo in 2015, where he personally led the battle to break the siege on Syria’s largest city and the country’s economic capital, and was then called by the opposition the Butcher of Aleppo.\n\nBy losing its ally in Damascus, Tehran is the biggest loser in the region. However, it seems to be taking a cautious stance on recent developments, reflected in timid and measured statements on the situation in Syria. \n\nIt is also preoccupied with other challenges and files, namely the deepening hostility between it and Israel and the US, which stands on the threshold of a new administration led by Republican President-elect Donald Trump. With the nuclear file still unresolved and buckling under US and international sanctions, the Tehran regime is apprehensive about the next stage.\n\nThis has been further made visible by Trump’s nomination of veteran diplomat Brian Hook, known for his hard-line positions towards Iran since President George W Bush’s era, to be the special envoy in charge of the country file.\n\nWhat will Moscow do?\n\nFamously, Moscow remains one of the most important stakeholders in what is happening in Syria. \n\nThe departure of al-Assad could be a major blow to the Kremlin, which has military sites in Syria. The most important of these are the Hmeimim Air Base, located southeast of the city of Latakia, and the Tartus naval base. \n\nThese two sites gave Russia access to the Mediterranean waters from its eastern bank, serving its interests in the region and Africa as well.\n\nVladimir Putin’s Russia has provided significant military support to the regime since 2015, with some 4,000 troops on the ground. This support, under the banner of fighting the so-called IS and extremist groups, has been crucial in maintaining al-Assad’s rule.\n\nThe fall of the regime would mean that Moscow would no longer have a foothold in Syria, given the deep-seated hostility of armed groups. Geostrategically, it would be a blow to Putin, who has been fighting a war in Ukraine for nearly three years. \n\nThese developments may be a factor in resolving the war in Ukraine and further influence the conflict between NATO and Western countries on the one hand and Russia on the other.\n\nFears of a Libyan or Afghan model\n\nNow that armed groups led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — formerly Jabhat al-Nusra — have taken control of the government in Syria, and with the different ideological agendas of these groups and the association of some of them with regional and international powers, the situation remains hazy, if not bleak.\n\nNo one can say with certainty that the country will not be divided and a democratic transition of power will not take place or whether Syria can avoid a fate similar to that of Libya since its uprising against the Muammar al-Gaddafi regime on 17 February 2011.\n\nThe North African country has been divided for years between an internationally recognised government based in Tripoli in the west and a government in the east led by Libya’s strongman, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, further contributing to regional and international polarisation. \n\nSo far, all attempts have failed to heal the rift between the two sides and put an end to the rivalry that has resulted in hundreds of deaths and the imposition of two governments, two central banks, armed forces and militias, dilapidated infrastructure and a collapsed economy despite the country’s vast oil wealth.\n\nAnother fear is the repeat of the Afghanistan scenario, where the Taliban surprisingly took complete control on 15 August 2021, and the imposition of a hardline Islamist regime there following the withdrawal of the US and other international forces.\n\nWhat if Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which spearheaded the overthrow of the al-Assad regime, takes control of the levers of government in a multi-confessional and multi-ethnic country populated by Kurds, Alawites, Druze, Shiites and Sunnis? \n\nThis is in addition to the Christians who form an integral part of Syria’s demographic fabric, as their ancestors were the first to embrace this religion and follow Jesus’ teachings. \n\nThe short answer is, it’s too early to tell.\n\nAs the rebels form their first provisional government free of the al-Assad family in more than five decades and a peaceful transfer of power takes place in which the country, the country now faces an immeasurably difficult task of healing the wounds of the civil war and turning the page on totalitarian rule.","summary":"This article was originally published in Arabic As rebels seize control in Syria after more than a decade of war, the future is uncertain.

That’s irrespective of whether or not President-Elect Donald Trump makes good on his threat to impose 25 per cent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico.\n\n“This is going to be devastating to the forest sector,” Parmar told BIV News in an interview today, where discussed his priorities as the new minister of Forests.\n\n“The first top priority that I’ve made, front and centre, each and every day is softwood lumber,” said Parmar, who served as a ministerial adviser to the minister of Forests from 2019 to 2020.\n\nEarlier this year, in its fifth annual review (AR), the U.S. Department of Commerce set final anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber imports at 14.5 per cent. They could get even worse in 2025.\n\n“We expect that the sixth AR is looking at a 15 per cent increase on top of that,” Parmar said. “These are significant increases.”\n\nAmerican duties on softwood lumber is just one of a litany of challenges that forestry companies have faced over the last few years in B.C.\n\nSince 2017, the NDP government has added new regulations and policies that have made it increasingly difficult for B.C. sawmills and pulp mills to continue to operating.\n\nMore than a dozen sawmill and pulp mills have permanently shuttered in B.C. in the past four years, and this year alone, two forestry companies – Teal Jones and, more recently, San Group – have filed for creditor protection.\n\nWith every sawmill closure in recent years, owners have cited the same problem: Lack of access to economic fibre.\n\nA big part of the problem is a shrinking annual allowable cut (AAC). But forest industry leaders point out that, after all the mill closures that have occurred in recent years, there is an adequate amount of AAC to keep the existing mills running, except that it has been made inaccessible due to cost and red tape.\n\nIn the 1990s, B.C. was harvesting 95 per cent of the province’s annual allowable cut (AAC), Rob Schuetz, president of Industrial Forest Services, said at a Global Wood Summit in November.\n\nSince the B.C. NDP came to power in 2017, the percentage of the AAC that is actually cut has fallen below 50 per cent, Schuetz said.\n\nMina Lauden, vice president of corporate affairs for Canfor Corp. (TSX:CFP), said at recent resources and energy forum sponsored by the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade (GVBOT) that B.C. has enough timber to supply sawmills and pulp mills, but that its often inaccessible due to cost and “regulatory complexity.”\n\n“Foundationally, for British Columbia, it’s about access to economically available fibre,” Lauden said. “We have the harvest available in the province. It’s about accessing it economically and reliably.”\n\n“Regulations are only one part of the fibre story that we have here in British Columbia,” Parmar said.\n\nHe blames the big forestry companies for essentially cutting and running – i.e. harvesting the most valuable timber first, when prices were high, and not making the investments needed to access some of the less economic timber.\n\nA number of companies that have shut down sawmills in B.C. have bought or built new sawmills in the U.S. and Europe, due to a greater availability of merchantable timber.\n\n“During the pine beetle kill, when lumber prices were high, in 2021 and 2022, Canfor and many other companies harvested much of their easily accessible timber, leaving a lot of their vast fibre supply without proper access, expecting to deal with it later,” Parmar said.\n\n“Those same companies that made those decisions did not decide to utilize the millions and sometimes billions of profits that they gained to access to what we refer to as uneconomic fibre. Instead, they left it for later, and now it’s later, and unfortunately, forestry workers…are paying the price for those kinds of business decisions.”\n\nBut industry analysts have said NDP forestry policies and regulations are to blame for the mill closures and flight of capital, saying they have made B.C. “uninvestable.”\n\nSome of those new policies and regulations include old growth harvesting moratoria, new forest landscape plans, ecosystem-based land management, increasing parks and protected areas, shared land-use decision-making with First Nations, and federal and provincial caribou habitat protection plans.\n\nSince his appointment as Forests minister three weeks ago, Parmar said he has met with the Council of Forest Industries (COFI), the United Steelworkers union, which represents forestry workers, and other stakeholders.\n\n“All of those stakeholders and partners that make up the forest sector have asked a lot of me and expect a lot from me, and I expect to deliver for them,” he said. “But I’m also going to be asking much of them.\n\n“When I have conversations with Canfor, and West Fraser and Tolko and many of these other partners, I will be looking to them to say that ‘you’ve made some money here in British Columbia, especially in 2021 and 2022. Where are those profits? Are those profits going down south, are they going to Europe? Why are they not being made here in British Columbia?’”\n\nWhile he gave no indication his government would reconsider forestry policies and regulations that the industry blames for making B.C. one of the highest cost jurisdictions in North America to operate, he did promise to shorten permitting times.\n\n“In my conversations with the staff in the ministry of Forests, I’ve already authorized them to expedite permit approvals,” he said.\n\nHe noted that his ministry has already accelerated permitting for wildfire wood salvaging, noting that in the Cariboo region, all wildfire salvage permits applied for were approved within less than 25 days.\n\nParmar said he hoped that, through the government’s new forest landscape planning tables, there may be ways to “speed things up.”\n\nAs for tariffs and duties, Parmar said his top priority will be pressing Ottawa to address the issue.\n\n“With duties going up next year – outside of the 25 per cent tariffs from the incoming president – just the increase in duties that we’re expected to see, I think those are going to devastating,” he said. “I’m going to be looking to Ottawa to provide the necessary support for us to be able to bridge these unfortunate times.”","summary":"Ravi Parmar says softwood lumber duties could double in 2025","url":"https://www.biv.com/news/resources-agriculture/softwood-lumber-duties-a-top-priority-new-forests-minister-says-9930765","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/biv/ravi-parmar-rob-kruyt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:45:00","author":"Nelson Bennett","authors":["Nelson Bennett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.343},{"id":271875666,"title":"CN Rail, Unifor reach tentative deal ahead of potential strike","text":"Shopping Trends\n\n The Shopping Trends team is independent of the journalists at CTV News.

He’s Known as ‘the Madman.’","text":"Javier Milei, the wild-haired Argentine president known by his supporters as “the madman,” has lately edged out Hungary’s Viktor Orban as the MAGA movement’s chief international inspiration.\n\nDonald Trump has called Milei his “favorite president,” and Milei was the first foreign leader to visit him at Mar-a-Lago after his victory. Last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference, which has increasingly sought to build a global network of right-wing activists and politicians, held its first-ever conference in Buenos Aires. Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, gave a speech lauding Milei’s relentless budget-slashing, and vowed that, with help from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s Department of Government Efficiency, “we’re going to do the same thing in the United States.”\n\nThe ascendence of Milei in Trumpworld is a sign of an important ideological shift on the right. Trump first ran for office railing against corporate America and rejecting the sort of entitlement cuts long dreamed of by Republican wonks like Paul Ryan, the former House speaker. “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,” Trump said in 2015. After Trump won, Orban became an icon to a group of rising right-wing intellectuals less interested in fiscal discipline that in using the power of the state to remake culture, reward friends and punish enemies. Conservatives like JD Vance often speak admiringly of the subsidies Orban’s government gives families to encourage them to have more children; such spending is more than 5 percent of Hungary’s G.D.P.\n\nMilei is a very different kind of right-winger. He’s an arch-libertarian — except when it comes to abortion — who has four cloned mastiffs named after conservative economists. He believes that drugs should be legal, as should the sale of organs, and sees marriage as a contract that should exist outside of state regulation.","summary":"Javier Milei and the rebirth of austerity for the needy.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/opinion/donald-trump-javier-milei.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/12/09/multimedia/09goldberg-gcbh/09goldberg-gcbh-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:36:37","author":"Michelle Goldberg","authors":["Michelle Goldberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":271874790,"title":"Tax cuts and deregulation would lower prices, expert explains","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nPrimary Politics December 09, 2024 05:13 \n\n Tax cuts and deregulation would lower prices, expert explains \n Former Council of Economic Advisers acting chair Tomas Philipson reacts to the left 'fear-mongering' over President-elect Donald Trump's policies on 'The Bottom Line.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard \n\nTags POLITICSTHE BOTTOM LINE | LATEST EPISODES","summary":"Former Council of Economic Advisers acting chair Tomas Philipson reacts to the left &apos;fear-mongering&apos; over President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s policies on &apos;The Bottom Line.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6365779396112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/a63b97e9-8ff8-4e2b-8fc7-79e7585732c3/a3a85150-73da-4de0-8630-829c946291ab/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:36:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.704},{"id":271874192,"title":"Top 'Washington Post' editor kills article on deputy's departure","text":"As the Washington Post newsroom awaits the appointment of a new top editor, its acting news chief intervened to block an article about the departure of its second-highest-ranking editor, a contender for the position, according to several people with knowledge of events.\n\nManaging Editor Matea Gold, a veteran of 11-and-a-half years at the Post who has built up deep loyalty among staffers, had been herself considered a top internal candidate to run the newsroom. According to associates, it became clear that Post Publisher and Chief Executive Will Lewis was poised to pass over her.\n\nShe is instead headed to be second-highest ranking leader of the New York Times Washington bureau, as the Times announced today.\n\nThe internal tensions over the selection of the Post's new executive editor are capping a series of crises for Lewis, including tensions over the paper's reporting on its own issues.\n\nActing editor says Post should not report on itself\n\nOn Saturday, Acting Executive Editor Matt Murray told editors that the paper should not cover itself, according to four people with knowledge.\n\nThis is not how the Post has handled past developments about itself or its leaders. Last year, it covered the retirement of Senior Managing Editor Cameron Barr and in 2015, it published an article about Managing Editor Kevin Merida's decision to leave for ESPN.\n\nMurray did not respond to NPR's request for comment and Gold declined comment. \n\nNPR spoke to nine people with ties to the Post for this article. They requested anonymity in order to speak candidly about sensitive internal matters at the paper. \n\nA Washington Post Co. spokesperson declined to answer questions for this story, but said, \"The Washington Post newsroom is editorially independent and operates in service of our community and national interest.\"\n\nMurray previously worked under Lewis at the Wall Street Journal, where Lewis served as publisher and chief executive from 2014 to 2020.\n\nLate last year, Post Owner Jeff Bezos announced Lewis would become publisher. He took the top post in January and appointed Murray in June, ostensibly to oversee a new innovation newsroom. \n\nMurray was to run the core newsroom until a former colleague of Lewis's at the Telegraph arrived from the U.K. Those plans collapsed. \n\nMurray has continued to run the Post's primary newsroom on an interim basis and remains in contention for the top editor's position permanently.\n\nGold is highly regarded inside the Post newsroom, especially as a stabilizing figure. In a social media post, Associate Editor and columnist Karen Tumulty called Gold \"deeply respected and deeply beloved\" there. Six colleagues tell NPR they believe Lewis's decision not to choose Gold helped push her into the arms of its leading competitor, compounding a sense of frustration internally. \n\nGold was not granted an interview with Bezos for the top position, according to colleagues. Beyond Murray, Clifford Levy, deputy publisher of the New York Times Co., Wirecutter and Athletic sites is believed to be in contention for the editor's job. \n\nShe is the latest in a series of significant departures from the paper, including former Executive Editor Sally Buzbee, whom Lewis sought to assign to a new role. She's now with Reuters. Reporters Shane Harris left for the Atlantic and Devlin Barrett for the Times.\n\nThe Post faces a series of challenges and crises\n\nIn recent years, the Post has endured a series of challenges and crises that have picked up pace under Lewis: deep financial losses, sharp job cuts, revelations that Lewis sought to pressure the Post not to cover questions of whether he was involved in covering up crimes more than a decade ago at Rupert Murdoch's British tabloids, and tough scrutiny of his own journalistic record in the U.K.\n\nHe had previously pressured NPR not to disclose fresh material supporting the allegations of a coverup in the Murdoch tabloid hacking scandal in London.\n\nWhile the Post did not initially report the allegations raised by NPR, Gold oversaw the paper's later coverage of them, as well as Lewis' controversial past in British newspapers. Several colleagues say he was visibly cold and short with her in meetings with top editors. Barr, the retired former senior managing editor, was subsequently brought in to edit those stories.\n\nMost recently, more than 250,000 digital subscribers formally canceled after owner Jeff Bezos killed a planned editorial endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris just days before Election Day. The figure represented more than a tenth of all digital subscribers. (There are about 128,000 daily print subscribers, according to the paper's most recently disclosed figures in September.) \n\nThrough Amazon and Blue Origin, Bezos's companies has billions of dollars worth of commerce involving the federal government. Last week Bezos told the Times he did not regret his decision on blocking the editorial and remained hopeful about President-elect Donald Trump's second administration, despite Trump's attacks on the press and the Post. \n\nAn experienced reporter on the Style desk, Manuel Roig-Franzia, had been assigned to write profiles of each of the likely candidates for the executive editor spot, including Murray and Gold. When he learned of Gold's departure, editors approved assigning Roig-Franzia to write a piece about her decision and her legacy at the Post. \n\nMurray took responsibility for the decision not to have the Post cover this latest development about its leadership, despite the ramifications for the paper. An editor with whom he spoke told colleagues that Murray had not read the planned article on Gold but said to \"pin it on me\" if anyone asked why it did not run.","summary":"Washington Post Acting Executive Editor Matt Murray killed a story about the departure of a veteran and popular editor for a senior position at the New York Times.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/09/nx-s1-5222807/washington-post-editor-kills-article-times-bezos","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5000x3535+0+0/resize/5000x3535!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3e%2Fac%2F849294004f21913b3dba0c72ec53%2Fmatea-gold.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:35:22","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.149},{"id":271873668,"title":"Threats Of Tariffs, Strike Spur Record Imports To US","text":"American imports are expected to reach record levels in November and December as retailers prepare for President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs and a potential strike by dockworkers next month.The National Retail Federation and Hackett Associates estimated Monday that the equivalent of 2.17 million 20-foot cargo containers arrived in the U.S. last month, up 14.4% over November 2023.December is expected to bring the equivalent of 2.14 million containers, up 14.3%.Those amounts would represent new monthly records, according to Reuters.Additional increases of 6.6% to 12.7% are also forecast in January, March and April, with a 4.1% decrease in February due to Lunar New Year factory closings in Asia.\"The window to frontload goods on vessels arriving before a potential strike is quickly closing.

The firefighters were applauded by a standing crowd for five minutes straight, as they walked through Notre Dame between dozens of heads of state, including President-elect Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, at the reopening ceremonies Dec. 7.\n\n\"Even if the shock caused by the fire may have been lasting, the pain was already overcome when prayer rose from the banks of the Seine and from hundreds of millions of hearts around the world,\" Ulrich emphasized.\n\nWhat happened with Notre Dame — a speedy 5-year resurrection from the ashes — is not the only example of God's grace through the centuries, Ulrich stressed.\n\n\"Generation after generation — believers experience it — the Lord does not abandon his own,\" he said. Even if \"distress and violence do not cease throughout the history of men,\" it is God and his disciples \"who feed on his strength to show the way to the victory of life.\"\n\nThe consecration of the new main altar was a central part of the inaugural Mass. The bronze modern structure designed by French artist Guillame Bardet stunned anyone entering the renewed cathedral as an example of contemporary architecture gently completing the centuries-old design.\n\nFirst, the archbishop placed the relics of five holy men and women inside the altar, three women and two men, whose history is linked to the church in Paris, including those of St. Marie Eugénie Milleret, St. Madeleine Sophie Barat, St. Charles de Foucauld and Blessed Vladimir Ghika. Among the relics were also those of St. Catherine Labouré, who was especially connected to the day of the altar's consecration.\n\nSt. Catherine is known to the world for having received apparitions from the Virgin Mary in 1830 in her convent on rue du Bac, in Paris, after which the religious sister asked, following Mary's request, that the Miraculous Medal, also known as the Medal of the Immaculate Conception, be struck. The feast of the Immaculate Conception ordinarily is celebrated Dec. 8 in the Roman calendar; this year, however, as it fell on the Second Sunday of Advent, it's been moved to Dec. 9.\n\nAfter a long prayer of dedication, Ulrich anointed the altar with the blessed oil of the holy chrism, spreading it at length over the entire surface with his bare hands. Then, incense candles were lit at five points on the altar, on the five crosses engraved in bronze. Finally, the priests covered the altar with the white cloth and lit the candles to continue with Mass, accompanied by the choir's singing.\n\nIn a message sent to the archbishop of Paris on Dec. 7, the night of the reopening ceremony, Pope Francis said that soon Notre Dame will \"be visited and admired once again\" by huge crowds of people from all walks of life.\n\n\"I know, Your Excellency, that your doors will be wide open to them, and that you will be committed to welcoming them generously and freely, as brothers and sisters,\" he wrote, making waves of comments in France that the pope himself spoke up against the cathedral's entrance fee proposed by France's Ministry of Culture.\n\n\"May they, lifting their eyes to these vaults that have regained their light, share his invincible hope,\" the pope said of 15 million people expected to visit Notre Dame every year from now on.\n\nNotre Dame's inaugural Sunday wrapped in Paris with a second cathedral Mass, this time open to the public, and celebrated by Notre Dame's rector-archpriest, Father Olivier Ribadeau Dumas. To attend, it was necessary to have reserved a place in a new digital application set up for Notre Dame de Paris.\n\nOn Dec. 3, the day the application went live, the 1,500 places on offer for this first Mass had all been reserved within 25 minutes, The Associated Press confirmed. Ribadeau Dumas had long been looking forward to returning to the cathedral to celebrate such a simple Mass, once the \"pomp\" of the reopening ceremonies had been replaced by \"humble normality,\" he told OSV News several times.","url":"https://www.ncronline.org/news/inaugural-mass-notre-dame-reveals-lord-does-not-abandon-his-own","image":"20241208T1215-NOTRE--DAME-FIRST-MASS-1786284.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:32:47","author":"Caroline de Sury","authors":["Caroline de Sury"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.104},{"id":271872110,"title":"Letters: Trump’s oligarchy | Invest ethically | Humane stand | Public funding | American institutions","text":"Trump is building\na U.S. oligarchy\n\nLaura Manweller of US News and World Report recently estimated the collective worth of Trump’s appointees is $358.9 billion — more than the GDP of 169 countries.

They’re among many who have supported the schools chief and opposed efforts by Mayor Brandon Johnson and the Chicago Teachers Union to push him out. Almost 700 principals and assistant principals also signed a letter asking the board to hold off on changes.\n\nLater, 21 alderpersons signed on to a letter to the school board offering their “full support” for Martinez’s retention. “We ardently believe that CEO Martinez is the logical choice to guide CPS through these troubled times,” they wrote.\n\n“I think it’s only right that the temporary board should adhere to the folks that are involved in education to wait until any type of major decisions are done,” said Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th), who signed the letter.\n\nWBEZ and Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that the school board offered Martinez a buyout in the latest effort to get him to leave. Negotiations are ongoing, but Martinez has so far not taken the offer.\n\nThe tension could come to a head this week, either through a settlement or Martinez’s dismissal. The school board is set to release its agenda on Tuesday for this Thursday’s scheduled meeting. A vote to fire Martinez would have to be explicitly listed on that agenda for action to be taken, legal experts have said.\n\nThe mayor and his handpicked board, which was appointed after the entire previous board resigned in October, could be feeling a sense of urgency to act. They’re close allies of the Chicago Teachers Union, whose leaders are insisting they land a contract agreement before mid-January when the new board takes over and President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nWhile both CTU and CPS say some progress has been made in contract talks, they remain far apart on some major issues. That includes financial terms and others that are more policy-related.\n\nCarlos Rivas Jr., elected to the school board in the 3rd District, said he’d like to have time to evaluate Martinez’s performance once he takes office in January even if it takes a bit for the new board to get caught up to speed. But he said he hoped the board would keep Martinez.\n\n“I wouldn’t want us to be put in the place of less autonomy and capability to decide things for the district,” Rivas said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2024/12/09/alderperson-new-school-board-member-say-dont-fire-cps-ceo-before-partially-elected-panel-takes-over","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3fa0cbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd4%2F34%2F9edb6a164f3fbcbcfcfd7ec8e080%2Fcpsped","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:30:33","author":"Nader Issa,Sarah Karp | Wbez","authors":["Nader Issa","Sarah Karp | Wbez"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":271876026,"title":"Ukraine war briefing: Our war dead 43,000 and Russia’s 198,000 says Zelenskyy","text":"Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that 43,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war, while of 370,000 injured, about half had been able to return to service after treatment.

The Ukrainian president told reporters he was hoping to call the outgoing US president, Joe Biden, in the coming days to discuss Nato membership.\n\n“A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn’t part of Nato. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a Nato member,” Zelenskyy said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, caused controversy in Europe in February when he raised the possibility of European nations sending troops to Ukraine. “Even if we get invited [to Nato], what happens then? Who guarantees our security? We can think about that and work on Emmanuel Macron’s proposal,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nZelenskyy asked for more support from Berlin against Russia while meeting with the current German opposition CDU party leader, Friedrich Merz, who is leading opinion polls ahead of elections in February. “We are counting on stronger, more decisive actions from Germany, from you personally. We are counting on it very much,” Zelenskyy said, mentioning Ukraine’s request for an invitation to join Nato and for long-range missiles. Merz has urged the current chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to send Ukraine the long-range Taurus missile system, which could fire deep into Russian territory – something Scholz has refused to do.\n\nThe Estonian prime minister, Kristen Michal, was also in Kyiv on Monday to meet with Zelenskyy and other senior officials, including Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal.\n\nUkrainian officials said Russian attacks killed a 91-year-old woman in the village of Stara Mykolayivka in the Donetsk region on Monday, as shelling also wounded four others.

Netanyahu also addressed the longstanding territorial issue of the Golan Heights, emphasising its permanence under Israeli control. The territory, occupied by Israel for nearly six decades, was annexed in 1981, a move recently recognised by the United States during Donald Trump’s presidency. “The Golan will be part of the State of Israel for eternity,” Netanyahu said, expressing gratitude to Trump for the recognition during his first term.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/if-we-end-war-now-hamas-will-return-says-israeli-pm-netanyahu-as-gaza-conflict-continues/articleshow/116149752.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116149765/116149765.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-10 00:26:47","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":271870058,"title":"Kate Middleton shortlisted for Time's Person of the Year 2024","text":"Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, has made it to the shortlist for Time’s prestigious \"Person of the Year\" 2024.

We have to be thoughtful and strategic, not go around making our opponent's arguments for him, but making our arguments in a significant and united way.\"\n\nTrump has said he will impose the 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods if Canada does not tighten border security to combat fentanyl smuggling and illegal migration.\n\n\"I\"m a big believer in tariffs. I think tariffs are the most beautiful word ... It's going to make us rich,\" Trump said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press that aired on Sunday.\n\nCBC News and Radio-Canada reported earlier Monday that, according to several sources, the Trudeau government could spend in excess of $1 billion to protect the Canada-U.S. border in an effort to allay Trump's concerns. \n\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told Radio-Canada that the government's intention is to announce the new border plan by Christmas, a few weeks before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\n\"We know a few things about Donald Trump,\" Trudeau said in Halifax. \"We know that when he says these things, he means them.\"\n\nThe prime minister said Trump also has a pattern of attempting to \"destabilize a negotiating partner\" to inject \"a bit of chaos into the well-established hallways of democracies and institutions.\"\n\n\"This time's going to be different. It's going to be a little more challenging,\" Trudeau said of Trump's second term.\n\n\"They're coming in with a lot clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than they had last time, but we can do this.

About two million people are without electricity throughout Houston. (Photo by Go Nakamura/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nTexas has spent years tweaking its electric grid, but it’s still not fixed. How do we know this? ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, projects an 80% likelihood of rolling blackouts if a storm the magnitude of Winter Storm Uri hits the state this winter. Prior to Uri in February 2021, the probability of rolling blackouts was only 5%. A weaker storm—equivalent to 2022’s Winter Storm Elliott—has a 50% probability of triggering rolling blackouts. And there is no assurance that rolling blackouts can be executed, risking a widescale grid failure. So, by ERCOT’s own projections, the grid is more fragile than it was four years ago.\n\nWhy? In 2002, Texas dispensed with a reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain that the consumer could count on in the heat of summer and cold of winter. It has been replaced by a 100% government operated grid under which consumers pay more, get less, and no one can be held accountable.\n\nSince 2021, electricity demand has continued to grow, and while supply from renewable resources and batteries has grown too, it cannot match demand at night. There are not enough natural gas, coal, and nuclear power plants, along with long duration batteries, to keep Texans warm during long, very cold winter nights. While some in Austin blame this problem on federal subsidies tilting the playing field towards renewable energy, the facts tell a different story. First, years before wind and solar farms proliferated in Texas, the ERCOT market design did not reward capital investment by power plant operators. Second, ERCOT is “an arm of the state,” according to the state’s highest court. ERCOT, not the federal government, controls entry to its grid. So, if wind and solar farms are a problem, they are a problem because the state let them become a problem. Finally, the state of Texas rewards gaming by allowing extreme price gouging, which has cost Texans billions of dollars.\n\nThe questions for the Texas Legislature start with, Who do you work for? The billionaire energy oligarchs or 30 million Texans? If the ERCOT grid fails again, how will you react to a federal takeover in the name of national security by President Trump? Of all the states that are critical to the national economy and national security, Texas is at the top of the list.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nUnitedHealthcare Murder Background: Here’s What We Know About Investigation After Luigi Mangione Detained\n\nApple’s Surprising iPhone Update—Green Bubbles End This Week\n\nGoogle’s RCS Nightmare—Why You Need A New App\n\nWhat’s the cost to date?\n\nIn 2021, both The Wall Street Journal and KPRC-2 television in Houston reported that ERCOT consumers had paid $28 billion more than they would have been expected to pay had the market remained a cost-of-service plus allowable return on investment for the utilities—a system that allowed power generators to be paid for investing in maintenance and new generating capacity. Instead, the system encourages generators to hold back power from the grid until tight conditions force wholesale prices to rise, sometimes dramatically, with consumers paying the price. During the five-day February 2021 freeze, spiraling wholesale prices led ERCOT to overcharge its customers by more than $4.2 billion. In 2023, the ERCOT Independent Market Monitor stated that ERCOT overcharged the consumer side of the market by $12 billion from June through December, 2023. No new power plants have been built in exchange for this $12 billion. That money went to executive bonuses and stock buybacks.\n\nWho is responsible?\n\nERCOT was named a defendant in hundreds of lawsuits filed following Winter Storm Uri. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that ERCOT is immune from lawsuits under the doctrine of sovereign immunity because—in carefully chosen language echoing that of the Soviet Union—ERCOT is “an arm of the state.”\n\nUtilities and power plant owners have been dismissed as defendants after arguing that ERCOT failed, or that other power plants failed, or that natural gas supplies failed, and that because the state manages everything about the ERCOT grid, these individual utilities and power plant owners bore no responsibility. It was an easy argument. None of the generators are responsible to individual customers because they only provide electricity to ERCOT. If the electricity was not delivered to consumers, therefore, it was the fault of the state of Texas.\n\nThe Third Court of Appeals overturned the February 2021 overcharge. But, in a move that has never happened anywhere else in the United States, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, PUCT, at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott, went to court to make sure that consumers had to pay the overcharge.\n\nERCOT is not a “deregulated” market\n\nFollowing a deadly freeze in 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spoke up, stating that “…shedding load in the winter places lives and property at risk.” In response, Texas did nothing to change things. In 2013, my colleague Paul MacAvoy and I detailed the design flaws of the ERCOT electricity market and noted that it would inevitably fail because electricity suppliers could not earn a return on capital investment. The state, however, persisted with ERCOT’s anticapitalistic design and daily operation. No one can claim the ERCOT market is deregulated when it is 100% operated by the state of Texas. Every day, ERCOT is the one buyer in the wholesale market, operating like any other government agency buying pencils and office chairs. It is also the one seller in the wholesale market, raking its fees off the top, and billing retailers for electricity daily.\n\nConsumers do not interact directly with the wholesale market. They must buy electricity through PUCT-licensed retailers, who do not own power plants and who are not required to have electricity supplies lined up to service their customers. This contrasts with the old days in Texas when a consumer bought electricity from a vertically integrated utility, and the PUCT made sure that the utility had the electricity generation capacity available to meet the demands of new customers. The utility and the PUCT worked together to make sure that the utility was making the necessary investments. But today, retailers can sign up customers willy-nilly, without knowing whether there is sufficient supply capacity in ERCOT. With more people moving to Texas and a growing economy, and the increased risk of winter blackouts in ERCOT, electricity retailers are selling empty promises. They are running a Ponzi scheme because they can do so without any consequences. If they come up short like they did in 2021, the state will bail them out. Read that as private profit and socialized costs.\n\nApart from selling something they don’t own, the retailers also make money by offering a confusing myriad of plans in full view of their competitors (see the PUCT’s website PowerToChoose.org). They publish their prices much like the airlines do on reservation services or gasoline stations along the road. While some may call this competition, it is remarkably easy for them to collude.\n\nThe proposed solution fails on many levels\n\nThe state has proposed solutions, including the adoption by ERCOT and the PUCT of an untried plan called a “Performance Credit Mechanism,” intended to compensate generators for providing electricity during tight market conditions. The plan, which has a hard cap on the payments, requires retailers to contract with generators. This approach using contracts attempts to reconstitute the vertically integrated utilities. But Texas had already thrown in the towel on its market design by allowing generator companies to acquire retailers such as NRG owning Reliant Energy. The PCM can only work if there is sufficient capacity for peak demand periods and there is 100% compliance across ERCOT. Neither of these requirements exist today. ERCOT’s antiquated portfolio of coal and natural gas power plants virtually guarantees that supply will be short as ERCOT’s rate of unplanned power plant outages is the highest in the nation. And the incentive for power plant operators to withhold electricity to drive the wholesale price from 5-cents per kilowatt hour to $5 per kilowatt hour is too great. As one power plant operator admitted on social media: “Ed, with prices you need to withhold. We have supply and demand functioning well. Get rewarded for being on during peak times.” Texas consumers should beg to differ.\n\nTexas government ignores the easy solutions\n\nThe first, best solution following the 2021 freeze was to build new natural gas power plants. Even the state of California commissioned new natural gas power plants in 2020 after power supplies in that state ran short. Texas state government turned down offers from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Starwood Energy Capital that, for approximately $10 billion, would have added up to 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—not for free of course, the companies asked for a 9 percent rate of return. Those power plants would have been operating today.\n\nNo one will build new natural gas power plants for ERCOT without making sure a rate of return is available. BlackRock rebuffed pleas by Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to invest $10 billion in new power plants last March. To illustrate the investment thesis, CPS, the city of San Antonio’s municipal utility, was able to buy two relatively new natural gas power plants for approximately 50% of the new build cost. It follows that BlackRock is not going to invest $10 billion just to have something that is worth $5 billion. Low interest loans from the Texas Energy Fund cannot overcome the lack of equity investment for new power plants. Incumbent power plants will ask for loans to extend the operating lives of their old coal and natural gas power plants, but that does not expand supply.\n\nThe second fast fix has always been a systemwide demand response program, where ERCOT would pay consumers to reduce electricity use during periods of peak demand. ERCOT already does this for cryptocurrency miners, paying them to reduce power use when the grid is strained. But regular Texans have had smart meters in their homes and businesses for more than 10 years. The technology is proven. During the summer of 2022, California sent out texts requesting that consumers opt-out on peak afternoons. More than one million did—and they did it without getting anything in exchange.\n\nWhy has the Texas government not adopted demand response for consumers after all this time? Doing so would lessen the wild volatility in electricity prices, which range as high as $5 per kilowatt hour wholesale. It also would cut into profitability for generators and commodities traders who play against consumers during tight supply days. Millions of Texans could save billions on their electric bills if just a few hundred thousand customers opt out during peak demand for cheap side payments.\n\nTexas government preys on its citizens\n\nIt’s not Republican vs. Democrat. Democrats run the states of California and New York, where there are dysfunctional grids. But the Republicans in charge of Texas have made it clear they do not care about the voter or consumer. That should change by 2026. Polling from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin shows that grid reliability is a top concern of Texas voters.\n\nTexas replaced its reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain with a severely fragmented system that is 100% government operated. No one can be held accountable. It is exactly like a government bureau out of the old Soviet Union down to its antiquated, computer driven input-output algorithm. Imagine that. One can forgive journalists, engineers, and lobbyists for not appreciating the irony, but the elected leaders of Texas should have learned about comparative government and economic systems in high school and college. Texas “deregulation” replaced government oversight of a capitalist driven electricity supply chain with direct government control.\n\nBeyond those structural problems, other factors are driving up electric bills for Texans. The addition of solar and wind farms brings needed new capacity but also requires an extensive buildout of transmission facilities to bring that electricity from rural areas to the state’s urban centers. Local utilities such as Austin Energy and CenterPoint Energy are also adding cleanup costs from storms and further costs necessary to harden their local distribution infrastructure to customers’ bills.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has often called high energy prices a tax on living, and by that measure, the Texas ERCOT market leads the nation in taxing life. Trump has pledged to cut electricity rates by 50% during his first 18 months in office, but he will not be able to change anything in Texas because the ERCOT grid is not subject to federal oversight or regulation. Texas broke it. Texas needs to fix it. That is the job of the Texas Legislature.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Ron Paul proposed an end to all foreign aid.\n\n“Here’s an easy one for @DOGE! Eliminate foreign aid!” Paul wrote on Musk’s X platform.\n\n“It’s taking money from the poor and middle class in the U.S. and giving it to the rich in poor countries - with a cut to the facilitators in between! Americans don’t want their government to borrow more money to spend on foreign aid. Besides, it is the immoral transfer of wealth and is unconstitutional.”\n\nSharing the former congressman’s post, Musk wrote that DOGE “will address this with full transparency for the American people.”\n\nRamaswamy also weighed in, saying that “Much of U.S. foreign aid isn’t even authorized by Congress.”\n\nHumanitarian assistance is just one form of foreign aid the United States provides. Others include the direct provision of commodities and equipment, technical assistance, funding for infrastructure, and support for foreign governments and international organizations.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, Congress appropriated $66.1 billion in foreign assistance for fiscal year 2023.\n\nTrump has eyed slashing foreign aid in the past. He tried several times to cut foreign assistance under his first administration, but those attempts were rejected by Congress.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that shift will be enough to convince lawmakers to strike all types of foreign assistance from the annual budget.\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy have also targeted non-governmental organizations for funding cuts. As the leaders of DOGE, they will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to issue recommendations and guidance from outside the government.\n\nIn announcing the new initiative, Trump described it as “potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time.”\n\n“Importantly, we will drive out the massive waste and fraud that exists throughout our annual $6.5 trillion dollars of government spending.

It still isn’t clear if the US or Israel have specific intelligence indicating that militants aligned with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda were threatening Israeli positions near the areas now under occupation.\n\n”The Syrian army abandoned its positions in the area around the negotiated Israeli-Syrian buffer zone, which potentially creates a vacuum that could have been filled by terrorist organizations that would threaten the State of Israel, would threaten civilians inside Israel,” said Miller, notably not giving any evidence of those groups having attempted to move in.\n\n“Every country has the right to take action against terrorist organizations, and every country, I think, would be worried about a possible vacuum that could be filled by terrorist organizations, especially in volatile times as we obviously are in right now in Syria,” he continued.\n\nNotably, US officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others at the White House have warned of a possible resurgence of fighters aligned with the Islamic State in Syria coinciding with the downfall of Assad. The US conducted strikes on at least 75 targets thought to be IS-affiliated over Sunday, according to a senior White House official.\n\nSeparate reports from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based human rights organization, indicated on Monday that Israeli forces targeted numerous military sites and potentially other targets across Syria for strikes.\n\nThe statements left open the possibility that Israel could seek to occupy the five villages — Ofaniya, Quneitra, al-Hamidiyah, Samdaniya al-Gharbiyya and al-Qahtaniyah — indefinitely, or at the very least until the establishment of a government in Syria with at least tacit support from the Israeli government. Importantly, the occupation comes just weeks before Donald Trump, a top ally of Benjamin Netanyahu known to be largely deferential to his Israeli counterpart, is set to take office.\n\nMiller would go on to say that “this is a temporary action that they have taken in response to actions by the Syrian military to withdraw from that area” while adding that the Biden administration, which has a little more than a month left in office, would be “watching what steps [Israel] take[s] in the coming weeks”.\n\nMarco Rubio is almost certain to take over for Antony Blinken at the State Department and is expected to face one of the cleanest Senate confirmations of any of Donald Trump’s nominees. \n\nRubio, like Trump, is a vocal supporter of Israel and is an opponent of the establishment of a Palestinian state, something the Biden administration and US allies in the Middle East have argued is necessary for ending the conflict in Gaza.","summary":"Parts of the Golan Heights were annexed by Israel in 1981 after being taken in the Six-Day War and have long been recognized internationally as illegally occupied territory","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/state-department-israel-syria-golan-b2661575.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/09/23/AP24344304363687.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TEyGbL4M-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-09 23:53:38","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":271872994,"title":"US to offer minimum acreage required at Alaska oil and gas auction - Reuters","text":"SummaryUS agency will offer 400,000 acres, the minimum required by lawAlaska officials seek jobs, revenue from drillingEnvironmentalists oppose, citing destruction of ecosystem\n\nDec 9 (Reuters) - The Biden administration will offer oil and gas drilling leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge at a sale on Jan. 9, the U.S. Interior Department said on Monday.\n\nThe agency will make 400,000 acres (161,874 hectares) available to drillers at the auction, the minimum required by a law that mandated the sale.\n\nANWR is a 19 million-acre refuge for species including polar bears and Porcupine caribou.
