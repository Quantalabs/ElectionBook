Real Clear Politics reported Monday that multiple heated confrontations and disagreements occurred after the baggie of cocaine was found in a West Wing locker on July 2, 2023. The Secret Service is pushing back on this narrative saying the cocaine investigation was handled properly. ‘This is false,’ spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told DailyMail.com to the allegation that Cheatle wanted the cocaine gone. ‘The US Secret Service takes its investigative and protective responsibilities very seriously.’ ‘There are retention policies for criminal investigations and the Secret Service adhered to those requirements during this case,’ he added. The bag of cocaine was sent for ‘destruction’ one day after the Secret Service’s 11-day investigation wrapped up without identifying the whodunit. Cheatle, who resigned after the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, reportedly knew the cocaine discovery would bring a media firestorm with it due to the widely chronicled drug use of first son Hunter Biden, according to RCP’s report. Historically such a discovery wouldn’t have come to light as the inner-ring of protective agents assigned to the first family would dispose of ‘contraband,’ three sources in the Secret Service community told the news outlet. President Joe Biden and his family were at Camp David taking in a pre-Fourth of July holiday during the time of the discovery and so it was a member of the Secret Service’s Uniformed Division who found the baggie in locker No. 50. DailyMail.com exclusively reported on the first images of the bag of cocaine in November. So instead of those agents finding the substance, it was discovered my a member of the Secret Service’s Uniformed Division. The officer who found the bag flagged it as a potentially hazardous substance – like Anthrax – though in documents obtained by DailyMail.com that individual ‘was confident it was drug related.’ It’s unclear when the alleged pressure campaign to have the cocaine destroyed began. RCP reported that at some point during the investigation vault supervisor Matt White received a call from Cheatle or someone speaking on her behalf asking him to destroy the bag of cocaine because agency leaders wanted to close the case, two sources told the news outlet. ‘Protocol is, whether you act on the [DNA] hit or not, we still have to maintain evidence for a period of up to seven years,’ a source said. ‘It became a big to-do.’ Traditionally a Technical Security Division investigator would have been deployed to the scene to identify the substance, but the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Service Department was called instead. The White House complex was then evacuated – something that tipped off the press. The bag was initially sent to U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center but then ended up at Quantico, at the FBI’s crime lab. Three sources told RCP that while no fingerprints were detected, the FBI lab found some DNA material. Sources said the agency ran the DNA material against national criminal databases and ‘got a partial hit,’ meaning that the DNA matched a blood relative of the person whose DNA was left on the bag. ‘The Congressional oversight committees need to put White under oath and confirm the “partial hit,”‘ a source told RCP. ‘Then the FBI needs to explain who the partial hit was against, then determine what blood family member has ties to the White House or what person matchin the partial hit was present at the White House that weekend.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOusted Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and other top officials wanted the cocaine&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Did former Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle prompt the quick destruction of the cocaine found at the White House? first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/did-former-secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle-prompt-the-quick-destruction-of-the-cocaine-found-at-the-white-house/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Was-ousted-Secret-Service-director-Kimberly-Cheatle.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 00:29:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.411},{"id":253455090,"title":"Ex-Trump Lackey Jenna Ellis Flips to Help Arizona Prosecutors","text":"Jenna Ellis, a former legal adviser to Donald Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign, on Monday reached an agreement with Arizona prosecutors that will see her duck potential jail time.

Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe.

Celeste Maloy still narrowly leads her opponent, who preemptively filed a lawsuit contesting the results. The Associated Press is not calling the race until the resolution of a pending legal challenge from Colby Jenkins that asks judges to decide whether 1,171 additional ballots that were disqualified for late postmarking should be counted. Maloy leads by 176 votes after the recount, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson announced Monday. Jenkins is suing Henderson — the state’s chief election officer — and clerks in nine of the district’s 13 counties, claiming they were aware of ballot processing and postmarking delays but did not address the issue or inform voters that their ballots would not be counted. He is asking the state Supreme Court to direct those clerks to count all ballots disqualified because of invalid or late postmarks. Henderson’s office has declined to comment on the lawsuit. State law requires ballots to be postmarked no later than the day before the election. Jenkins’ complaints revolve around a late batch of southern Utah ballots routed through Las Vegas by the U.S. Postal Service. If Jenkins wins his legal challenge and more than a thousand additional ballots enter the mix, they could turn the tide in a tight race that has to this point always favored Maloy. Maloy, who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump, is seeking her first full term in Congress after winning a special election last fall.

According to a report on Israeli outlet, Channel 12, yesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to postpone his aims to establish relations with Saudi Arabia due to the rapid developments taking place within US politics in recent months, particularly in regard to US President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race and the increasing likelihood of former president, Donald Trump’s re-election into power in the elections in November. Netanyahu’s view is reportedly that it may be worth waiting until the end of the US election season to see whether the Republican nominee, Trump, returns to office, in which case the Israelis would apparently have a clearer vision in regards to the process of pursuing the long-sought normalisation deal with the Gulf Kingdom under US mediation.

With 92 days and counting until Election Day, Trump’s campaigning made a stop by Adin Ross’ Kick stream on Monday afternoon (Aug. 5) with a select group of Trump fans on hand and donning red MAGA hats. Ross and Trump engaged in a quick hits segment where 45 gave his unbridled opinion on a litany of political figures, pop-culture stars and more. One of the photos that popped up happened to be Kanye West, and DT didn’t know where to start with Yeezy, but decided to channel Avril Lavigne’s 2002 Grammy-nominated hit with his description of Ye. “He’s a very complicated,” Trump said of West. “Let’s say complicated because he is. He’s a really nice guy, but he can get some people into trouble. And he can get some other people. He’s got a good heart — he does, he does, but he’s complicated.” Fans were shocked to hear Trump speak about Ye, but some didn’t think he was far off in his surface level description. “Trump is honestly dead on target with this,” one person wrote while another chimed in on X: “Every time Trump speaks about Kanye he gives nothing but love to him.” Trump and West have been intertwined at times throughout the last decade. The former president sent his well-wishes to Kanye and Kim Kardashian after they tied the knot in 2014. Ye had a fake Trump cast in the “Famous” video and later professed he would’ve voted for him in the 2016 election if he had voted. Their relationship went to another level in 2018 when West pulled up to the White House in a red Make America Great Again hat, which he rocked a few weeks prior while performing on Saturday Night Live. “It was something about when I put this hat on that made me feel like Superman. You made a Superman — that’s my favorite superhero — you made a Superman cape,” Ye told reporters at the Oval Office in 2018. “I think it’s the bravery that helps you beat this game called life. They tried to scare me into not wearing this hat — my own friends. This hat, it gives me power in a certain way.” Ye went head-to-head with Donald Trump and Joe Biden in a failed bid to win the 2020 Presidential Election. The tenor of their friendship changed in 2022 when West pulled up to a Mar-A-Lago dinner at Trump’s club with his controversial political affiliate Nick Fuentes. Per NBC, West criticized Trump for not covering the legal bills of those arrested during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol and asked the former president to be his running mate in ’24. Elsewhere in Trump’s interview with Adin Ross, he was gifted a free Cyber Truck and Rolex watch from the streamer, which Rolling Stone speculates could be a violation of FEC rules.","summary":"Trump made an appearance on a Kick stream with Adin Ross on Monday (Aug. 5).","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/donald-trump-kanye-west-adin-ross-stream-1235747242/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Donald-Trump-and-Kanye-West-2016-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 00:03:35","author":"Michael Saponara","authors":["Michael Saponara"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":253453934,"title":"Blinken’s Asia trip a boost for bilateral ties, reinforces stance in South China Sea row: analysts","text":"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s recent visit to the Asia-Pacific region focused on strengthening bilateral ties with key countries and reinforcing a collective stance against China’s actions in the South China Sea, analysts have said. While tangible outcomes of the trip were more pronounced in East Asia, experts said key allies in Southeast Asia were strategically prioritised. Tan See Seng, research adviser at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), said Blinken’s choice to visit the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam – all countries previously visited by US Vice-President Kamala Harris – was a continuation of President Joe Biden’s “emphasis on practical bilateral ties, rather than multilateral diplomacy with Asean”. “His priority remains strengthening bilateral ties with selected Southeast Asia states that the US deems important to its strategy to counter China,” Tan said. Blinken’s visit from July 25 to August 3 also took him to Laos, Mongolia and Japan. Most of the concrete outcomes occurred during his time in Tokyo. During the Japan-US Security Consultative Committee, known as the “2+2” security talks on July 28, Washington and Tokyo agreed to further bolster military cooperation by upgrading the command and control of American forces in the East Asian country. A day later at the Quad Ministerial Meeting, Blinken met foreign ministers from Australia, India and Japan, with the bloc saying in a statement after the meeting that they were working on a series of initiatives to maintain a “free and open maritime order”, including a plan to set up a new maritime legal dialogue. In Southeast Asia, Blinken paid his respects to Vietnam Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, who died on July 19, while in Laos he attended the Asean Regional Forum where he criticised Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions” in the South China Sea. In Singapore, Blinken said at a dialogue that the US would remain engaged with the world regardless who became president in the November election, and defended Washington’s trade policies against China as part of a plan to ensure fair competition and protect national security. The only deliverable in Southeast Asia was during Blinken’s visit to the Philippines, where Washington announced US$500 million in foreign military financing to help modernise the Southeast Asian nation’s armed forces. Tan of RSIS said Asian leaders would have wanted Blinken to speak on how the US intended to counter China, and how that policy would affect the region. “Apart from China, Asian leaders would have pushed him to say how the US will continue to engage with the rest of Asia as a good in itself,” Tan said, adding that Blinken could have touched on what a potential Harris administration might mean for the region. While there are strong indications that former president Donald Trump might return to the White House after November’s election, Harris, who secured the Democratic presidential nomination last Friday, is expected to pose a consideration challenge to Trump. Should Harris become president, Tan said it would be worth paying attention to her current Deputy National Security Adviser Rebecca Lissner, whose ideas on the need for America to “de-risk” itself from China “could inform Harris’ China policy”. Lissner’s ideas on the need to keep the global commons free, open and accessible are also worth looking into, according to Tan, alongside her views on the importance of the US as rule-setter rather than rule-taker. Mark S. Cogan, associate professor of peace and conflict studies at Japan’s Kansai Gaidai University, said it was in Laos that Blinken expressed his criticism over China’s “destabilising actions” in the South China Sea. “The location of which is strategic as there is an urgency among neighbouring states on how to manage China’s aggressive presence in their own backyard,” Cogan said. Blinken’s visit as a whole was also “to move Southeast Asian partners closer towards a more assertive or proactive posture towards China in the South China Sea”, Cogan noted. “The not-so-subtle message to Vietnam was that American resolve in the region is in line with Hanoi’s recent diplomatic complaints about the Hai Yang research vessel,” he said, referring to the Chinese vessel sailing around Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in June. Noting that what was made public versus what was discussed in private were often two different things, Cogan said it was likely that continuity of foreign policy was also on the agenda. “I am sure that the US had circulated the message that Harris’ defiant rebuke of China during her Singapore trip a few years ago would be central to policy going forward,” Cogan said. During a week-long visit through Southeast Asia in 2021, Harris delivered a sharp rebuke in Singapore of China for its incursions in the South China Sea, warning that Beijing’s actions amounted to “coercion” and “intimidation”, and affirming that Washington would support its allies in the region. “This trip is not just about military aid or a contrast with China,” Cogan said, noting that it was also about foreign policy continuity. “Southeast Asian partners are unsurprisingly nervous about a Trump second term, and the transactional diplomacy and accommodation that defined his previous four years in office. That is consequential for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, which have a history of policy flexibility.” Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore, said much of Southeast Asia appeared to be “ambivalent, confused, or even contradictory” about what they wanted from the US. “They do not want to see a lack of US commitment, yet they also worry when [Washington] shows active engagement,” Chong said, adding that most Southeast Asian states also liked to criticise Washington for intensifying US-China competition. “The rivalry is bilateral, [but] there is little corresponding criticism of [China]. Perhaps such behaviour is simply because it is easy and cheap to criticise Washington and not have to worry about costs, in contrast to Beijing,” Chong added.","summary":"Trip seen as continuity of US foreign policy, but analysts say more insight needed into engagement with rest of Asia ‘as a good in itself’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3273304/blinkens-asia-trip-boost-bilateral-ties-reinforces-stance-south-china-sea-row-analysts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/05/44391ee3-6dfb-4cd9-9904-8d22ec1e923a_eabafcaa.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/31/Alexandre%20Soljenitsyne_5_0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-06 00:00:10","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.169},{"id":253453726,"title":"Project 2025 Is an Unmitigated Polling Disaster for Trump and Republicans","text":"Across the Democratic Party’s most senior levels — within Vice President Kamala Harris 2024 campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and other leading party elections and messaging operations — liberal operatives and politicians are plotting to make sure that between now and Election Day, as many voters as possible know about Project 2025, as well as Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Republican leaders’ deep connections to it. With just three months left in the U.S. presidential election, various sectors of the Democratic elite are planning to invest considerable resources toward amplifying the hard-right, Heritage Foundation-hosted policy and personnel initiative, in order to damage the Trump-Vance ticket and other GOP candidates, especially in battleground states, according to four people with knowledge of these operations. In the words of one source familiar with Team Harris’ efforts on the matter, Democratic leaders are working to “smother” Republican candidates “with their own vision for the country,” and will be spending significant time and money — on targeted ads and other messaging and fundraising blitzes — to further solidify Project 2025 in the consciousness of the American electorate. Recent public polling underscores why the Democratic Party is so enthusiastic about tying Republicans to Project 2025: The data suggest that many of the policy priorities outlined in its agenda are deeply unpopular. Furthermore, according to a person familiar with the matter and another Democrat briefed on it, there are reams of internal polling among Democratic organizations showing how much Project 2025 has been breaking through the media ecosystems, even to many median voters. Numerous Democratic Party sources, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, independently tell Rolling Stone that they were stunned that Project 2025 actually broke through to a surprising number of normal, non-extremely-online Americans, and can’t believe how often they have been asked about it by constituents and other so-called “normies.” Indeed, there is some public data, such as from YouGov earlier this summer, pointing to how information on Project 2025 had started to emerge from closed-off partisan bubbles. “Overall, 20 percent of U.S. adult citizens say they’ve heard a lot about Project 2025, while 39 percent have heard a little and 42 percent have heard nothing at all,” the YouGov report reads. “Most Independents with an opinion about Project 2025 dislike it (7 percent favorable, 38 percent unfavorable), while Republicans are more positive (26 percent favorable, 12 percent unfavorable).” This all explains why Trump and his senior staff have — falsely — claimed that he has nothing to do with the conservative project, to the point that he got his supporters to boo Project 2025 during a campaign stop. Trump and his ilk realize how much attention the project is receiving from voters and how woefully unpopular many of the outlined policy prescriptions are to the average citizen. In recent weeks, as Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump had privately vented to political advisers that Project 2025, specifically the abortion-related components of it, risked tanking his electoral chances ahead of November. The former Trump administration staffer, Paul Dans, who headed up Project 2025 within the Heritage Foundation recently resigned, after trying to claim that Trump had no ties to it. Last week, Trump’s campaign co-chiefs Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita gloated in a statement: “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.” Project 2025 has not shuttered. Even if it had, its large policy book has long since been published, its Trumpy personnel database has already been built, and the numerous conservative organizations — including the Heritage Foundation — that formed Project 2025 still exist and are still doing the work (some of which is blessed by Trump himself) to lay the foundation for a potential second Trump term. “Trump can try to distance himself from this, but 70 to 80 percent of the people who wrote the book are going to be in his second administration — the cabinet, under secretaries, assistant secretaries, the senior advisers. They’re all going to be the foot soldiers in a second Trump administration!” one of Project 2025’s contributors previously said. “You can’t look at this constellation of organizations and people without seeing that they’re all his people.” Recent polling from Navigator — a consortium of liberal pollsters, organizations, and operatives — found that some of Project 2025’s abortion-related proposals test off-the-charts poorly. Nearly 80 percent of registered voters oppose allowing the government to monitor people’s pregnancies to potentially prosecute them if they miscarry, 73 percent say it would be harmful to allow employers to deny workers access to birth control, 70 percent say a national abortion ban would be harmful, and 71 percent say it would be harmful to ban in-vitro fertilization nationwide. But it’s not just abortion. Other Project 2025 proposals also test through the floor, when posed to likely voters and focus groups. The Navigator poll found 82 percent of voters say it would be harmful to remove the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans with preexisting conditions; 79 oppose banning Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices and removing the $35 price cap on insulin for seniors; 73 percent oppose abolishing the Department of Education; 66 percent of voters oppose allowing the president to fire thousands of federal civil servants and replace them loyalists; 68 percent of voters oppose making it easier to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. “Our campaign will ensure Americans understand how harmful Trump’s Project 2025 is to their lives, including cutting billions in education funding, monitoring women’s pregnancies, raising prescription drug prices on seniors, and gutting our government of nonpartisan officials to install Trump loyalists as dangerous as they are unpopular,” James Singer, a Harris 2024 spokesperson, says on Monday. Similarly, the Democratic National Committee’s national press secretary, Emilia Rowland, says: “Trump and Vance’s Project 2025 agenda should terrify every American: banning abortion nationwide, threatening doctors with jail time, restricting access to contraception, and even monitoring women’s pregnancies,” adding that this “November, voters will remind Trump and Vance that they have no place in our doctor’s offices.” The Navigator findings are backed up by new polling from University of Massachusetts Amherst gauging respondents’ opinions on Project 2025 policy priorities. The UMass poll results, provided exclusively to Rolling Stone, found that 68 percent of Americans oppose the idea of firing thousands of federal employees and replacing them with political appointees loyal to the president, 64 oppose eliminating the Department of Education, and 72 percent oppose restricting women’s access to contraception. The poll additionally found that 56 percent of Americans oppose cutting funding for renewable energy research and investment, and only 23 percent who support doing so. And a majority of respondents said they oppose reducing federal protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, compared to 22 who support doing so. According to the UMass poll, 53 percent of Americans have read, seen, or heard about Project 2025. “Our results suggest that Trump’s move away from Project 2025, while straining credulity, makes sense if Trump intends to return to the White House,” says Tatishe Nteta, the UMass Poll director. “While our politics are usually divided by class, generational, racial, gender, and partisan identities, among these groups we find almost universal opposition to many of the policies associated with Project 2025.” Nteta continues, rather ominously for the American right’s 2024 ambitions: “Even former Trump voters exhibit opposition to many of these policies, a bad omen for the Republican Party and Trump campaign.”","summary":"Democrats are planning to “smother” Donald Trump, J.D.

The decision by the justices came in response to Missouri’s lawsuit claiming that the case against Trump infringed on the right of voters under the US Constitution to hear from the Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to regain the White House. The Supreme Court’s order was unsigned. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have taken up Missouri’s case but added that they “would not grant other relief”. Trump was found guilty in May of falsifying business records to cover up a US$130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence before the 2016 US election about a sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump years earlier. Prosecutors have said the payment was designed help Trump’s chances in the 2016 election, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, the Republican candidate in this year’s election, denies having had sex with Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after his sentencing, scheduled for September. Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a July 3 lawsuit against New York state asking the Supreme Court to pause Trump’s impending sentencing and the gag order placed on him by New York state judge Juan Merchan. Legal disputes between states are filed directly to the Supreme Court. Bailey argued that the criminal case against Trump violated the right of Missouri residents under the Constitution’s First Amendment to “hear from and vote for their preferred presidential candidate”. “Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024 election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,” Bailey said in bringing the case. Republican attorneys general from Florida, Iowa, Montana and Alaska filed a Supreme Court brief in support of Missouri’s lawsuit. Trump also faces federal and state criminal charges involving his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to US President Joe Biden. The Supreme Court in a July 1 ruling powered by its 6-3 conservative majority granted Trump substantial criminal immunity for actions taken in office. It all but ensured Trump would not face trial in the federal election subversion case before the election. Trump’s lawyers promptly invoked the immunity ruling in a bid to toss the hush money verdict. They said prosecutors improperly relied on social media posts made in 2018 by Trump when he was serving as president that qualified as official communications. The judge in the case said he would rule on Trump’s arguments by September 6. Merchan said that if he upholds the conviction, he would sentence Trump on September 18. A New York state appeal court last week rejected Trump’s challenge to his gag order. The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan means Trump, who has called all the criminal cases against him politically motivated, cannot comment publicly about individual prosecutors and others in the case until his sentencing.","summary":"Trump denies having had sex with porn star Stormy Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after his sentencing, set for September.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3273326/supreme-court-declines-missouri-bid-halt-trump-sentencing-hush-money-case","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/06/46a37035-8e48-4006-91ad-f02001c8c458_4eacb9fa.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/16/160724-Trump%20Tshirts%20NY.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:47:06","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.456},{"id":253453150,"title":"Adin Ross Surprises Donald Trump with a Cybertruck and Rolex (VIDEO)","text":"Home Life Style Adin Ross Surprises Donald Trump with a Cybertruck and Rolex (VIDEO) Adin Ross Surprises Donald Trump with a Cybertruck and Rolex (VIDEO) Published on 06 August 2024 Author Internewscast Share this @internewscast.com FacebookXRedditPinterest Share this @internewscast.com FacebookXRedditPinterest You May Also Like Life Style A suspect fleeing police in Florida crashed into a pregnant woman’s car,… Internewscast August 5, 2024 Life Style Internewscast August 5, 2024 Life Style Internewscast August 5, 2024 AU Washington braced for an expected Iranian retaliation for the killing of a… Internewscast August 6, 2024 News SHOCKING video has captured the moment an allegedly drunk driver sped through… Internewscast August 6, 2024 US Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) has waged several successful legal efforts… Internewscast August 6, 2024 US The Ohio State Supreme Court has made an astonishing ruling in the… Internewscast August 6, 2024","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis Post: Adin Ross Surprises Donald Trump with a Cybertruck and Rolex (VIDEO) first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/life-style/adin-ross-surprises-donald-trump-with-a-cybertruck-and-rolex-video/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Adin-Ross-Gifts-Donald-Trump-Cybertruck-Rolex-VIDEOS.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:43:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.131},{"id":253453162,"title":"El Monte man arrested after repeatedly trespassing at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate","text":"A Chinese national from El Monte faces charges of trespassing at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, where he purportedly told Secret Service agents he wanted to drop off documents related to China’s involvement in the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump. Zijie Li, 38, who allegedly attempted multiple times to access Mar-a-Lago, was arrested by Palm Beach police on July 31 for trespassing after he was warned to stay away. He pleaded not guilty Friday in Palm Beach County Court and remained in jail Monday, Aug. 5, on $10,000 bail. Efforts to contact Li’s relatives and Trump campaign officials for comment were unsuccessful. Li’s first encounter occurred at about 8 p.m. on July 19, when the gray Toyota Prius he was driving attempted to enter the main gate at Mar-a-Lago and was stopped by Secret Service agents, according to a Palm Beach police probable cause affidavit obtained by the Southern California News Group. Li reportedly informed the agents he possessed information that China was involved in the failed assassination of Trump at a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 and wanted to leave documents with them. The agents informed Li he was trespassing, adding that he was not allowed to enter further onto Mar-a-Lago property. Palm Beach police arrived at Mar-a-Lago and issued a written trespassing warning to Li, who was advised he would be arrested if he returned, the affidavit states. On July 30 at 5:41 p.m., Li was seen driving his vehicle on South Ocean Boulevard toward the Mar-a-Lago checkpoint. A police officer made contact with Li, who was blocking a traffic lane. During the encounter, the officer noticed Li’s GPS had a destination of 1100 S. Ocean Blvd., which is the address of Mar-a-Lago. The officer released Li, who then was seen about an hour later driving about a block away from Mar-a-Lago, prompting Palm Beach police and Secret Service agents to contact him outside the security zone. Once again, Li was told not to return to Mar-a-Lago and was released, according to the affidavit. A day later, just after 10 a.m., Li’s vehicle allegedly traveled eastbound over Palm Beach’s Southern Boulevard Bridge, past Secret Service checkpoints and barricades, and attempted to enter through the south gate at Mar-a-Lago.Li was told by security personnel who stopped him that he could not enter. He then drove off and was arrested by police a little more than an hour later. Other Chinese nationals also have been arrested for illegally entering Mar-a-Lago over the last few years, according to Fox 29 in West Palm Beach. In June 2022, a 53-year-old man was arrested on a trespassing charge. Jing Lu, a Chinese national, was charged with illegally entering Mar-a-Lago in December 2019. Mar-a-Lago intruder Yujing Zhang was deported to China in 2021 after serving a prison sentence in the U.S. following her 2019 arrest. Additionally, a Connecticut opera singer was arrested after she drove a speeding SUV through a checkpoint outside Mar-a-Lago on Jan. 31, 2020.","summary":"Zijie Li told Secret Services agents he wanted to give them documents suggesting China was involved in the assassination attempt against the former president.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/08/05/el-monte-man-arrested-after-repeatedly-trespassing-at-trumps-mar-a-lago-estate/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tresspasser-this-one.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:42:49","author":"Scott Schwebke","authors":["Scott Schwebke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.672},{"id":253453168,"title":"Trump team cries foul over Sunday poll, but surveys out Monday show same or worse","text":"After a week of upward polling momentum for Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump’s campaign pushed back on the data found in one survey only to have others show the same result. A poll of more than 3,000 voters by CBS and YouGov released Sunday showed Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than her boss had been before he decided to back away from presidential consideration. “She has a 1-point edge nationally — something President Biden never had (he was down by 5 points when he left the race) — and Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states,” CBS wrote. That small lead, according to Trump’s campaign, was the result of some funny math by pollsters and not reflective of reality. “The latest CBS / YouGov poll of registered voters nationwide showing margin-of-error shifts in the national head-to-head ballot between President Trump and Kamala Harris is entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly, while maintaining weights on age, partisanship, and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated,” Trump’s campaign said Monday. According to Trump’s campaign, the polls sampling make up is also problematic. Of 3,092 registered voters contacted, only 35.5% identified themselves as conservatives, compared to 30.3% moderate voters and 30.2% liberal leaners. That’s fewer conservatives and moderates than seen in past polls, they say, and unfairly skewed to the left. “Without this manipulation, President Trump would be maintaining a 51-49 lead in their August 4 survey,” the Trump’s team said. Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior advisor, said the polls demonstrate that the “fake news media” is continuing its crusade to “help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies.” “As this analysis shows they’ll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her. This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win,” Hughes said. But despite the skepticism cast by team Trump, a slew of polls released Monday show similar results. A survey of 1,326 registered voters conducted by I&I/TIPP shows Harris up by one point in a head-to-head matchup and by two points in a race including third party alternatives, both within the 2.9-point margin of error. A SurveyUSA poll of 1,500 likely voters found the Vice President leading the 45th President by three points — outside the 2.4% margin of error — with 4% of those surveyed reporting they are still undecided. A Morning Consult poll of 11,265 registered voters released on Monday has Harris up by 4%, well outside that weekly survey’s 1% margin of error. “Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, a record-high margin in her favor in our tracking and the largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,” pollsters wrote.","summary":"“Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, a record-high margin in her favor in our tracking and the largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,” Morning Consult wrote","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/trump-team-cries-foul-over-sunday-poll-but-surveys-out-monday-show-same-or-worse/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24210622885334-1-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:42:09","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":253454472,"title":"Harris has 1-point edge nationally over Trump, CBS News poll finds","text":"Harris has 1-point edge nationally over Trump, CBS News poll finds When President Biden exited the 2024 race, CBS News polling had him trailing former President Donald Trump by five points.

Frank Carillo was charged on Friday in federal court in Virginia with threatening the vice president after posting a series of messages targeting Harris on the social media site GETTR, according to court records. Harris is the Democratic candidate facing Republican former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 presidential election. “Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive I will do it personally if no one else does,” read one post cited in court documents. Another said Harris is “going to regret ever trying to become president.” The messages were posted on July 27, six days after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection and endorsed Harris to take his place as the Democratic candidate. The account also posted messages targeting Biden and FBI Director Christopher Wray. FBI agents seized a rifle and a handgun during a search of Carillo’s home, according to court documents. Carillo was expected to make his first court appearance today. Attorney information for Carillo was not immediately available. U.S. Justice Department officials have been concerned by what they have called a spike in threats to public officials in the United States.

Tim Walz could be Kamala Harris’ running mate. What happens if he becomes vice president?","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of Vice President Kamala Harris’ top picks for a presidential running mate, and a decision is expected by Tuesday. Harris has narrowed down her list to two or three candidates, according to national media reports, with the vice president meeting with finalists over the weekend. Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, met with Harris on Sunday, the Washington Post and others reported. Walz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket. And in recent weeks he’s gained national media attention for going on the attack against Republicans by calling them “weird,” a tactic that’s gained traction among Democrats trying to convince swing voters to come to their side. What if Walz is picked? The odds look decent that Minnesota’s governor will join the Democratic presidential ticket. So if he does, what happens next? Should Walz run with Harris, he will continue serving as governor through the presidential election. But if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump in November, Walz will have to step down. If that happens, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become governor of Minnesota for the rest of Walz’s second four-year term, which ends in January 2027. She would be the first woman and first Native American to hold the state’s highest elected office. Even if Walz doesn’t get picked as vice president, he’s widely seen as a favorite for a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration. If Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, Walz could end up leaving the governor’s office if he’s asked to lead an executive agency like the Department of Education or Veterans Affairs. The last Minnesota to serve as vice president was Walter Mondale in President Jimmy Carter’s administration. Before that Hubert Humphrey served with President Lyndon B. Johnson. Who fills Flanagan’s seat? With the lieutenant governor’s office open, the Minnesota Constitution calls for the “presiding officer” of the Senate to fill the position. If that were to happen right now, it would mean Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Minneapolis DFLer, would fill the role. He would become Minnesota’s first Black lieutenant governor. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently splits control of the Senate 33-33 with Republicans after the June resignation of State Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, who is running for Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District. However, the Legislature isn’t scheduled to convene until January. There’s a special election for Morrison’s Senate seat in November on the same day as the general election that will determine who controls the majority in the Minnesota Senate. The rest of the Minnesota Senate isn’t up for election until 2026. If Champion were to become lieutenant governor and step down from the senate, there would also be a special election for his seat. Democrats likely would regain control as his north Minneapolis district is a safe Democratic stronghold. Though past transitions haven’t gone quite as smoothly. Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach In January 2018, then-Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to fill former U.S. Sen. Al Franken’s seat after Franken resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. The move automatically made Republican Senate President Michelle Fischbach the lieutenant governor. Fischbach refused to resign from the Senate as it would have ended a slim Republican majority in the chamber.

A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.On Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.This arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).Economists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.Despite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.This comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.In wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it \"Kamala Krash.\"Trump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.Newsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.A Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: \"If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\"It is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.\"The Biden campaign post reads: \"Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins. Left: Trump [in January] desperately trying to take credit for the stock market hitting record highs under President Biden.\"Experts have reacted by advising investors to maintain a long-term perspective, particularly for retirement funds, adding that panic selling during market downturns typically results in greater losses, according to AP.Jacob Channel, senior economist for LendingTree, noted that markets have historically recovered from worse sell-offs, the news outlet added.","summary":"The global market plunge struck the U.S. as stocks fell sharply after opening, sparking reactions amid the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/u-s-market-sees-huge-daily-drop-sparking-reactions-1934938","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443391/stock-market.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:26:53","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":253453200,"title":"‘Cyber squatter’ owns 15 websites named for Kamala Harris and potential running mates","text":"“I just tried to grab her name and all the heartland governors I could think of,” he recalled Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. Four years later, if Harris selects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Eche could be looking at a payday. He is willing to sell it — and a slate of over a dozen other Harris websites — for $15,000, he says. This is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in New York City’s Brooklyn borough. Eche is a cyber squatter, a person who buys a domain with someone else’s name or brand for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. It is also called domain investing, given it can reap significant rewards. In 2011, five years before Hillary Clinton selected Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate in the presidential race, Eche — then known as Jeremy Peter Green, before he got married — purchased ClintonKaine.com. After the former secretary of state made the pick, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc” emblazoned at the bottom. Harris spent the weekend interviewing a half dozen potential running mates, including Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. She is said to be making her decision imminently and has a slate of planned events with her running mate this week. Eche told the AP that he has not been contacted by anyone connected to the Harris campaign. In 2016, it took a week after Clinton selected Kaine before he connected with anyone from the Clinton campaign, and that was because he had a connection to the operation. He is skeptical Harris’ campaign will reach out before they officially make the pick. “Hopefully (Harris’) people are a little more savvy than Clinton’s people were,” he said. Eche owns at least 15 websites tied to Harris and her selection of a possible running mate. In addition to Walz, he also owns HarrisPritzker.com, a nod to the Illinois governor; HarrisEvers.com, for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers; HarrisFetterman.com, for Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman; HarrisWarnock.com, for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock; HarrisPeters.com, for Michigan Sen. Gary Peters; and several others. But Eche does have a favorite among her prospective veeps. “Walz is my favorite,” he said. “Of the people she is thinking about, Walz makes the most sense.” He also owns 10 websites featuring Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s name and other Democrats, with an eye toward a possible 2028 presidential run. Eche’s Walz website is now simply a blank chartreuse with the governor’s name in lower-case black letters, a callback to the artist Charli XCX labeling Harris “brat” in a tweet shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, allowing the vice president to take on his operation. That was his wife’s idea, he said. But the site links to his startup’s website — Communer, a site to buy and sell domains and trademarks — where he is offering the Harris slate for $15,000. Eche supported Clinton in 2016, and he supports Harris this cycle. Yet his experience from 2016 — where his website turned into a pro-Trump site — doesn’t give him any pause in selling the Harris sites this time around. “The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,” he said. “I’ve got to sell it to somebody. I know I could just donate it, but that is not really how this works. People with billboards aren’t donating their billboards to the campaign. It is just a property basically.” A Harris spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked whether the plan to buy the domains.","summary":"After Hillary Clinton's campaign declined to buy the website with her name on it in 2016, the owner sold it to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cyber-squatter-pritzker-fetterman-evers-squatter/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164176005-e1722900227543.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:26:28","author":"Dan Merica,The Associated Press","authors":["Dan Merica","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":253452530,"title":"Supreme Court’s Decision on Missouri Case to Lift Gag Order and Sentence in Trump NY Lawsuit","text":"Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) has waged several successful legal efforts against the Biden administration and continues to do battle against government overreach. However, his office’s recent effort to intercede regarding the New York criminal case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg against former President Donald Trump has met with rejection. On July 3, Bailey’s office filed a motion for leave to file a “bill of complaint” against the State of New York in the United States Supreme Court. In the motion, Missouri sought a temporary stay of the gag order and sentencing in Trump’s case in the run-up to the election. As set forth in the accompanying brief and complaint, the actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri’s voters and electors, namely:New York’s gag order and impending sentence unlawfully impede the ability ofelectors to fulfill their federal functions.New York’s gag order and impending sentence violate the Purcell principle.New York’s gag order and impending sentence violate the First Amendment rights of Missouri citizens to listen to the campaign speech of a specific individual on specific topics.Missouri respectfully submits that the forgoing violations establish considerable harms to voters and electors in Missouri, who will be precluded from fully engaging with and hearing from a major-party Presidential candidate in the run up to the November election. These harms are a direct consequence of New York’s calculated, unprecedented decision to prosecute Trump for alleged bookkeeping offenses just months before the Presidential election. On Monday, however, the Supreme Court issued an order denying Missouri’s motion. The order is obviously brief, simply denying the relief requested by the State of Missouri, but does indicate that Justices Thomas and Alito would have granted the motion to file the bill of complaint. As CNN notes, the effort was somewhat of a longshot. But the case was widely viewed as unlikely to gain traction at the Supreme Court in part because of the sweeping implications of allowing a state to intervene in a pending criminal case unfolding in a different state. Following the ruling, Bailey issued a statement on Twitter/X, expressing his disappointment with the outcome but vowing to continue efforts to combat Joe Biden’s (and Kamala Harris’s) Department of Justice: It’s disappointing that the Supreme Court refused to exercise its constitutional responsibility to resolve state v. state disputes.I will continue to prosecute our lawsuit against @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden’s DOJ for coordinating the illicit prosecutions against President Trump— Attorney General Andrew Bailey (@AGAndrewBailey) August 5, 2024","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) has waged several successful legal efforts&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supreme Court&#8217;s Decision on Missouri Case to Lift Gag Order and Sentence in Trump NY Lawsuit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/supreme-courts-decision-on-missouri-case-to-lift-gag-order-and-sentence-in-trump-ny-lawsuit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Supreme-Court-Rules-on-Missouri-Suit-Aimed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:23:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":253453562,"title":"Trump appeared on a Kick livestream with Adin Ross, then things got weird","text":"Donald Trump’s presidential campaign took an interesting detour today as the former president appeared in a livestream hosted by streamer Adin Ross. The livestream was hosted on Kick and, at its peak, had over 580,000 viewers. Ross is a streamer known for courting controversy. At the height of his popularity on Twitch, he accumulated over 7 million followers. He’s hosted influencer Andrew Tate, who is currently facing charges in Romania for rape and human trafficking. He was repeatedly banned from Twitch for using racial slurs, before being permanently banned last year after featuring a chat stream where users spammed racial and antisemitic slurs. Ross migrated to the alternative streaming site Kick, where continued his antics which included hosting known white supremacist Nick Fuentes. Ross’ terms-of-service-breaking content, like streaming the Super Bowl and scrolling through PornHub, has made him popular with Gen-Z males and thereby a perfect conduit for Trump to reach a younger audience — something his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is herself attempting by hosting rallies featuring rapper Megan Thee Stallion. The stream with Trump may drive just as much controversy. At one point in the interview, Ross presented Trump with Rolex watch. Shortly after gifting him the watch, Ross brought up Fani Willis, a district attorney in the state of Georgia, who has filed an indictment against Trump for alleged election interference during the 2020 presidential election. “I have a friend who’s currently being treated very unfair by [District Attorney Willis]. He’s a rapper named Young Thug,” Ross said during the livestream, referencing Williams’ racketeering case against the rapper. “I was just wondering if there’s a way that we could make sure he gets treated fair?” \"Observers wondered if Ross was attempting to bribe Trump.\" Donald Trump has a precedent for getting rappers out of sticky legal situations. At the end of his term in 2021, Trump pardoned the rapper Lil Wayne after he pled guilty to illegal gun possession. He also commuted the sentence for rapper Kodak Black, who was sentenced to 46 months after lying on federal forms in an attempt to purchase firearms. Trump didn’t directly respond to Ross’ question, saying, “He’s gotta be treated fair.” As the details of the stream spread across social media, observers wondered if Ross was attempting to bribe Trump or whether accepting such an expensive gift constituted some kind of campaign finance violation. The two continued the livestream with Trump offering one word comments on a list of celebrities and politicians, including Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Finally, at the end of the stream, Ross presented Trump with another gift: a Tesla Cybertruck with a custom wrap featuring the now famous picture of Trump after he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The stream ended with Ross and Trump streaming from the Cybertruck as “YMCA” played them out.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24214007/trump-adin-ross-livestream-kick-2024-presidential-election","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4bt1IfJDgIAcDRnTmPc9leDh-k=/0x0:2182x1142/1200x628/filters:focal(1091x571:1092x572)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25560887/Screenshot_2024_08_05_at_6.03.58_PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:17:57","author":"Ash Parrish","authors":["Ash Parrish"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.027},{"id":253453060,"title":"Families of 190 corpses left rotting in funeral home owed US$950M: judge","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Festivalgoer's body found in Montreal's Olympic Basin A 20-year-old man is dead after his body was found in the Olympic Basin on Ile-Notre-Dame.

Morning Consult said the poll was conducted between August 2 and 4 and is based on the responses of 11,265 voters.Morning Consult said that Harris' 4-point lead is a \"record-high margin in her favor\" and is the \"largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,\" according to the pollster's election tracking.On August 16, 2023, President Joe Biden was found to be ahead of Trump by 5 points among national voters surveyed by Morning Consult.

The left’s electoral strategy is predicated on riling up voters with ever-more divisive and destructive ideas. The strategy is risky and perhaps even self-defeating, yet Harris is rushing in that direction. She will likely run the most radical campaign in modern history. And Trump shouldn’t let her get away with it. I’ve spent 30 years conducting and analyzing polls, and like many in my profession, I’ve concluded that the single most important political development of the 21st century is the migration of white voters to the Republican Party. The GOP can now count on the consistent support of about 60% of white voters, if not more — up from about 50% to 55% previously. And while demographic changes are slowly lowering whites’ share of the electorate, they still represent about ⅔ of all American voters — meaning Democrats must maintain a strong coalition based on non-white voters to prevail. The Democratic coalition that emerged in Barack Obama’s election in 2008 and remains today centers on four groups: blacks, Hispanics, single women and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29. Since 2008, Republican presidential candidates have never won more than 37% of any of these groups and usually performed much worse, according to Roper Center data. To win in 2024, Harris must claim Obama-like levels of support among them all, since her party’s erosion among white voters means she’s unlikely to gain the 41% of the white vote that Biden did in 2020. The challenge is to appeal to each part of her coalition. Since Obama’s victories, the Democratic Party strategy has been to play to each group’s identity, striking often divisive notes to drive turnout. They’ve met black voters with messaging about America’s widespread racism, while Hispanics have heard a similar negative message. Democrats reach single women with warnings about sexism and abortion and young voters with a variety of cultural and economic catnip, from marijuana legalization to climate virtue-signaling. The problem with this strategy is that with every election, Democrats have had to push the envelope to keep the coalition together — especially after Hillary Clinton failed to do so in 2016. Hence the left’s radicalization over the past eight years: its current hostility to the police, belief in open borders, support for childhood sex changes and demands for rampant student debt cancellation. Far from a platform based on principles, the Democratic Party’s agenda is impelled by a desperate attempt to keep its coalition energized. The job of grievance-peddling now falls to Harris, and she’s already tacking further left. Notably, she has immediately backed more student debt cancellation and has stridently defended an expansive approach to abortion access as a means of appealing to young and single women. Perhaps the only moderation she’s shown is her quiet announcement that she no longer wants an immediate ban on fracking — a calculated retreat designed to help her in Pennsylvania. As the campaign progresses, Harris will likely move into more radical territory, potentially, for example, resurfacing her past support for reparations for the descendants of slaves. Will Donald Trump be similarly extreme? Not even close. Trump’s rhetoric is a major departure from political norms, with its heavy emphasis on personal attacks. But policy-wise, the former president isn’t driving voters to the polls on the crazy train. He generally talks about supporting the police, expanding opportunity, cutting taxes and the federal bureaucracy, standing with the military and other run-of-the-mill Republican priorities. Trump’s relative policy normalcy — combined with Democrats’ increasing ideological extremism — is already drawing new voters to the Republican fold. Polls consistently show him doing better with blacks and Hispanics compared to 2020 and 2016, likely because a growing number are fed up with the left’s agenda and its resulting record of failure. Perhaps most crucially, young men have begun a mass migration rightward, threatening a key part of the Democratic coalition. These defections are already driving Harris’ turn toward radical identity politics: Instead of trying to win lost voters back, she’s revving up those who remain, hoping they’ll turn out in massive numbers. The result is a great American tragedy. One of our country’s two great parties has decided it can’t win without pitting people against each other and undermining core constitutional, economic and moral principles. The other party projects a unifying message of opportunity and aspiration — behind a standard-bearer who resists appeals to the country’s better angels. But it’s a message Harris must oppose at all costs for her strategy to work.

Ellis provided legal counsel to former President Donald Trump 2020 campaign. The lawyer was one of 18 defendants indicted earlier this year for disputing the results of the 2020 election in Arizona. Trump was not among those charged. Democratic state Attorney General Kris Mayes announced Monday that Ellis agreed to cooperate with the investigation into the electors case. The case surrounds Republicans who have been accused of unlawfully attempting to deliver the state’s 11 electoral votes to Trump after the battleground race was called for President Joe Biden. Mayes said Ellis’s “insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the State in proving its case in court” in a statement announcing the deal. “As I stated when the initial charges were announced, I will not allow American democracy to be undermined — it is far too important. Today’s announcement is a win for the rule of law,” the Democratic attorney general continued. Arizona’s 2020 race between Trump and Biden was one of the closest in the country. Many major networks, including NBC, held off on calling the state for Biden until nine days after Election Day, with final tallies showing Trump lost by under 11,000 votes. Trump disputed the election results, telling supporters the following January, “In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address.” No evidence has been found to back up his claims. In December 2020, 11 Republicans concerned with alleged voter fraud gathered in Arizona’s capitol and signed a document claiming Trump had won the state. They said they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and sent the document to Congress. Ellis was not one of the electors but was later indicted on charges of aiding their efforts to overturn the Arizona presidential election. The lawyer worked closely with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former personal attorney, who was also indicted in the Arizona election case, to make the case that the GOP leader had legally won the battleground state. In her new cooperation deal, Ellis agreed to “completely and truthfully” testify at future trials and provide information about her dealings with Giuliani. In exchange, Mayes confirmed that all nine felony charges against Ellis will be dropped and that she will avoid jail time.","summary":"Former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis has agreed to cooperate with authorities to avoid prison time by providing evidence in Arizona&#8217;s &#8220;fake electors&#8221; case surrounding the 2020 election.  Ellis provided legal counsel to former President Donald Trump 2020 campaign.

But the case affecting spouses of H-1B visa holders and Silicon Valley’s technology industry may still end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. A decision Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia puts a cap — at least for now — on a years-long court battle over work authorization for the wives and husbands of H-1B workers who have been allowed to work since 2015 if their spouses are on track for a green card. Two months after the right to work was granted in 2015 to holders of the H-4 visa — a residence permit for spouses of people on the H-1B skilled-worker visa — a group of tech workers sued the federal government, claiming the employment authorization illegally and unfairly forced them to compete for jobs against noncitizens. Friday’s ruling by the D.C. panel upheld a lower-court decision maintaining H-4 employment rights. “We want to be here working and supporting our families,” said business systems analyst Mebi Babu, of San Ramon. “I’ve been living with this uncertainty for the past eight years.” John Miano, a lawyer representing the tech workers group suing as “Save Jobs USA,” said the appeals-court ruling failed to address the crucial issue in the case: whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which allowed H-4 employment, had legal authority to do that. “If this stays in place, (Homeland Security) can allow anything,” Miano said Monday. “We now have a separate immigration system being created by the administrative state. “The courts are now allied with big business to wipe out the protections for U.S. workers in the immigration system.” Miano said he planned to petition the court to re-hear the case, and if that fails, the tech workers will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The importance of the court fight to Silicon Valley’s major tech companies was emphasized when Google, Apple, Cisco, HP, Intel, Salesforce and the former Twitter made the unusual move to urge the court hearing the case in 2021 to let the estimated 90,000 H-4 workers continue to work in the U.S. The majority of those workers are believed to be employed in Silicon Valley. “This ruling is good news for thousands of families in the United States, including some of our own employees,” said Google lawyer Halimah DeLaine Prado. “We are proud to have led a broad coalition of companies supporting families in this proceeding. We’ll continue to advocate in support of our employees and their families and we continue to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform to help keep the U.S. economically competitive.” The H-4 visa, like the H-1B intended for workers with specialized skills, has been caught up in America’s debate over immigration. Cases of U.S. workers being replaced by H-1B visa holders — as was alleged in the Save Jobs USA lawsuit — have complicated the future of employment for H-4 holders, as have abuses by staffing and outsourcing companies. Adding to the difficulties are extremely long waits for the green cards that allow H-1B and H-4 holders to get off visas and become permanent residents. “You can’t really expect people to be sitting at home for 20 years,” said Pratima Joglekar, an assistant in an immigration-law firm, who lives in Fremont and obtained her green card in December after seven years on the H-4. “It took me 14 years to get my green card. It took my husband 19 years.” Joglekar, a local leader of an advocacy group pushing to preserve the H-4 work authorization, said letting the visa holders work boosts the economy. “People earn money — they put the money into the economy in different ways, either by purchasing things or paying for their families,” said Joglekar, 39. The Save Jobs case was tossed out in March 2023 by District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who cited the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, along with “decades of executive-branch practice, and both explicit and implicit congressional ratification of that practice.” Miano argues that Congress has never actually approved employment for H-4 holders, which came via federal rule-making. He sees the court decisions in the Save Jobs case as a distortion of America’s system of checks and balances. “You strip the power from Congress and hand it to bureaucrats,” Miano said. “We have the courts acting to strip democracy from the American people.” Many H-4 holders would like to see Congress act to ensure they can work. Employers are often reluctant to hire them because their right to employment — also jeopardized by former President Donald Trump, who vowed to take it away — is uncertain, said Babu, 40. Employment brings not only more financial stability, and often health insurance, but also financial independence, and confidence, Babu said. Speeding up the green card process would solve the underlying issue, Babu added. Trump’s pledge to strip the right to work from H-4 holders was never carried out, but they worry that should he win the presidency again, they will lose employment authorization. “It scares me a lot,” said Babu, whose husband also works in tech. “I’m pretty sure we’d have to leave California — it’s so expensive here.”","summary":"Two months after the right to work was granted in 2015 to holders of the H-4 visa -- a residence permit for spouses of people on the H-1B skilled-worker visa -- a group of tech workers sued the federal government, claiming the employment authorization illegally and unfairly forced them to compete for jobs against noncitizens.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/05/h-1b-visa-spouses-on-h-4-visa-can-keep-working-but-fight-goes-on/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SJM-L-H1BSPOUSES-0806-01.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:02:09","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":253453074,"title":"Harris is nearing the end of her veepstakes, but one rule trumps them all: Analysis","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is set to announce her running mate on Tuesday, but amid all the hullabaloo over who she'll tap, one mantra remains the unbreakable rule for any vice presidential search: do no harm. Parlor talk is rampant over the three men rumored to be in the veepstakes' top tier: Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The search's calculus likely takes into account their varying appeals, backgrounds, personal baggage and where on the electoral map they can improve Harris' standing. But it's unclear exactly how much a running mate helps the candidate at the top of the ticket -- and the downside of picking someone not ready for the bright lights of a national campaign are severe, possibly making the lack of negatives superior to any possible positives a contender brings. \"At the end of the day, the most practical thing is, do no harm,\" said former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., a Harris ally. \"Who's the governor of which state? Who's the senator from, what state? What do they bring? There's all this public record about the other factors that you would include. But the vetting ... is where you really have to do the deep dive to make sure that somebody meets the other criteria, but that can at best bring value, at worst, be neutral, because you sure don't want someone to bring the ticket down,\" he added. Those in contention to be Harris' pick have been auditioning for days, appearing across various media outlets, singing the vice president's praises and going after former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance his running mate. Last weekend, some were interviewed in person at Harris' residence in Washington. Of Shapiro, Walz and Kelly, each brings his own benefits. Shapiro is a rising star and popular governor of the nation's marquee swing state. Walz brings a progressive record and the folksy appeal of a white-haired Midwesterner, along with an extensive record in Washington, the military and public education. Kelly boasts a sterling resume as a combat veteran and former astronaut from a swing state who is married to a survivor of political violence. Each, too, brings vulnerabilities. Shapiro has drawn progressive ire over his stances on Israel, school vouchers and handling of a sexual misconduct claim against a staffer in his gubernatorial office. Walz risks exacerbating attacks on Harris as a \"California liberal\" with his own policy record. And Kelly isn't known to exactly deliver a barnburner on the stump. Democrats insist they're happy with their choices, arguing that any of the top-tier candidates would be positive additions to Harris' ticket. \"The stakes are very high. But fortunately for us, all three of her finalists are superstars and would do well by us,\" said Democratic strategist David Brand, who works with members of Harris' team and said he supports Shapiro in his personal capacity. Still, various factors will be weighed, and downsides will be measured against upsides. \"There does seem to be a little bit of baggage around him, but again, I think that's all trumped by the very possibility, if she does pick him, that he can help lock down Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes. That's not insignificant,\" one Democratic pollster said, using Shapiro as an example. Harris \"has one priority when it comes to this campaign, and it's winning the election,\" the person added. \"She's gonna let that filter and that calculus be the only calculus in her mind when she decides who to pick. And you can rest assured that who she picks, she chose because she thought that that person helped her win the election. Nothing else.\" Typically, running mates haven't moved the electoral needle significantly in a positive way, and many have enjoyed a burst of attention after their announcements before becoming largely minor factors in recent heavyweight presidential bouts. One source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking said a running mate has the potential to alter the race -- either by adding a benefit and complementing Harris or faceplanting, and that their potential to change the race is often underestimated. But traditionally, the person said, voters decide how to cast their ballot based on the top of the ticket. \"I think a VP can be a drag. I believe they can also provide a bump. And as is typically the case, they can have not much of an impact at all,\" the person said. The downside a running mate could bring, however, could be steep.

Parlor talk is rampant over the three men rumored to be in the veepstakes' top tier: Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The search's calculus likely takes into account their varying appeals, backgrounds, personal baggage and where on the electoral map they can improve Harris' standing. But it's unclear exactly how much a running mate helps the candidate at the top of the ticket -- and the downside of picking someone not ready for the bright lights of a national campaign are severe, possibly making the lack of negatives superior to any possible positives a contender brings. \"At the end of the day, the most practical thing is, do no harm,\" said former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., a Harris ally. \"Who's the governor of which state? Who's the senator from, what state? What do they bring? There's all this public record about the other factors that you would include. But the vetting ... is where you really have to do the deep dive to make sure that somebody meets the other criteria, but that can at best bring value, at worst, be neutral, because you sure don't want someone to bring the ticket down,\" he added. Those in contention to be Harris' pick have been auditioning for days, appearing across various media outlets, singing the vice president's praises and going after former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance his running mate. Last weekend, some were interviewed in person at Harris' residence in Washington. Of Shapiro, Walz and Kelly, each brings his own benefits. Shapiro is a rising star and popular governor of the nation's marquee swing state. Walz brings a progressive record and the folksy appeal of a white-haired Midwesterner, along with an extensive record in Washington, the military and public education. Kelly boasts a sterling resume as a combat veteran and former astronaut from a swing state who is married to a survivor of political violence. Each, too, brings vulnerabilities. Shapiro has drawn progressive ire over his stances on Israel, school vouchers and handling of a sexual misconduct claim against a staffer in his gubernatorial office. Walz risks exacerbating attacks on Harris as a \"California liberal\" with his own policy record. And Kelly isn't known to exactly deliver a barnburner on the stump. Democrats insist they're happy with their choices, arguing that any of the top-tier candidates would be positive additions to Harris' ticket. \"The stakes are very high. But fortunately for us, all three of her finalists are superstars and would do well by us,\" said Democratic strategist David Brand, who works with members of Harris' team and said he supports Shapiro in his personal capacity. Still, various factors will be weighed, and downsides will be measured against upsides. \"There does seem to be a little bit of baggage around him, but again, I think that's all trumped by the very possibility, if she does pick him, that he can help lock down Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes. That's not insignificant,\" one Democratic pollster said, using Shapiro as an example. Harris \"has one priority when it comes to this campaign, and it's winning the election,\" the person added. \"She's gonna let that filter and that calculus be the only calculus in her mind when she decides who to pick. And you can rest assured that who she picks, she chose because she thought that that person helped her win the election. Nothing else.\" Typically, running mates haven't moved the electoral needle significantly in a positive way, and many have enjoyed a burst of attention after their announcements before becoming largely minor factors in recent heavyweight presidential bouts. One source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking said a running mate has the potential to alter the race -- either by adding a benefit and complementing Harris or faceplanting, and that their potential to change the race is often underestimated. But traditionally, the person said, voters decide how to cast their ballot based on the top of the ticket. \"I think a VP can be a drag. I believe they can also provide a bump. And as is typically the case, they can have not much of an impact at all,\" the person said. The downside a running mate could bring, however, could be steep. Democratic strategists pointed to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a cautionary tale. Palin, a once-rising star in the GOP, was tapped as then-Sen. John McCain's running mate in 2008. After initially injecting his presidential campaign with a shot of youthful enthusiasm, she faltered on the national stage when her lack of policy chops was laid bare.

Social media platforms, including X have been under scrutiny for years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including false information about elections and vaccines. There has been growing concern in Washington that AI-generated content could mislead voters in the November presidential and congressional elections. Since Musk bought the platform formerly called Twitter in 2022, civil rights groups have raised concerns over a rise in hate speech and misinformation due to reduced content moderation. Musk, who last month endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. For example, he has said, without evidence, that Democrats are allowing migrants to cross the southern border so that they can vote in federal elections, even though they are ineligible to do so. “As Secretaries of State whose offices and 37 million constituents were recently impacted by false information provided by your platform, we are calling on you to immediately implement changes to X’s AI search assistant, Grok, to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year,” the officials from Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Washington, Michigan and New Mexico said in an open letter to Musk. After Democratic US President Joe Biden stepped aside as presidential candidate on July 21 and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris, the chatbot, Grok, falsely told social media users that Harris had missed the ballot deadline in nine states. “This is false. In all nine states the opposite is true,” the letter from the secretaries of state added. Musk said in March that Grok – a chatbot from artificial intelligence start-up xAI – would be enabled for all premium subscribers of X. The officials said in their letter that even though the chatbot is only available to premium users, its misinformation was shared with millions of people on social media. The officials said X should direct Grok users to CanIVote.org, a non-partisan website on US voting information, when asked about US elections. The social media platform did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. X, which researchers say has scaled back content moderation efforts and reinstated once-banned accounts of known misinformation spreaders, has also faced criticism for stoking tensions during recent far-right riots across England. On Sunday, Musk triggered fresh criticism for posting that “civil war is inevitable” in response to another user blaming the riots on “the effects of mass migration and open borders”.

He’s sitting on HarrisWalz.com now","text":"Jeremy Green Eche took a chance and purchased the website HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020 when then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. “I just tried to grab her name and all the heartland governors I could think of,” he recalled Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. Four years later, if Harris selects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Eche could be looking at a payday. He is willing to sell it — and a slate of over a dozen other Harris websites — for $15,000, he says. This is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in New York City’s Brooklyn borough. Eche is a cyber squatter, a person who buys a domain with someone else’s name or brand for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. It is also called domain investing, given it can reap significant rewards. In 2011, five years before Hillary Clinton selected Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate in the presidential race, Eche — then known as Jeremy Peter Green, before he got married — purchased ClintonKaine.com. After the former secretary of state made the pick, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc” emblazoned at the bottom. Harris spent the weekend interviewing a half dozen potential running mates, including Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. She is said to be making her decision imminently and has a slate of planned events with her running mate this week. Eche told the AP that he has not been contacted by anyone connected to the Harris campaign. In 2016, it took a week after Clinton selected Kaine before he connected with anyone from the Clinton campaign, and that was because he had a connection to the operation. He is skeptical Harris’ campaign will reach out before they officially make the pick. “Hopefully (Harris’) people are a little more savvy than Clinton’s people were,” he said. Eche owns at least 15 websites tied to Harris and her selection of a possible running mate. In addition to Walz, he also owns HarrisPritzker.com, a nod to the Illinois governor; HarrisEvers.com, for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers; HarrisFetterman.com, for Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman; HarrisWarnock.com, for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock; HarrisPeters.com, for Michigan Sen. Gary Peters; and several others. But Eche does have a favorite among her prospective veeps. “Walz is my favorite,” he said. “Of the people she is thinking about, Walz makes the most sense.” He also owns 10 websites featuring Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s name and other Democrats, with an eye toward a possible 2028 presidential run. Eche’s Walz website is now simply a blank chartreuse with the governor’s name in lower-case black letters, a callback to the artist Charli XCX labeling Harris “brat” in a tweet shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, allowing the vice president to take on his operation. That was his wife’s idea, he said. But the site links to his startup’s website — Communer, a site to buy and sell domains and trademarks — where he is offering the Harris slate for $15,000. Eche supported Clinton in 2016, and he supports Harris this cycle. Yet his experience from 2016 — where his website turned into a pro-Trump site — doesn’t give him any pause in selling the Harris sites this time around. “The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,” he said. “I’ve got to sell it to somebody. I know I could just donate it, but that is not really how this works. People with billboards aren’t donating their billboards to the campaign. It is just a property basically.” A Harris spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked whether the plan to buy the domains.

The Arizona attorney general's office announced Monday that it was dropping nine felony charges against Ellis in exchange for her cooperation. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes called the agreement a \"significant step forward.\" \"I am grateful to Ms. Ellis for her cooperation with our investigation and prosecution,\" Mayes said. \"Her insights are invaluable and will greatly aid the state in proving its case in court.\" Ellis was originally charged and pleaded not guilty to nine felony counts in Maricopa County that included fraud, forgery and conspiracy in Arizona's so-called fake electors case to overturn the 2020 election results. According to a copy of her cooperation deal, released by officials in Arizona, Ellis has agreed to provide information to law enforcement and testify \"completely and truthfully at any time and any place\" while vowing not to \"protect any person or entity\" through false information or omissions. The agreement also shows Ellis sat for a recorded proffer session in June with the attorney general's office. Ellis was one of eighteen people indicted by Mayes' office over alleged efforts to overturn the presidential election results in Arizona. Ellis was accused of pressuring Arizona state lawmakers to overturn the results in favor of Trump, and urging former Vice President Mike Pence to accept fake electors instead of the actual elector votes cast for President Joe Biden. Former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were also indicted, while Trump was not charged in the case.

Susan Wild’s personal Facebook account is the gift that keeps on giving. Resurfaced screenshots show the Dem congresswoman cheered on the publication of then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s address during the federal government shutdown in January 2019. Then a first term rep, Wild made two comments under Facebook user Paul Lichty’s post sharing McConnell’s home address in Washington, D.C., suggesting it be emblazoned on a billboard, presumably to direct protesters to McConnell’s home. “Someone should take out a billboard,” Wild replied to Lichty’s post. “Indeed!” Lichty shot back. The exchange continued with Wild implying that federal workers impacted by the shutdown should “visit” McConnell’s residence “in the suburbs of DC where many of those workers live.” Lichty then replied that “a few (thousands) would show up for a chat” with McConnell. Wild, who represents Pennsylvania’s competitive 7th congressional district, is no stranger to making disparaging statements. Earlier this summer, Wild was forced to lock her Facebook account after being called out for a bizarre comment she made on the platform calling a veteran she encountered at a Memorial Day parade homophobic. Previously, the House Ethics Committee ranking member questioned the intelligence of Carbon County voters by saying she needed to “school them” on their strong support for former President Donald Trump. The rural area had just been added to Wild’s district at the time of her comments in 2022, thus reddening the district. Wild doubled down on her comments last January, saying on a Zoom call that she was “dismayed” when Carbon County became part of her district because its residents had “drunk the Trump Kool-Aid.” Wild is seeking a fourth term against GOP state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, who wasted no time in ripping the incumbent’s comments Monday. “Despite her claims that she is ‘moderate and bipartisan’, Susan Wild has earned a reputation for making offensive statements about the people she is elected to represent,” Mackenzie said. “Unfortunately, reckless and threatening comments like the ones in today’s story take her political rhetoric to a dangerous new level — one that has no place in the Lehigh Valley,” Mackenzie added, referring to the geographic region of his eastern Pennsylvania district.","summary":"For her GOP opponents, Rep.

Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr shared a video of himself explaining how he left the animal carcass in Central Park a decade ago, that for years remained a mystery. In the 2014 clip he posted to X (formerly Twitter), Kennedy told controversial comedian Rosanne Barr that he was driving to a falconry outing near Goshen when he came across the dead bear. ‘A woman in the van in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear,’ he said while sitting at a table as Barr stood and listened. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next ‘So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.’ Kennedy continued that in New York ‘you can get a bear tag for roadkill bear’. However, he went on to explain that the hawking went long and that he did not have time to go home to Westchester to drop off the carcass, and instead went straight to New York City for dinner, and afterward had to go to the airport. ‘The bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,’ he said.

He said he was not drinking but that others with him were and thought he came up with ‘a good idea’ around an old bike that was in his car that he was supposed to dispose of for someone. ‘I said, let’s go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like it got hit by a bike,’ Kennedy said. ‘So everybody thought that’s a great idea.’ Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr admitted to dumping a bear carcass in Central Park (Picture: X/@RobertKennedyJr) A campaign bus for Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is toured during the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention near the Fiserv Forum on July 17 (Picture: AP) He said the dead bear was all over the news the next day and that he worried because his fingerprints were on the bike, but that it remained a mystery to the public for a decade. Kennedy posted the clip on Sunday, a day before The New Yorker published a profile on him that included a photo of him sitting at the edge of his vehicle trunk and faking a face of pain as he stuffed his fingers in the deceased cub’s mouth. The bear had a visible open wound on its side. The candidate told the magazine when asked about the picture: ‘Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.’ In another weird twist, Kennedy’s cousin, Tatiana Schlossberg, was the first journalist to report on the bear cub – and told The New York Times that ‘like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story’. Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr talks during a campaign event, in West Hollywood, California, in June (Picture: AP) It is not the only weird incident to emerge from Kennedy’s past recently. A month ago, Vanity Fair published a 2010 photo of Kennedy holding an animal carcass. The magazine reported that Kennedy told someone who was traveling to Asia that ‘that he might enjoy a restaurant in Korea that served dog on the menu, suggesting Kennedy had sampled dog’. Kennedy denied the account and said the carcass belonged to a goat. Kennedy, who is the nephew of the US’s 35th president John F Kennedy, left the Democratic Party at the end of last year and announced his bid for the White House as an independent. A Data for Progress poll released in late July showed that ex-President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were tied at 49% support among likely voters in battleground states, but that Trump had a 1 percentage point lead over Harris when Kennedy and four other candidates were included. With 4% support, Kennedy was the leading candidate after Trump and Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

That’s the question raised by new presidential polling from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov. The last time the pollsters were in the field in January, former President Donald Trump led President Biden 43% to 39% when “leaners” were factored in. In that survey, Robert Kennedy Jr. had 9% support. Yet during a new survey conducted July 29 to August 1, Trump is behind replacement candidate Vice President Kamala Harris 46% to 43%, with Kennedy down to 6%. When Kennedy voters were asked to choose between the top two candidates, more of them said they would vote for Trump than for Harris, 29% to 26%, with 45% saying they wouldn’t vote at all. That narrows the margins since January’s poll, when the same prompt was given to RFK voters about Trump and Biden. Back then, Trump received support from 33% of the RFK voters while Biden took only 23%. But RFK voters leaning toward Trump aren’t enough to offset Democratic gains elsewhere in a D+4 poll that sampled 42% Democrats, 38% Republicans, and 20% independents. The data indicate Harris’ choice of running mate could give her a boost. Expected Tuesday, the announcement will be a kickoff of her campaign’s battleground-states tour. Roughly half of respondents believe the selection should be a male and about the same amount said he should hail from a swing state. That checks the boxes for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, two Democrats in the running — and seen as top favorites — as of Monday evening. Among Democrats, 14% want Kelly and 12% prefer Shapiro. Kelly has a slight edge among independents at 7%, with Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg not far behind at 5%. The polling points to the former president’s polarization, with 75% of Trump backers saying his accomplishments drive their support and 48% citing Trump’s ability to “save America” as a key point in his favor. Conversely, 66% of those not voting for Trump say he’s a “threat to America,” with 48% of them also blaming Trump for the “Jan. 6 insurrection.” Harris supporters, meanwhile, see her campaign in aspirational terms, with 66% believing the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator represents a “new generation” in the Democratid Party. Of Harris supporters, 37% think she’ll enhance America’s “global standing,” while 35% think Harris will continue the policies of the Biden administration. Ironically, America’s global standing and the threat of continued Biden policies are key reasons many voters are looking elsewhere, with 77% of Harris haters worried she will perpetuate Bidenism and 49% convinced she will erode international perception of the United States. When asked about candidate qualities, Harris has the advantage over Trump in being perceived as compassionate, energetic, likable, intelligent, hardworking and “moderate,” which suggests Trump’s branding of her as “dangerously liberal” isn’t catching on. Trump is thought of as more experienced, strong and patriotic. The polling also indicates the prospect of a Harris election inspires more positive feelings than Biden’s re-election would have, with twice as many people saying they would feel “pride” if the vice president was elected in November rather than the incumbent. A quarter of independents say they’re more excited about voting in a Harris-Trump race, but that number is dwarfed by the 66% of Democrats and the 37% of Republicans who say the same.","summary":"Is it a case of Kamala-mentum?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/kamala-harris-gains-7-points-in-national-poll-and-a-swing-state-vp-could-boost-her-even-more/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-wir9o54mi-1722890426763.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722876109&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rMZ42omc-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:38:22","author":"A.g.

Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” the spokesperson added. It is unclear how many US personnel were injured, or the extent of their injuries. President Joe Biden was briefed on the suspected attack, a White House official said. The attack comes after the US carried out a strike in Iraq last week that was described as an act of self-defence against militants who officials said were preparing to launch drones against US and coalition forces in the region. Tensions have been escalating following the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran last Wednesday by a blast at his guesthouse. Iran’s revolutionary guard (IRGC) has accused Israel of killing Haniyeh and said it was supported by the US. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death. Also last week, Israel said it killed a top Hezbollah commander in an air strike on a southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to retaliate against Israel for the killings. The Al Asad base was attacked in January this year by Iranian-backed militias, who launched ballistic missiles and rockets - most of which were intercepted, US Central Command said at the time. A number of US personnel were assessed for traumatic brain injuries after the attack, while at least one Iraqi service member was wounded. The airbase has been used by the US since 2004, following the invasion of Iraq, and has been visited by former US presidents George W Bush and later Donald Trump.","summary":"The attack comes as the US warns the Middle East is at a critical moment after the killings of Hamas and Hezbollah senior leaders.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5dd33egeqo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/beea/live/9ca90170-5377-11ef-a26e-97d01d76bc14.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:34:14","author":"Nadine Yousif","authors":["Nadine Yousif"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.5},{"id":253450624,"title":"Bitcoin, crypto shares plunge as investors pull back on risky stocks amid recession fears","text":"Bitcoin and US cryptocurrency-related shares tumbled on Monday with the rest of the stock market after a weak jobs report and the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates sparked fears of a US recession. Bitcoin’s price has fallen more than 15%, to below $55,00, over the last five days to hit its lowest level in nearly six months, while ether plummeted more than 22%, at $2,463, its lowest since January. Crypto miners like CleanSpark, Bitfarms, Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital fell between 12% and 25% in early trade. The companies’ shares creeped up throughout the day, but still remained down overall. Crypto exchange site Coinbase saw shares plunge as much as 18% and Bitcoin buyer MicroStrategy shares plummeted as much as 23%. It was a complete flip for the crypto industry, which was riding high on hopes that industry regulations were set to become more relaxed. Crypto investors have rallied behind a Donald Trump win in November, hoping the controversial former president would pull back on the industry regulations enforced during President Joe Biden’s time in the White House. Crypto shares soared after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally as investors assumed the event would would propel him to a victory in November over presumed Democratic nominee Biden. Trump’s speech at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tenn., weeks later – during which he claimed the US would be “the crypto capital of the planet” if he is re-elected – also boosted shares. Most recently, Morgan Stanley reportedly told its financial advisors that they could begin pitching Bitcoin ETFs to their wealthy clients – signaling a positive shift from major Wall Street players who have long been skeptical of crypto. But a weak July jobs report Friday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates unchanged earlier in the week led to a massive sell-off. Analysts said the crypto nosedive was unsurprising, and that the crypto-related stocks would ebb and flow alongside sociopolitical pressures. “The bitcoin and crypto market will likely trade off macro and election cues for most of (the third quarter),” Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani wrote in a note. Chhugani said “we are not surprised by Bitcoin’s snap reaction as the only weekend traded market.” Some analysts used the stock’s volatility on Monday to advise investors to pursue direct digital assets instead of ETFs and crypto-related stocks. “If this weekend serves as a reminder of anything, it is the importance of investing in digital assets directly on native crypto exchanges,” Joshua Peck, founder of crypto hedge fund TrueCode Capital, said. But others advised caution when entering the crypto market in any matter. “It’s a big reminder that bitcoin and crypto in general are risk assets and sit at the pointy end of the risk spectrum,” Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, said.

Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said that they would have allowed the suit to continue.Jenna Ellis Cooperating in ArizonaEllis, who was part of the Trump legal team that unsuccessfully tried to reverse the 2020 election outcome, was indicted in April alongside 17 other former Trump associates on charges of conspiring to overturn Arizona's election results in favor of the former president using \"fake electors.\"Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes announced on Monday that Ellis had signed an agreement to \"testify completely and truthfully at any time and any place requested\" on the same day, calling it \"a significant step forward in our case.\"While Trump has not been indicted in Arizona, a legal expert previously told Newsweek that the former president would \"most likely\" be charged if another defendant agreed to testify against him as part of a plea deal.","summary":"Trump is battling multiple court cases as he campaigns as the Republican candidate in this year's presidential election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-donald-trumps-legal-setbacks-this-month-1934908","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2443380/donald-trump-legal-setbacks-august.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:30:19","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.563},{"id":253450544,"title":"‘Like Donald Trump designed it’: The Sydney smoke stack compared to a chicken nugget","text":"But urban planners and residents have been quick to criticise the draft plan.

On Saturday, the second gentleman Emhoff admitted to cheating on his first wife, Kerstin Emhoff, leading up to their divorce in 2009. Worse, it seems his mistress was his children’s nanny, a teacher at their school, who also ended up pregnant from the affair, though no one’s saying what came next — and Emhoff and his wife’s campaign desperately want the scandal to end with no more questions asked. And major media are eager to help: The New York Times made sure to emphasize in a headline that this was a “long-ago affair”; The Washington Post helpfully pointed out that “the affair ended years before he began dating Vice President Harris.” The double standard is glaring: The press spent years breathlessly covering the tale of Donald Trump’s alleged 2006 dalliance with Stormy Daniels; no news is too old if it embarrasses Republicans. Plus, top outlets have been busy polishing Emhoff’s image. He appeared on Late Night with Steven Colbert at the end of May, jovially retelling the story of how he met Kamala on a blind date. A July 26 CNN article, “How Doug Emhoff is amplifying his wife’s historic presidential bid,” called Emhoff Kamala’s “closest confidante and best surrogate” The story of how Emhoff learned Joe Biden had dropped out — two friends he’d just walked out with from a SoulCycle class broke the news, forcing him to sprint back to his car to retrieve his phone — made the rounds on social media, feeding into the prevailing narrative: Doug’s a thoroughly personable guy, modern but goofy, and, above all, a completely supportive partner. And Team Kamala hasn’t been shy about playing up his likability, going so far as to release merch with a photo of a young Doug on mugs and t-shirts in the official campaign store. Sorry: As liberal journalist Mickey Kaus noted on X: “Editors: If it’s relevant to the election to profile Emhoff in your publication (typically in an absurdly positive light), this story is relevant too.

Somos, which bills itself as a “a Latino-led, Latino-focused organization aimed at empowering hardworking Latinos year-round to participate in our nation’s democracy by taking action in our own communities,” commissioned the survey BSP Research conducted of 800 Hispanic voters from seven key states — and released it Monday to the left-leaning New Republic, which predictably frames the group’s efforts as working. Harris, per the survey, leads 55% to 37% among voters from that demographic in seven key battlegrounds: Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina. The pollsters say the data show Harris has a “very strong lead among Latinos” in what they bill as polling that contains a “large enough sample in them to arrive at a confident estimate of the two-party vote in the states that will actually decide the election.” “Harris has strengthened and consolidated support,” said Melissa Morales, president and founder of Somos PAC. What’s more: The poll suggests Harris could juice turnout, with 34% of Latinos more excited about voting with her on the ballot, while 10% are less interested in participating in November. Morales argues former President Donald Trump has “very low favorability within the Latino community,” topping out, and his numbers will keep declining the “more we remind them who Trump actually is.” The poll suggests that compared with Trump, Harris is well-regarded with Hispanic voters. She’s 21 points above water (55% to 34%) with Latino men under 30 years of age and at 70% approval against 23% disapproval with women in the same age bracket. She also enjoys 69% approval with Hispanics in Nevada and 54% among them in Arizona, one of the places the Biden border policy has harmed the most. Speaking of the border, the polling indicates Harris’ immigration policy should not be, as she might put it, “unburdened by what has been.” Asked about combining increased border security with amnesty for illegal immigrants, a position the “border czar” now favors, 65% of respondents view Harris more favorably. Somos PAC has put its money where its messaging is already in this campaign. As NBC News reported in the spring, during what was a very different presidential race, the group had committed to spending $57 million in eight battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin. Crucially, half that spending will be in Nevada and Arizona. For its part, the Harris campaign says its “winning coalition from 2020 is energized” and Hispanics are a big part of that. “Since the Vice President launched her campaign, we’ve seen historic enthusiasm from key parts of the Democratic base: Black voters, Latino voters, AANHPI voters, women, and young voters,” claimed Harris’ battleground states director Dan Kanninen in a weekend memo. Trump’s campaign had a more visible strategy against President Biden with Hispanic voters than against Harris, including a July ad buy in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Team Trump said then it was confident in its ability to cut into Democratic support from Hispanic communities, which contain more than 36 million voters and nearly 15% of the electorate, per the Pew Research Center, citing polling that showed 3 out of every 5 Latino voters had soured on Biden. With a new Democratic nominee, however, the left is betting the race has recalibrated.","summary":"Caveats abound given the source of the survey, but a prominent Democratic pollster is pushing the narrative that Vice President Kamala Harris has the inside track with swing-state Latino voters.

The Missouri attorney general went to the high court with the unusual request to sue New York after the justices granted Trump broad immunity from prosecution in a separate case filed in Washington. The order states that Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito would have allowed Republican Andrew Bailey to file the suit, though not grant his push to quickly lift the gag order and delay sentencing. Bailey argued the New York gag order, which Missouri wanted stayed until after the election, wrongly limits what the GOP presidential nominee can say on the campaign trail around the country, and Trump's eventual sentence could affect his ability to travel. “The actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri’s voters and electors,” he wrote. Bailey railed against the charges as politically motivated as he framed the issue as a conflict between two states. While the Supreme Court typically hears appeals, it can act as a trial court in state conflicts. Those disputes, though, typically deal with shared borders or rivers that cross state lines. New York, meanwhile, said the limited gag order does allow Trump to talk about the issues important to voters, and the sentence may not affect his movement at all. Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James argued that appeals are moving through state courts and there’s no state-on-state conflict that would allow the Supreme Court to weigh in at this point. “Allowing Missouri to file this suit for such relief against New York would permit an extraordinary and dangerous end-run around former President Trump’s ongoing state court proceedings,” she wrote. Trump is under a gag order imposed at trial after prosecutors raised concerns about Trump’s habit of attacking people involved in his cases. It was modified after his conviction, though, to allow him to comment publicly about witnesses and jurors. He remains barred from disclosing the identities or addresses of individual jurors, and from commenting about court staffers, the prosecution team and their families until he is sentenced. His sentencing has been delayed until at least September. Trump was convicted in Manhattan on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She says she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. The charge is punishable by up to four years behind bars, though it's not clear whether prosecutors will seek prison time. Incarceration would be a rare punishment for a first-time offender convicted of Trump’s charges, legal experts have noted. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a conditional discharge requiring Trump to stay out of trouble to avoid additional punishment. Trump is also trying to have the conviction overturned, pointing to the July Supreme Court ruling that gave him broad immunity from prosecution as a former president. That finding all but ended the possibility that he could face trial on election interference charges in Washington before the election. The high court has rejected other similar suits framed as a conflict between states in recent years, including over the 2020 election results. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

After a weekend spent interviewing finalists, Harris must decide on her wingman before the two set off Tuesday on a tour across key battleground states where they will introduce the new Democratic ticket to voters and highlight the stakes of the election. Everything about her campaign has been rapid-fire out of necessity. She's only been a candidate for a little over two weeks, since President Joe Biden bowed out of the race following a dismal debate performance and escalating calls within the Democratic party for him to step aside.

And about 8 in 10 Democrats say they would be somewhat or very satisfied if Harris became the Democratic nominee for president, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted after Biden withdrew from the race. Harris has had to do condensed vetting of her potential running mates as the party's convention draws near. That means there’s not much time left for advocates for and against different picks get in their final licks. Harris was zeroing in on three running mate contenders, whom she interviewed Sunday in Washington. They were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, according to a person familiar with the process who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. Three other men have been in the mix: Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Some congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles or 600 kilometers of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse Trump's arguments that the Biden-Harris administration’s immigration policies are too relaxed. Shapiro has prominent supporters, too, like Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate. A person familiar with the mayor's thinking said she had no insider knowledge about Harris' intentions. When asked about the veepstakes Monday, Shapiro said he had no information. “I got nothing for you, man,\" he told an Associated Press reporter as he arrived at the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg. \"Have a great day.” Both Kelly and Shapiro have seen their detractors become more vocal as Harris closes in on a decision. Walz is in his second term as governor of Minnesota. He has made his state a bastion of liberal policy and, this year, one of the few states to protect fans buying tickets online for Taylor Swift concerts and other live events. He comes from rural America and in his first race for Congress, Walz upset a Republican incumbent. Harris and her running mate — whoever that is — will launch Tuesday into an aggressive, seven-state battleground tour that begins in Philadelphia on Tuesday and winds through Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, though the scheduled Georgia stop might be affected by rains associated with Hurricane Debby. Her early rallies have attracted enthusiastic thousands. Campaign officials say each stop will be loaded with local election officials, religious leaders, union members and more in an effort to show the diversity of her coalition. Some Republicans will also appear with her, according to the campaign. The campaign this week launched “Republicans for Harris.” The program will be a “campaign within a campaign,” according to Harris’ team, using well-known Republicans to activate their networks, with a particular emphasis on primary voters who backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Campaign officials are aware that momentum can be fleeting and are working to capitalize on the energy now, while managing expectations by continuing to emphasize that the race with Republican nominee Donald Trump is tight. But the strong rollout has allowed the Harris campaign to put a number of states back in play that had been feared out of reach when Biden remained at the top of the ticket. Trump's running mate, JD Vance, told Fox News on Sunday that Harris' pick doesn't matter to him. “Whoever she chooses, the problem is going to be Kamala Harris’ record and Kamala Harris’ policies,\" he said, adding “it’s not going to be good for the country.” Associated Press Writer Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pa. contributed to this report. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.
