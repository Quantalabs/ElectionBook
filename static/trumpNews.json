Voters are gearing up to head to the polls to cast their ballots for either Donald Trump or Kamala Harris in one of the nation’s most historic presidential races. They’ll also be determining which party will control the House and Senate.\n\nFollow the AP’s Election 2024 coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nOhio Sen. Brown’s campaign urges voters to stay in line\n\nThe campaign for Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is facing a tight reelection in Ohio, urged voters to remain in line even after polls closed Tuesday, sending out an email to supporters saying, “IF YOU ARE IN LINE TO VOTE, STAY IN LINE.”\n\nBrown’s success is key for Democrats seeking to maintain control of the chamber with their incumbents in states like Ohio and Montana.\n\nHoward students take pride in Harris and a historic moment for ‘The Mecca’\n\nHoward University students are reveling as their campus is pushed into the spotlight of American politics alongside its star alumna, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLines of students awaited to enter the campus gymnasium watch party as well as the Harris-Walz campaign’s main event, to be held in the heart of campus, known as “The Yard.”\n\n“It’s not every day you get a presidential election that’s going on in the heart of your campus,” said Tyler Henry, a Howard senior from Dallas.\n\n“We all have bright futures in front of us, and to see Kamala express that anyone from anywhere can come here and become something huge is so important,” said Josiah King, a Howard senior from Boston.\n\nTrump urges supporters on social media to ‘stay in line’\n\nTrump posted a clip on his social networks asking Republican voters to “stay in line.”\n\n“We’re doing really well. If you’re in line, stay in line,” he says in the 13-second clip. “Don’t let them take you off that line.”\n\nThe clip was shared on various social networks.\n\nJudge tells polling place to quit testing its fire alarms\n\nIt’s important to regularly test one’s fire alarms.\n\nJust not at a polling place on Election Day.\n\nIn Pennsylvania’s Allegheny County, Moon Area High School — which hosts a polling place — conducted “intermittent fire alarm testing” on Tuesday, according to court documents.\n\nA county judge ordered the school to “immediately cease all inspections and testing … until all voting is completed.”\n\nCrucial races in Ohio and North Carolina\n\nPolls are closing in Ohio and North Carolina, states that could have major implications for who ends up controlling Congress.\n\nDemocrats in Ohio are defending a crucial Senate seat, currently held by Sen. Sherrod Brown, as well as three battleground House seats.\n\nRepublicans are also trying to make gains in North Carolina, where redistricting has tipped three House seats in their favor.\n\nThey could also pick up a fourth House seat in the state if Republican Laurie Buckhout can unseat incumbent Rep. Don Davis, a Democrat.\n\nTrump adviser projects confidence\n\nSenior Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is projecting confidence as polls begin to close.\n\n“He feels great,” he said of Trump, speaking at the former president’s watch party in West Palm Beach, Florida. “We are ready, when the election is called, to begin the transition to put this country back on track.”\n\nTrump’s campaign sees its easiest path to the nomination running through Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\n\n“Donald Trump has momentum,” he argued.\n\nAs for the persistent gender gap in polls, he says, “Women do not vote only on their gender … It’s a fallacy.”\n\nSenate control deadlocked\n\nDemocrats’ hope of keeping control of the Senate is hanging by a thread after the seat flip in West Virginia.\n\nTo win control of the chamber, Republicans need to pick up a seat in any one of several battleground states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Montana or Nevada.\n\nDemocrats’ best chance at flipping a seat back in their favor is likely in Texas, where Democrat Colin Allred, a current House member, is challenging Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nMAGA hats have taken over the Palm Beach County Convention Center\n\nTrump is holding a massive watch party at the convention center tonight. The former president himself will be watching the results come in at Mar-a-Lago, with family members and club members.\n\nIt’s TBD when — or even whether — Trump will decide to motorcade over to the venue.\n\nIncumbents trying to swap Georgia House districts\n\nCourt-ordered redistricting in Georgia has substantially changed both the state’s 6th and 7th House districts, and the parties could potentially trade control of the seats.\n\nAfter redistricting, the Republican-held 6th district leans toward Democrats, while the GOP believes it will gain the Democratic-controlled 7th district.\n\nEven the respective incumbents for those seats are trying to pull off the swap.\n\nRepublican Rep. Richard McCormick is running for the 6th district, and Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath, who previously represented the 6th district, is running for McCormick’s old seat.\n\nFederal cybersecurity officials say no evidence to back up claims of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania\n\nA senior official at the federal cybersecurity agency says no nationwide security problems are threatening the integrity of the elections, and is pushing back on claims of fraud in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nCait Conley, a senior adviser to the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told reporters that though officials have responded to bomb threats, disinformation and other problems, there are no major incidents with a national-level impact.\n\nAsked about claims of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania being advanced by Donald Trump and some of his supporters, Conley said federal officials had been in close contact with their state and local counterparts across the country and “we see no data or reporting to support these claims.”\n\nMultiple Pennsylvania officials, including Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, have also said they had not seen any signs of cheating and have called the election secure.\n\nPolls closing in key Virginia races\n\nAs polls close in Virginia, a pair of competitive House races could give an early hint of who is faring better in the race for House control.\n\nIn northern Virginia, Democrat Eugene Vindman and Republican Derrick Anderson, both Army veterans and lawyers, are vying for a House seat.\n\nIn the military-heavy southeast part of the state, Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans is running for reelection against a fellow Navy veteran, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal. Meanwhile in Georgia, Democrats and Republicans are poised to swap control of a pair of redistricted House districts.\n\nWhat to watch as polls are closing\n\nFlorida: First polls are about to close in much of Florida, which reports votes quickly. The first votes released will be early in-person and mailed votes. Those have tended to favor Democrats in the past, but it’s not clear that trend will hold this year. Florida adds Election Day votes soon after and counts few votes after election night, so races tend to wrap up quickly.\n\nGeorgia: Polls are about to close in the battleground state of Georgia. The first votes reported have historically included at least some cast before Election Day. We don’t know if the advance vote this year will favor Democrats as it has in the past. Voters don’t register by party in Georgia.\n\nPolls are closing soon in 6 states\n\nAt 7 p.m. EST, polls will close in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia, though some areas of Indiana and Kentucky closed at 6 p.m.\n\nAt 7:30 p.m. EST, polls will close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\nVermont’s Republican governor says he voted for Harris\n\nPhil Scott, Vermont’s Republican governor, told reporters outside his polling place that he voted for Harris over Trump, his party’s presidential candidate.\n\nScott said it was “not an easy thing to do being the Republcian sitting governor and voting against your party’s nominee,” according to video from NBC 5. But Scott said he “came to the conclusion that I had to put country over party.”\n\nScott voted for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMusk says his PAC will expand its work after Election Day\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk said his pro-Trump super PAC will continue its work after the election, focusing on the 2026 midterms as well as local prosecutorial races. Musk discussed the future of his America PAC during a live event on his social media platform X. Musk repeated his support for Trump and said that a Trump victory would reflect an electorate eager for change.\n\n“I think there’s a sea change in the country,” said Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX. “I hope I’m not wrong about that.”\n\nDetroit police patrol convention center where ballots are being counted\n\nMore than a dozen Detroit police officers were milling around late afternoon inside Huntington Place and in the area immediately outside the doors to the massive convention room where election workers were to count ballots.\n\nBarricades are up outside the room and escalators to and from the area have been shut off.\n\nEveryone entering has to go through metal detectors. Any bags they have are being checked by security.\n\nDetroit police said there were no reported issues inside or outside of Huntington Place. As of 6 p.m. EST, traffic outside the center was light with no protesters in sight.\n\n“It’s all hands on deck,” Deputy Chief Franklin Hayes told The Associated Press last month. “We have a comprehensive plan.”\n\nPennsylvania officials deny Trump’s cheating claim\n\nOfficials associated with both political parties are denying Trump’s claim of “massive cheating” in Philadelphia.\n\nOn social media, one of three Philadelphia election board members, Seth Bluestein, a Republican, said there is “absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation.” Voting in the city is “safe and secure,” he said.\n\nDemocrat Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Department of State said, “Pennsylvania counties, including Philadelphia, are running a safe and secure election.”\n\nTrump provided no details about the alleged cheating. His spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment about what he meant.\n\nMore bomb threats at Atlanta-area polling places\n\nAnother metro Atlanta county has seen voting disrupted by bomb threats. About an hour before polls were to close, officials in DeKalb County said they received bomb threats against five polling places.\n\nOfficials in the overwhelmingly Democratic suburb said voting had been suspended at those locations until police confirm there are no bombs. County officials say they’re seeking a court order to extend voting, which is routine in Georgia when a polling place is disrupted. Some polling places in Fulton and Gwinnett counties were targeted earlier Tuesday. Those threats were found to be false.\n\n“Rest assured that we are working quickly to ensure every voter will have an opportunity to cast their ballot despite these bomb threats,” DeKalb elections director Keisha Smith said in a statement.\n\nJudge blocks improper hand count at Pennsylvania polling place\n\nTrump’s allies appeared worried about turnout among men today, urging them to vote as Election Day drew to a close.\n\n“If you know any men who haven’t voted, get them to the polls,” Stephen Miller, a longtime adviser to the Republican nominee, posted on X at 5:58 p.m. EST\n\nCharlie Kirk, the leader of the conservative group Turning Point, seemed concerned earlier in the day. “Turnout is mixed and not where we want it to be,” he wrote on X. “We need more people to vote. We can’t let turnout flatline.”\n\nHe struck a more positive note at 4:11 p.m. EST “The men are arriving,” he posted. “Turnout is SURGING.”\n\nTrump allies urge men to cast their ballots\n\nTrump’s allies appeared worried about turnout among men today, urging them to vote as Election Day drew to a close.\n\n“If you know any men who haven’t voted, get them to the polls,” Stephen Miller, a longtime adviser to the Republican nominee, posted on X at 5:58 p.m.\n\nCharlie Kirk, the leader of the conservative group Turning Point, seemed concerned earlier in the day. “Turnout is mixed and not where we want it to be,” he wrote on X. “We need more people to vote. We can’t let turnout flatline.”\n\nHe struck a more positive note at 4:11 p.m. “The men are arriving,” he posted. “Turnout is SURGING.”\n\nHoward’s Black Greeks practice strolling in advance of Harris’ arrival\n\nHours before Harris arrives at Howard University, Black Greek organizations are practicing strolling, a tradition in Black Greek organizations, for her election event.\n\nBlack sororities and fraternities, known collectively as “The Divine Nine,” have been a source of strength for Harris. This year there was a surge in support from members of these groups, many of whom were excited by Harris’ historic presidential run despite being barred from endorsing candidates.\n\nThe vice president is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., which was founded at Howard University in 1908. Harris pledged as a senior at Howard in 1986.\n\nA technical glitch meant long waits in Apache County\n\nA technical glitch in ballot printers at more than a dozen polling places in Arizona’s rural Apache County meant long waits for voters.\n\n“Poll workers were encouraging people to leave and come back later in the day when the printer was fixed,” said Zane James, who voted in the community of Wheatfields after waiting 2 1/2 hours in 40-degree weather.\n\nThe printer was fixed, “but five to 10 people left and I don’t know if they are coming back,” he said.\n\nRita Vaughan, the Apache County elections director, said technicians fixed the problem after it emerged early Tuesday. She said polling places stayed open and people voted with paper ballots or accessible voting devices used by people with disabilities or language issues.\n\nThe Native vote helped push Biden over the top in Arizona in 2020. Trump drew a diverse crowd, including Navajo families from neighboring Arizona, when he visited New Mexico last week.\n\nHours at Georgia polling places extended following bomb threats\n\nVoting hours have been extended at five polling places in Georgia’s Fulton County that were briefly closed earlier in the day because of bomb threats that were determined to be noncredible.\n\nEach voting location’s hours have been extended for as long as they were closed. The extensions range from 10 minutes at one location to 45 minutes at two locations.\n\nJudge in Georgia calls Republican lawsuit ‘frivolous’\n\nA federal judge Tuesday scolded Republican Party attorneys for what he called a “frivolous” lawsuit that accused election officials in seven Georgia counties of breaking the law by letting voters hand-deliver their absentee ballots over the weekend.\n\nAn attorney for the Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party told U.S. District Court Judge R. Stan Baker he wasn’t trying to stop the 1,300 ballots from being counted but wanted them kept separate from other ballots.\n\nThe groups previously indicated they wanted the ballots as potential evidence for future litigation.\n\nThe GOP lawyers argued it was illegal for county election officials to accept mail ballots dropped off in person after early voting ended Friday.\n\nBaker said Georgia law clearly states that county election officials are required to accept absentee ballots until the polls close on Election Day.\n\nJudge declines to extend voting hours in Louisville after morning delays\n\nA judge has declined to grant a two-hour extension of voting hours in Kentucky’s most populous county after problems with electronic poll books led to delays at some precincts.\n\nElection officials in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, said delays involved loading poll books to include the 113,000 early voters who cast ballots before Election Day.\n\nAshley Tinius, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Clerk, said no voters were turned away and the electronic issues were resolved later Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Kentucky Democratic Party asked a judge to extend voting from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The party’s motion said, “Delays caused by the e-polling books crash caused some voters to leave their place in line and forego casting a ballot.”\n\n“There were numerous instances of voters unable to be checked-in and issued ballots,” the motion reads.\n\nThe state Republican Party opposed the motion, arguing that only the Kentucky General Assembly can set election times and any vote cast after 6 p.m. would be illegal.\n\n‘Human error’ forces recount of 30,000 absentee ballots in Milwaukee\n\nElection officials in Milwaukee are recounting more than 30,000 absentee ballots because doors on the ballot tabulators were not properly sealed.\n\nThe recounting was being done “out of an abundance of caution,” said Melissa Howard, spokesperson for the Milwaukee Election Commission.\n\nThere was no reason to believe that any ballots already counted had been tampered with, she said.\n\nHoward said they were taking the step of recounting all of the ballots in an effort to be “completely, fully transparent.” The problem was due to human error, she said.\n\nThe decision will delay the reporting of about 105,000 absentee ballots that could determine whether Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump win Wisconsin.\n\nA small set of polls in Indiana and Kentucky close at 6 p.m. EST\n\nPolls in a few Indiana districts across the state and polls on the eastern side of Kentucky are the first to close in the nation.\n\nThe first large poll closing comes at 7 p.m. EST. That closure includes most of Florida, all of Georgia and Virginia, among others.\n\nPennsylvania county goes to court to block improper hand count\n\nFayette County has gone to court to block a local judge of elections from doing a unilateral hand count of ballots in violation of the state’s election code.\n\nMarybeth Kuznik, director of the Fayette County Bureau of Elections, says in a court filing that Washington Township Judge of Election Vincent Manetta “reported that after polls close today, he intends to remove the ballots from the ballot box and audit or hand count the votes cast for each presidential candidate.”\n\nCompleted ballots are supposed to be run through tabulating equipment.\n\nKuznik asked a judge to order Manetta to comply with state election law. The judge has yet to rule.\n\nA white substance was found on a ballot envelope in Salt Lake County, Utah\n\nThe envelope was sequestered, tested and found to not be harmful, according to police. Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who oversees elections statewide, commended the county clerk and her employees for acting swiftly to ensure the safety of those in the area.\n\n“This incident will be fully investigated. Anyone attempting to intimidate election workers or disrupt election administration in any way can expect to face criminal charges,” Henderson said.\n\nGeorgia voting sites receive bomb threats\n\nBomb threats to Georgia voting sites were made over the internet and included Cyrillic letters, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said. That gave election officials a clue about the origins of the threats, he said at an early evening briefing in Atlanta.\n\n“We jumped on it quickly and then the FBI then followed our lead,” he said. He said that once the FBI released a statement about the matter earlier Tuesday, the threats “kind of tapered off.”\n\nHe said of the culprits: “I guess they realized that dog won’t hunt today in Georgia.”\n\nSenior Harris campaign official says the VP has an advantage with late deciders\n\nHarris senior campaign adviser Stephanie Cutter said in an MSNBC appearance that the vice president stayed focused in the final weeks of the campaign on how she aims to “make your life better” while Trump seemed consumed by grievances.\n\nIndeed, Trump in the final stretch remarked that he wouldn’t mind if an assassin had to “shoot through the fake news” to get to him. He raised eyebrows by vowing to protect women “whether the women like it or not.” And his campaign had to clean up after a comedian warming up the crowd at Madison Square Garden rally referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”\n\n“I’m not going to make any predictions,” Cutter said.” “But I do think that we finished very strong. And if you were making your decision in the last couple weeks of this campaign, I think, you know, by significant margins, people were deciding for Vice President Harris.”\n\nEmpire State Building lights will mark swing state winners as results roll in\n\nThe lights on the Manhattan icon will change color every time The Associated Press declares a victor in one of the decisive swing states, according to a post on its official account on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe 103-floor skyscraper’s tower lights will shine blue for five minutes if Harris claims one of the battlegrounds and shine red for five minutes if Trump wins one.\n\nWhen one of the candidates reaches the winning threshold of 270 electoral votes, the Art Deco landmark will again be lit up to correspond to the victorious political party: red for Republican Trump or blue for Democrat Harris.\n\nBarring a major surprise, the seven states where the race for the White House will likely be decided are Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nRudy Giuliani seen in a Mercedes similar to the one he was ordered to turn over\n\nRudy Giuliani was not shy as he drove up to a polling station in Palm Beach, Florida, in a blue Mercedes that appeared to be the one a federal judge ordered him to turn over to the two Georgia election workers who won a defamation lawsuit against the former mayor of New York.\n\nSitting in the passenger seat of what appears to be a 1980 Mercedes-Benz 500SL, Giuliani smiled and waved to supporters and photographers at the polling place where Trump cast his ballot as he tried to reclaim the presidency.\n\nIt could not be immediately confirmed if Giuliani was riding in the same car he was supposed to turn over. The judge gave the staunch Trump supporter until October 29 to do so. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman has ordered Giuliani to appear in a New York courtroom on Thursday to explain why he missed a deadline.\n\n“Our lawyers have requested documentation to transfer over the title of the vehicle, and haven’t heard back from opposing counsel,” said Giuliani spokesman Ted Goodman.\n\nDoug Emhoff’s ex-wife casts ballot for Harris\n\nKerstin Emhoff, second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s ex-wife, posted a video casting a vote for Harris.\n\n“I’ve been so moved by watching emotional videos posted by people after voting for Kamala & Tim,” she wrote. “Voting for our daughters, wives, sisters, from red and blue states. This is that moment. I proudly cast my vote for my friend and family Kamala Harris!”\n\nKerstin Emhoff has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign, including attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nResults for 2 North Carolina counties delayed briefly as precincts close later\n\nTwo counties in battleground North Carolina will delay turning in their results by 30 minutes after the State Board of Elections agreed to extend the close of voting at two precincts due to technical problems there on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe board voted to push the closing time at one precinct in Burke County and another precinct in Wilson County to 8 p.m.\n\nAccording to election officials, likely voters at the Wilson County precinct were unable to cast ballots for almost an hour and a half because a printer needed to generate voter authorization forms wasn’t working. And in Burke County, people couldn’t vote for potentially 30 or 40 minutes when a precinct laptop computer with the official pollbook had a problem.\n\nThe state board won’t publish unofficial results from Burke and Wilson counties until voting ends at the precincts. Results in the state’s other 98 counties can be reported at the normal closing time.\n\nJacksonville voters briefly diverted after suspicious package found in polling place\n\nVoters arriving at a polling place in Jacksonville, Florida, were diverted to another voting location for a short time Tuesday after a suspicious package was found outside.\n\nSupervisor of Elections Jerry Holland said in an email that about 20 voters were sent to other locations for about 40 minutes before operations at the polling place resumed. The package ended up being the personal belongings of a homeless person, he said.\n\nDenver-area authorities look into ballot issues at adult day care facility\n\nAuthorities in the Denver area are investigating after election officials discovered “discrepancies” with signatures on several mail ballots sent from an adult day care facility in the city.\n\nThat’s according to Denver clerk and recorder Paul Lopez in a statement.\n\nElection workers in Colorado check the signatures on mail ballots against voter signatures on file to make sure they’re submitted by the voter the ballot was sent to. Lopez said his office notified law enforcement and the Denver district attorney’s office was investigating. He also said law enforcement in nearby counties were also investigating but did not explain why.\n\nDenver’s KMGH-TV, which first reported the investigation, said ballots from the facility were sent to six counties.\n\nColorado overwhelmingly votes by mail.\n\nVoting machines malfunction in central Iowa county\n\nIn Central Iowa’s Story County, home to about 100,000 people and the city of Ames, voting machines at some precincts malfunctioned, portending possible delays to reporting results.\n\n“We are aware of technical issues regarding tabulators in some precincts in Story County,” said Ashley Hunt Esquivel, a spokesperson for Iowa Secretary of State’s Office. “The auditor is working with the vendor and our office to resolve it. It is not stopping anyone from casting a single ballot. It may impact how quickly we can report results.”\n\nStory County Auditor Lucy Martin told the Des Moines Register that machines did not read “certain ballot styles” at about 12 of the county’s 45 polling locations. Election workers would have to count ballots at those locations by hand, according to local Democratic and Republican Party officials. The machines were tested and the cause of the technical difficulties was unknown, Martin added.\n\nHarris urges North Carolinians who haven’t voted to get going\n\n“The path to the White House runs through North Carolina,” Harris said in an interview on Raleigh’s Foxy 107.1. “And it’s a tight race. We are tied. Every vote matters.”\n\nHarris told host Karen Clark she plans to work the phones until polls close to get out every vote she can.\n\n“This is about turning the page and bringing in a new generation of leadership for America,” Harris said.\n\nHarris visits Democratic National Committee phone bank in Washington on Election Day\n\nKamala Harris used her visit to a phone bank hosted by the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday to both thank the supporters working to turn out the vote and make calls herself.\n\n“This truly represents the best of who we are,” Harris told the supporters making calls at the phone bank. She was then handed a cell phone and joined in the phone bank.\n\n“I am well,” Harris told the person. “Have you voted already?”\n\nThe person responded, to which Harris said, “You did? Thank you.”\n\nIn Richmond, Virginia, Electoral Board removes precinct chief over complaints\n\nIn Richmond, Virginia, the local Electoral Board held an emergency meeting to remove a precinct chief.\n\nBoard Chair Starlet Stevens said in a telephone interview that 11 voters were given ballots that only had the presidential race and not local races.\n\nBecause they cast the ballots, they were unable to redo their votes with the correct ballots.\n\nStevens said the Board voted to remove the precinct chief not for the error but because the chief was being “disrespectful.”\n\nThe Board also received a complaint that the precinct chief refused to help a person who wanted to vote curbside, something that Virginia law allows for anyone 65 and older or physically disabled.\n\nElection stressed? Here’s what some experts recommend\n\nThree out of four American adults believe this election is vital for the future of democracy. They believe that the stakes are high — and for some, so are their stress levels.\n\nBut there’s more you can do than doomscroll and hold your breath between news alerts.\n\nSome experts advise using meditation and mindfulness to ease their stress. Headspace, a mental health company and app, has a whole series of guided meditations called its “politics without panic” collection.\n\nIt’s also important to be mindful of news intake and social media use and vetting news sources to ensure you’re not consuming inflammatory misinformation. Experts said “self-care” is critical, too, including eating well, exercising and getting enough sleep.\n\nChurches also are drawing on meditation and breathing practices to help their congregants.\n\nAt an Episcopal church in Pennsylvania’s heartland, the Rev. David Peck has led a weekly gathering called “Contemplative Citizenship,” which guides apply ancient techniques of prayer and meditation that enable people to respond to conflict more deliberately\n\n‘My faith in this country has been so restored,’ Walz says of 2024 experience\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Tuesday that his experience as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate “restored” his faith in the nation.\n\n“This is truly a remarkable thing we do every four years,” he said in a conversation with reporters outside his campaign plane. “It’s democracy. It’s messy. It’s beautiful. It’s the people.”\n\n“My faith in this country has been so restored,” he added.\n\nWalz said he had not talked with Harris on Election Day but projected confidence that they would prevail over former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I just can’t describe the difference in the vibe that is out there with folks and how hungry they are for something different,” he said\n\nFor funny man Ken Jeong, this Election Day is serious\n\nKen Jeong is funny. But not on Election Day. Today, he’s serious.\n\nThe actor and comedian (who also is a doctor) was working the phone banks to support Harris, calling voters to make last-minute pushes in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\n“It’s been quite inspiring,” Jeong said. “I’ve never been on something like this on such a grand scale.”\n\nJeong said most of the people he called didn’t know who he was, but he randomly connected with a man in Michigan who had attended one of his standup shows.\n\nAnd some of the people he called didn’t agree with him politically, which Jeong had no problem with.\n\n“Even on these phone calls and phone banking, I listen to opinions that are completely different from mine,” Jeong said. “And I don’t discount anybody.”\n\nDo you want more Steve Kornacki? Peacock has you covered tonight\n\nComing around 6 p.m. Eastern: Kornacki Cam.\n\nThe super-popular NBC News National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki will be part of a multiview experience put together by Peacock and is expected to last until around 2 a.m.\n\nAlso part of the multiview (basically, some of the same technology NBC utilized during the Paris Olympics) is a live stream of NBC News coverage and analysis, projected Electoral College results — and lots and lots of Kornacki, who’ll be at his big board to break down all the numbers.\n\n“We’re caffeinating and hydrating him. We’re making sure he’s eating,” NBC’s Craig Melvin wrote on X. ”@SteveKornacki, the national treasure, is rested and eager for his quadrennial Super Bowl.”\n\nNatural gas leak prompts the closure of a polling place outside Detroit\n\nOfficials in Northville, Michigan, closed a polling place at midday and sent voters to another precinct in the Detroit suburb because of a natural gas leak. Consumers Energy was investigating the leak.","summary":"Election Day is here.

This figure excludes spending on cable or streaming ads, meaning the total amount Republicans have spent on anti-trans ads is likely even higher.\n\n“Attacking our community was without a doubt their #1 ad priority,” Montana state Representative Zooey Zephyr (D) wrote on X. “Today, the American people get the opportunity to rebuke that hate.”\n\nThere are an estimated 1.6 million transgender people over the age of 13 in the U.S. While trans people only represent around 1 percent of the U.S. population, this community has been increasingly targeted by the right in recent years.\n\n“That’s $134 per trans person in anti-trans ad spending. To say that this assault on our community has been disproportionate is an understatement,” Alejandra Caraballo, clinical instructor at Harvard Law Cyberlaw Clinic, said on X. \n\nAlthough voters say transgender issues are among the least important factors driving them to the polls, trans activists argue that Republicans are relying on anti-trans rhetoric to rally their base. In fact, according to transgender journalist Erin Reed, Donald Trump has spent more money on anti-trans ads than on ads concerning housing, immigration, and the economy combined. \n\n“It’s been the biggest type of ad run by far by Republicans. This is their closing message,” Reed said on X. \n\nOne of the top ads pushed by the Trump campaign in October attacked Kamala Harris for supporting “taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,” regarding her previous statements concerning access to gender-affirming care for incarcerated or detained people.\n\n“I think that this is a classic fear campaign,” Reed told PBS News earlier this month. “[T]he purpose of a fear campaign is to distract you from issues that you normally care about by making you so afraid of a group of people, of somebody like me, for instance, that you’re willing to throw everything else away because you’re scared.”\n\nThis anti-trans ad campaign is part of a broader strategy reflected in Trump’s political platform, Agenda 47, which is filled with anti-trans policies that include a ban on trans people’s participation in women’s sports, a prohibition on federal or state funding for gender-affirming care, and other related measures.\n\n“Anti-trans politicians keep recycling baseless rhetoric against the trans community, spending over $200 million dollars – money that could instead be invested into real issues like underfunded schools & rising living costs,” West Virginian trans activist Ash Orr said on X.\n\nIn addition to the anti-trans rhetoric promoted by the Trump campaign, groups like the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, have spent large sums on anti-trans ads with the aim of securing GOP victories in Senate races in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. However, trans activists argue that the anti-trans rhetoric used in this election could backfire, just as it did in the 2022 midterms. \n\n“If Republicans lose after spending nearly a quarter billion dollars on anti-trans ads, it will prove once and for all that trans rights do not mobilize voters,” trans activist Allison Chapman told Truthout. “Then, if we are lucky, maybe we will get to go back to just being seen as people and not as our genitalia or genetic makeup.”","summary":"“That's $134 per trans person in anti-trans ad spending,” civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo said.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/republicans-spent-nearly-215m-on-tv-ads-attacking-trans-rights-this-election/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2024/11/gettyimages-2168147168-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:06:56","author":"Zane McNeill","authors":["Zane McNeill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":262948658,"title":"Sabrina Carpenter engaged 260K voters — more than any other artist — ahead of 2024 presidential election","text":"Sabrina Carpenter asked her fans to please, please, please do their civic duty.\n\nThe pop sensation engaged over 260,000 voters and registered more than 35,000 new voters ahead of the 2024 presidential election, per a report from Variety on Tuesday.\n\nThe “Espresso” songstress successfully partnered with the nonpartisan organization HeadCount to break the record for voter engagement set by Ariana Grande in 2019 during her “Sweetener” world tour.\n\nCarpenter, 25, got fans involved through giveaways, in-person activations and video boards on her “Short n’ Sweet” arena tour.\n\nA sweepstakes — which has since come to an end — included a chance to be flown out to the “Taste” singer’s concert in San Francisco on Nov. 9.\n\nIn order to enter, hopefuls had to check their voter registration status, per Variety.\n\nPrior to the “Short n’ Sweet” tour, Carpenter also teamed up with HeadCount to send two fans to watch her perform at the 2024 Governors Ball Music Festival in June.\n\nThat contest alone resulted in over 40,000 fans checking their voter registration overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, Green Day’s “Saviors” tour also broke a record by registering over 7,900 new voters and engaging over 61,000 voters through in-person activations, according to the outlet.\n\nCarpenter continued to use her influence on Election Day Tuesday as she took to her Instagram Story to encourage fans to vote.\n\n“Please Please Please Vote Today!

His other resort nearby, Trump National Doral Miamis is worth around $US273m.\n\nMORE: ‘Missing’ socialite’s home sold for $21m\n\nTrump also owns three homes in Palm Beach Florida, worth a combined US$86m.\n\nA big lover of golf, Trump has invested heavily in the game and owns 10 courses in six US stats worth around US$342m and two golf resorts in Scotland and another in Ireland worth a combined value of around $US100m.\n\nIt’s in New York City, where Trump first made his name as a real estate developer and he continues to hold a considerable amount of his wealth there.\n\nThat includes the US$1.8bn 1290 Avenue of the Americans of which Trump owns a 30 per cent stake worth around $US248m.\n\nHe also owns 30 per cent of the US$1.6bn, 555 California St, all of Trump Park Avenue which is worth an estimated US$105m and all of Trump Tower which is valued at around US$161m.\n\nThe Republican leader also owns the leasehold of 40 Wall St, worth US$168m through to 2059.\n\nMORE: Experts warn: Don’t buy in these Aussie suburbs\n\nHis New York residence, the 11,000 square foot Trump Tower Penthouse is worth US$50m.\n\nHe also owns 50 per cent of Trump International Las Vegas which is valued at around US$122m.\n\nHarris’s real estate worth is much less, although compared to the average Aussie or American her property assets are still considerable.\n\nVice President Harris achieved millionaire status despite working as a public servant and it’s thanks to a massive investment portfolio and property she owns with her husband, Doug Emhoff.\n\nThe US Sun reports, the couple’s net worth is estimated to be about $US8 million ($A12.13m) and they own property in California with some high-profile neighbours.\n\nEmhoff, 59, initially took out a $US2.7 million loan for a Brentwood, California, estate in 2012. He transferred the four-bedroom, five-bathroom home with a private pool into a joint trust after marrying Harris in 2014, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMORE: ‘Quitter’s bunker’ Joe Biden is now calling home\n\nThe 325 sqm Brentwood house is located 10 minutes from the highly popular Getty Center Museum, as well as the Will Rogers State Historic Park.\n\nAccording to the unit’s property profile, the single-family home was built in 1948. Information about the home has been kept under wraps as the vice president is understood to still own the place despite living in Washington DC as part of her duties as vice president.\n\nHarris and Emhoff are not the only big names to call Brentwood home. The second family is reportedly neighbours with high-profile celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Gisele Bündchen, Dr. Dre, and LeBron James.\n\nFormer president Richard Nixon had property in Brentwood before being elected to the presidency. While working in DC, Harris and her husband live at the Naval Observatory, the official residence of the vice president and their family.\n\nMORE: Ronaldo’s mansion to be ‘most expensive ever’\n\nShe and her husband are understood to have owned several other properties, including a $US1.775 million two-bedroom condo in Washington DC and a condo in San Francisco, which cost Harris half a million dollars in 2004.\n\nHarris sold her DC condo in 2021 for a whopping $1.85 million, per Architectural Digest.\n\nIn 2021, the one-bedroom apartment Harris maintained in San Francisco was put on the market and sold ten days later for almost $800,000, Daily Mail reported.\n\nMost of Harris’ wealth came after she married Emhoff in 2014, according to documents disclosed by Harris during her run for president in 2020. Her net worth significantly increased when she and Emhoff, who was an entertainment lawyer at the time, combined assets.\n\nPrior to that, most of the money Harris made came from being the San Francisco district attorney and later, California’s attorney general.\n\nRELATED: ‘Nonsense’ – Biden’s bizarre scheme to pay off his house\n\nFinance documents stated Emhoff made $US1 million per year and held dozens of investments and stocks in various companies such as Home Depot, St. Jude Medical, Comcast, and American Express, reports ABC News.\n\nShortly after Harris announced her decision to run for the Senate in 2015, Emhoff got rid of much of the stock he owned.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, saw another significant bump in assets via a $US300,000 advance payment for her memoir, The Truths We Hold\n\nIn 2018, Harris and Emhoff reported a gross joint income of $US1,889,156, per a tax return.\n\nBefore Harris took over as vice president, Emhoff announced he would be leaving his law firm and took up a job at Georgetown University’s law school, where he reportedly makes $US200,000.\n\nMORE: Soaring rents force Aussies to flee major cities\n\nINSIDE THEIR INVESTMENTS\n\nThe WSJ reported that the couple made $US450,299 together in 2023, according to a jointly filed tax return, and that they have assets ranging up to $US7.36 million. Financial advisors said that most of the couple’s wealth is in their retirement funds. They have between $US1.79 million and $US4.4 million in their retirement accounts.\n\nLast year, they gave $US23,026 to charity. Their largest gifts went to Howard University and two colleges in California. They also contributed to non-profit and religious organisations. The couple has $US850,000 to $US1.7 million across four bank accounts, according to WSJ.\n\nOne of their joint bank accounts has a balance of $US50,001 to $US100,000. The Journal reports that Harris and Emhoff’s portfolio is “conservatively allocated,” with about half of their money in stocks, a third of it in cash, and the rest in bonds.","url":"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/real-estate/national/celebrity/trump-dwarfs-harris-by-15bn-in-hidden-battle/news-story/e034106a6209077af53635aa56f173c2","image":"https://www.realestate.com.au/news-image/w_1024,h_768/v1726006813/news-lifestyle-content-assets/wp-content/production/capi_e034106a6209077af53635aa56f173c2_f8cd3967e2ba833503aa76af2084732e.jpeg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:05:36","author":"James Macsmith","authors":["James Macsmith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.022},{"id":262948306,"title":"Wild Reason Taylor Swift Is Being Slammed","text":"The 34-year-old singer was seen cheering in the stands alongside her mum as her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his team, the Chiefs, played against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe game coincided with Kamala Harris’ final rally for the US election, a star-studded affair with the likes of Lady Gaga and Katy Perry performing to show their support.\n\nSo when Swift failed to make an appearence, New York-based magazine site The Cut published a piece with the headline, “Taylor Swift chose football over Kamala Harris”.\n\nThe caption called Swift out for being at the game with her “Trump-y friends, the Mahomes” instead of campaigning for the Democratic candidate the day before the election. \n\nThe article on The Cut by Olivia Craighead and Danielle Cohen outlined their disappointment that she wasn’t being more political. \n\nFollow our live US election coverage here.\n\nMORE: Strange truth of Trump’s election home base\n\nThe article argued that her appearance at the Harris rally, held in the key swing state of Pennsylvania would have made “perfect sense” because she was on a break from The Eras tour. \n\n“If anyone could sway the white women of Bucks County to vote for Harris, it’s Swift. There’s no doubt in my mind that the Harris campaign tried their damndest to get her there, too,” the writers claimed. \n\nThe article also pointed out that instead of being at the rally, she spent the game cheering alongside Patrick Mahome’s wife, who fans have long speculated is a Trump supporter. \n\nThe writers also criticised Swift because she wore no Harris or Democratic merchandise when she attended the game. \n\nBut fans online weren’t impressed with the criticism of Swift, who has already endorsed Ms Harris publically online. \n\nMORE: Aussie idea could gift Kamala the presidency\n\n“Her post endorsing Kamala has over 11 million likes. She posted yesterday reminding fans to vote. I think she’s allowed a few hours to enjoy herself and support her partner,” one wrote.\n\n“Are you going to call out male artists who didn’t show up for Kamala yesterday as well? Or does only Taylor get the hate?”, another asked. \n\n“This is actually the most dangerous post I have seen so far. To tear down this self-made American woman and try and distort her reality is sick,” one argued. \n\n“She already publicly endorsed a candidate. Why are you trying to make people mad?”, another asked. \n\n“Bullying and shaming women just never ends, does it,” someone said. \n\n“There’s still time to delete this post,” another noted. \n\nSwift, who has more than 200 million followers on Instagram, already endorsed Ms Harris on social media. \n\nShe wrote that she was voting for Ms Harris because she believes she’s “fighting for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior and champion for them”, explaining that she’d done her research and was certain of her decision. \n\nSwift signed off on the endorsement as a “childless cat lady,” a jab at JD Vance, whose 2021 comments about female Democrats went viral after he was announced as Trump’s vice president pick. \n\nIn an interview with Tucker Carlson, Mr Vance complained that America was being run by Democrats and “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.”\n\nSwift offering her endorsement is a big deal. She’s arguably the most famous woman in the world, and she didn’t speak about politics until 2018.\n\nThe singer, who didn’t discuss politics in 2016 when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were running for president, broke her political silence in 2018. \n\nShe took to social media to call out Tennessee Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn and reveal why she’d be voting for Democratic candidates Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.\n\nShe wrote that she’d always been “reluctant” to discuss politics but felt differently about that now. \n\nIn the 2020 documentary Miss Americana, Swift was seen arguing with her team, and even her own dad, about her decision to talk politics. \n\nWhile her team argued that discussing politics was risky and could ultimately be a safety risk for Swift or even half her audience, the singer stood up to them. \n\n“I need to be on the right side of history. Dad, I need you to forgive me for doing it, because I’m doing it,” she said. \n\nOriginally published as Wild reason Taylor Swift is being slammed","url":"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/wild-reason-taylor-swift-is-being-slammed/news-story/70a4a3adcc7035de6e0d5666f059b6d7?expand_comments=true","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f6e89f2d7d4e469d4470cc5c93adcffc","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:05:36","author":"Mary Madigan","authors":["Mary Madigan"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":262948304,"title":"The Showdown New Polls Reveal State Of Election Race Between Donald Trump And Kamala Harris","text":"Weekend Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Weekend Paper Delivery \n + Full Digital Access \n \n Features\n \n \n \n \n $10/ WEEK \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n $10/ WEEK \n \n ($40 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks.* \n \n \n ($40 min. cost) charged every 4 weeks.* \n *Read the fine print\n \n \n \n THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW\n \n Full Digital Access + Weekend Paper Delivery $40 charged every 4 weeks.

Andy Kim easily won Tuesday’s election to become New Jersey’s newest member of the U.S. Senate, claiming the open seat that once belonged to the disgraced Robert Menendez — and punctuating a dramatic campaign that upended the state’s party-boss power structure.\n\nKim, a three-term congressman and former Rhodes Scholar who stunningly outlasted the state’s first lady for his party’s nomination and led a successful lawsuit to strike down a controversial primary ballot system, defeated Republican Curtis Bashaw in the general election.\n\nHe will become the first Asian American senator from New Jersey and the first U.S. senator of Korean descent from any state.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 8 p.m., just as polls closed.\n\nThe 42-year-old won the seat Menendez, a fellow Democrat, had held since 2006 but vacated when he resigned in August after being convicted of federal corruption charges, including that he accepted gold bars as a bribe.\n\nHis victory continues a half-century winning streak for Democrats, who haven’t lost a U.S. Senate race in the Garden State since 1972 — when Richard Nixon was still president and the Yankees had only 20 of their 27 World Series titles.\n\nThis race came in a big year as Democrats aimed to keep their razor-thin control of the Senate — Congress’ upper house — in a big presidential election year and in the wake of the shocking charges against Menendez.\n\nBoth Kim and Bashaw, a wealthy hotel developer and first-time candidate, were promising to restore integrity to the seat after the scandal.\n\nThe 64-year-old Bashaw, who defeated a challenger endorsed by former President Donald Trump in the party’s primary, was an atypical Republican candidate in today’s age: a married gay man who pitched himself as a pro-choice moderate. He was vying to become New Jersey’s first openly gay member of Congress. The party felt this race was their best chance in years to end their decades of losing in the blue state.\n\nBut Kim had built momentum in a head-spinning Democratic primary. A congressman representing central and south Jersey’s 3rd District, Kim jumped into the race the day after Menendez was indicted and stay in even after First Lady Tammy Murphy, the wife of Gov. Phil Murphy, won the endorsement from several of the state’s top Democrats.\n\nKim also sued in an attempt to end the “county line,” a decades-old — and long-debated — system in which candidates endorsed by powerful county party leaders receive top placement on the primary ballot. Murphy stood to benefit the most from the system, which led to backlash from critics who said she was being bolstered by nepotism and her husband’s power — charges the Murphys denied.\n\nBolstered by a wave of progressive support, Kim beat Murphy at most county party conventions where secret ballots were held. Murphy won most of the public votes.\n\nMurphy ultimately dropped out, saying she didn’t want to wage a big battle against a fellow Democrat in a big year. Then, a judge sided with Kim in his suit, declaring the ballot setup unconstitutional and jolting the state’s political universe. Kim later easily won the party’s nomination despite some of the party bosses privately remaining upset with him.\n\nThe general election was also intriguing, with Kim and Bashaw clashing over abortion and immigration though never with the vitriol seen in other races.\n\nNotably, Bashaw said he supported passing a federal law to allow abortion rights in all 50 states, but Kim noted Bashaw also praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe vs. Wade.\n\nBashaw had to navigate a tough challenge: balancing Trump in deep-blue Jersey. He beat Mendham Mayor Christine Serrano Glassner, a Trump-endorsed Trump loyalist, to win the GOP nomination. But while Bashaw said he would vote for the former president and Republican presidential nominee, he also distanced himself from Trump as he courted independent and unaffiliated voters that are critical for a GOP contender to win a statewide race here.\n\nKim ultimately led in fundraising and public polling, even though many voters said they didn’t know much about either candidate.\n\nMenendez had launched an independent bid to keep his seat but dropped it after his conviction.\n\nThanks to Tuesday’s win, Kim, will be New Jersey’s first new senator since Cory Booker — now the state’s senior senator — was elected in 2013. A Moorestown resident, Kim will also become the first U.S. senator from South Jersey since 1955.\n\nHe won’t have to wait until January to be sworn in. After Menendez resigned, Gov. Murphy named his former chief of staff, George Helmy, to temporarily hold the seat until the outcome of this race. He promised to appoint the winner after the election is certified.\n\nThat means Kim could take office this year, giving him seniority over his fellow freshman senators who won’t be sworn in until January.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.

Of those voters, 53 per cent were women, 44 per cent men and 3 per cent other.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Expert reveals next steps if the election is a tie.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today \n\nAll eyes will be on swing states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nFormer CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza joined Nat Barr on Sunrise on Monday, and explained what process will unfold if the two candidates end up drawing.\n\nSurprisingly, the experienced political commentator said it was possible for both candidates to collect 269 electoral votes, which would make it a contingent election in which the US House of Representatives decides the outcome.\n\nWhichever candidate receives 26 votes or more in a House vote would become president while a US Senate vote would choose the vice president.\n\nElectoral votes refer to the US Electoral College, which is the system whereby individual states have a number of votes to choose the next president, based upon their own residents’ choice.\n\nIt means states with larger populations cannot consistently choose the presidency through the weight of numbers.\n\nAnd Cillizza said a draw was entirely possible.\n\n“Someone’s got to win. It’s not going to be a tie?” Barr asked.\n\n“It could be, I don’t think it will be but there is a scenario by which you have 269 electoral votes for Harris, 269 for Trump — it would go to the building right back there (the US Capitol),” Cillizza said.\n\n“It could go to the where the House decides — it’s never happened before, I don’t think it will happen. It will be close, probably the closest we have had since Bush v Gore (the 2000 US election). It could be that close.”\n\nAfter much polling, the candidates remain almost tied, with support for the pair split along gender lines.\n\n“She’s got more women and he’s got more men. Women are more likely to vote and women are more likely to be Democrats. Does that mean anything?” Barr asked.\n\n“What I would say is that women have made up a majority of the American electorate in every presidential election since 1994, with expectations for them to be again,” Cillizza said.\n\n“It won’t be 57 per cent women and 43 per cent men. It will probably be 48 per cent men and 52 per cent women. The converse is also true, if Donald Trump wins men by more than Kamala Harris wins women, he will probably win and vice versa.\n\n“It is a simplistic way to look at it ... Kamala Harris is going to win women, but the question is does she win more women than Donald Trump is going to win men.”\n\nCillizza believed the result would be in by Saturday.\n\n“In 2020, it wasn’t that close, it was that Saturday. It was because they called Pence on November 7. I think it might be Saturday again. Watch Pennsylvania (one of the swing states).”\n\nFinally, Cillizza said he believed the Harris campaign had the momentum.\n\n“I think (Trump’s) last 12 days, starting with the rally at Madison Square Garden, and his comments ‘I am going to protect women whether they want it or not’, (about) Liz Cheney and calling Kamala Harris ‘trash’ on Monday night.\n\n“It is not where you want to finish a campaign, particularly where women are the swing vote. People who voted for Nikki Haley in the primary, who do they choose?\n\n“They are Republicans on issues like immigration and the economy, but they don’t like Donald Trump.

mean for the broader region.\n\nThe status quo would remain for the alliance between the two countries regardless of whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris wins, former Australian ambassador to the US Arthur Sinodinos said.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: 7NEWS’ exclusive guide to the US Election\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today \n\nHowever, a new president could affect how other nations interact with Australia due to the foreign policies of the incoming administration.\n\n“The question is whether the relationship between the US and partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are impacted,” he told AAP.\n\n“The question is on how other relationships between America and other allies play out.”\n\nBoth presidential candidates spent the final full day of campaigning rallying supporters in key battleground states, with polls showing the contest on a knife’s edge.\n\nWhile there had been concern about the fate of the AUKUS submarine deal after President Joe Biden left office, Sinodinos said the multibillion-dollar partnership would remain intact.\n\n“There are question marks going forward, if there was a Trump presidency he might want more assurances with the industrial bases ... but that’s speculation,” he said.\n\n“The bedrock is that AUKUS is supported by both sides of politics.”\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong said the federal government would work closely with either administration.\n\n“We will work with whoever voters choose for president and also the Congress of the day in Australia’s interest to strengthen the alliance,” she told reporters in Canberra.\n\n“Historically, we’ve had an alliance for many, many years and this relationship is bigger than the events of the day.”\n\n‘Extremely discombobulating’\n\nAfter rioters stormed the US Capitol trying to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, opposition foreign spokesperson Simon Birmingham said he hoped there would not be unrest following the 2024 poll.\n\n“We hope to see an election outcome that is respected by all sides, and that does see a peaceful transition of power from President Biden to either a new President Harris or a returned President Trump,” he told Sky

But the US has seen enormous tests and strain before.”\n\nSinodinos said there was uncertainty in Washington, with security preparations in the event of unrest following the election outcome.\n\n“The best advice is to hope for the best and prepare for the worst, and that’s what’s happening in DC,” he said.\n\n“We didn’t think that January 6 would happen, but it did.”\n\nHarris is vying to be the first woman president, while if Trump wins he will be the first in more than 130 years to serve non-consecutive terms in the White House.\n\nIt would be “extremely discombobulating for us allies around the world” if Trump regains the presidency, Lowy Institute director Michael Fullilove said.\n\n“Mr Trump is profoundly sceptical of alliances, he has a weird affinity for strongmen,” he told AAP.\n\n“It’s all personal and it’s all transactional so that affects the reliability the rest of the world associates with the US.”\n\nSinodinos said there was a precedent for what a second Trump term would look like.\n\n“You can look at his first term for lessons on how he would conduct himself, but the question is whether other people are trying to influence him or whether it’s his own instinct and to what extent he’ll take a transaction approach,” he said.","url":"https://7news.com.au/news/2024-us-election-result-a-bigger-picture-for-australian-ties-c-16638240","image":"https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-16638240/a85b686eea3d865777cda5fb577c8f3cae60b013-16x9-x0y0w2000h1125.png?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:03:34","author":"Andrew Brown","authors":["Andrew Brown"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.071},{"id":262947838,"title":"US Election 2024: Donald Trump Posts Video Message, Says 'Stay In Line' | Watch","text":"Former US president Donald Trump on Tuesday posted a video message to social media urging Republicans to stay in line to vote as his campaign seeks to boost turnout in the final hours.\n“Hi, Republicans.

The poll showed 73% of voters believed democracy was in jeopardy against 25% who said it was secure.\n‘CHEATING’ in Philadelphia\nHours before polls closed, Trump claimed on his Truth Social site without evidence that there was “a lot of talk about massive CHEATING” in Philadelphia, echoing his false claims in 2020 that fraud had occurred in large, Democratic-dominated cities. In a subsequent post, he also asserted there was fraud in Detroit.\n“I don’t respond to nonsense,” Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey told Reuters. A Philadelphia city commissioner, Seth Bluestein, replied on X, “There is absolutely no truth to this allegation. It is yet another example of disinformation. Voting in Philadelphia has been safe and secure.”\nTrump, whose supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after he claimed the 2020 election was rigged, voted earlier near his home in Palm Beach, Florida. “If I lose an election, if it’s a fair election, I’m gonna be the first one to acknowledge it,” Trump told reporters.\nMillions of Americans\nMillions of Americans waited in orderly lines to cast ballots, with only sporadic disruptions reported across a handful of states, including several non-credible bomb threats that the FBI said appeared to originate from Russian email domains.\nTrump planned to watch the results at his Mar-a-Lago club before speaking to supporters at a nearby convention center, according to sources familiar with the planning. Harris, who had previously mailed her ballot to her home state of California, spent some of Tuesday in radio interviews encouraging listeners to vote.\nHarris, 60, the first female vice president, would become the first woman, Black woman and South Asian American to win the presidency. Trump, 78, the only president to be impeached twice and the first former president to be criminally convicted, would also become the first president to win non-consecutive terms in more than a century.\nControl of both chambers of Congress is also up for grabs.

The winners were reportedly randomly selected among those who signed a petition pledging support for free speech and gun rights.\n\nThe offer was limited to registered voters in one of seven states that will likely decide the outcome of the Nov. 5 election - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk awarded Kristine Fishell with a $1 million check during the town hall at the Roxain Theater on October 20, 2024 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Justice Department warned Musk and his America PAC last month that the sweepstakes may violate federal law, which prohibits paying people to register to vote. \n\nHe has also appeared on stage with Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania and hosted a series of town halls on his own in the eastern state, seen as critical in today's election. \n\nRepublicansFloridaPennsylvaniaElon Musk\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nElon Musk to join Trump in Florida for star-studded election night party - giving Republican candidate direct access to owner of X and its hundreds of millions of users\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The billionaire entrepreneur and owner of social media platform X has spent a whopping $119 million on his pro-Trump political action committee, America PAC, during this election.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14046097/Elon-Musk-Trump-Florida-election-night-party.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/06/00/91724167-0-image-m-15_1730854557514.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/10/20/6699362829233534316/1024x576_MP4_6699362829233534316.mp4","publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:01:16","author":"Editor,Lettice Bromovsky","authors":["Editor","Lettice Bromovsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.161},{"id":262947690,"title":"Maine US presidential election results 2024","text":"Voters in Maine have gone to the ballot box in the US presidential election 2024.\n\nThe state is one of only two in the US that allows electoral college votes to be 'split'.

close in US elections, as Trump and Harris vie for presidency","text":"Voting has ended in several key US states, as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris vie to the be next American president.\n\nThe Republican candidate is predicted to win the reliably red states of Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia, while Ms Harris is expected to win Vermont – usually a Democrat state – according to the Associated Press.\n\nIf the results of voting follow the predictions of America’s largest media organisations, Mr Trump will have gained 23 votes in the electoral college, and Ms Harris 3.\n\nUnder the US voting system, a total of 270 votes in the college are needed to win the presidency.\n\nThe election has largely unfolded smoothly across the USA, despite some voters suffering delays in casting their ballots, and a spate of what the FBI described as non-credible bomb threats.\n\nThe economy – and reducing inflation – is a key issue for Americans according to exit polling, but other areas of concern for voters are security on the US’s southern border with Mexico, protecting democracy and abortion rights.\n\nAs they take part in the presidential poll, 10 states across the US will vote on whether to enshrine the right to abortion in law.\n\nThe neck-and-neck race will have a sweeping impact on global politics, including in the UK where Sir Keir Starmer’s Government may have to grapple with upheaval in America’s security and defence approach if Mr Trump wins.\n\nThe Government has been working hard to win over the Republican candidate in case he is re-elected, after a trans-Atlantic spat developed in recent weeks over Labour Party volunteers heading to the US to campaign for his rival.\n\nSir Keir is expected to be following the results of the US election, but his official spokesman did not say whether the Prime Minister would be staying up overnight to watch the results roll in.\n\nSome Cabinet ministers have in the past made scathing criticisms of Mr Trump while Labour was in opposition, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who in 2017 called Mr Trump an “odious, sad, little man” in a social media post.\n\nThough Labour and Mr Trump “may not be ideological bedfellows”, if he is elected “there will be a really good working relationship”, the Health Secretary told LBC.\n\nThe Republican candidate would likely chart a new US course on major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, areas where Sir Keir has largely followed the lead of US President Joe Biden.\n\nFormer Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson has voiced concerns about what the result might mean for global affairs, telling Channel 4 News: “The thing that really worries me right now is Ukraine and the future of democracy in that country.\n\n“I think there is a risk whatever happens in this election that there will be a disaster in Ukraine.”\n\nIn central London, Democrat supporters living in the UK appeared confident their efforts to “get out the vote” of Americans overseas was “second to none”.\n\nDemocrats Abroad UK chair Kristin Wolfe told PA: “This is happening all over the world – we are turning out overseas voters.\n\n“We’re going to win this thing.”\n\nChairman of the Republicans Overseas UK group Greg Swenson meanwhile told the PA news agency there is “considerable optimism” over a Trump victory.\n\nMr Swenson added: “For the first time we have embraced mail-in and early voting and it’s paid off.\n\n“It’s still too close to call, but we feel voters will choose prosperity and security through common sense over the negative outcomes of the left’s radical progressive agenda.”\n\nSo-called swing states such as Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania – where the results will be close – are the areas where the Democrats and Republicans have focused their campaigning in recent days.","summary":"The Republican candidate is projected to win the states of Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia, while Ms Harris is expected to win

Polls closed in Georgia, one of the closely fought battlegrounds that could decide the election, along with a handful of other states. On Election Day, tens of millions of Americans added their ballots to the 84 million cast early as they chose between two candidates with drastically different temperaments and visions for the country.\n\nTrump and Harris each notched early wins in reliably Republican and Democratic states, respectively. Trump won Kentucky and Indiana, and Harris took Vermont.\n\nThe economy and immigration are the top issues facing the country, voters said, but the future of democracy was also a leading motivator for many Americans casting a ballot in Tuesday’s presidential election. AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide, found a country mired in negativity and desperate for change.\n\nThose casting Election Day ballots mostly encountered a smooth process, with isolated reports of hiccups that regularly happen, including long lines, technical issues and ballot printing errors.\n\nHarris has promised to work across the aisle to tackle economic worries and other issues without radically departing from the course set by President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to replace thousands of federal workers with loyalists, impose sweeping tariffs on allies and foes alike, and stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\nHarris and Trump entered Election Day focused on seven swing states, five of them carried by Trump in 2016 before they flipped to Biden in 2020: the “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Arizona and Georgia. Nevada and North Carolina, which Democrats and Republicans respectively carried in the last two elections, also were closely contested.\n\nTrump voted in Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago club, and said afterward that he was feeling “very confident.”\n\nHarris, the Democratic vice president, did phone interviews with radio stations in the battleground states, then visited Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington carrying a box of Doritos — her go-to snack.\n\n“This truly represents the best of who we are,” Harris told a room of cheering staffers. She was handed a cellphone by supporters doing phone banking, and when asked by reporters how she was feeling, the vice president held up a phone and responded, “Gotta talk to voters.”\n\nThe closeness of the race and the number of states in play raised the likelihood that, once again, a victor might not be known on election night.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that he had no plans to tell his supporters to refrain from violence if Harris wins, because they “are not violent people.” Asked about accepting the race’s results, he said, “If it’s a fair election, I’d be the first one to acknowledge it.” He visited a nearby campaign office to thank staffers before a party at a nearby convention center.\n\nAfter her DNC stop, Harris planned to attend a party at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington.\n\nFederal, state and local officials have expressed confidence in the integrity of the nation’s election systems. They nonetheless were braced to contend with what they say is an unprecedented level of foreign disinformation — particularly from Russia and Iran — as well as the possibility of physical violence or cyberattacks.\n\nBoth sides have armies of lawyers in anticipation of legal challenges on and after Election Day. And law enforcement agencies nationwide are on high alert for potential violence.\n\nEach candidate would take the country into new terrain\n\nHarris, 60, would be the first woman, Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve as president. She also would be the first sitting vice president to win the White House in 36 years.\n\nTrump, 78, would be the oldest president ever elected. He would also be the first defeated president in 132 years to win another term in the White House, and the first person convicted of a felony to take over the Oval Office.\n\nHe survived one assassination attempt by millimeters at a July rally. Secret Service agents foiled a second attempt in September.\n\nIn Scranton, Pennsylvania, Liza Fortt arrived at her polling location in a wheelchair and not feeling well. But she said she ventured out anyway to vote for Harris.\n\n“It means a lot to me and my grandkids, my granddaughters, my nieces. … I was just waiting for this day to come,” said Fortt, who is 74 and Black. She said she never thought she’d have such an opportunity, to cast a ballot for a Black woman in a presidential race.\n\n“I’m proud, to see a woman, not only a woman, but a Black woman,” Fortt said.\n\nFirst-time voter Jasmine Perez, 26, cast her ballot at the Las Vegas Raiders’ stadium in Nevada for Trump, citing his spiritual values.\n\n“What really attracted me to Donald Trump is I’m a Christian,” Perez said, noting of the former president, “I like that he openly promotes Christianity in America.”\n\nHarris, pointing to the warnings of Trump’s former aides, has labeled him a “fascist” and blamed Trump for putting women’s lives in danger by nominating three of the justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. In the closing hours of the campaign, she tried to strike a more positive tone and went all of Monday without saying her Republican opponent’s name.\n\nJD Jorgensen, an independent voter in Black Mountain, North Carolina, which was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, said voters should have made up their minds by now.\n\n“I think that the candidates, both being in the public eye as long as they both have been, if you’re on the fence, you hadn’t really been paying attention,” said Jorgensen, 35.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — A divided America weighed a stark choice for the nation’s future Tuesday as a presidential campaign marked by upheaval and rancor approached its finale.

For this reason, it’s possible that, as was the case in the 2020 Biden-Trump election, it could be days before the winner is confirmed.\n\nNo matter what the national outcome, Harris’ support in her hometown is in little doubt. In 2020, 93% of the vote in the city went to the Biden-Harris ticket, among the highest margins in the nation.\n\nRegardless of how —– or how soon —- the election is decided, Harris’s strong connection to the East Bay is undeniable.\n\nBorn in an Oakland hospital, she lived in Berkeley as a baby and again from ages 5 to 12. It was here that she learned ballet from Madame Bovie, a world-famous ballerina; frequented the Rainbow Sign, a Black cultural center that would help shape her political imagination; attended the private Berkwood School for kindergarten, where she got stitches defending a friend from a neighborhood bully; and bussed to first grade at Thousand Oaks Elementary School during the early years of Berkeley’s integration program.\n\nBerkeley polling places were busy Tuesday. James Mensing, vote center captain at Willard Middle School on Stuart Street, said, “We’ve had a steady stream of people today. People are in a good mood.”\n\nAround the city Tuesday, not surprisingly, the landscape was dotted with Harris campaign signs, and journalists from the New York Times and international media outlets showed up outside Harris’ former home at 1227 Bancroft Way.\n\n“She reflects the values of this area,” said Enrique Sanchez, who voted for Harris at the polling place at 2112 Browning St., just two blocks from Harris’ Bancroft Way home.\n\nFinishing Sanchez’s sentence, “The things that made us want to live in Berkeley – diversity, acceptance,” added Chloe Hanna, who was there with Sanchez and their daughter Clara, 6.\n\nEdna Eileen said, “I was born and raised in Asia. I’m an immigrant, and she is a second-generation immigrant. I feel great that I voted for her. She stands for what I stand for as a woman.”\n\nNot everyone was a supporter. “I voted for RFK,” said Dana Ullman. “Our governmental agencies are captured by big pharma and Big Ag and sadly so is the Democratic Party.” Ullman characterized his vote as a protest vote: “If I were in a contested state, I would vote for Harris.”\n\nA number of voters expressed concerns about how Trump might respond to a Harris win.\n\n“I like democracy,” said Bryan Vale. “Trump tried to overthrow the vote last time. I would prefer my kids to grow up in a democracy rather than a dictatorship.”\n\nCarole Porter, Harris’ childhood friend from elementary school in Berkeley, was preparing to spend the evening glued to the TV watching the election returns.\n\n“I know she will win. She always lands on her feet,” Porter said from her home in Richmond.\n\n“Our country will be so much better to have her leading at this critical tipping point. This is an opportunity again for us to see each other as people who have so much more in common than we have different,” Porter said.\n\nBerkeley Councilmember Rashi Kesarwani said, “It gives me goosebumps to think of Kamala Harris taking the oath of office as our next president. Her candidacy fills millions of us, especially Black Americans, with hope.”\n\nShe added, “I hope that young people, especially our Black and brown daughters, see themselves in Kamala and know they should never ever give up on their dreams.”","summary":"Many in Berkeley, where the Biden-Harris ticket won 93% of the 2020 vote, said she reflects the city’s values of “diversity and acceptance.”","url":"https://nation.lk/online/she-stands-for-what-i-stand-for-voters-in-kamala-harris-hometown-of-berkeley-wait-for-results-with-pride-and-fear-282209.html","image":"https://newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241106-004548.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:00:08","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.25},{"id":262947534,"title":"Boris Johnson is 'fired' from Channel 4 election night panel after clashing with Emily Maitlis over his book, Joe Biden's mental acuity and porn star Stormy Daniels","text":"Boris Johnson is 'fired' from Channel 4 election night panel after clashing with Emily Maitlis over his book, Joe Biden's mental acuity and porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nLISTEN: Stormy Daniels on the Mail’s hit podcast 'Everything I Know About Me.'

You can't actually answer a single question.'\n\nMr Johnson responded: 'By the way Emily I've answered all your questions all night. Currently I am blissfully engaged promoting my book Unleashed, available in all good book stores.'\n\nLater in the programme, Mr Johnson was replaced on the Channel 4 panel by Michael Cohen - who served as a lawyer to former president Mr Trump.\n\nGuru-Murthy told viewers: 'Boris Johnson has been fired for banging on about his book.'\n\nIt was not clear whether Mr Johnson's exit from the programme had been planned or if he had departed early.\n\nMr Johnson, 60, has been promoting his new memoir titled Unleashed after it was released last month.\n\nThe 784-page book looks back on Mr Johnson's time as prime minister - from 2019 to 2022 - including Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\n\nMr Johnson, 60, spoke on meeting Donald Trump, before again mentioning Unleashed\n\nThe former PM appears on FOX News' The Story on October 31, also with his book\n\nChannel 4 newsreader Guru-Murthy is at the helm of the channel's first overnight US election programme since 1992 alongside former Newsnight presenter Maitlis.\n\nPolitical pundits, and a number of famous faces including Mr Johnson, joined the hosts in the Washington DC studio as the American public decides whether Democratic nominee Kamala Harris or Mr Trump becomes president.\n\nGuests on the programme include Republican supporter and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, and Stormy Daniels, the woman at the centre of Mr Trump's hush money trial following an affair between the two.\n\nA representative for Channel 4 has been contacted for comment.\n\nJoe BidenStormy DanielsBoris Johnson\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nBoris Johnson is 'fired' from Channel 4 election night panel after clashing with Emily Maitlis over his book, Joe Biden's mental acuity and porn star Stormy Daniels\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The former prime minister was told off for holding up his memoir and plugging it just minutes into the live panel coverage on 'America Decides: US Presidential Election'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14046129/boris-johnson-fired-channel-4-election-coverage.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/06/00/91724131-0-image-m-14_1730854784746.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 01:00:00","author":"Editor,James Reynolds,Pa Media","authors":["Editor","James Reynolds","Pa Media"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.008},{"id":262948074,"title":"AP Race Call: Republican Laurel Lee wins reelection to U.S. House in Florida's 15th Congressional District","text":"WASHINGTON - Republican Rep.

He really is', Cox said. \n\n'He's crazy, he's insane, he wants to be a dictator. It's all been so clear, I don't know why the American people aren't listening. Some of the American people are, but a lot of the American people aren't. \n\n'The kind of nonsense he's been talking... I think he's lost it. He's deeply mentally unstable, and I think he has been for quite some time. This is not a man who should be president of the United States.\n\n'He's unreliable, he's a convicted felon, I'm horrified. I'm a lapsed Catholic, and I read today that he's got huge support among Catholic voters. I find that extraordinary, Catholic voters voting for such a man who is... a big sinner.'\n\n'I find it all depressing and curiously ridiculous.'\n\nWhen asked about how much of Trump's fiery rhetoric would become reality, he chuckled as he said: 'He'll do what suits Donald Trump. He's not interested in... making American great again. \n\n'The man is completely self-serving, he is only interested in one thing, and that's Donald Trump. \n\n'He doesn't give a damn about America. He really doesn't.'\n\nCox then got into a scrap with former British prime minister Boris Johnson, who claimed that Trump's views on Ukraine and its president Volodymyr Zelensky would be changed by him entering the Oval Office. \n\nThe Succession star said: 'I don't buy it. I don't buy any of it, and... it's a very hard thing for Boris to talk about. \n\n'We witnessed, during the whole of his last term, how much he was in Putin's pocket.'\n\nDuring Channel 4's coverage, Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who accused Donald Trump of paying her to stop her revealing their dalliance, has admitted she has been living in an RV since July over fears for her safety. \n\nDaniels, the 45-year-old adult film star, told Channel 4's special US election programme of her anxieties about how Trump's supporters behaved since she became publicly linked with the former president. \n\nShe also publicly clashed with former British prime minister Boris Johnson, needling him over his relationship with the Republican presidential candidate. \n\n'It was scary in the beginning, then it got quiet for a while. During this election, it kind of picked up again. \n\n'The biggest difference between this time and the first time around is that people aren't hiding. Part of that has to do with January 6 at the Capitol. \n\n'[Trump supporters] aren't hiding anymore. They're using their real screen names, they're using their real phone numbers. \n\n'The threats are more graphic, more targeted, and as we all know when I testified back in May, Trump's attorneys \"accidentally\" put a document on the screen of the courtroom that had nothing to do with the case that we were trying that day with my unredacted home address. \n\n'So I haven't been home since July, I have been living in an RV and travelling.'\n\nDaniels was referring to the leak of her home address earlier this year. \n\nShe said at the time that 'it’s become unsafe for her family and her pets,' including her horses that have been shot twice. \n\nWhen asked whether she feared a Trump win or loss, she said: 'To be completely honest with you, I don't know.\n\n'He's made it very clear he plans to go after after anyone who was against him and those who helped him.'\n\nDaniels also claimed that Trump supporters had been calling in bomb threats to live comedy shows she was hosting.\n\n'Trump supporters were calling in droves and threatening club owners [with] burning down the clubs.'\n\nShe later squabbled with former British prime minister Boris Johnson over Trump's character, pointedly asking him: 'If you were prime minister and you and Donald Trump got into a disagreement, as people do with Donald Trump, would you have any fear for the ladies in his life?'\n\nJohnson said: 'Nothing like that came up. When you're talking to the US president, the relationship you have as UK prime minister is one of great formality and importance. \n\n'Of course you develop a friendship, but actually, and I can say this in all sincerity, I never in my time with him was treated with anything other than courtesy and friendliness.' \n\nSpeaking to Daniels, he said: 'Now you had a very different experience, but I can only talk about mine.","summary":"Legendary actor Brian Cox has branded Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump a 'monster' in an excoriating interview. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14046025/Logan-Roy-vs-Boris-Succession-star-Brian-Cox-brands-Donald-Trump-monster-arguing-former-prime-minister-ex-president.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/11/06/00/91723879-0-image-a-16_1730854685247.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-11-06 00:59:30","author":"Editor,Perkin Amalaraj","authors":["Editor","Perkin Amalaraj"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":262948004,"title":"Gara për senatin/ SHBA, projeksionet nxjerrin fitues republikanët në shtetin e West Virginia","text":"Republikani Jim Justice do të fitojë vendin në senatin në West Virginia, sipas një projeksioni nga CNN.\n\nNdërkaq, deri më tani, Donald Trump kryeson ndaj Kamala Harris në garën për president të SHBA-ve.\n\nTrump ka aktualisht 23 vota elektorale, ndërsa Harris vetëm 3.\n\nIsh presidenti Trump është në avantazh në shtete si Kentucky, Indiana dhe West Virginia, ndërsa Harris në Vermont dhe Ohio./abcnews.al","summary":"Republikani Jim Justice do të fitojë vendin në senatin në West Virginia, sipas një projeksioni nga CNN.

Such reforms could increase savings and capital investment, fostering a more robust economy.\n\nYet, some politicians appear to be weaponizing tax policies against entrepreneurs and the wealthy, reflecting a growing populism that views inequality and success as problems to be solved through higher taxes.\n\nThe stakes are incredibly high for small business owners. The outcome of this election will shape tax policies for years to come, and it’s imperative for entrepreneurs to stay informed and engaged in the political discourse surrounding tax policy.\n\nBut first, let’s take a step back to understand how we came to this point in time.\n\nA brief history of income tax in the U.S\n\nIn 1913, the United States introduced the income tax, initially targeting only a very small portion of the population. It was truly a tax on the wealthy elite. It wasn’t until 1944 that the U.S. expanded the income tax to wages more broadly, but even then, it was largely on income that exceeded normal living expenses.\n\nFast forward to today, and income tax has become a routine part of American life. While income taxes were rising, so were corporate taxes. In fact, less than a decade ago, the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had a significant impact on both sets of taxes, cutting many individual taxes and reducing the corporate rate to 21%. Many of those cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, giving the next White House and Congress an enormous impact on future tax policy.\n\nKey points to watch\n\nGiven what’s at stake, small business owners need to be prepared to engage in a rigorous discussion about the future of the tax system.\n\nHere are six key areas to understand:\n\n1. Corporate taxes\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a signature piece of legislation under former President Donald Trump. While there is some discussion among Republicans about how to reduce the budget deficit while extending tax cuts, it seems likely that a second Trump term coupled with sufficient Republican support in Congress would not increase the corporate tax rate. In fact, Trump reportedly said in June that he’d like to reduce the corporate tax rate to 20%.\n\nWhile Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t shared a detailed tax policy since becoming the Democratic nominee, based on how she is running her campaign so far, it seems likely she will continue most of the proposals of the Biden/Harris ticket. On the corporate tax front, the Biden/Harris administration has proposed raising the corporate tax rate back up to 28%. When combined with state taxes, this would again position the U.S. as having one of the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world.\n\n2. Incentives\n\nEvery presidential administration uses tax incentives as a lever to drive their policy goals. Tax credits for having children, using daycare and caring for elderly relatives incentivize growing and caring for families. Tax deductions for home mortgage interest encourage home ownership. And deductions for investing in a 401(k) promotes retirement savings.\n\nThe Biden/Harris administration has created substantial tax incentives for purchasing electric cars and other green energy investments, shifting the direction of entire industries. We’re likely to see these types of incentives continue under a Harris/Walz administration. In addition, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is known to be a big supporter of child tax credits, helping create the nation’s largest such credit for low earners in 2023 — a $1,750 per child credit that began phasing out at $29,500 for single filers and $35,000 for married couples filing jointly.\n\nFormer President Trump has indicated that he would like to abandon the green energy initiative. Instead, we can expect that he and a Republican Congress would support a return of 100% bonus depreciation, which incentivizes businesses to invest in machinery, equipment and other assets.\n\n3. Capital gains taxes\n\nOn the individual side, the Biden/Harris administration has said it aims to raise the top individual tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, increase the net investment tax from 3.8% to 5% and tax capital gains at ordinary income rates for income over $1,000,000. This would mean capital gains could be taxed at rates exceeding 50% when state taxes are included. Such changes could significantly impact entrepreneurs and investors who rely on capital gains for their income and would severely impact the tax consequences of selling a business.\n\n4. Social security\n\nThe Biden/Harris administration has proposed increasing the social security taxes on business income, especially business income earned through pass-through entities such as limited partnerships and S corporations. All business income would be subject to social security taxes, not just employment income.\n\n5. Wealth tax\n\nThere has been much discussion by the Biden/Harris administration about passing a wealth tax in the form of a new alternative minimum tax. While ostensibly this is only currently intended to affect individuals with greater than $100 million of net worth — and Vice President Harris already has adopted Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on people earning less than $400,000 a year — recall that the income tax initially only affected the most wealthy. This tax, if passed and upheld by the courts, would likely affect many more Americans in the future, just as the income tax did and the original alternative minimum tax crept into the lives of everyday people.\n\nFormer President Trump has campaigned heavily on using tariffs as a revenue source and policy lever. Some of his ideas have included a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and a 60% tariff on imports from China. Such moves would increase costs for any small business that imports materials while potentially helping those that compete with overseas products.\n\nNavigating uncertainty\n\nSmall business owners and entrepreneurs must pay close attention as this election season unfolds. Understanding the nuances of each candidate’s proposed tax policies is essential for making informed decisions that could impact your business and personal finances.\n\nThe evolving tax code reflects broader societal values and priorities. As debates intensify, stay informed so that you can navigate this shifting terrain. Engage with the discourse, understand the implications and exercise your vote.\n\nThe future of tax policy is in your hands.","summary":"Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
