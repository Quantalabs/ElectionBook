But supporters have argued that it is merely shorthand for a more comprehensive, layered defense system against major foreign rivals.What To KnowIn a statement to Bloomberg, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said that U.S. defense officials had \"gathered the brightest minds and best technical talent to review a full range of options that considers current US missile defense technology and cutting edge innovation to rapidly develop and field a dependable umbrella of protection for our homeland.\"Various department heads, including Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, \"have engaged with the President to present options, and look forward to announcing the path forward in the coming days.\"This marks one of the few major developments or public comments about the project since Trump signed the initial executive order, other than a mention from Trump on Monday when he said that lower prescription drug prices would create savings that would easily cover the costs for \"Golden Dome\"—\"easily ... we'll have a lot of money left over.\"The Defense Intelligence Agency on Wednesday also released an assessment depicting the threats that a sophisticated U.S. missile defense system would be able to thwart, posting a graphic and link on X, formerly Twitter.The one-page assessment and graphic outline missile threats from conventional and nuclear-capable delivery systems \"in the coming decade\" that will \"expand in scale and sophistication,\" helping justify the need for much-improved defense.Intercontinental ballistic missiles from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea—the latter two of which have 10 or fewer but projected to have dozens by 2035—spark concern due to their incredible range, potentially allowing other nations to strike from the other side of the planet.But details on the defense system remain scarce, which has frustrated lawmakers as they seek to formulate a federal budget for the coming fiscal year.What People Are SayingHegseth on Thursday told troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar: \"President Trump committed a trillion dollar defense budget. ... We will have the best ships, the best subs, the best planes, best fighters, drones, missiles, air defense, space defense, border security, golden dome. ... America will be stronger than EVER BEFORE!\"American defense and security tech company Lockheed Martin in March wrote on X: \"Imagine a defense system that shields America from aerial threats, hypersonic missiles and drone swarms with unmatched speed and accuracy. Thanks to President Trump's vision, Golden Dome will make this a reality, securing our future.\"What Happens NextThe Pentagon and defense officials will present ideas in the coming days on executing Trump's plan for \"Golden Dome.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump has long discussed creating an advanced missile defense system for the United States.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-golden-dome-defense-project-takes-major-step-2073037","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2645746/donald-trump-golden-dome-defense.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 01:07:44","author":"Peter Aitken","authors":["Peter Aitken"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":321802218,"title":"Trump announces $200B in deals during UAE visit, AI agreement signed","text":"ABU DHABI >> President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged to strengthen U.S. ties to the United Arab Emirates and announced deals with the Gulf state totalling over $200 billion and the two countries also agreed to deepen cooperation in artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter Trump’s meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the White House said he announced deals that included a $14.5 billion commitment from Etihad Airways to invest in 28 Boeing 787 and 777x aircraft powered by engines made by GE Aerospace.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said the two countries also agreed to establish a “US-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership” framework and Trump and Sheikh Mohamed attended the unveiling of a new 5GW AI campus, which would be the largest outside the United States.\n\nSources have said the agreements will give the Gulf country expanded access to advanced artificial intelligence chips from the U.S. after previously facing restrictions over Washington’s concerns that China could access the technology.\n\nTrump began a visit to the UAE on the latest stage of a tour of wealthy Gulf states after hailing plans by Doha to invest $10 billion in a U.S. military facility during a trip to Qatar.\n\n“I have absolutely no doubt that the relationship will only get bigger and better,” Trump said in a meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\n“Your wonderful brother came to Washington a few weeks ago and he told us about your generous statement as to the 1.4 trillion,” Trump said, referring to a UAE pledge to invest $1.4 trillion in the U.S. over 10 years.\n\nTrump was referring to Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamed’s brother and the UAE’s national security adviser and chairman of two of Abu Dhabi’s deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds.\n\nThe U.S. president was met at the airport in Abu Dhabi by Sheikh Mohamed, and they visited the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, its white minarets and domes, impressive in the late-afternoon light.\n\n“It is so beautiful,” Trump told reporters inside the mosque, which he said had been closed for the day.\n\n“First time they closed it. It’s in honor of the United States. Better than in honor of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”\n\n$200 BILLION IN NEW DEALS\n\nA White House fact sheet said Trump had secured $200 billion in new U.S.-UAE deals and accelerated the previously committed $1.4 trillion.\n\nIt said Emirates Global Aluminum would invest to develop a $4 billion primary aluminum smelter project in Oklahoma, while ExxonMobil Corp, Occidental Petroleum, and EOG Resources were partnering with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in expanded oil and natural gas production valued at $60 billion.\n\nSheikh Mohamed told Trump the UAE was “keen to continue and strengthen this friendship for the benefit of the two countries and peoples,” adding to Trump: “your presence here today, your excellency, the president, confirms that this keenness is mutual.”\n\nBefore his departure for the UAE, Trump said in a speech to U.S. troops at the Al Udeid Air Base southwest of Doha that defence purchases signed by Qatar on Wednesday were worth $42 billion.\n\nUAE has been seeking U.S. help to make the wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models, although the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the U.S. government.\n\nThe AI agreement “includes the UAE committing to invest in, build, or finance U.S. data centers that are at least as large and as powerful as those in the UAE,” the White House said.\n\n“The agreement also contains historic commitments by the UAE to further align their national security regulations with the United States, including strong protections to prevent the diversion of U.S.-origin technology.”\n\nFormer U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of U.S. AI chips to the Middle East and other regions. Among Biden’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress its military strength.\n\nAt the UAE presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nTrump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown.” Trump had hinted he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.\n\nDEALS, DIPLOMACY\n\nOther big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S. and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.\n\nThe trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nTrump said in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.\n\nHe also announced on Tuesday the U.S. would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nHe urged Sharaa to establish ties with Syria’s longtime foe Israel.\n\nTrump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration. If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.","summary":"ABU DHABI >> President Donald Trump on Thursday pledged to strengthen U.S. ties to the United Arab Emirates and announced deals with the Gulf state totalling over $200 billion and the two countries also agreed to deepen cooperation in artificial intelligence.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/05/15/breaking-news/trump-announces-200b-in-deals-during-uae-visit-ai-agreement-signed/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/web1_2025-05-15T144005Z_3_LYNXMPEL4E08Z_RTROPTP_4_USA-TRUMP-GULF.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 01:03:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":321803284,"title":"Republicans Dealing With Key Hold Ups in Megabill","text":"Congressional Republicans remain at an impasse amid a couple of sticking points in their quest to pass their reconciliation bill, consisting of major items to implement President Donald Trump’s agenda.\n\n“There’s still some minutia that needs to be worked out, but we’re going to have, I think, the SALT and the Medicaid, [the] two parts [that] are the most debatable,” Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) told reporters on Thursday. “But I think we’re getting close, and I think it’s really encouraging.”\n\nSALT stands for state and local taxes. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers who itemize on their federal tax return to deduct from their federal taxes state and local taxes they paid. The current SALT deduction of $10,000 per household is set to expire after this year.\n\nDifferent factions of the House GOP—including those who want the SALT deduction to increase and Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus that want deep spending cuts—met in the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) before speaking to reporters, trying to hash out their differences and come to a consensus on a bill.\n\nRep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) said that the plan for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which gives out food stamps to those in need, also needs to be finalized.\n\n“All those things right now are unsolved for variables that need to be fixed soon, but SALT is the top priority,” LaLota said.\n\n“None of us are going to support that as it currently stands,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) said, referring to the $30,000 SALT deduction cap that is in the bill, which has passed key committees, including the Ways and Means and the Energy and Commerce committees.\n\nOne proposal on the table is raising the SALT deduction threshold from the current $10,000 per household ($5,000 jointly) cap to $62,124 per household, which would take effect in the 2025 tax year, according to LaLota.\n\n“We’re eager to hear what the counter is,” he told reporters.\n\nGOP members of Florida’s congressional delegation called for reforming Medicaid.\n\n“There’s people who want to see reforms,” and there are people who want it expanded, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) said.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said, “We have to be very mindful of how the trajectory of Medicaid is.”\n\nDonalds went on to say that the bill would put Florida on the path to expanding Medicaid. Florida has declined to expand the entitlement program.\n\n“We don’t want to be punished for being good stewards,” said Cammack. “So we have some options on the table.”\n\n“In Medicaid in particular, we have two populations: able-bodied adults, and then kids, single, single parents, the elderly,” said Donalds. “And we treat them very, very differently. It’s not just one simple program.”\n\nThe House Budget Committee is scheduled to vote on the reconciliation bill on May 15. Republicans cannot afford to lose the votes of more than four of their own members.\n\nJohnson told reporters that the Budget Committee meeting will proceed as scheduled.\n\n“I’m talking to everybody, and I think we’re going to get this thing done on the schedule that we proposed,” he said.\n\nJohnson aims for the House to pass the bill by Memorial Day weekend.\n\nOne Budget Committee member, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), said he will vote no as the bill currently stands. Norman wants more than the $1.5 trillion in savings over a decade that the bill would produce. He and other conservatives want that figure at $2 trillion.\n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said that conservatives need to respect the targets set in the bill.\n\n“We set the numbers that we were supposed to hit,” he said. “We should hit those and don’t move the goal posts.”\n\nAt least one holdout is leaning toward voting for the bill following today’s meeting of the House GOP factions.\n\n“I’m a ‘lean yes’ now, which is usually not my position at this stage, but I feel good about it,” said McCormick.\n\nRegarding the megabill discussions, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) said: “I think we can get to a place that will satisfy the SALT members as well as the low-sodium members.”","summary":"‘I think we can get to a place that will satisfy the SALT members as well as the low-sodium members,’ Rep.

For two main reasons.\n\nOne, he doesn't like to be dictated to by anyone, let alone a leader he believes he is defeating in a war.\n\nAnd two, he doesn't recognise Mr Zelenskyy as a president. Period. And he therefore doesn't believe he is worthy of negotiating with.\n\nAs we waited outside Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace with the world's media ahead of the proposed peace talks, we spoke to Russia 24 TV anchor Konstantin Churikov.\n\n\"He's not a president,\" Mr Churikov said of Mr Zelenskyy during our interview.\n\n\"He is for a long, long time in power without any elections, so that's a problem.\n\n\"I do not have any idea how President [Putin] can officially meet, as a president, a person who is not a president. So, it's ridiculous for us.\"\n\nMr Zelenskyy's first five-year term of office was due to come to an end in May 2024, but Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia's full-scale invasion began, which means elections are suspended.\n\nRussia doesn't accept this.\n\nCall for fresh sanctions\n\nIf a 30-day unconditional ceasefire can't be agreed to during Friday's talks, Mr Zelenskyy has said the West must act.\n\n\"Russia does not feel that it needs to end the war, which means there is not enough political, economic and other pressure on the Russian Federation,\" he said.\n\n\"And so we ask, if there is no ceasefire, if there are no serious decisions, if there are no bilateral meetings, we ask for appropriate sanctions that will be a stimulus for faster ending of the war.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, both French President Emmanuel Macron and new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke of fresh sanctions on Russia in the coming days if Moscow failed to agree to a pause in the fighting.\n\nThey mentioned financial services, as well as oil and gas, as possible targets.\n\nOther European nations, such as the United Kingdom and Poland, are also threatening financial penalties, but Russia knows the quickest way to securing sanctions relief will likely be through the United States.\n\nThe Kremlin is keen to build a solid relationship with the Trump administration, and has been working hard to improve ties.\n\nSpeaking aboard Air Force One on the final day of his Middle East visit on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said he doesn't believe there will be a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine yet.\n\n\"Nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?\" he told journalists.\n\n\"I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together.\"\n\nThe Turkish government is hoping the meeting it hosts between the two sides will be a step towards easing the deep hostility.\n\nBut even one step forward is a big ask when both sides have such deep distrust.","summary":"Neither Russian President Vladimir Putin nor his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend talks in Istanbul.

It also warned against utilising US AI chips for the training and inference of Chinese AI models.The BIS also published guidance to US companies on strategies to protect their supply chains against diversion tactics.While the restriction on Huawei Ascend chips will not impact Indian companies much as they are not used here, the US move to track movement of its chips has raised some concerns.It means that trackers will have to be put in every shipment, no matter which country it goes to, industry executives said.“Disabling the chip may be a drastic step, but establishing a foolproof tracking system at the physical level will require time to implement,” Deepika Giri, assistant vice president, big data analytics (BDA) and AI research, at IDC Asia Pacific, said, acknowledged the complexity of implementing the new controls.“An alternative could be to use keys, similar to those in software licences, which are sent to the purchaser and prevent unauthorised usage by non-licensed users,” she said.The AI Diffusion Framework—which proposed an annual cap of 50,000 GPUs for India—would have severely impacted India’s ability to import high-end chips like Nvidia’s B200, with estimates suggesting a limit of just 20,000 units under the proposed total processing performance (TPP) limit, industry insiders had said.121195429The Donald Trump administration said it intends to pursue a more “bold, inclusive strategy” for the global dissemination of American AI technology among trusted allies while safeguarding it from adversaries.Cloud company ESDS Software Solution utilises Nvidia chips, including the A100 and H100, and anticipates the B200 GPU rollout in India within the next three to four months.Piyush Somani, founding chief executive of ESDS, expressed concern about the potential delay of B300 GPUs, which might take over a year to reach India without policy intervention.Somani, who is also the president of the Cloud Computing Innovation Council of India, highlighted the exponential surge in India's AI compute requirements, having increased over fivefold in the last 18 months, driven by demand from sectors like banking, agritech, and government agencies.He emphasised the critical importance of data sovereignty and self-reliance in AI infrastructure for India. If India is to truly lead in AI, we can’t afford to depend on foreign cloud platforms where data exits our country, sometimes even unknowingly,” Somani said.Prateek Jhawar, managing director and head of infrastructure and real assets investment banking at Avendus Capital, said Huawei Ascend chips are only being used in China and they are unlikely to come to India anytime soon.“But fundamentally, they can provide a low-cost alternative to Nvidia chips, and that is why the US is trying to create blockage around them from being used by other countries,” he said.Jhawar also raised concerns about the practicality of enforcing the new regulations. “If they intend to track, they will have to include trackers in every shipment, no matter which country it goes to.”He, however, added, “We're yet to see the formal guidance from the US on the consequences of not following this rule.”","summary":"The US scrapped a proposed AI export control rule, easing pressure on Indian cloud firms who feared chip import limits.

They emphasized that lifting sanctions reflects an international political will more than it does a legal matter.\n\nIn exclusive statements to Qatar News Agency (QNA), they indicated that current signs suggest the sanctions will be lifted quickly and without bureaucratic obstacles, thanks to direct support from major powers, led by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, which have already lifted their economic sanctions on Syria.\n\nSyria's reintegration into the global financial system, they said, will facilitate financial transfers, stimulate the economy, and spur investment and reconstruction booms.\n\nIn this context, Syrian Minister of Energy Eng. Mohammad Al Bashir said that lifting the economic sanctions imposed on Syria will open the door to a new phase of joint recovery and rebuilding and improving the economic situation. He praised the efforts of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkiye in supporting the lifting of the sanctions.\n\nIn a special statement to QNA, the Minister of Energy stressed that this pivotal role will have a profound impact on reopening Arab communication channels, fostering a climate of openness and mutual cooperation, and enhancing the economic outlook.\n\nHe added that the government highly appreciates the efforts made by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Turkiye in supporting the push to lift sanctions on Syria, adding that these efforts stemming from a sincere commitment to Arab unity and alleviating the humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people.\n\nFor his part, Dr. Osama Al Qadi, head of the Qadi Center for Economic and Financial Consulting, affirmed that lifting sanctions reflects a political decision more than a legal one. He noted that former US President Donald Trump had given clear signals of support for the new Syrian administration and even invited the Syrian president to visit the United States, a move Al Qadi described as a direct invitation to partnership.\n\nHe explained that current political indicators suggest the lifting of sanctions will proceed quickly and without bureaucratic hurdles, due to direct backing from major countries, chiefly the US, UK, and France, which have already lifted their economic sanctions on Syria. He added that Syria’s reintegration into the global financial system will facilitate financial flows, reinvigorate the economy, and create a surge in investment and construction.\n\nAl Qadi stressed that Syria's economic environment needs technical support from sister countries, which have supported, and continue to support, the Syrian people through various stages. He expects these countries to contribute to rebuilding the banking sector and providing the necessary support to develop it in line with global standards.\n\nHe added that Syria now has a real opportunity to emerge from isolation, and that success in seizing this pivotal moment will require a comprehensive national effort, including legal and institutional reforms, eliminating corruption from the business environment, and restoring Syria’s international reputation. He emphasized that Syria can become a reconstruction hub attracting investment from around the world and breathing new life into its battered economy. \n\nMeanwhile Dr. Firas Shaabo, a Professor of financial management at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul, said that lifting sanctions could be seen as a positive signal to markets and foreign investors, allowing for an influx of investment and boosting commercial activity. It would also enable the Syrian market to open up to modern technologies and advanced infrastructure.\n\nHe added that the biggest challenge lies in the assumption that sanctions are the sole reason for economic dysfunction and that their removal will automatically improve the economy. He clarified that real improvement requires efficient management of state resources, the development of strategic economic plans, and governance of government operations.\n\nHe pointed out that the challenges facing the Syrian economy include widespread infrastructure destruction, weak financial institutions, corruption, and political instability.\n\nRegarding the Syrian banking system, Shaabo said that the capital base of Syrian banks is very small; there are 16 private banks, the largest of which has capital of no more than $10 million. Six banks have capital below $3.5 million, and the rest between $1 million and $500,000. He concluded as a result that the banks' capital must increase.\n\nHe stressed the important role that Gulf and regional banks will play in the next phase, noting that Gulf banks already have a presence through Syrian banks that are considered extensions of them. He said that lifting sanctions will encourage international institutions to return gradually to Syria, and the pace of their return will depend on Syria’s commitment to required reforms and the stability of the country’s overall situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Sinan Hathat, an expert in population affairs, said that lifting sanctions would open the door to international and regional investment, especially in sectors experiencing growing demand such as energy, transportation, logistics, and real estate. He explained that the Syrian market appears attractive to investors seeking new opportunities, which would create both direct and indirect job opportunities and help revitalize production chains in the agriculture and industry sectors.\n\nHe added that the expected return of investment will have a dual effect; the first is that it will help rehabilitate the national economy, and on the other, it will generate direct and indirect jobs for Syrian workers, whether in construction or through the activation of industrial and agricultural value chains.\n\nDr. Nawar Najmeh, political affairs researcher and member of the Syrian National Dialogue Committee, described the sanctions as having created an economic and diplomatic prison for Syria, blocking the flow of goods and money and preventing interaction with the global economic system. He said their removal is a step toward liberating the Syrian economy and reconnecting it to the international system. He added that the coming period could see an influx of goods, medical equipment, and technology, which would allow for fundamental reforms in infrastructure and public services.\n\nDr. Yasser Al Hussein, an academic specializing in political economy, considered the lifting of U.S. sanctions specifically to be a strategic shift in the Syrian file, potentially opening the door for Syria to reconnect with the global financial system after years of isolation.\n\nHe said that the destruction inflicted on infrastructure requires investments exceeding $400 billion, including for water, electricity, and road networks, as well as the construction of housing, health, and educational facilities. Lifting sanctions, he said, would allow international companies to enter and implement these projects, which would increase competitiveness and reduce operational and insurance costs.\n\nAl Hussein pointed out that economic openness will help rehabilitate the social environment by encouraging the return of Syrian refugees from neighboring countries and Europe, especially as resources become available to rebuild schools, hospitals, and basic services. He explained that this new climate could help reduce poverty levels, which, according to UN estimates, have exceeded 90%, by creating new job opportunities especially in the private sector and small and medium enterprises.\n\nIn the same context, Dr. Ibrahim Nafi Qushji, an economist and banking expert, said that lifting sanctions marks a turning point for the future of the Syrian economy, as it paves the way for reintegration into global markets and enhances trade and investment flows. He noted that achieving sustainable recovery will depend on the readiness of the economic infrastructure and the ability of Syrian institutions to interact with the global financial system.\n\nQushji explained that the positive effects of the decision will appear gradually, starting with the liberalization of financial transactions such as access to the SWIFT international transfer system, followed by the removal of trade restrictions, and eventually a broader opening to regional and international markets. However, he stressed that this path requires comprehensive reforms, including modernizing infrastructure, restructuring the Central Bank of Syria, and developing monetary policies to control inflation and stabilize the exchange rate.\n\nOn the policy front, he emphasized the need to reform the legal and institutional environment to build investor confidence by enacting transparent investment laws, offering genuine economic incentives, and streamlining procedures related to business establishment and profit repatriation.

It could make him more dangerous.","text":"Ed Martin may have finally found his calling: He will lead a made-up sounding organization to investigate imagined abuses of power. But while Martin’s new job may feel fake, the dangers posed by it are very real. After flaming out as President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Martin has been resurrected in a role where he can perhaps do even more damage, as head of the Justice Department’s “Weaponization Working Group.” Attorney General Pam Bondi created the group in February, declaring her intention to restore the “integrity and credibility” of the DOJ. Bondi’s memo goes on to accuse other prosecutors of abusing their power “to achieve political objectives,” listing Jack Smith, Alvin Bragg and Letitia James as examples. All three, of course, have initiated criminal or civil cases against Trump. A jury found against Trump in the case led by Bragg and a judge found against Trump in the case led by James. The cases brought by Smith never made it to a jury trial, but grand juries returned indictments after finding probable cause that Trump unlawfully retained national defense information and interfered in the 2020 presidential election. There is no evidence that these cases were brought to achieve purely political objectives. In an introductory press conference, Martin made an extraordinary pledge: to share disparaging information about former government officials even if the evidence is insufficient to support criminal charges against them. According to Martin, “if they can’t be charged, we will name them … and in a culture that respects shame, they should be people that are ashamed. And that’s a fact. That’s the way things work. And so that’s, that’s how I believe the job operates.” If Martin really does follow through on that de facto mission statement, it will be a betrayal of both DOJ policy and legal ethics, which prohibit prosecutors from making extrajudicial statements about individuals under investigation. Moreover, while “name and shame” is a tactic that the DOJ uses in certain circumstances, Martin’s description is not how that strategy works, either. “Name and shame” in a DOJ context refers to the practice of filing a detailed indictment against defendants who cannot be arrested because they are in a country from which they cannot be extradited. This technique fulfills a legitimate law enforcement interest by exposing alleged misconduct as a deterrent. For example, five Chinese military hackers were named in a 2014 indictment accusing them of economic espionage in the steel industry to expose the activities of a hostile foreign adversary. In 2016, 13 Russian intelligence operatives were named in special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment accusing them of interfering with the 2016 presidential election. But importantly, this strategy is generally only deployed after a grand jury finds evidence sufficient to establish probable cause and returns an indictment. Martin, on the other hand, suggests he will publish disparaging information about individuals even in the absence of such evidence, a breathtaking breach of DOJ norms. As a federal prosecutor, I learned quickly that the DOJ takes its obligation to refrain from making statements that could harm a person’s reputation seriously. Or at least, it used to. When I first became a U.S. attorney, my colleagues and I were sent to the Justice Department training center in Columbia, South Carolina, to learn the do’s and don’ts of making public comments about our work. We were taught we must avoid making statements outside of the public record except where required, such as an active crime spree in which public safety is at risk. The “Justice Manual,” the DOJ’s policy guidebook, prohibits personnel from confirming or denying even the existence of an investigation, lest they cast aspersions on the subject of the probe. In addition to DOJ policy, ethics rules also prohibit prosecutors from making statements that could harm the reputation of a person under investigation. Rule 3.8(f) of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a provision describing the special responsibilities of prosecutors, prohibits lawyers for the government from making “extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused.” Recall that the justification for firing then-FBI Director James Comey during Trump’s first term was his 2016 press conference regarding Hillary Clinton’s private email server. While Comey publicly recommended against filing charges, he nonetheless castigated the presidential candidate for conduct he called “extremely careless.” In a memo supporting Comey’s termination, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote that Comey ignored a “longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation. Derogatory information sometimes is disclosed in the course of criminal investigations and prosecutions, but we never release it gratuitously. The Director laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument, but without a trial. It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.” Martin, however, has apparently never read the textbook. In January, Trump appointed him interim leader of the nation’s largest U.S. attorney’s office despite a complete lack of prosecutorial experience. Martin had previously served as the chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, president of Phyllis Schlafly’s Eagle Forum and a lawyer in private practice. Perhaps not surprisingly, as interim U.S. attorney, Martin acted more like a Trump attack dog than an evenhanded administrator of justice. He fired and investigated career prosecutors who had worked on cases regarding the Jan. 6 attack. He dismissed pending cases against Jan. 6 defendants, including one he had previously represented. As part of what he called “Operation Whirlwind,” he sent letters to Democratic politicians demanding answers about their public statements, to the Georgetown University Law Center questioning its teaching and hiring policies, and to medical journals inquiring into their content, creating a climate of intimidation and potentially chilling free speech. Unlike the U.S. attorney position, Martin’s new role does not require Senate confirmation. But it will still allow Martin to carry Trump’s water by publicly accusing his accusers of misconduct, even in the absence of evidence that any crime was committed. This is terrible news for prosecutors who have worked on any number of cases Trump may find personally objectionable. The immediate harm will be to the reputation of the public servants who worked long hours to uncover evidence of Trump’s alleged wrongdoing. The long-term damage will be to discourage honorable people from joining the Justice Department for fear that they might end up in the crosshairs of a hostile future administration. And meanwhile the public will lose its protection from corruption at the highest levels of government.","summary":"After flaming out as President Donald Trump’s U.S. attorney nominee, lawyer Ed Martin has a new job with Pam Bondi doing the thing that got James Comey fired.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-failed-us-attorney-ed-martin-doj-rcna207163","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-Ed-Martin-ch-1437-44b2d4.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-16 00:12:01","author":"Barbara McQuade","authors":["Barbara McQuade"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":321798628,"title":"World News | EAM Jaishankar Holds Talks with Afghan FM Muttaqi on Trade, Chabahar Port, and Visa Facilitation","text":"New Delhi [India], May 16 (ANI): External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held a telephonic conversation with Afghanistan's Acting Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi on Thursday and discussed ways to strengthen cooperation between India and Afghanistan.\nJaishankar also expressed his appreciation for Muttaqi's strong condemnation of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam.

Mullins was working at Halter Ranch in Paso Robles, California as a general manager and living on the property.\n\nAt that very first meeting, Busby claims Wyss - who has an estimated net worth of $4.8 billion and lives in Wyoming - 'deliberately placed his hand on Ms. Busby's butt and groped her.\n\n'Mr. Wyss proceeded to tell Mr. Mullins, in Ms. Busby's presence, about how \"good\" Ms. Busby's butt looked in the dress she was wearing,' the lawsuit alleges. 'A few nights later, Mr. Wyss suggested to Ms. Busby that she wear the same dress again because it looked \"sexy\" on her.'\n\nAt the time, Busby claims she had hoped it was a one-off statement.\n\nBut soon, Wyss's creepy behavior escalated, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIt says Wyss 'made several sexual propositions' at subsequent meetings, but Busby did not want to speak up at the time because she did not want to jeopardize Mullins' standing with the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Busby and Mullins' relationship grew more serious - and she moved in with him on the property in 2021.\n\nTheir home life, though, allegedly became crowded as Wyss would stay in the house with them whenever he visited the Paso Robles property.\n\nOn several occasions, Wyss would even undress in front of Busby and Mullins - and invite them to remove their clothing as well, she claims.\n\nStill, when she was offered a job as a project manager at the winery, Busby accepted the offer. \n\nFor years afterward, Busby said Wyss would continue to make sexual advances at her - both alone and in front of Mullins.\n\n'Mr. Wyss told Ms. Busby how much he enjoyed having a threesome, even with another man,' the lawsuit states.\n\n'He even suggested a \"foursome\" and stated that it would be \"fun\" for the three of them and another woman by the name of \"Lori.\"'\n\nWyss also allegedly told Busby about his own sexual experiences, including several affairs and even a story about him and Lori meeting a man in a movie theater in his native Switzerland, initiating oral sex with him and then having a threesome at Lori's apartment.\n\n'He further said that Americans were \"too uptight\" around having those affairs,' the lawsuit claims.\n\nWyss allegedly then went on to mention Lori once again when he 'shoved his iPad in Ms. Busby's face' to show Lori wearing 'shear, black lingerie' on FaceTime.\n\nHe then went on to question Mullins and Busby about their sexual preferences and even 'asked Ms. Busby about her favorite sexual preferences,' the suit claims.\n\nOn a business trip in January 2021 - shortly after Busby joined the staff at the winery - he also allegedly suggested 'if Bryce is not behaving, you can join me in bed. \n\nBy 2022, Wyss even allegedly told Busby 'If you ever went after me for sexual harassment, you would win.' \n\nStill, Busby says she kept her mouth shut out of concern for her and Mullins' careers.\n\nBut privately, she says she spoke to Mullins after they got married and had a baby - and the two agreed to move into a smaller house on the property, which did not have enough room for Wyss to stay over.\n\nAt that point, though, Busby claims Wyss began to demand they pay $1,650 in monthly rent - even though the prior tenant was only paying $300 a month, and they were living at the larger house free-of-charge.\n\nWhen Busby then returned from maternity leave in 2023, she claims Wyss told her and her husband they were both being overpaid - so Busby decided to voluntarily reduce her salary from $75,000 to $65,000 'fearful of any more retaliation' as she sought treatment for anxiety and stress.\n\nBusby ultimately decided to resign in July 2024, sending the company a formal complaint, denouncing the 'inappropriate behavior and misconduct' Wyss inflicted on her and her husband.\n\nMullins has also filed his own lawsuit against his former boss, claiming Wyss failed to honor a promise of equity in Halter Ranch that would have grown to at least $30 million, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. \n\nHe describes how the Swiss billionaire coaxed him away from his life and finance career on the East Coast to help run Halter Ranch and make it profitable.\n\nMullins said in his suit that he was reluctant at first to accept the job, as a business professor warned him 'that Halter Ranch's problems - stemming in large part from Mr. Wyss' emotional decision-making and outsized ego - were not ones Mr. Mullins would be able to remedy.' \n\nYet Wyss's alleged promise that Mullins would 'have full control of the Halter Companies upon Mr. Wyss's death' was too enticing, and Mullins became Halter Ranch's vice president and general manager.\n\nThat all ended after his wife sent her complaint email, Mullins claims.\n\nHe said Wyss 'abruptly terminated' his employment and offered a severance package that required him to release his claim on the equity in the business.\n\nWyss has not yet responded to either lawsuit, but executives at Halter Ranch have denied the claims.\n\n'The allegations in the complaint are not true and we intend to vigorously advance the facts that surround their time at the winery and their departure,' they said in a statement. \n\n'For almost five years, starting in 2019, Mr. Mullins and his current wife voluntarily made themselves part of the Halter Winery community and took advantage of its owner's generosity,' they continued.\n\n'This included deciding to become employees of the winery, choosing to live at the winery rent free for years, frequently traveling with the owner to Europe, the Caribbean and elsewhere at the owner's expense, asking the owner and his wife to host their wedding party and inviting the owner to serve as Best Man.\n\n'Through all these years, they never complained about the owner's conduct, or simply declined to spend so much time with him, until after they voluntarily left their employment at the winery in 2024.' \n\nHowever, this is not the first time Wyss has been accused of sexual harassment.\n\nIn 2013, he settled out of court for $1.5 million with a Colorado woman who claimed she suffered sexual abuse for years as an employee at the Wyss Foundation, according to the Daily Caller.\n\nShe had claimed she had to have sex with Wyss in order to get him to fund grants to nonprofits that focused on at-risk youth and sex trafficking.\n\nYears before, another former employee filed a federal suit against him, claiming he created a hostile work environment at Synthes - a medical device manufacturer he founded to make implants to mend bone fractures.\n\nShe wound up losing the case claiming employment discrimination, but the judge noted that the sexually offensive incidents she cited were 'undisputed by the defendants' including Wyss, the Daily Caller reports.\n\nStill Wyss has become a major donor to left-leaning causes. \n\nHis Wyss Foundation has also donated over $807million in the United States since 2016, with much of it going to either environmental causes or to support the environmental efforts of Joe Biden's presidency. \n\nThe foundation has a specific arm for lobbying and political advocacy called the Berger Action Fund, which has donated $343million to groups trying to stop Republican gerrymandering efforts, as well as Democrat-aligned super PACs. \n\nIn fact, over $60million of the Berger fund's $72million went to drumming up support for Biden's programs. \n\nMany of his donations also went to trying to stop President Donald Trump in his first term and his successful nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nThe Wyss Foundation and BAF, however, have claimed that they never directly donate to campaigns or candidates - which is prohibited by federal law as it is believed Wyss is still a Swiss national with no US citizenship. \n\nHis daughter Amy, though, has previously served on the board of the Wyss Foundation and is a US-Swiss dual citizen.","summary":"Hansjorg Wyss, 89, a billionaire Democratic donor, has been accused of trying to coax a couple in his employ to have orgies and threesomes with him and another woman.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14717565/Hansjorg-Wyss-winery-sexual-harassment-Madison-Busby-Bryce-Mullins.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/16/00/98428951-0-image-m-24_1747351023418.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:59:57","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":321797624,"title":"WATCH: GOP Rep Makes Embarrassing Freudian Slip on Air","text":"A Republican representative made an awkward gaffe on Fox News when discussing the Trump administration’s plans for Medicaid. \n\n“And then you can look at Medicaid cuts,” Missouri lawmaker and Congress tax chief Jason Smith said, before hastily correcting himself. “Uh, Medicaid reforms, I should say.” \n\nSmith, the current chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is a massive proponent of President Donald Trump’s “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” and has been pushing for the president’s proposed budget measures in Congress. \n\n“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill puts American families first,” he wrote on X Thursday. \n\nBut Smith accidentally said the quiet part out loud when he appeared on The Will Cain Show on Fox Thursday.\n\nSmith also directly contradicted his state’s Republican Sen.

Department of Economic and Social Affairs. “It's been a nervous time for the global economy,” he told reporters while launching the midyear forecast. “In January this year, we were expecting two years of stable — if subpar — growth, and since then, prospects have diminished, accompanied by significant volatility across various dimensions.” Also Read | India-Pakistan Tension: DGMOs of Both Countries Talked Over Hotline To Discuss Ceasefire, Says Pak’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar; Ceasefire Extended Till May 18. The U.N. is now forecasting global economic growth of 2.4% this year and 2.5% next year — a drop of 0.4 percentage point each year from its projections in January. Last year, the global economy grew 2.9%. Mukherjee said the slowing is affecting most countries and regions, but among the most severely hit are the poorest and least developed countries, whose growth prospects have fallen from 4.6% to 4.1% just since January. “That translates into a loss of billions in economic output for the most disadvantaged of countries,” which are home to over half the global population living in extreme poverty, he said. The world's developed and developing countries also are projected to suffer, according to the U.N. report. Economic growth in the United States is now projected to drop significantly, from 2.8% last year to 1.6% this year, it said, noting that higher tariffs and policy uncertainty are expected to weigh on private investment and consumption. China's growth is expected to slow to 4.6% this year from 5% in 2024 as a result of subdued consumer sentiment, disruptions in its export-oriented manufacturing companies, and continuing challenges in its property sector, the report said. The European Union's growth is forecast to remain the same this year as it was last year — just 1%, the report said, citing weaker net exports and higher trade barriers. The United Kingdom's economic growth of 1.1% last year is projected to fall to 0.9%. Weakening trade, slowing investments and falling commodity prices are also forecast to erode growth in other major developing economies, including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa. India will remain one of the world's fastest-growing large economies, but the U.N. forecast said its growth is expected to drop from 7.1% in 2024 to 6.3% this year. The U.N.'s global economic growth forecast is lower than the International Monetary Fund's. On a more positive note, Mukherjee said the U.N. is expecting that bilateral negotiations will lead to lower tariffs, although he said they won't return to the levels before U.S. President Donald Trump's February announcement. Nonetheless, Mukherjee said, resolving uncertainties would help individuals and businesses move forward with economic decisions and that would have a positive impact on the global economy.

Discovery)\n\nWould a streaming service by any other name smell as sweet as the anodyne and largely meaningless “Max?” Uh, yes, and probably be a lot more popular long-term with consumers around the planet.\n\nAt this week’s New York upfronts presentation to advertisers, Warner Bros. Discovery executives said its Max streaming service this summer would revert to its natal name, HBO Max. The reversion reinstates in big type the only brand that compels many of the service’s 122 million customers to pony up several dollars in subscription fees each month.\n\nIt’s also a sign of where WBD and HBO Max are headed next after an often wobbly half-decade that included one huge and debt-ridden merger, a ruinously expensive ambition to compete with Netflix and Amazon, and a reconsideration of what a smaller, more sustainable media company could be post-Streaming Wars.\n\nThe good news about the return to HBO Max, as HBO chief Casey Bloys joked, \"is I have a drawer full of stationery from the last time around.\"\n\nIt took WBD a few years to figure it out, though.\n\nThe streaming service launched almost exactly five years ago, and was called HBO Max by two sets of leaders ago. The launch was a shambolic mess, hobbled by the pandemic lockdown that started two months earlier, and which shut down several planned original shows. Jason Kilar, who had just become head of what was then called Warner Media and was part of AT&T, was enraged enough at the messy debut that some executives soon would move on.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘The Four Seasons’ Dethroned In Netflix’s Top 10 List By An Exceptional Show\n\nGoogle’s New Android Update — 3 Things Your Phone Can No Longer Do\n\nSerious BlackRock Bitcoin Warning Fuels ‘Disaster’ Fears As The Price Suddenly Dives\n\nPerhaps Warner executives were suffering from a near-fatal over-exposure of HBO-branded video services at the time. There was the premium cable mothership, called simply HBO, but the list also included proto-streaming, on-demand services HBO Go and HBO Now.\n\nConsumers could be forgiven for some market confusion before HBO Go and Now went soon. Even after they shuffled onto an ice floe, confusion remained. HBO Max included pretty much all of HBO’s current and library content and a bunch of other great stuff from Warner’s rich library of films and TV stretching back most of a century. If you were an HBO cable subscriber, you even got to use HBO Max for free. Deal! Provided you could figure out this newfangled streaming app thing.\n\nFast forward, past the 2022 merger of reality-show haven Discovery Networks with the much-bigger Warner Media. Now, new leadership wanted to signify that they had an “everything” streaming app capable of competing with the big boys, even if it didn’t have Netflix and Amazon’s international reach, bottomless pockets, and sustainable scale.\n\nMax featured a wide range of shows, including plenty for awards-driven fans of premium original scripted series and features, sports geeks (eventually), classic movie obsessives, animation fans young and old, and trashy reality show lovers, among much else. Basically, the idea was to provide a lot of something for everyone who might be willing to pay for it.\n\nSo, in 2023, HBO Max lost half its name, leaving the minimalist Max as mute stand-in for one of television’s most storied brands.\n\n“Even two years ago, the idea was still that we were gonna be something for everybody,” Bloys told the upfronts audience. “Everybody wanted to be the next Netflix, and it’s so incredibly expensive to do that ... We have accepted and understand that the majority of our subscribers at this point are going to have Netflix, and they're going to have Amazon.”\n\nSo the question now is what does the re-christened HBO Max become?\n\nPer Bloys, “We did a lot of research and focus groups. The things subscribers want from us are HBO programming, scripted dramas, comedies, documentaries, the pay-one [licensed] movies, library movies, and basically the Warner Bros. TV library.”\n\nNot on that list: children’s programming and animation. Earlier this year, WBD cut ties with Sesame Street, is carving down what’s left of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, and mothballed access to many classic kid-focused animated shows such as Looney Tunes.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but Max’s children’s shows couldn’t compete with CocoMelon (on Netflix and YouTube) and Bluey (on Disney+). So HBO Max won’t have much in the way of children’s programming, and less of animation, once a strong suit.\n\nWBD has finally begun to make modest streaming profits ($339 million in Q1 adjusted EBITDA), after too many quarters of even bigger losses. And Max continues to roll out internationally, already in around 75 countries with plenty more to come. The international push has helped drive subscriber growth, which last quarter added 5.3 million more subs.\n\nThat still leaves Max far behind Netflix, which operates in more than 190 countries, with Q1 operating income of $3.35 billion, up 27% over 2024. Netflix stopped reporting its total subscriber count in the previous quarter, at 301 million, but continues to far outstrip every streaming competitor but YouTube.\n\nGiven that reality, one sign of good management might be to adapt, and do something different. That’s what’s happening.\n\nBased on Bloys’ comments, and those of CEO David Zaslav, “different” means fewer, bigger swings with content spending than Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. That less-is-more approach leverages Warner’s deep library of films and TV shows, and HBO’s still reliable knack for producing culture-grabbing originals such as House of Dragons, Hacks, and The Last of Us.\n\nIt also may set the stage for further deal-making by Zaslav, who welcomed Donald Trump’s election with comments about hoped-for deregulation and openness to mergers & acquisitions. Given many other macro uncertainties, we’ll see if anything like that happens this year, but it’s safe to say the spirit is willing if the deal is solid.\n\nAccordingly, earlier this year, WBD reorganized operations, putting its burgeoning streaming service and the studios behind its movies, DC superhero franchises, games, and television production on one side, and the company’s cable networks in a separate division.\n\nMany in Hollywood expect that reorg is a predicate to spinning off WBD’s cable operations (TNT, CNN, Discovery, etc), perhaps similar to what Comcast is already doing with most of its cable networks other than Bravo.\n\nCertainly, rebranding to HBO Max, emphasizing a brand that means quality television entertainment, would nicely accommodate the bright line the latest reorganization draws between the growing streaming and production side versus the fading cable networks. At least people will know what they’re getting when they sign up, far more than they ever did with “Max.”\n\nHBO Max, by the way, isn’t the only streaming product based on a vastly popular brand that’s getting an official new/old name this week. Elsewhere at the upfronts, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the everything-on-ESPN streaming app expected to launch before football season this year will officially be called (drum roll, please) ESPN.\n\nThat’s a shift, but at least a sensical one, from the long-awaited project’s internal code name of “ESPN Flagship.” Flagship suggested the app’s vital importance to the Worldwide Leader’s continued success, especially as its cable birthplace continues to fade. But the brand is the brand. At least somebody at Disney figured that out right away.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

In March, the company said it had obtained clearance from a U.S. committee to sell shares to Group 42, a Microsoft-backed AI company based in the UAE.\n\nThat clearance came from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, and marked a key step for Cerebras in its effort to go public. Cerebras competes with Nvidia, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) are the industry's choice for training and running AI models. More than 85% of Cerebras' revenue in the first half of 2024 came from Group 42.\n\nThe tech IPO market broadly has been in a drought since early 2022, when rising inflation and higher interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Cerebras appeared poised to be the first notable pure-play AI IPO after its filing, but then the came the delay. CoreWeave, which provides AI infrastructure, debuted in March and has seen its market value jump about 65% since its IPO.\n\nThe IPO market is showing signs of life, with trading app eToro hitting the Nasdaq this week and digital health provider Hinge Health scheduled to go out next week.\n\nThe Middle East is becoming a more critical market for AI development.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia this week along with other tech leaders and President Donald Trump for the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum.

Feldman said last year that the company would have another \"hyperscaler\" within the first half of 2025.\n\n\"We're close with another,\" he said on Thursday. \"I think they haven't been the quickest to respond.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Cerebras announced the ability to run an open-source model from Alibaba on its chips at what it says is a lower price than what OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model charges, and at a higher speed.\n\n— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: Cerebras postponing IPO","summary":"Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said his hope is that the AI chipmaker goes public in 2025 after a delay last year.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/cerebras-ceo-says-chipmakers-aspiration-is-to-hold-ipo-in-2025.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108123806-1743449348290-gettyimages-2157855612-RCZ_4027.jpeg?v=1747351008","video":"https://pdl-iphone-cnbc-com.akamaized.net/VCPS/Y2024/M10D08/7000354154/1728412460-36581902234-hd_L.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:52:42","author":"Jordan Novet","authors":["Jordan Novet"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":321792080,"title":"Receiver of troubled Boston nursing home defends hire of disgraced ex-senator Dianne Wilkerson","text":"A court-appointed receiver of a financially-strapped Boston nursing home defended his hire of disgraced ex-senator Dianne Wilkerson, after “allegations of nepotism and self-dealing” were lodged against her in Superior Court last month.\n\nIn a post-hearing order, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Christopher Belezos, who is overseeing hearings regarding the receivership of Roxbury’s Edgar P. Benjamin Healthcare Center, raised “significant concerns” about the considerable pay Wilkerson testified that she was making at a facility on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n“On April 16, the court heard testimony from several witnesses regarding allegations of nepotism and self-dealing by a member of the receivership’s team,” Belezos wrote in the April 22 order. “The subject of such allegations, Ms. Wilkerson offered, under pains of penalties of perjury, testimony that she is an employee of the EPBHC, receiving full benefits, being paid at a rate of $82 per hour, working an average of 90 hours per week.\n\n“If such testimony is accurate, it raises significant concerns as to the rate of remuneration being paid to Ms. Wilkerson by an institution in receivership with a projected 2025 loss in the area of $4.4 million,” the judge added.\n\nWilkerson, an ex-state senator whose political career ended after she was busted by the feds for taking a bribe, is executive assistant to Joseph Feaster, the court-appointed receiver of the troubled nursing home.\n\nShe was present for a hearing held Thursday in Superior Court, but didn’t take part in the day’s proceedings, and deferred comment to Feaster.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after a roughly half-hour hearing, Feaster defended his decision to hire Wilkerson and her compensation, in the wake of last month’s mismanagement allegations. He described Wilkerson as “talented” and said she was thoroughly vetted before being added to the facility’s receivership team.\n\n“Donald Trump has a past, and he’s president of the United States,” Feaster said when asked about Wilkerson’s checkered past. “She served her time. She doesn’t have a CORI. She has nothing which would preclude her from working, and so that has to be the determinant.\n\n“So that was looked at, because I certainly am not going to have any situation which would be problematic for the organization or for me,” he said. “She’s employable and she’s talented.”\n\nWilkerson resigned from the state Senate in 2008 and spent more than two years in jail after agreeing to plead guilty to charges tied to a federal corruption bust. She was infamously shown stuffing $1,000 in cash bribes into her bra in a photo that was released by the feds.\n\nFeaster said Wilkerson didn’t perjure herself on the stand last month, when she testified about her compensation. He said there was a “misinterpretation” about his assistant’s testimony, when she said she works 90 hours a week, when in fact, she gets paid on a bi-weekly basis for a total of 80 hours.\n\n“I think that she was saying I work more hours than what I get paid for, and what we wanted to confirm is that … she only gets paid for bi-weekly, 80 hours,” Feaster said.\n\nWilkerson told the Herald last month that it’s true that she makes $82 an hour and works 90 hours a week, but “no one asked me a third question.”\n\n“How many hours do I actually get paid for? And the answer to that question is 40. That’s all,” she said at the time.\n\nFeaster also said he saw Wilkerson’s hourly rate as reasonable, given that he makes $450 an hour as the facility’s receiver.\n\nBenjamin Healthcare, which has roughly 80 patients, was placed into receivership last April to avoid the facility’s closure and allow it to begin a financial turnaround. Wilkerson was hired as Feaster’s executive assistant upon his appointment as receiver at that time.\n\nThis week’s hearing centered around the facility’s finances, whether receivership should be continued and what the court-appointed team’s contingency plan was if a buyer doesn’t materialize from the bid process.\n\nIn a May 14 court filing from Feaster, the “receiver informed the court” at the April 16 hearing “that the most viable path forward for the facility to continue operating would be through soliciting proposals for third party owner/operator.”\n\nBelezos, the judge, pressed for a breakdown of the facility’s financial information from the receivership team, and set a deadline for May 29.\n\nA lawyer for Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office, which represents state agencies like the Department of Health, said the state wants to keep the Roxbury facility open, rather than move forward with a closure and transfer of patients.\n\nTo try to recover funds, Feaster is pursuing a civil lawsuit that has been filed against the facility’s former administrator, Tony Francis, who ran the Benjamin before he was appointed as receiver, Commonwealth Beacon reported.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Francis “siphoned” more than $3 million in funds from the facility, per a prior court filing from Feaster.\n\nThe matter returns to court on June 28.","summary":"A court-appointed receiver of a financially-strapped Boston nursing home defended his hire of disgraced ex-senator Dianne Wilkerson, after “allegations of nepotism and self-dealing” were lodged against her in Superior Court.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/15/receiver-of-troubled-boston-nursing-home-defends-hire-of-disgraced-ex-senator-dianne-wilkerson/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/njaminnl04.jpg?w=1024&h=774","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:51:58","author":"Gayla Cawley","authors":["Gayla Cawley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":321791700,"title":"Hollywood superstar George Santos here to talk prison life, his eggs, Cameo and his future in the entertainment industry [Facepalm]","text":"New Members Added: 363/1000\n\n Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

Trump’s Justice Department later said Comey improperly handled memos describing his interactions with Trump, though the ex-FBI chief was not charged with any crime. Trump and Comey’s relationship remained bitter after the investigation into Comey, who said in 2018 Trump was “morally unfit to be president” and treats women like “pieces of meat.” In recent years, Comey has taken to writing non-fiction books about what he learned from his time in D.C., as well as crime novels.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nA timeline of James Comey and President Trump (CBS)\n\nThe Comey firing, as retold by the Mueller report (AP)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Mr Trump, on board Air Force One, said: 'Nothing is going to happen until Putin and I get together, OK?\n\n'Obviously, he was going to go but he thought I was going to go. He wasn't going if I wasn't there. I don't believe anything is going to happen, if you like it or not, until we get together.

Ukraine wants an immediate ceasefire whereas Russia wants to address what it regards as the core issues behind the conflict. \n\nIts set of demands for post-war Ukraine include no Western military assistance or membership of Nato or any alternative defence alliance.\n\nYesterday, Mr Zelensky reiterated his belief that Russia 'is not serious' about peace.\n\nHe said: 'He [Putin] set the date [for talks]. I responded. I reacted immediately. I said I would be there on that date. All parties must demonstrate willingness to take part in negotiations and the first step must be an unconditional ceasefire.\n\n'I am here, we are ready for direct negotiations. We have a mandate from the Ukrainian people to agree certain steps which will lead to the end of the war.' \n\nThe Ukrainian delegation sent to Istanbul is led by the country's defence minister. Mr Zelensky remained in Ankara where he met the Turkish president Recep Erdogan.\n\nThe Ukrainian and Russian delegations are due to meet at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul.\n\nPresident Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg and foreign envoy Steve Witkoff are also due to attend the talks.\n\nMoscow is widely thought to be attempting to delay the peace process so it can make further progress on the battlefield and seize more Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, said in Istanbul yesterday: 'The task of these direct negotiations with Ukraine is to establish long-term peace sooner or later by eliminating the root causes of this conflict.","summary":"Donald Trump yesterday insisted there would be no peace deal agreed for Ukraine 'until Putin and I get together'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14717827/Donald-Trump-says-no-peace-Ukraine-Putin-Russian-despot-snubs-talks-Zelensky-Turkey.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/15/23/98430807-0-image-m-42_1747349699829.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:46:12","author":"Editor,Mark Nicol","authors":["Editor","Mark Nicol"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":321793750,"title":"'Cannot accept it': Senate Republicans give ultimatum to Mike Johnson","text":"As House Republicans rush to gather enough support to approve President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which aims to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent, Senate Republicans are unwilling to accept the legislation, NBC News reported Thursday.\n\nSen.

Gavin Newsom hailed a “major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms” with the announcement of a deal in which the state, search giant Google and others would provide nearly $250 million in public and private funding over five years to support California news publishers decimated by the digital age.\n\nBut Newsom this week trimmed the state’s opening contribution by two thirds in his proposed budget revision to close a $12 billion deficit that he blamed on a combination of economic impacts from President Donald Trump’s tariffs and soaring costs for Medi-Cal, the state’s health care for the poor, driven in part by the state making it available to immigrants without legal status.\n\nThe proposed budget shrinks California’s initial contribution from $30 million to $10 million for the 2025-26 fiscal year that starts in July.\n\n“The sole reason for the reduction is more limited/fewer resources than projected in the January budget,” said H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state Department of Finance. “Now, we will see what the Legislature intends to do.”\n\nThe state’s contribution was hatched as a compromise settlement that would lead to the withdrawal of two bills that threatened to force payments from technology companies to news publishers for their content that helps drive the platforms’ financial success.\n\nOne was AB 886 by East Bay Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, the Journalism Preservation Act, modeled on laws in Canada and Australia that require the tech giants to pay news publishers. The other was SB 1327, by former East Bay state Sen. Steve Glazer, which would have supported them through a tax on gathering user data.\n\nTechnology companies vigorously opposed the legislation, which the industry policy coalition Chamber of Progress called a “link-tax-funded news bailout.”\n\nPublishers countered that dominant online platforms, especially those of Google and Meta, use news content and divert advertising revenue from news publications. They argued most Google searches end at the results page with answers snipped from online news articles that don’t require clicking through to the websites of news publishers that bore the cost of gathering and verifying the information. When readers do click through to publisher’s websites, they said, Google takes another 70% of each advertising dollar, thanks to its control of digital advertising technology.\n\nIn August, Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, announced a deal with the state and Google that would provide funding to support newsrooms and replace the proposed legislation. It called for California to pay $30 million this year and $10 million in each of the next four years into a journalism fund that was to be established at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nGoogle would pay $15 million into the fund and $5 million to an artificial intelligence accelerator, and add $10 million to “existing journalism programs.” For each of the next four years, Google would pay $10 million into the fund and $10 million into the existing programs.\n\nWicks called it “a first-in-the-nation partnership with the state, news publishers, major tech companies and philanthropy,” while the Chamber of Progress hailed it as “a win for Californians who care about local news.”\n\nNewsom in a statement at the time said “this agreement represents a major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms and bolstering local journalism across California — leveraging substantial tech industry resources without imposing new taxes on Californians. The deal not only provides funding to support hundreds of new journalists but helps rebuild a robust and dynamic California press corps for years to come, reinforcing the vital role of journalism in our democracy.”\n\nWicks said this week that given the state’s worsening budget outlook, it could have been a lot worse.\n\n“I am grateful to our governor for making an essential public investment that strengthens journalism — a pillar of civic life in a democratic society,” Wicks said in a statement. “This down payment, combined with those of private and philanthropic partners, will catalyze community-facing news and information gathering across California. We must support and sustain a free and vibrant press, empowering local news outlets up and down the state to continue in their vital work.”\n\nThe lawmaker was expected to say more about the journalism funding effort next week.\n\nAnthony York, a former communications advisor to the governor’s office now working with a coalition on the news funding proposal, had a similar response, and noted the Legislature could restore the proposed cut in the final budget that must be approved by June 15.\n\n“Given the state of affairs, we did take a haircut on the state side,” York said. “But I think it’s good news we survived the gauntlet.”\n\nDanielle Coffey, president of the News Media Alliance, which has advocated for national legislation to support news publishers, said the state funding reduction was “disappointing” and reflects the vulnerability of a handshake deal replacing legislation. But Coffey said Wicks has been a tireless advocate for local journalism given the intense opposition she’s faced, and she remained hopeful the assemblywoman would find more money for newsrooms.\n\n“She’s been a constant champion for this,” Coffey said. “There wouldn’t have been anything at all. Her fortitude is commendable.”","summary":"\"The sole reason for the reduction is more limited/fewer resources than projected in the January budget,\" said H.D.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is partially blaming his state&apos;s financial woes — including a proposed freeze on illegal immigrant adult enrollment in full-scope Medicaid — on President Donald Trump. Newsom debuted the state’s $322 billion budget. It includes a $12 billion deficit — a shortfall Newsom is partially blaming on what he called the \"Trump Slump.\" Newsom also hedged his criticism, saying: \"I’m not blaming the president for the deficit. Someone else might be, you might be, but that’s not what I’m doing. I&apos;m directly attaching estimated significant dollars of revenue loss to the actions.\" The White House reacted to Newsom&apos;s comments. \"After decades of mismanagement, incompetence, and corruption, California Democrats have no one to blame but themselves for California’s financial woes,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to FOX Business. WH ANNOUNCES $1.2T IN ECONOMIC COMMITMENT WITH QATAR, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT BOEING ORDER In order to combat California&apos;s budget shortfall, Newsom unveiled a plan that would freeze enrollment in the state&apos;s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, for adult illegal immigrants, a fact sheet the governor&apos;s office provided to FOX Business said. The document notes that the proposed freeze would take effect \"no sooner than January 1, 2026,\" and would apply \"to new adult applicants over age 19.\" People would not \"be kicked off their health care,\" according to the document. Californians currently without legal status that are already registered with Medi-Cal will maintain coverage. INDIA CONSIDERING TARIFFS ON US GOODS TO COUNTER TRUMP&apos;S LEVIES On Jan. 1, 2027, any illegal immigrant older than 19 and enlisted in the program will be charged a $100 monthly premium. The change, the document claims, is partially due to Trump&apos;s economic policies. \"Trump’s pendulum swings on tariffs have slowed the economy and weakened state revenues by a staggering $16 billion,\" the document declared. While the plan still needs to pass through the state legislature, the release said that Newsom \"refuses to turn his back on hardworking Californians, especially when it comes to their basic healthcare needs.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE \"No state has done more than the state of California,\" Newsom said. \"No state will continue to do more than the state of California, by a long shot.\" The release continued, \"But because of the $16 billion Trump Slump and higher-than-expected health care utilization, the state must take difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability and preserve the long-term viability of Medi-Cal for all Californians.\" Fox News Digital&apos;s Alex Nitzberg contributed to this report.","summary":"California Democratic Gov.

Trump is the 47th president of the US. \n\n“Cool shell formation on my beach walk,” the FBI chief-turned-crime novelist captioned the post. \n\nTrump administration officials and the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., interpreted Comey’s post as a death threat against the commander in chief. \n\n“While President Trump is currently on an international trip to the Middle East, the former FBI Director puts out what can clearly be interpreted as ‘a hit’ on the sitting President of the United States — a message etched in the sand,” White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich wrote on X. “This is deeply concerning to all of us and is being taken seriously.”\n\n“Just James Comey causally [sic] calling for my dad to be murdered,” Trump Jr. tweeted, sharing a screenshot of the former FBI director’s Instagram post. “This is who the Dem-Media worships. Demented!!!!” \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem indicated that the Secret Service is now involved in the matter. \n\n“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Noem wrote on X. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.” \n\nComey, who launched the investigation into allegations of collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign — which rested on debunked intelligence from the infamous Steele dossier — claims he “didn’t realize” some would view the post as a call for violence. \n\n“I posted earlier a picture of some shells I saw today on a beach walk, which I assumed were a political message,” Comey said in a statement, posted on Instagram. “ I didn’t realize some folks associate those numbers with violence.”\n\n“It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.” \n\nTrump, 78, was shot in the ear last July during a failed assassination attempt in Butler, Pa., that left two others seriously injured and one person dead.\n\nTwo months later, another would-be assassin hid in the bushes outside the president’s Palm Beach, Fla., golf course, armed with a rifle, as Trump played a round of golf. His alleged plans to shoot and kill the then-Republican presidential candidate were foiled by a quick-thinking Secret Service agent who spotted the man’s rifle and opened fire on him.\n\nThe Secret Service and Comey’s publisher did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.","summary":"“Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of @POTUS Trump,” Noem wrote on X. “DHS and Secret Service is investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.” ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/15/us-news/ex-fbi-chief-james-comey-accused-of-threatening-trump-in-since-deleted-8647-instagram-post-deeply-concerning/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/104579228.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/l5dhim10-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:38:43","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":321794924,"title":"Kim Kardashian puts on a busty display in a bandeau top as she steps out in Paris with pal Katy Perry and mother Kris Jenner after testimony in $10million jewellery heist trial","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, May 16th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Brown is charged after alleged bottle attack on music producer at London nightclub: US Rapper to appear in Manchester court\n\nRevealed: The terrifying potential consequences of 'period delaying pills' that teenage girls can get their hands on for cheap online\n\nDiddy lawyers shock trial with Whitney Houston drug overdose bombshell after ripping Cassie to shreds\n\nMy perfect affair: For six glorious years, I've followed these five rules for not getting caught.

I'd estimate its value at around $8,000.\n'On her right hand, Kim is sporting a massive ring. While the exact cut is hard to confirm, the diamond appears to be at least 20 carats, set in a solitaire design that further emphasises its remarkable size.\n'Given these details, it’s safe to assume the ring carries a hefty price tag - my estimate would be around $3.5 million.'\n\nTo complete the ensemble, she accessorised with a gold choker necklace and a brown leather belt featuring a gold chain\n\nMeanwhile, Katy, 40, cut a glamorous figure in a dusty pink silk corset dress with a thigh-high slit at the back as she was pictured leaving the restaurant \nInside the courtroom, Kardashian broke down in tears as she shared her fears that she thought she would raped that evening. \nShe previously told David Letterman about the heist in a 2020 interview: 'They kept on saying \"the ring, the ring.\" \n'I kept looking at the concierge,' she continued, referring to the concierge of the exclusive hotel who had been forced at gunpoint to lead the gang to her apartment.\n'I was like, \"Are we gonna die? Just tell them I have children, I have babies... I have to get home\".'\nYunice Abbas, 71, who is among the 10 suspects standing trial, many in their late 60s or 70s and dubbed 'the grandpa gang,' has told French media that he and others who took part in the robbery did not know who Kardashian was.\n'It's not her, it's her diamond we targeted,' Abbas told C8 TV a few years ago. Abbas has admitted his participation in the robbery - writing a book about his role.\nIn interviews with French media, he said he was sorry for what he did and wanted to apologise to Kardashian.\nThere is no possibility of a guilty plea in such cases and Abbas is standing trial despite admitting to playing a role in the robbery.\n\nThe trio were also joined by Jeff Bezos' fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, 55, who looked effortlessly chic in a furry white double-breasted coat \n\nThe American journalist beamed at the cameras as she exited the restaurant, arm-in-arm with a pal \n\n The secret meanings behind Kim Kardashian's Paris looks including iconic 'power move' with sheer robe and underwear, $3M necklace made from 80 diamonds and THAT ring \nFrank Berton, a lawyer representing 68-year-old Aomar Ait Khedache, nicknamed 'Omar the Old,' said last month he hoped the fact that Kardashian is a global star won't affect the trial.\nKhedache is accused of being the gang's ringleader, which he denies.\n'This trial attracts international attention because of who the plaintiff, the victim, is,' Berton said. \n'What we hope is that it won't change anything in the way the facts are judged,' he said. (Writing by Ingrid Melander, reporting by Juliette Jabkhiro; Editing by Michael Perry) \nKardashian jetted into the French capital on Monday, sharing a picture of her view from the plane that she captioned simply with a French flag.\nWhile it is not known what the SKIMS founder got up to the night before her day in court, her mother Jenner took to Instagram to reveal she had spent the evening at dinner with partner Corey Gamble and Michael Coste.\nThe suspects in the trial are accused of tying up billionaire Kardashian with zip ties and duct tape before making off with jewels, including a $4 million engagement ring given to her by her then-husband rapper Kanye West (now known as Ye), according to investigators.\nAhead of Kardashian's testimony, her stylist Simone Harouche, who was asleep in the same luxury hotel flat at the time of the attack, spoke to the court on Tuesday morning.\n\nKim's outing in Paris comes just days after she was seen wearing a lavish diamond necklace and earrings as she prepared to testify at the trial of the gang accused of robbing her at gunpoint in her Paris hotel room in 2016 \n\nThe influencer was joined by her mother Kris as she made her way into the courtroom on Tuesday afternoon \n\n'We've been friends since we were little girls. So when I heard this sound, it was very different, and it woke me up, because it was a sound that I had never heard from Kim. \nIt was terror,' Harouche, who was downstairs in the duplex flat, told the court.'I have babies, and I have to live' - that's what I heard her say,' Harouche recalled, adding that she rushed to lock herself in the bathroom and texted Kardashian's sister Kourtney and their bodyguard for help.\nWhen the robbers left and Kardashian joined her downstairs, 'she was beside herself, I've never seen her like that before,' Harouche said.\n'She just was screaming and kept saying we need to get out of here, we need help, what are we going to do if they come back.'\nCameras are usually not allowed in courtrooms in France, and Kardashian's testimony will not be broadcast live.\nKris JennerKaty PerryKim KardashianParis\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKim Kardashian puts on a busty display in a bandeau top as she steps out in Paris with pal Katy Perry and mother Kris Jenner after testimony in $10million jewellery heist trial\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 28\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Members of President Donald Trump’s team even pointed her to polling showing she would lose to Ossoff in 2026 to discourage her from running, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe polling, by Trump’s favored pollster Tony Fabrizio, showed her losing the race to Ossoff by nearly 20 points, also revealing Kemp and Small Business Administrator and former Sen. Kelly Loeffler would be better candidates.\n\nGreene told the outlet in a statement that it was a “private conversation, and apparently is being leaked.”\n\nShe accused Fabrizio of working “against” her because he says he has a “conflict.” The congresswoman also blasted the poll’s credibility.\n\n“Pick any 800 people in Georgia, and you can make a poll say anything you want,” she told the outlet.\n\nShe then appeared to mock the GOP political establishment by listing off their Senate losers in the past few years, including Loeffler, Herschel Walker, and former Sen. David Perdue. And then, in response to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) suggesting to the outlet that Greene is not “appealing,” she said, “Nobody cares about Tillis because he represents everything wrong in the Senate, and he has his own problems in North Carolina.”\n\nThe congresswoman had said she knew she could win the Senate race, widely labeled as a “toss-up” in 2026. Two other polls, from the Trafalgar Group and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, had MTG losing by 11 and 17 points, respectively.\n\nShe announced her decision not to run in a lengthy post to X on May 9. “So, Jon Ossoff, you can stop with the fundraising emails and campaign ads claiming I’m your opponent. I’m not running. Start trying to raise money off one of these other generic Republicans, though I expect your donations will drop,” she concluded.\n\nWhen asked by the Wall Street Journal about Greene running for the Senate seat, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), who beat Loeffler in a 2021 special election and Walker in 2022, laughed.\n\n“Come on, man,” he said.\n\nIt’s unknown who the GOP will coalesce around for Georgia’s Senate election, but Republicans will want to pick a formidable candidate to build their Senate majority in 2026.\n\nIt just won’t be Greene.","summary":"Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-GA) nearly decided to run for Senate against incumbent Sen.

Troops who don't self-identify but are known to commanders or others in their unit may be flagged for evaluation.\"Commanders who are aware of service members in their units with gender dysphoria, a history of gender dysphoria, or symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria will direct individualized medical record reviews of such service members to confirm compliance with medical standards,\" the guidance states.The policy requires active-duty service members to voluntarily disclose their status by June 6, while those in the National Guard and Reserve have until July 7. Those who come forward voluntarily will be offered enhanced separation benefits — about twice the normal amount of separation pay.Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said earlier this month that approximately 1,000 service members \"will begin the voluntary separation process,\" which can take several weeks.Officials emphasized that commanders can expedite evaluations if needed. \"It is the duty of the service member and the commander to comply with the new process,\" the senior official said.The Defense Department, the official added, \"is confident and comfortable with commanders implementing the policy, and it does not believe they would use the process to take retribution against a service member.\"The rollout follows the Supreme Court's recent decision allowing the administration to enforce the ban while ongoing legal challenges proceed. The court's three liberal justices dissented, arguing the policy should remain on hold. The policy does not grandfather in currently serving transgender troops and offers only limited waivers.As of December 9, 2024, officials reported that 4,240 troops had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria across the active duty, National Guard, and Reserve, though the real number may be higher. The military currently includes about 2.1 million service members.Trump first attempted to ban transgender service members during his first term, though those already serving were permitted to stay. President Joe Biden reversed that policy, but Trump reinstated a stricter version upon returning to office.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a vocal critic of the prior inclusion policy, tied the new directive to broader cultural goals.\"No More Trans @ DoD,\" Hegseth posted on X. In a recent address to a special operations conference, he declared, \"No more dudes in dresses. We're done with that s---.\"This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.","summary":"A senior defense official described the rollout as a \"complicated and lengthy\" process intended to implement Trump's directive.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/pentagon-use-health-screenings-remove-transgender-troops-2073048","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2645742/pete-hegseth-pentagon.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-15 23:36:30","author":"Gabe Whisnant","authors":["Gabe Whisnant"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.406},{"id":321799108,"title":"Kudlow - Thursday, May 15","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MADISON BURGESS \n Published:23:42 BST, 15 May 2025 |Updated:00:35 BST, 16 May 2025 \n\nWynne Evans is reportedly suing producers with a medical negligence claim after he 'suffered a double fracture and two snapped ligaments' but was 'told to continue dancing' on Strictly Ciome Dancing.\nIn January, The Mail on Sunday caught on video the BBC Radio Wales host making a vile sexual slur to his female co-star Janette Manrara on the live tour.\nHe subsequently apologised and resigned from the tour and the BBC launched a wide-ranging investigation which goes beyond the Strictly live incident. \nHowever, in a fresh twist, the the 53-year-old, made famous by the Go Compare adverts, is suing production company Phil McIntyre Entertainments for personal injury, claiming 'inadequate backstage medical provision,' The Sun reports.\nThe star is also said to be fighting for £11,000 in outstanding fees that he believes he is owed 'for the dates he didn't perform at'.\nHe reportedly tripped and fell off stage in Newcastle, days before the 'spit-roast' scandal hit the headlines. \n\nWynne Evans is reportedly suing producers with a medical negligence claim after he 'suffered a double fracture and two snapped ligaments' but was 'told to continue dancing' on Strictly Ciome Dancing \n\nHowever, in a fresh twist, the the 53-year-old, made famous by the Go Compare adverts, is suing production company Phil McIntyre Entertainments for personal injury (pictured: with Strictly professional Katya Jones)\nA source told the publication: 'He was basically strapped up, and told to keep smiling and carry on. He was in agony.\n'The following night, he had to pull out of Glasgow then the following day 'spit-roast-gate' kicked off - just as his foot started to swell up.\n'Wynne's lawyers told him he had a legitimate injury claim - his physio costs are spiralling and he hasn't been allowed to work during this time. So he has decided to sue the production company, something that won't be affecting taxpayers.'\nWynne reportedly got an MRI scan which showed he had a broken foot, fractured ankle and two snapped ligaments and is still having issues with walking pain-free now.\nMailOnline has contacted Wynne and Phil McIntyre Entertainments for comment.\nIt comes after the BBC launched a wide-ranging investigation into opera singer Wynne that goes beyond his time on Strictly Come Dancing, The Mail on Sunday revealed.\nThe Welsh star is at the centre of an inquiry that bosses have confirmed is a 'wider BBC' matter rather than relating just to the dance show – and the tour that followed where we exposed him for using the crude term 'spit roast'.\nIt is understood that the review is being conducted in secret.\nThe Go Compare frontman was caught on video in January warning dancer Janette Manrara not to stand 'too close' to co-star Jamie Borthwick or they would perform the three-way sex act on her.\n\nThe star is also said to be fighting for £11,000 in outstanding fees that he believes he is owed 'for the dates he didn't perform at' \n\nThe Go Compare frontman was caught on video in January warning dancer Janette Manrara not to stand ‘too close’ to co-star Jamie Borthwick or they would perform the three-way sex act on her (pictured with Strictly professional Katya Jones)\n\nEXCLUSIVE Wynne Evans sparks backlash after landing charity gig despite Strictly sex slur scandal \nAt the time, he apologised for what he called an 'inappropriate and unacceptable' comment at Birmingham Arena as the professional dancers and their celebrity partners prepared for a photo on stage to launch the tour.\nThe outcome of the investigation is likely to be revealed in May. If Mr Evans is found to have breached rules concerning inappropriate behaviour, he could lose his job as presenter of the BBC Radio Wales breakfast show.\nAs well as leaving the Strictly tour in January, Mr Evans has been absent from the programme since January 27, just days after the MoS exposed his comment to Ms Manrara.\nHe also appeared in a BBC travel documentary, All At Sea, with Gavin And Stacey actress Joanna Page, which saw them sail around their native Wales. It is not known if it will be recommissioned.\nEvans has launched a fight-back with his legal team, telling The Sun newspaper that his 'spit roast' comment was a light-hearted reference to EastEnders actor Mr Borthwick 'looking like a spit roast chicken' because of how he warmed up on Strictly.\nBut in the video Wynne can be heard warning Janette as she approached the group of dancers: 'Careful, not too close to Jamie', followed by the words 'Spit roast'.\nThe father-of-two's legal team insist the remark was not in relation to the It Takes Two host.\nIt was alleged that some of the Strictly cast believe it should have been Jamie, 30, who left the live tour, not Wynne.\nThe Sun reported that the actor sent a rude message to the Strictly WhatsApp group chat, with sources telling them that they believe Jamie's comment was worse than Mr Evans's yet 'nobody batted an eyelid'. \n\nIn another development, Strictly sources have told the MoS that Olympic gold medallist Sam Quek raised the alarm to producers about a comment made by Mr Evans while on the show.\nWynne's lawyer said he does not recall making the comment and that ‘nobody has presented any evidence to him that he did’. Sam 36, didn’t wish to comment on the matter.\nWynne jetted off to Dubai for some Easter sun last month with his girlfriend Liz Brookes, 50. He has rarely been seen since he stopped hosting his radio show.\nThe BBC refused to comment. A spokesman for Wynne said he had no comment at the time.\nJanette ManraraWynne Evans\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWynne Evans is 'suing producers' after he 'suffered a double fracture and two snapped ligaments' but was 'told to continue dancing' on Strictly\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

John Fetterman in the 2028 elections.\n\nDemocrats strongly supported Fetterman during his 2022 senate campaign, despite him suffering from a stroke and appearing to struggle during his debate with Republican opponent Dr. Mehmet Oz. While discussing Democrats’ recent turn against Fetterman on “The Victor Davis Hanson Show,” co-host Jack Fowler reflected on a 2022 NBC News interview in which Fetterman was pressed about his mental fitness post-stroke.\n\n“The problem the Democrats have with him is you can make the argument that at least in a general election he better reflects the views of the majority of Pennsylvanians. The $64,000 question is does he reflect a majority view of the Democrats? So he will win a general election against, unless it’s a good Republican, but he will not win a primary if the Pennsylvania Democratic Party is loony. I don’t know if it is or not,” Hanson said.\n\n“I think it is, Victor. I saw some poll, just by happenstance, of Josh Shapiro, the Democrat governor, I think [he has an] 82% approval rating, and I’m pretty sure Fetterman’s is under 50%. This is among Democrats,” Fowler said.\n\nThe New York Magazine released a piece regarding Fetterman on May 2, suggesting, based on interviews with former aides, he is in poor mental and physical health. Prior to publication, an internal Pittsburgh poll conducted in February said only 46% of his state’s likely Democrat voters view Fetterman favorably, with 49% saying they have an unfavorable view.

Once they cross that line, the Democratic Party sends out the word to its subordinates. So the media then just stops giving them favorable coverage. The media stops giving them softball interviews. The big donor class is ordered not to give them any money,” Hanson said.\n\n“They find a primary candidate, and they can get rid of him. That’s what they do. Just like they created Joe Biden in 2020. They got rid of Sanders. They got rid of Warren. They got rid of Buttigieg — they coronated him,” Hanson added. “Then when he was no longer useful they got rid of Biden. That’s what they do. They mask it by saying they’re the party of democracy. They’re not. They’re the party of the inside cabal.”\n\nFetterman has pushed against his own party since 2023, calling out fellow Democrats and media pundits in defense of his support for Israel in the Israel-Hamas war. After visiting President Donald Trump in January and criticizing his party’s lack of support for deporting illegal migrants with criminal records, Democrats quickly pushed back against the lawmaker.\n\nFollowing the New York Magazine piece, Fetterman received little public support from his colleagues, while major Pennsylvania Democrats told the outlet they did not support him.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
