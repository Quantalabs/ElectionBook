His 16 months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East.“I want to thank General Charles ‘CQ’ Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family,” Trump posted on social media.RELATED STORY | President Trump’s first 30 days: Rapid government changes and controversial actionsTrump says he is nominating Air Force Lt.

Fight! Fight!” and straightened his right arm swiftly, holding it at an elevated, roughly 45-degree angle, and then quickly pulled it back down again. After his arm returned to his side, he yelled “Amen.” Any person with the faintest knowledge of Western history would recognize the gesture as a Nazi salute. Bannon has denied it was supposed to be a Nazi salute. In an interview with NBC News at the conference Thursday, Bannon said, “I do that all the time. I wave to my crowd, because it’s all about them.” But if you watch the video, no reasonable person would describe the gesture as a wave. Some media outlets suggested Bannon’s gesture mimicked that of megabillionaire Elon Musk, who carried out what many say resembled a Nazi salute at an inauguration event for President Donald Trump in January. Musk’s gesture triggered a debate about his true intentions. After the forceful extension of his arm — executed with an audible grunt — he did it once more and then said, “My heart goes out to you,” leading some people to believe that it may have been an unintentionally unfortunate-looking attempt to engage the crowd. Musk later deemed the accusations as “dirty tricks” in a post on X. But notably, he also made several Nazi-related puns on his social media platform, leaving some to wonder if perhaps he meant to provoke a polarizing response. “When I see the troll emoji, it’s like looking in the mirror,” he wrote a few days later. Bannon lacks the plausible deniability about accidental gestures that Musk had at his disposal. Bannon, an influential podcast host and the former chief strategist for Trump during his first term, is a savvy communicator and extremely plugged in to the news cycle. It is safe to assume he knows about what Musk did, which is why some media outlets described Bannon as imitating him. That this happened after Musk’s gesture was widely criticized by many as a Nazi salute feeds the theory that it was a conscious provocation. Moreover, Bannon made no comment akin to “My heart goes out to you” as Musk did, which might have confounded efforts to pin down Bannon’s meaning. Jordan Bardella, the leader of France’s far-right National Rally party, canceled his appearance at CPAC after Bannon’s speech, citing his condemnation of a speaker who “as a provocation” made “a gesture referring to Nazi ideology.” Bannon told the French newspaper Le Point, “If he canceled [the speech] over what the mainstream media said about the speech, he didn’t listen to the speech. ... He’s a boy, not a man.” The Holocaust-denying white supremacist Nick Fuentes said in response to the speech: “It was a straight-up Roman salute. It’s getting a little uncomfortable even for me.” So what is Bannon doing? His gesture serves as a signaling device to attract the most noxious, militant and overtly fascistic elements of the American far right to support the president. In his speech, Bannon addressed his audience as “the tip of the tip of the spear of the populist nationalist movement,” celebrated the release of Jan. 6 prisoners and said, “We want Trump in ’28.” Put it all together and Bannon is inviting extremists to mobilize on behalf of Trump’s authoritarian project on a level previously unseen. Even if we were to understand Bannon’s gesture as “trolling,” it is still an insidious strategy that carnivalizes Nazism. Even as a winking reference to Musk’s odd, disturbing gesture (whose darkest implications Musk refused to fully repudiate), it still radiates an ease and playfulness toward Nazi iconography. Why choose this specific gesture, a clear reference to the most universally acknowledged symbol of Nazism other than the swastika, as a “joke” to “troll the media” or “own the libs”? It still has the effect of making fascism and white supremacy look less ominous and less taboo, and maybe for some on the right, a little more intriguing than before. Even as a “joke,” it acts as a path to mainstreaming some of the most heinous ideas that humanity has ever conceived of. It chips away at the cultural and political guardrails our society has developed against autocracy, vigilante racial domination, hatred of “the other.” And this all comes as Trump develops closer ties with Germany’s far-right party, Alternative for Germany, some of whose members have used Nazi slogans. Bannon’s gesture doesn’t mean he is a Nazi nor does it signify a wholesale defense of Nazi ideals. But it does mean he is willing to play around with the aura and symbology of Nazism to achieve his political goals. At any level of interpretation, Bannon’s gesture is abhorrent, and it speaks volumes about his political movement if he retains power within it.","summary":"Steve Bannon's apparent Nazi salute gesture at CPAC lacks the plausible deniability of Elon Musk's.

In addition to his repeated comments about absorbing Canada into the United States, Trump has made clear he will not allow China to control the strategic Panama Canal nor tolerate the communist dictatorship’s aggressive economic intervention in Mexico as a backdoor to the United States.\n\nNearly a month before his inauguration, Trump revived an idea for the United States to buy Greenland. And he quite reasonably demands that Canada contribute more seriously to NATO and North America’s defence. For all his bellicosity, Trump’s instincts concerning our continent’s security are sound and rooted in what appears to be a genuine desire to avoid war.\n\nIn the north, Russia has come to dominate the High Arctic with a chain of bases supporting an immense fleet of icebreakers, ice-capable cargo vessels, and warships including a huge nuclear-powered battlecruiser. In contrast to Canada’s two aging “heavy” diesel-powered icebreakers, the Russian Federation has more than 30 icebreakers, many of them nuclear-powered.\n\nInattentive North Americans were shocked to learn recently that China has also quietly gained profound influence over the vital Panama Canal. This came about through Panama’s participation in China’s imperialistic Belt and Road Initiative and by allowing a regime-linked Hong Kong-based company to operate the strategic seaports at each end of the canal.\n\nCanada throughout its history has effectively outsourced much of its national defence to others—first Great Britain, later the United States. Despite our nation’s strong performance during times of actual warfare, the tendency to get others to help defend our homeland is an old, ingrained habit predating Confederation itself.\n\nThe multi-decade-long disintegration of Canada’s proud military has been disturbing and even heartbreaking for many Canadians. But this neglect has reflected deliberate public policy under successive governments, and Canadians let it happen by electing governments indifferent if not hostile to Canada’s defence.\n\nUnder the predatory gaze of Russia’s mighty Northern Fleet and air force, bolstered by its new Chinese allies, Canada’s Arctic sits largely naked. If Canada does not step up and defend its immensely rich Arctic Archipelago, it stands to lose it.\n\nCanada’s military rebuilding process must urgently address the northern geopolitical issue. Announcing the procurement of equipment (or displaying its delivery in photo ops) is always exciting and newsworthy. And it’s important—but not enough. Building support bases, by contrast, is hard, expensive work, but that is where we must begin.\n\nIn addition to more, bigger, and better operating locations in the Far North and High Arctic—only one such base has even been started and is years behind schedule—Canada will need a large, fully capable, comprehensive support base for northern operations located on a deep-water harbour connected to continental roads and railways. The northernmost such potential location is the Port of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The new Canadian northern support base would become the home port of Canadian and U.S. Coast Guard vessels, as well as ships of other Arctic-facing NATO nations, including Denmark and Norway.\n\nWhatever one might think of Donald Trump the man, people need to set aside their emotions to at least recognize that Trump the president is dead serious in his foreign policy goals, especially as it concerns the security of the regions ringing his country. Canadians, and Canada’s federal government, need to accept that Trump clearly expects action.","summary":"Commentary The Donald Trump administration appears serious about bolstering the defence of North America—ranging from Panama to the Arctic Ocean.

It’s not about efficiency at all. It’s about lawlessness.\n\nI offer the following analogy: If you are concerned about crime in your neighborhood, and you show up at the police station and open your trunk to show them the “suspects” you’ve apprehended, they’re not going to praise your industriousness. They’re going to throw you in jail because vigilantism is very bad. It leads to bodies hanging in trees and mobs with pitchforks and outlaws in the sheriff’s office.\n\nRight now, we shouldn’t be asking whether any of the bodies in trees (DOGE cuts) are really horse thieves (wasteful spending), we should be asking how the outlaws got into the sheriff’s office and how we get them out.\n\nJohn Biundo\nWalnut Creek\n\nVoters bought Trump’s\nline about cost of eggs\n\nOne of the main reasons people voted for Donald Trump was the price of groceries, specifically, eggs.\n\nDespite inflation being tamed by President Biden, eggs were still a bit higher last November than before the COVID pandemic, which killed over 180,000 needlessly during Trump’s first presidency. A slim majority voted Republican, for cheaper eggs.\n\nHow’s that working for us? Ummm, not so good. Eggs are now twice the price they were when Democrats lost the election. Some blame bird influenza; some blame inflation. Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is unlikely to control the bird flu since he is anti-vax. If bird flu jumps into the human population, thousands more people will die. You can thank Republican senators who confirmed RFK’s nomination, along with the other incompetent Cabinet secretaries, whose only qualification is to follow Trump down to oblivion.\n\nRepublicans’ policies bring cheaper eggs? You’ve been fooled again.\n\nBruce Joffe\n\nTrump merely enforcing\nlaw on immigrants\n\nRe: “Trump’s orders are a reminder of WWII Japanese internment” (Page A8, Feb. 16).\n\nPresident Trump has not declared war on immigrants. It is war upon illegal entries, a crucial distinction. As a legal immigrant and proud American citizen, I deplore illegal entry to our country, while applicants who do it the correct way wait for their quotas to come up.\n\nThe president is America’s protector-in-chief. He has a congressional mandate. That “people suffer” is abjectly horrific but of no pertinence to this process. One breaks our laws, one risks capture and prosecution. Criminals break our laws, they suffer, hence innocent families suffer. People suffer.\n\nThe comparison to the illegal incarceration of Japanese Americans is irrelevant, albeit a crime to humanity we will long regret.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nWe must sound alarm\non Musk-Trump ‘coup’\n\nAs an 82-year-old elder, I’ve lived through many political crises in this country — but I have never seen an attack on our democracy like this.\n\nIn the past, there was bipartisan opposition to lawlessness. Today, the guardrails are being dismantled before our eyes, and we must sound the alarm to defeat the Elon Musk-Donald Trump coup.\n\nMartha Breed\nWalnut Creek\n\nGOP senators’ silence\nis wake-up call to U.S.\n\nWatching the current administration’s dismantling of our democracy is gut-wrenching. Governing by presidential decree, threatening our allies and neighbors, making a mockery of our existing laws and Constitution are not democracy. These actions strongly contradict the oath of office, to uphold and protect the Constitution. The illusion of reducing government bureaucracy, “saving the country,” is in reality consolidating all power to one man. Simply, his ball, his game, his rules, the majority of Americans be damned.\n\nOur Constitution deliberately separates power between three coequal branches of government to prevent this kind of takeover, or it did. Republican congressional members are willfully complicit by their inaction and silence. Case in point, Trump’s cabinet appointments, mostly a collection of disgracefully unqualified puppets, all receiving Senate approval. The degree of head-in-the-sand capitulation by Republican senators should serve as a wake-up call to all Americans.\n\nJames Mills\nWalnut Creek","summary":"Also: Trump's line &#124; Enforcing law &#124; Sound alarm &#124; Senators' silence.

It is seeking an investigation, saying “appropriate action” should be taken to ensure that future hearings are conducted with the “dignity and impartiality the public has a right to expect.”\n\nA representative from Reyes’ chambers didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nDuring the rhetorical exercise, Reyes told the attorney that she changed the rules in her courtroom to bar graduates of the University of Virginia law school from appearing before her because they are all “liars and lack integrity.” She instructed the government attorney, a graduate of the school, to sit down.\n\nIn another exchange cited in the complaint, the judge asked the attorney what “Jesus would say to telling a group of people that they are so worthless, so worthless that we’re not going to allow them into homeless shelters?” She continued, “Do you think Jesus would be, ‘Sounds right to me?’”\n\nThe government lawyer responded, “The United States is not going to speculate about what Jesus would have to say about anything.”\n\n“An independent impartial judiciary is fundamental to our system of justice,” Mizelle wrote. “When judges demonstrate apparent bias or treat counsel disrespectfully, public confidence in the judicial system is undermined.”\n\nReyes is known for her stern rebukes of lawyers on both sides. In a different case earlier this month, she verbally rebuked former U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, who’s representing eight government watchdogs suing the Trump administration over their firing. She denied an emergency motion and called it “beyond comprehension” to hold a hearing on a matter rather than resolving it in a “five-minute phone call.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been ramping up its criticism of judges over rulings blocking parts of his ambitious agenda rolled out in the first weeks of his administration.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier this month accused judges of acting as “activists rather than honest arbiters of the law.” Supporters have circulated pictures of judges online, made claims about their families and suggested that the Republican president simply ignore their orders.\n\nReyes, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, indicated that she won’t rule before early March on whether to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing the order, which plaintiffs’ attorneys have said illegally discriminates against transgender troops.\n\nHer questions and remarks, however, suggested she is deeply skeptical of the administration’s reasoning for ordering a policy change. Reyes also lauded the service of several active-duty troops who sued to block the order.\n\n“If you were in a foxhole, would you care about these individuals’ gender identity?” the judge asked the government attorney, who answered that it “would not be a primary concern of mine.”\n\nTrump’s Jan. 27 order claims the sexual identity of transgender service members “conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life” and is harmful to military readiness. It requires Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to issue a revised policy.\n\nSix transgender people who are active-duty service members and two others seeking to join the military sued to block the Trump administration from enforcing the order. In a court filing, plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that Trump’s order openly expresses “hostility” and constitutionally impermissible “animus” toward transgender people.\n\nTrump’s order also says that “use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual’s sex” is inconsistent with a government policy to “establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.”","summary":"The complaint accuses a federal judge of misconduct during hearings over President Trump’s executive order calling for banning trans troops from serving.","url":"https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/02/22/doj-files-complaint-against-judge-weighing-trans-troop-ban-challenge/","image":"https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/v2/O5FWOWKGJM2VAVBRFNWSWM2OII.jpg?width=1200&auth=e7f2e6d502a1bfff186bb5171bfb353c81661f5197dfdc05166c9c9fbea6a543","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:30:00","author":"Alanna Durkin Richer,Alanna Durkin Richer, The Associated Press,The Associated Press","authors":["Alanna Durkin Richer","Alanna Durkin Richer, The Associated Press","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":293076558,"title":"Judge blocks Trump’s executive order ending federal support for DEI programs","text":"By LEA SKENE and LINDSAY WHITEHURST, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday blocked a sweeping executive order from President Donald Trump that sought to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nJudge Adam Abelson in Baltimore found it likely violates free-speech rights and granted an injunction blocking the funding withdrawal as a lawsuit plays out.\n\nTrump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts.

Has Musk taken a chainsaw to his own sanity?","text":"Dressed in his all-black 'Dark Gothic MAGA' hat, black coat, T-shirt and sunglasses, Elon Musk was going for the rock star look as he came on stage on Thursday night in Maryland.\n\nHe bounded around punching the air at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) with all the suppressed energy of a boxer limbering up for the big fight, yet he was clearly waiting to add the final touch.\n\nOn cue, Argentina's eccentric President Javier Milei walked on stage clutching a huge chainsaw and handed it to the man who has promised to do what Milei is already doing in his own clapped-out country – slicing government spending to bits.\n\nThe giant power tool was engraved with 'Viva la libertad, carajo', Spanish for 'Long live liberty, damn it'. It's what Milei famously wielded during his successful 2023 run for Argentina's presidency.\n\nMusk roared as he waved it over his head, telling the delighted crowd, 'This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy. Chainsaw! Waaaagghh!'\n\nThe technology billionaire is hardly someone to pass up the chance to make a grand gesture.\n\nHe once brought a flamethrower with him to an interview with podcast king Joe Rogan and they proceeded to smoke cannabis together.\n\nBut that was in 2018 and Musk was just the world's richest man.\n\nNow he's the head of Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, and widely regarded as the most powerful person in the new administration.\n\nMight this have been the moment to tone down the antics and act with a little decorum?\n\nInstead, Musk has turned up the dial on his manic and narcissistic behaviour, a fact that appears to be confirmed by the singer Grimes, his former girlfriend and the mother of three of his children.\n\nOn the same day that Musk was gallivanting with the chainsaw, the Canadian pop star – whose real name is Claire Boucher – went on Musk's social media platform, X, begging him to respond to texts, emails and phone calls about a 'medical crisis' facing one of the children.\n\n'Plz respond about our child's medical crisis,' wrote Grimes in a post that was later deleted. 'I am sorry to do this publicly but it is no longer acceptable to ignore this situation. This requires immediate attention.'\n\nShe went on: 'If you don't want to talk to me can you please designate or hire someone who can so that we can move forward on solving this [?] This is urgent, Elon.'\n\nGrimes did not say which of their children was involved: X Æ A-Xii (pronounced 'X Ash A Twelve'), Exa Dark Sideræl, or Techno Mechanicus.\n\nIn another post, Grimes said: 'I'm not giving any details but he won't respond to texts, calls or emails and has skipped every meeting and our child will suffer lifelong impairment if he doesn't respond asap, so I need him to f****** respond and if I have to apply public pressure then I guess that's where we are at.'\n\nGrimes criticised Musk's parenting skills earlier this month when he took X Æ, now four, with him to the Oval Office for a press conference with President Trump about the work of DOGE.\n\n'He should not be in public like this,' the child's mother said on social media.\n\nShe was referring to the little boy, but many might agree she could have been talking about his 53-year-old father, whose behaviour – since he unofficially joined the government in January – has become even more erratic than it was previously.\n\nSome viewers of the rambling interview he gave at CPAC – covering everything from his controversial government cuts to the war in Ukraine – noted that he sometimes seemed incoherent and even struggled to construct an intelligible sentence, sparking concern for his health.\n\n'I am become meme,' he said at one point, adding: 'My mind is a storm.' He also suggested that Fort Knox's gold depository wasn't real, saying: 'We just wanna see it and make sure somebody didn't spray paint lead or something.' \n\nOn X, some speculated that he had taken drugs, most likely the party drug ketamine they suggested, before coming on stage, which might have explained not only his wild antics but also why he was wearing dark glasses – perhaps to hide rapid eye movement or dilated pupils.\n\nMusk has admitted regularly using ketamine, a horse tranquiliser and powerful anaesthetic that's become popular among recreational drug users for its hallucinogenic side-effects and the trance-like state it produces.\n\nMusk has said he gets it on prescription from 'an actual, real doctor', even though in the US, it is a controlled substance and is only approved by the federal government as an anaesthetic.\n\nIn an interview last year, he said he uses 'a small amount once every other week' to treat depression. 'There are times when I have sort of a… negative reaction in my brain, like depression I guess, or depression that's not linked to any negative news, and ketamine is helpful for getting one out of the negative frame of mind,' he said.\n\nAsked if he abused the drug, he replied: 'I don't think so. If you use too much ketamine, you can't really get work done, and I have a lot of work.'\n\nHowever, Friends star Matthew Perry died from the 'acute effects of ketamine' and doctors warn it can be highly addictive.\n\nExperts say the drug can lead to unpredictable behaviour and that, at higher doses, disassociation, a condition in which the user feels detached from their body and surroundings.\n\nKetamine researcher Amit Anand said users 'can feel grandiose and like you have special powers or special talents. People do impulsive things, they could do inadvisable things at work'.\n\nIt's hardly the first time Musk's bizarre behaviour has raised concerns about his mental state.\n\nHe is an uber-workaholic who happily sleeps in his office. A 2023 biography revealed he would sometimes get so over-stressed he would stay awake all night and end up vomiting with anxiety.\n\nHis already heavy workload as the boss of various companies including car maker Tesla, rocket manufacturer SpaceX and his social media platform has been increased by his government work.\n\nAnd there is plenty of that. He has pledged to cut $2trillion in annual federal government spending, yet so far he has cut only $55billion – and even that figure is contested.\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times reported that members of the Tesla board had become worried about Musk's use of the prescription sleep aid Ambien, which can cause hallucinations.\n\nJust over a year ago, the Wall Street Journal claimed Musk had also been taking the hallucinogenic drug LSD (aka acid), cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms – supposedly consumed at parties around the world that are so secretive, guests must sign non-disclosure agreements barring them from discussing what goes on and give up their phones as they enter.\n\nMusk responded to the shocking claims on X, saying: 'Whatever, I'm doing, I should obviously keep doing it! If drugs actually helped improve my net productivity over time, I would definitely take them!'\n\nAfter Musk delivered a wild and extended diatribe about British politics, Musk biographer Seth Abramson said last month that he believed Musk could be 'deeply unwell' and 'may be going mad', with potentially serious consequences for the world.\n\nAbramson said he'd been tracking Musk's online behaviour for the past two years and 'given that he's admitted to all of mental illness, heavy drug use and crippling stress, it is now reasonable to fear he is deeply unwell'.\n\nSuch speculation is only likely to grow after his latest performance with the chainsaw.","summary":"Dressed in his all-black 'Dark Gothic MAGA' hat, black coat, T-shirt and sunglasses, Elon Musk was going for the rock star look as he came on stage on Thursday night in Maryland .","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-14423087/Musk-bizarre-behaviour-chronic-stress-ketamine-child-unwell-chainsaw.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/22/00/95465595-0-image-m-54_1740182733175.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:22:50","author":"Editor,Tom Leonard","authors":["Editor","Tom Leonard"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":293075936,"title":"Hunter Schafer misgendered on passport because of Trump: ‘I am never going to stop being trans’","text":"Actor Hunter Schafer says she was “shocked” to find a “male” marker on her new passport.\n\nThe actor, known for roles in “Euphoria,” “Cuckoo,” “Hunger Games: A Song of Songbirds and Snakes” and more, shared her reaction to being misgendered in a video on TikTok.\n\nSchafer, who was born in Trenton and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, says she had heard that the Trump administration was moving to change people’s gender marks on passports, but didn’t think it would actually happen.\n\n“Today I saw it on my new passport,” she said, holding up the official document in the since-expired TikTok story (see video below) and pointing to the “M.” \n\n“My gender markers were first changed in my teens, when I first got my driver’s license and then passports following, all have been female since then, hasn’t really been a problem,” said Schafer, 26. \n\nJust as in prior years, she put “female” on her passport application. She saw the “M” when she received the finished document. \n\n“I’m not making this post to fearmonger or to create drama or receive consolation,” Schafer said. “I don’t need it. But I do think it’s worth posting to sort of note the reality of the situation and that it is actually happening. And I was shocked because I just didn’t think it was actually going to happen.”\n\nSchafer, who appeared in the Yorgos Lanthimos movie “Kinds of Kindness” last year, rose to fame in 2019 playing Jules Vaughn in HBO’s “Euphoria,” which is currently in production on its long-awaited third season. \n\nSchafer also stars in Amazon’s upcoming series “Blade Runner 2099.”\n\n“I wanna acknowledge my privilege,” she continued in the TikTok video, “not only as a celebrity trans woman who is white and thin and can adhere to contemporary beauty standards and I can participate in all of that, and I pass and it still happened.” \n\nIn January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order saying that the government would only recognize female and male sexes, and that official government-issued documents and identification must “accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” meaning sex at birth, not gender. \n\nThis, of course, completely flies in the face of reality, being that people aren’t just male and female, but intersex. The order targets intersex people as well as transgender and nonbinary people, making such changes to their government-issued IDs reflect Trump’s directive and not the truth. \n\n“I do believe it is a direct result of the administration our country is currently operating under,” Schafer said of her new, incorrect passport marker. \n\n“I also want to say I don’t give a f--- that they put an ‘M’ on my passport,” she said. “It doesn’t change really anything about me or my transness. However, it does make life a little harder.”\n\nSchafer had to apply for a new passport after obtaining a temporary passport because hers was stolen from a car. She pointed out that she and many others who are affected by the marker change might get stopped now at checkpoints, given the new, incorrect designations on their passports.\n\n“I just want to say trans people are beautiful,” she said. “We are never going to stop existing. I’m never going to stop being trans. A letter and a passport can’t change that and f--- this administration. And I don’t really have an answer on what to do about this but I feel it was important to share. This is real.” \n\nThank you for reading.

That, the Oklahoma Republican said, is the collective picture painted of all the problems with government bureaucracy at all levels that imperils the U.S.’ ability to stay ahead of China in terms of cyberthreat-prevention and energy dominance. Permitting reform is one of the most important things to address with a new administration and new state government sessions beginning, the governors collectively expressed. There was bipartisan consensus at the NGA that America must move responsibly toward a future secure from malign foreign actors in both cybersecurity and energy development. NJ RESIDENTS HIT WITH DOUBLING BILLS AS LAWMAKERS FUME OVER MURPHY'S ‘ENERGY DISASTER PLAN’ \"Permitting reform is one of those issues where both Republicans and Democrats recognize the problem, we largely agree on solutions,\" Stitt said, adding it is a national security issue that the U.S. must streamline permitting. \"Our allies need affordable, reliable energy and the US has the resources to provide that,\" he said. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum spoke at length on that matter, saying America is in competition with foreign rivals like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea whether they like it or not. \"It’s key that we win the AI arms race with China,\" he said, citing bot-powered attacks that can be much more effective than human hackers. \"They would have the ability to take down the electric grid. They have the ability to disrupt everything that we know in our country. And they wouldn't have to put a single soldier on the ground, but it could completely disrupt us and our economy. So, winning that AI arms race doesn't just take software developers, it takes more electricity.\" \"We’re in a competition… against other countries that aren't slowing themselves down with the level of bureaucracy that we have,\" Burgum said, citing the threat of cyberattacks from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Burgum and the governors discussed the promise of nuclear energy and new technology that allows for the portability of such operations, where plants that generate power can be placed much closer to where that power is needed. Stitt remarked that when Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro issued an order mandating his own government to rule on infrastructure permit applications within two weeks or give the applicant their money back, he didn’t want to get \"beat by a Democrat\" in that idea so he quickly issued his own order. HOCHUL DOES APPARENT ABOUT-FACE ON NATURAL GAS AS NYC UTILITY SIGNALS MAJOR RATE HIKES Shapiro also said Pennsylvania conducted an audit of permit applications earlier in his term and found 3,400 – leading him to order there be cataloging going forward. Despite Bethlehem Steel’s stacks laying dormant 25 years on, and the massive St. Nicholas Breaker coal processor long gone, Pennsylvania remains the nation’s second-largest energy net-exporter – a fact noted by the governor. The first North American discovery of oil occurred in the mid-1800s in Venango County, and some of the longest-producing wells remain active in Pennsylvania, though the Commonwealth has been far surpassed in that regard by Texas, Alaska and other states. \"We're proud of our legacy as a national energy leader,\" Shapiro said. \"We’ve got to get to-market quickly [regarding] energy projects.\" Pennsylvania produced more than 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2023. But there has been a push-pull effect of former Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell banning fracking on state parkland, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett reversing that, and Shapiro's Democratic predecessor Tom Wolf then restoring Rendell's moratorium.

He cited the bipartisan SPEED Act out of Harrisburg, which provides for third-party permitting review while also accelerating the overall process. Burgum called the work of a governor one of the hardest, but remarked that it is about to \"become more fun than it’s ever been\" with the accessibility of the Trump administration. In that regard, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster described how cabinet secretaries had shared their own personal contact information following a Friday White House meeting – and that President Donald Trump invited calls as well but did not share his own number. \"I’ve got it, but I’m going to hold onto it,\" he joked.","summary":"CO Gov.

Access denied,” he tweeted, before adding another comment on a post of the Wicked star, saying she “looks like a crack h*e”.\n\nThe internet fired up over the 38-year-old’s comments, swiftly coming to Grande’s defence. \n\n“This is the most disrespectful and disgusting tweet I’ve seen today,” one user tweeted on X, while another commented, “It’s not okay to say this; you have no idea what damage and insecurity it can cause. Women are much more than just their appearance. Keep these statements to yourself.”\n\n“She’s more famous than you, has more money, more success, has an amazing reputation, and hasn’t been to jail,” another added, as one wondered, “Why do men think it’s ok to comment on women’s bodies?”\n\nAnd the comments went on:\n\n“Access denied ??? nobody asked for it in the first place.”\n\n“Ariana Grande wouldn’t touch you with a ten-foot pole.”\n\n“Brother she don’t know you.”\n\nDespite the onslaught, Tate – a former kickboxer – doubled down on his comments about Grande in a follow-up tweet shared on Friday after he was approached for comment by the media.\n\nIn his new tweet, he once again took a swipe at her body. \n\n“Why does the main stream media keep contacting me for comment? Have I not been clear?” he tweeted. \n\n“I’m sorry Ariana I will not offer you a chance with the Top G until you eat some hamburgers. You currently do not stand a chance with me. I hope this clarification helps. \n\nTate eventually issued a statement to BBC, of which he proudly posted on X.\n\n“I’ve decided not to pursue a relationship with Ariana at this moment in time, I hope she understands,” he told the outlet. \n\nTate is no stranger to controversy. The social media influencer was arrested in 2022 in Romania on suspicion of rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women, all of which he has strongly denied. \n\nIn recent weeks, he caught the ire of Aussie radio host Amanda Keller over his “misogynistic” tweet describing Melania Trump following the inauguration of her husband, US President Donald Trump. \n\n“Only real men can appreciate how perfectly balanced Trumps relationship is Melania,” Tate tweeted back in January. \n\n“She’s never talking alot. No opinions. Never trying to get trumps attention. She’s not trying to get noticed by media or be the star.”\n\nTate added that the First Lady “is quiet and obedient and watches [Trump] win” and \n\n“THATS A REAL WOMAN”.\n\n“It’s sad not many other men even notice this because they’re so busy being homosexual ‘best friends’ with their wife,” he concluded.\n\nIn the days that followed, Keller took to her breakfast show with Brendan “Jonesy” Jones to blast Tate and his views.\n\n“I wouldn’t ever comment on this guy unless he was this giant influence,” she said on-air at the time. “I do not approve of the things he says, but he has such an influence over young men.”\n\n“And you’re saying it’s all the neck tattoo stuff. It’s beyond that,” she added. “It is young guys in general. It is not our image of toxic guys who are listening to him. It’s young guys in general who are hearing his toxic message. And this is because, well, we all know this. Young men are looking. And I’m a mum of two boys.”\n\n“Everyone wants strong, masculine male role models. But this toxic guy has stepped into the void.

Mr Vance pointedly chose to meet its leader, Alice Weidel, during his visit to Munich.\n\nStep forward the far-left Linke party, descended from the East German communists who built the Berlin Wall and created the Stasi, the ubiquitous secret police. It has seen a surge of support for its policies of affordable housing, income equality, climate protection, and pacifism, and its call to tax billionaires out of existence.\n\nFor the precariat — and there are many in even advanced capitalist societies who fulfill that definition — there is an enhanced sense of chafing as they experience stagnating or declining real wages while simultaneously witnessing a relentlessly growing gap between the very rich and the poor.\n\nNowhere is this more visibly personified than in stunningly affluent Americans — Musk is perceived as American despite being South African-born and Canadian by citizenship — hectoring the natives on their political choices.\n\nThe US is a country where wealth is much admired. But it is a nation where the share of economic growth going to average workers, which rose for generations after the Second World War, has fallen sharply.\n\nExactly the opposite has happened to that country’s super-wealthy, among whose number we can include Donald Trump, the supporters who lined up with him on the inauguration stage at the Capitol Rotunda 34 days ago and, of course, Musk.\n\nIn US history, the number of millionaires increased from six to 100 between 1800 and 1850. \n\nBy the mid 1980s, there were 66,000 “super-rich” households worth $10m or more. By 2019 it had reached 693,000.\n\nBecoming wealthy is the American dream. But when more people are left behind than flourish, this leads to popular discontent and instability. It is key to Trump’s domestic success that he has been able to articulate this resentment in his political favour despite his wealthy trappings.\n\nBut Europe and, in particular Germany, is going to be different.\n\nThat country has long contained a radical left-wing streak. MP Heidi Reichinnek, 36, is one of Linke’s most commanding speakers.\n\nLike Angela Merkel she was raised in East Germany. Unlike the former chancellor, she has a tattoo on her forearm celebrating Rosa Luxemburg, the Marxist revolutionary murdered by the Freikorps in Berlin following the First World War.\n\nIn a video she declares an old slogan of the left: “Resist fascism in this country. To the barricades.”\n\nIt has been watched more than 30m times during its first week online.\n\nThe American intervention in Germany’s election was not a good idea in the first instance. And it will be ill-judged as history comes to mark the changes of this decade.\n\nEvery freedom has limits \n\nConsumers who like to post waspish comments online about services and goods with which they are dissatisfied have good reason to think twice after a ruling in Ireland’s High Court this week.\n\nA judge ordered a man to pay €40,000 damages after he submitted defamatory comments about a plumbing firm to the Trustpilot platform which says it provides “real reviews by real people”.\n\nTrustpilot is popular. Its 2024 ‘Transparency Report’ notes that 53m reviews were published in 2023, a 17% increase year-on-year.\n\nAt the same time, 3.3m “fake” reviews were withdrawn, an extraction rate of 6%.\n\nJust over eight out of 10 of those decisions were made by automated technology with the others requiring “specialist” intervention, by which we suppose they mean human beings.\n\nIn this case it was four comments posted in February 2022 which led to the Four Courts. An aggrieved customer described a company as “con men”, “gangsters”, “rogue traders”, and “cowboys.”\n\nSuch accusations might be expected to catch the attention of even the most junior of paralegals. Two were removed after 24 hours and two were removed after four days.\n\nVenting his opinion cost this customer €40,000 (before costs), thus illustrating common misconceptions about the place of free speech in our society.\n\nThe judge, contemplating the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court, said he considered it to be in the “moderate” category of seriousness of defamation.\n\nThe Trustpilot case was far from being the only eye-catching libel encounter this week.\n\nIn a claim which might have come straight from the pages of the author AP Herbert, lawyers swapped arguments in what could be known as The Case of the Christian Louboutin Shoes.\n\nA mother and daughter lost their defamation application for €75,000 after failing in an attempt to return footwear worth €675 without a receipt to the Brown Thomas shop on Grafton St.\n\nThe case turned on whether a Louboutin employee said the goods appeared to be “mock”, or not authentic, in the hearing of other shoppers, causing embarrassment to the two women.\n\nThe judge decided that the words were not uttered and threw out the cases with an order for costs against the mother and daughter.\n\nThese two disparate examples of the perils of reputational conflict before judges come after the appointment of barrister and Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan as minister with the tough and reforming brief for justice, home affairs, and migration in the new Government.\n\nPreviously, as a backbencher, Mr O’Callaghan had criticised the proposal in the Defamation Bill to abolish juries for libel actions.\n\nThat bill failed to pass into legislation because of the election campaign but is now said to be “a priority”. Mr O’Callaghan affirms it will be passed without significant amendments.\n\nThat is all to the good. Juries usually like to disproportionately punish traditional publishers on the false assumption that they have deep pockets and wide reach, a belief 30 years out of date.\n\nIts overall consequence is to chill the very freedom that so many citizens say they value.","summary":"US intervention in Germany’s election was not a good idea, and it will be ill-judged as history comes to mark the changes of this decade","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/ourview/arid-41579584.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9025/4512859_7_seoimage1x1_GERMANY_20Election_20123351.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:10:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com","authors":["Irishexaminer.com"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.107},{"id":293079550,"title":"Stock indexes suffer worst losses this year amid consumer, business economic fears","text":"Feb. 21 (UPI) -- Major stock indexes suffered their worst losses of the year Friday amid concerns among consumers and businesses that President Donald Trump's policies may be hurting the U.S. economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped around 1.7%, their worst one-day declines since Dec. 18, according to closing prices.

Hodges, which ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry and that states cannot prohibit them.Some lawmakers, including an Oklahoma State Senator, and other anti-LGBTQ activists have pushed for the case to be overturned. Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have signaled in a court dissent that the case should be reconsidered.A majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, though a 2024 Gallup poll found Republicans are less likely to back it than Democrats.What To Know People have protested Obergefell and its enshrinement of same-sex marriage rights since it was first decided. Since the court's 5-4 ruling, it has shifted to a more conservative majority after President Donald Trump appointed three justices during his first term. The court has also overturned previous decisions, most notably the abortion rights established in Roe v. Wade in 2022.However, same-sex marriage rights were bolstered in late 2022 when Congress passed, and President Joe Biden signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act. The law \"requires that interracial and same-sex marriage must be recognized as legal in every state in the nation,\" the president said.Staver, chairman of the conservative Christian ministry Liberty Counsel, which advocates for anti-LGBTQ policies, said in a video appearance on World Prayer Network Wednesday night, that we're at \"a ripe time to overrule Obergefell.\"He argued that \"there is no so-called constitutional right in the Constitution to same-sex marriage, that's ridiculous.\" Staver then said, \"It's not an if, it's just a matter of when\" Obergefell will be overruled.Efforts to chip away at the ruling are also taking place legislatively. Earlier this month, Oklahoma State Senator David Bullard introduced a bill seeking to provide tax credits to families with \"eligible dependent child\" which it defines as someone under 19 years old and \"is a natural child of both of the taxpayers.\"He spoke about the bill's impetus Thursday on Jenna Ellis In the Morning, saying \"The reality is we have to push back on Obergefell.\"He continued, \"If we wait too long on that Obergefell ruling to start actually sending things back up and challenging that stance that somehow we have to all get along and say that same-sex marriage is okay, it's going to be too late at some point for us to push back.\"Newsweek has reached out to GLAAD for comment via email on Friday evening.Earlier this year, Idaho Representative Heather Scott, proposed a draft memorial urging the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider Obergefell v. Hodges, in a bid to \"restore federalism.\"A 2024 Gallup poll found that 69 percent of Americans support legal same-sex marriage, with more support among Democrats than Republicans. It found that 83 percent of Democrats support same-sex marriage, 74 percent of independents, and 46 percent of Republicans.What People Are Saying The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in a X, formerly Twitter, post in 2022 following the passage of Respect of Marriage Act: \"The bill ensures federal recognition of marriage regardless of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of either spouse. The bill does not, however, codify the right of same-sex couples to marry in all 50 states, as the Supreme Court deemed constitutionally required in Obergefell v. Hodges. If Obergefell is overturned, states would still be able to deny marriage licenses to LGBTQ couples.\"Idaho Representative Heather Scott said at the January hearing, per The Idaho Stateman: \"The purpose of this resolution is just to affirm our state authority to regulate marriage.\"What Happens Next Bullard's bill is pending review in the Oklahoma Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, which will determine whether it advances to the Appropriations Committee.As of now, there is no case before the Supreme Court directly seeking to overturn Obergefell.","summary":"Some Christian conservatives are working to overturn the Supreme Court ruling that enshrines same-sex marriage.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/conservatives-push-overturn-same-sex-marriage-2034733","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2593435/mat-staver.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:06:48","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.025},{"id":293078708,"title":"AP sues Trump aides over Gulf of Mexico naming spat","text":"The Associated Press has sued senior aides to US President Donald Trump over a decision by the White House to restrict the news outlet's access to the president and other officials for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in its coverage.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed on Friday in US District Court in Washington DC, alleges the White House's decision to bar AP reporters from the Oval Office and Air Force One violates the US Constitution, including protections for free speech, by trying to control the language that it uses to report the news.\n\n\"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,\" the complaint states.\n\nResponding to questions about the lawsuit posed by conservative commentator Mercedes Schlapp, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, speaking during an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, said: \"We feel we are in the right in this position.

Zoe, who competed in shot put at Maine's Class B state indoor championship meet on Monday, said she is \"grateful\" for the president's announcement that he will be cutting federal funding to Maine over its defiance of Trump's order to keep men out of women's sports, adding that leaders in the state \"have failed our female athletes.\" \"State leaders have failed our female athletes and there needs to be repercussions for their neglect,\" Zoe said. \"We feel seen and heard because of this announcement and hope that steps will continue to be made to protect women's sports in Maine.\" ESPN STAR STEPHEN A SMITH MAKES STANCE ON TRANS INCLUSION IN WOMEN'S SPORTS CLEAR During the state championship meet, Katie Spencer, who competed as a male named John Rydzewski in pole-vaulting as recently as June 2024, out-jumped every other female by half a foot. Spencer's winning pole vault was pivotal in helping Spencer's track and field team at Greely High School in Cumberland, Maine, win the Class B state championship meet by just a single point. Following news of what happened, Trump announced that Maine would lose public funding until \"they clean that up.\" Republican Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby began sounding the alarm after Spencer won the women's pole-vaulting state championship on Monday. In an interview with Fox News Digital, she reiterated Zoe's concern that without some sort of federal intervention nothing was going to change. Several years ago, the state amended its state Human Rights Act to include protections for gender-identity, and since Democrats control both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office, Libby said there is \"a 0% chance\" they will repeal it. CA LAWMAKERS INTRODUCE BILL PROTECTING GIRLS FROM TRANS ATHLETES AFTER STATE REFUSES TO FOLLOW TRUMP'S ORDER Following Trump's Feb. 5 executive order threatening to end public funding to schools that do not keep men out of women's sports, the Maine Principals' Association, the primary governing body for high school athletics in the state, said that the president's order conflicts with state law aimed at protecting human rights. As a result, the association said it will defer to the latter when it comes to determining athletic eligibility. Sarah Perry, a civil rights attorney who has extensive experience litigating Title IX issues, said that in addition to Trump's executive order, the association is also flouting directives from the Department of Education and previously established precedent from a slew of cases that challenged former President Joe Biden's Title IX regulations allowing athletic eligibility to be determined by one's preferred gender identity. Perry noted that besides the obvious risk of losing funding, these states also open themselves up to federal Title IX investigations, something she said could potentially force them to comply with Trump's demands. Fox News Digital reached out to the Maine Principals' Association for comment but did not receive a response by publication time. NCAA RESPONDS AS CRITICS CALL OUT POTENTIAL LOOPHOLES IN ITS NEW TRANS-ATHLETE POLICY \"It is absolutely reprehensible that people in a position of power would allow this against children who are trying to compete,\" Libby said. \"There will not be enforcement from the state level, that is absolutely clear. So the only mechanism of enforcement that we have is for the administration to intervene.\" Libby noted that after posting about Spencer's state championship title on social media, a young female competitor at the meet commented that she and her teammates did not even know they would be competing against a biological male until they arrived at the state championship meet on Monday. \"It was so disheartening to find out, because, you immediately know the result,\" Libby told Fox News Digital. Libby also pointed out that it was illustrative of a larger problem in Maine when it comes to protecting women's rights in athletics. TRANS ATHLETE AND ‘UNCOMFORTABLE’ OPPONENT SPEAK OUT AFTER ALLEGED INCIDENT PROMPTS CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT \"This is not a first-time scenario here,\" she said. \"There is another boy who has been running girls' cross-country for several fall seasons now. He was a mediocre athlete as a boy, but as a girl he is doing extremely well. This is increasing in Maine. And unless something is done at the federal level, I think we're just going to see more and more of it.\" Due to the win, Spencer has now automatically qualified for the multistate regional championships, taking the spot that would have been awarded to the female athlete who garnered second place had Spencer competed in the boys' division. Trump on Thursday said that Maine will not receive federal funding until it complies with his executive order requiring schools and athletic associations to ensure biological males do not compete on women's sports teams. \"I heard men are still playing in Maine,\" the president said Friday during a speech at the annual National Governors Association conference in Washington, D.C. \"I hate to tell you this, but we're not going to give any federal money. They are still saying, ‘We want men to play in women’s sports,' and I cannot believe they are doing that… so we're not going to give them any federal funding, none whatsoever, until they clean that up.\" ‘LIGHT IT ON FIRE AND THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE’: FORMER ALL-AMERICAN TENNIS PLAYER SLAMS NCAA'S TRANSGENDER POLICY Trump met with governors at the White House on Friday, including Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, amid the conference taking place in the nation's capital. For a brief moment, Trump and Mills got into a verbal skirmish over his move to slash the state's federal funding due to its defiance against Trump's executive order barring men from competing in women's sports. \"You better do it because you're not going to get federal funding,\" Trump said to Mills, to which she responded: \"We're going to follow the law, sir. We'll see you in court.\" \"Enjoy your life after governor, because I don't think you'll be an elected official afterward,\" Trump shot back. In a statement to Fox News Digital, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Partisan elected officials and judicial activists who seek to legally obstruct President Trump’s agenda are defying the will of 77 million Americans who overwhelmingly re-elected President Trump,\" and added that \"their efforts will fail.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"All of President Trump’s executive actions are lawful, constitutional and intended to deliver on the promises he made to the American people,\" Leavitt said. \"The Trump Administration is prepared to fight these battles in court and will prevail.\"","summary":"A female high school track and field athlete is praising President Donald Trump for doing what she said Maine lawmakers won&apos;t: protect women from biological males competing against them in sports.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/maine-female-athlete-grateful-trumps-focus-trans-competitors-after-local-leaders-failed-girls","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/02/931/523/trans-flag-inlay-photo-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:02:36","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.125},{"id":293075964,"title":"Deadline diplomacy: Trump’s Gaza ‘Riviera’ scheme mobilises the Arab world","text":"The Middle East is holding its breath as diplomats across the Arab world scramble to defuse the political and humanitarian powder keg that is US President Donald Trump’s shocking proposal to relocate Gaza’s 2.2 million residents and repurpose the razed strip as a glitzy Mediterranean “Riviera” resort.\nWidely condemned as a colonialist fantasy and a blueprint for ethnic cleansing, Trump’s plan has nevertheless been enthusiastically embraced by Israel’s far-right government. But the international backlash has been swift, with Arab leaders and Middle East experts warning that such a move could plunge the region into chaos.\n“The overwhelming majority of Palestinians would likely not choose voluntarily to leave Gaza even if they could,” said Monica Marks, a professor of Middle East politics at New York University Abu Dhabi. “Many feel they have nothing left to lose now besides their pride, steadfastness, and whatever rubble is left of their homes.”\n“Expelling them would be a dirty, excruciating, bloody business, full of insurgency and a non-compliant population,” she told This Week in Asia.\n\nConventional wisdom among regional analysts is clear: Trump’s proposal is a non-starter. Experts predict fierce Palestinian resistance to any forced relocation, likely triggering yet another blood-soaked military crackdown by Israeli forces.\nBut the fallout would not stop at Gaza’s borders. Egypt and Jordan, the two countries Trump has identified as potential destinations for displaced Palestinians, have made it clear that hosting millions of Gazan refugees is simply not an option.\nJordan’s King Abdullah, during a February 11 meeting with Trump at the White House, offered to take in 2,000 Palestinian children with cancer for medical treatment – a symbolic gesture of goodwill. Egypt, meanwhile, has reportedly allowed around 15,000 Gazans to cross its border in recent months. But neither nation has agreed to any large-scale relocation plans.\n\n‘Recipe for disaster’\nRelocating thousands more Palestinians into Egypt’s neighbouring Sinai peninsula would be “a recipe for disaster”, said Cairo-based analyst Shahira Amin.\nSuch a move may “spark an uprising” against long-ruling Egyptian President Abdel Fateh el- Sisi and could destabilise his government, said Amin, a non-resident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council think tank’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative.\nShe said most Egyptians were supportive of the Palestinian cause and would see their mass displacement as “a betrayal on the part of the Sisi regime, should it cave in under US pressure”.\nThe plan would also risk radicalising refugees and setting the stage for future conflict, jeopardising Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel. “If rockets are fired into Israel from Sinai, Israel would certainly retaliate with counter-attacks, dragging Egypt into a war,” Amin said.\nVirtually no issue touches hearts and motivates passions across the Arab world like the plight of Palestinians\nMonica Marks, Middle East politics professor\nThat would not bode well for the Gulf monarchies either. “Any scenario in which there is state collapse, chaos, or widespread turmoil in either Egypt or Jordan would pose an enormous threat to the stability and security” of neighbouring Arab states, said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington-based risk consultancy.\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain had been “very firm in their opposition to Trump’s deranged ethnic-cleansing plan for Gaza”, he added.\nMarks agreed that Trump’s presumptuous proposal was seen throughout the Arab world as an “unrealistic ethnic-cleansing fantasy with profoundly disturbing potential”.\n“Virtually no issue touches hearts and motivates passions across the Arab world like the plight of Palestinians,” she said.\n“That’s especially true now, after so many Arabs throughout the region have spent the past 16 months watching Israel wage what they strongly believe became a genocide against the Palestinian people”.\nJordan and Egypt are both heavily dependent on the US economically and militarily, meaning any threats made by Trump to cut aid would hit hard, Marks said.\n“These regimes are damned if they do and if they don’t,” she said, adding that their very survival “could be existentially threatened by opposing or facilitating Trump’s Riviera ethnic-cleansing plan”.\n\nSearching for alternatives\nArab leaders are now racing against the clock to propose a viable alternative. Egypt is set to host an emergency Arab summit early next month to address the crisis, with hopes that a more palatable solution can satisfy Trump’s ambitions, safeguard regional stability – and avoid what by most legal definitions would be a war crime.\n“I don’t think it’s going to happen,” said Barbara Slavin, a distinguished Middle East fellow at the Stimson Centre think tank in Washington, of the Gaza scheme. She believes that Arab states will “try to cobble together a plan and convince Trump that he can get the credit for it”.\nSaudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to play a pivotal role, with speculation mounting that he may raise the issue during ongoing talks in the country between the US and Russia over a Ukraine war deal.\nSlavin floated the possibility of a compromise. “It would have to entail some new and improved, non-Hamas Palestinian technocratic government, Arab peacekeepers, and temporary housing for Palestinians while rubble is cleared,” she said.\n\nDespite publicly backing Trump’s plan, even Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu likely recognises the dangers of implementing it, according to Slavin. “Even Bibi understands that a mass expulsion of Gazans … would be enormously destabilising to Jordan and Egypt and possibly force them to end their peace treaties with Israel”, she said.\nIf implemented, Trump’s Gaza plan would be a “tremendous propaganda gift to the Iranians”, Slavin said – especially after the string of strategic setbacks Tehran and its “Axis of Resistance” allies have suffered since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023.\nIran and its Axis partners “are simply too weak” to wage war on the US and Israel over the plan, Slavin said. Attacks by Tehran-allied groups such as the Houthis in Yemen could result, “but it wouldn’t be World War III”.\nAnd though some Israelis “might welcome” the mass expulsion of Palestinians, she said “many would see it as an echo of what happened to so many European Jews in the 1930s”.\n\nThe repercussions could reverberate far beyond the region, however. Forcibly expelling Gaza’s population would not only fuel anti-American sentiment, but also embolden terrorist groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and destabilise US allies across the Arab world.\nSuch groups “have always used catastrophes … like the one we are seeing in Gaza as opportunities to forward their ideological and strategic interests”, said Abdul Basit, a senior associate fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies’ International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore.\nBasit predicted that militant groups would seize on the displacement of Palestinians to recruit new members and radicalise a generation of young Muslims – just as with the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan earlier this century.\nThe pro-Isis online sphere was quick to capitalise on the comments\nLucas Webber, threat intelligence analyst\nIsis sympathisers have already weaponised Trump’s comments, observers say. “The pro-Isis online sphere was quick to capitalise on the comments and … disseminate propaganda about it,” said Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism, a British consultancy focused on disrupting online terrorist threats.\nThe mass displacement of Gazans would not only allow militant groups “to look at this displaced population as a group from where they would like to recruit”, but also paint various Middle Eastern powers as “failed and weak leaders of the Muslim world”, Basit said.\nThe ripple effects could also reach the West, where heightened polarisation and Islamophobia risk further fracturing Europe’s multicultural societies. Basit said the continent’s rising far-right movements would likely leverage the turmoil to “entrench their anti-minority sentiment” and target Muslims.\nA gift to US rivals\nMeanwhile, China and Russia are poised to exploit any fallout from Trump’s Gaza gambit. Analysts predict that it would drive Arab states closer to Beijing and Moscow, undermining US influence in the region.\nGoing ahead with the plan would be “an own-goal of mammoth proportions that would reverberate for a very long time”, Slavin said, describing it as a “massive gift to China”, which could position itself as the sole defender of international law.\nAfter the world has watched Washington’s virtually unconditional support for Israel’s 16-month campaign of destruction in Gaza, forcefully expelling its remaining population, as Trump has proposed, “would only further damage” the international standing of the US, said Cafiero of Gulf State Analytics.\nChina and Russia are “well positioned to take advantage of such heightened tension”, he said – and more than willing to step into any rift in relations between the US and Arab world.\nAs Egypt’s emergency summit on March 4 approaches, the world waits to see if Arab leaders can craft a diplomatic lifeline – or whether Trump’s incendiary Gaza scheme will push the Middle East closer to the brink.","summary":"With lives at stake, the Arab world is rallying to counter what analysts described as the US president’s ‘deranged ethnic-cleansing plan’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3299683/deadline-diplomacy-trumps-gaza-riviera-scheme-mobilises-arab-world","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/21/516a1f71-42ba-4e36-8f02-e39f6b97a68d_6687ac5d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-22 00:00:14","author":"Tom Hussain","authors":["Tom Hussain"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":293077648,"title":"Letters: The human cost of Trump’s cuts is unknown","text":"Human cost of Trump’s\npolicies is unknown\n\nAmericans across the country aren’t fully aware and aren’t seeing coverage of hundreds of demonstrations everywhere, every day, across the nation, in response to the mass firings and U.S. agencies closing around the country, many in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile Donald Trump and Elon Musk tear down our country and spit at our values, people all over the world suffer as food and medicine sit in ports.

India would particularly look to shield its farm sector.The government is also examining the impact of reciprocal tariffs proposed by the US administration on its trading partners. The idea is to look at India’s competitors in the export market to assess if there is any relative price benefit and work out a strategy. “We have begun talks with line ministries,” one official said. India exports auto components worth about $15 billion (`1.2 lakh crore) at nil duty to the US annually, officials said. The import of auto parts into India, however, attracts 5-15% duty. This was flagged during an inter-ministerial meeting to discuss the IndiaUS BTA.

These measures assume significance as US President Donald Trump has termed India as a tariff abuser and threatened reciprocal levies.It was also highlighted that there is negligible trade of ready-to-drive e vehicles with the US, so a duty relaxation in this segment may not significantly hurt domestic industry. “The US is a high-cost country and there is no sizable American manufacturer in India.

Smartphones, which is now the dominant category in electronics exports, have increased their contribution to 60% in FY25 from 52% in the last fiscal.118461686Smartphone exports in the 10 months of this fiscal stood at Rs 1.55 lakh crore-.January has been a record month for smartphone exports with outward shipments to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore ($3 billion), of which iPhones contributed over Rs 16,500 crore ($2 billion). Led by smartphones, electronics exports in the month jumped over 85% to Rs 35,416 crore in the month this year.Threat of Reciprocal TariffsA year ago, electronics exports stood at Rs 19,067.60 crore, according to Ministry data.Boosted by the surge, the electronics segment is now the third largest contributor of exports, with the category closing in on petroleum exports, which has seen a decline to the tune of 23.66% in the first 10 months of the fiscal.In contrast, electronics exports have shown a massive jump over the last few years, particularly after the implementation of the production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones. Following the scheme, Apple started shifting its supply chains to India and made the country a second home for iPhone manufacturing after China.Electronics exports improved its ranking in the top 10 to become the country’s third largest category by FY24. However, experts say the industry should be cautious about the threat of reciprocal tariffs by the Donald Trump administration. “The industry and government are working together to chart out a roadmap to avert any negative consequences for the sector,” said an industry executive, asking not to be named.The industry has been demanding rationalisation of tariffs so that India remains competitive visà-vis China and Vietnam.As per India Cellular and Electronics Association, mobile phone production in India has doubled since the launch of the PLI scheme from Rs 2.20 lakh crore in FY 2020-21 to Rs 4.22 lakh crore in FY 23-24.","summary":"India's electronics exports have significantly expanded, becoming the third-largest contributor to the country’s exports.

Reyes, who is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the U.S. military.Newsweek reached out to Reyes' chambers for comment via email.Why It MattersTrump on January 27 issued an executive order instructing the Pentagon to update its guidance \"regarding trans-identifying medical standards for military service and to rescind guidance.\" After the order went into effect, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memo saying transgender people would no longer be allowed to enlist in the military.The order sparked a lawsuit from transgender service members, who argued it is unconstitutional to ban them from serving. It is one of several legal cases Trump is facing over the flurry of executive orders issued in the early days of his second term.What To KnowDOJ Chief of Staff Chad Mizelle filed the ethics complaint against Reyes on Friday, alleging \"misconduct\" during case proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 18 and February 19.Mizelle accused Reyes of engaging in \"hostile and egregious misconduct that violated Canons 2A and 3A(3) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges,\" according to the order, posted to X, formerly Twitter, by the Article III Project.During the contentious hearing, Reyes seemed deeply skeptical of Trump's executive order.\"You and I both agree that the greatest fighting force that world history has ever seen is not going to be impacted in any way by less than 1 percent of the soldiers using a different pronoun than others might want to call them,\" Reyes said while addressing Justice Department lawyer Jason Lynch. \"Would you agree with that?\"She also said the premise that there are only two genders is not \"biologically correct.\" Mizelle raised concerns about these remarks in the ethics complaint.\"While Judge Reyes was not sure exactly how many sexes there were, she hypothesized that could be 'anywhere near about 30 different intersex examples.' It was during these lines of questioning that Judge Reyes engaged in the unacceptable misconduct at issue in this complaint, questioning a Department of Justice attorney regarding his religious beliefs and then using him unwillingly as a physical prop in her courtroom theatrics,\" he wrote.He pointed to her questioning a DOJ attorney about what Jesus \"would say to telling a group of people that they are so worthless, so worthless that we're not going to allow them into a homeless shelter?\" He said her question lacked relevance and placed the attorney in an \"untenable position.\"He also accused Reyes of using an attorney as a \"physical prop\" after a demonstration about discrimination in which she hypothetically said she would not allow University of Virginia Law School graduates to appear before her.Mizelle wrote that the matter warrants \"at minimum\" a \"further investigation to determine whether these incidents represent a pattern of misconduct that requires more significant remedial measures.\"What People Are SayingWriter Ari Drennen, in a post to X: \"The Trump DOJ is BIG MAD about their lawyers being humiliated in court.\"Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, on X: \"In this case, whatever you think about the issue, the DOJ is correct.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nAn unknown number of Musk’s security guards have been deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, according to CNN, which cited three unnamed law enforcement officials familiar with the matter and noted Musk has told close contacts about an increase in death threats against him.\n\nMusk, a special government employee, does not have a Secret Service detail like President Donald Trump, though sources told CNN the size of the billionaire’s detail is rivaled only by the president’s.\n\nMusk said Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference his private security detail is not “enormous” before suggesting it could be bigger.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service and Justice Department did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhat Rights Does Musk’s Security Detail Have After Being Deputized?\n\nIt’s unclear what specific authorities Musk’s detail has been given following deputation, but it is possible the group could carry weapons on federal premises, a right typically granted to special deputies. However, the rights of special deputies can be limited to their specific assignment, meaning they are only granted certain rights in particular situations, events and places, according to a Justice Department audit of the U.S. Marshals Service’s deputation authority. Private security details are barred from carrying weapons in places like the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told CBS, though he did not elaborate on Musk’s security staff. The deputation of Musk’s detail also means the U.S. Marshals Service could be held liable if something went wrong with the security members it deputized, CNN reported.\n\nWhat Is Special Deputation?\n\nSpecial deputation refers to granting designated people federal law enforcement authority, according to the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, which adds the process allows people to act as federal law enforcement officers under supervision of the federal government. To become a special deputy, individuals must submit a request to the attorney general and explain the reasons behind their request, according to the Justice Department. Deputations remain in effect for one year.\n\nHave Other People—like Anthony Fauci—had Deputized Security?\n\nYes. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who advised Trump on the COVID-19 pandemic, had his security detail deputized in 2020 after receiving threats to his safety. However, Fauci was reportedly guarded by other government employees—specifcally, agents from the Health and Human Services inspector general's office—unlike Musk, who has private security.\n\nCan Musk Receive Secret Service Protection?\n\nYes, according to the U.S. Secret Service, which notes protection can be authorized for individuals through an executive order by the president.\n\nAn Indiana man was recently charged with felony intimidation for allegedly making multiple threats against Musk on his platform X, formerly known as Twitter. One of the threats, according to Fox 7, said “We're gunning you down, next Muskrat.\"\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nWe estimate Musk’s net worth at $383 billion, making him the world’s wealthiest person ahead of Mark Zuckerberg ($236 billion) and Jeff Bezos ($230 billion).\n\nKey Background\n\nThe New York Times equated Musk’s security detail to “a mini-Secret Service” last year, reporting that Musk travels with as many as 20 security guards tasked with devising escape routes and clearing rooms before Musk enters them. Musk and his companies have spent millions of dollars on his security, according to the Times, which reported three people close to the businessman have said he has become more fearful and isolated as a result of threats to his safety. Musk has publicly spoken about his security and death threats against him on multiple occasions, saying at Thursday’s Conservative Political Action Conference he is “open to ideas” on improving his security. At a town hall last year, the billionaire also linked his involvement in politics to an increase in threats against his security, saying “dramatically increasing my risk of being assassinated and engaging in politics are not what I want to do.” Musk’s concerns about his security stretch back years: In 2022, his social media platform X suspended an account dedicated to tracking the whereabouts of his private jet using public data, and also suspended several journalists whom Musk accused of posting his “exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nIs Elon Musk Running DOGE?

Instead, the justices held Trump’s request “in abeyance” — they will let the case play out in the lower court before making a decision. A hearing in that court is scheduled for February 26.\n\nLiberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that they would have denied Trump's request.\n\nConservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas would have granted it.\n\nGorsuch claimed that the lower-court judge “effectively commanded the president and other executive branch officials to recognize and work with someone whom the president sought to remove from office.”\n\nTrump’s mass purges, agency shutdowns and attempts to block federal funding, as well as other executive actions targeting transgender Americans and birthright citizenship, have been met with more than three dozen lawsuits from federal workers, state officials, nonprofit groups and civil rights attorneys, among others, across the country.\n\nThe administration’s request to the Supreme Court arrived one day after Trump wrote what appeared to be a declaration that he does not believe he can break any law. “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” the president wrote on Truth Social and X. Days later, he declared himself “king,” and the White House shared images of the president wearing a crown.\n\n“I always abide by the courts, and then I’ll have to appeal it. But then what he’s done is he’s slowed down the momentum, and it gives crooked people more time to cover up the books,” Trump said from the Oval Office earlier this month.\n\n“So yeah, the answer is, I always abide by the courts, always abide by them, and we’ll appeal, but appeals take a long time,” he added.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters this month that the administration “will comply with these orders but it is also the administration's position that we will ultimately be vindicated.”","summary":"Hampton Dellinger will remain at the Office of Special Counsel, for now","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/supreme-court-trump-hampton-dellinger-b2702669.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/21/23/07/US-secretary-of-commerce-sworn-in-at-White-House-o6451nuw.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/3Vv7eCsx-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:50:21","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":293078356,"title":"Colorado lawmakers condemn Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons — with all Republicans rejecting resolution","text":"The Colorado legislature on Friday officially condemned the pardons issued by President Donald Trump to people convicted for their actions in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — but its resolution passed over the universal objections of the Republican minority.\n\nAll 12 Republicans in the Senate and all 22 in the House voted against the amendment. House Republicans turned their backs in protest as the resolution was being read on the House floor Friday and then filibustered the resolution for the next several hours. The Senate approved the resolution earlier this month.\n\nDemocrats, who occupy nearly two-thirds of the seats in the state legislature, universally supported the condemnation. (One Democratic representative voted no accidentally, then signed on as a co-sponsor of the resolution to signal her support.)\n\n“We need to stand up and protect the rule of law and our democratic norms. That is critical,” said Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat.\n\nOne of Trump’s first acts as he started his second term last month was to pardon more than 1,500 people involved in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Following months of lies asserted by Trump and others about his loss, a mob of people stormed the building to disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election. They smashed windows, broke into congressional members’ offices and attacked Capitol police officers.\n\nMore than 100 police officers were injured, one died after suffering two strokes and several others died by suicide after the attack. A Trump supporter, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed during the riot as she tried to climb through a broken window of a barricaded Capitol doorway. More than 1,200 people were convicted in connection with the riot.\n\nSen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, introduced Senate Joint Resolution 6 — titled “Condemnation of January 6 Insurrection Pardons” — on the Senate floor on Feb. 10. He invoked his time in the Army and serving in Iraq, as well as friends there who died in service to the country and the Constitution.\n\nThe Jan. 6 riot was a direct attack on the country’s founding document, he said, and pardoning those responsible was in insult to that service and sacrifice. \n\n“Every justification to either endorse or sidestep what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, is rooted in lies,” Hinrichsen said. “So colleagues, if we cannot, regardless of party, muster the courage to speak with truth about the greatest assault on this Constitution from within our own citizenry in 160 years — or condemn the aid and comfort now given to its enemies, who sought to render the sacrifices of those who gave their lives in its defense to have been in vain — then any words of solemnity to that sacrifice are nothing but hollow, insulting utterances. \n\n“I have no desire to sit and smile politely or (engage in) such performance, and I ask for a bipartisan aye vote.”\n\nWhile every Republican in the Senate voted against the resolution, only Sen. Mark Baisley, of Woodland Park — a rumored gubernatorial candidate — spoke against it. He called it “an inappropriate and shameful use of the resolution process and beneath the dignity of this legislative body.”\n\nThe resolution became an explicit flashpoint in the House when it was heard Friday. Republicans were intent on dragging out the debate. Members argued the resolution didn’t address problems the state is facing, such as the high cost of living, and was being wielded as as political wedge.\n\n“Is this resolution designed to actually condemn someone and his actions, and make some moral statement about what he did or his leadership?” said Rep. Stephanie Luck, a Penrose Republican. “Or is this just political theater designed for a particular constituency, who right now is spinning a little bit because the election results this last November didn’t go their way?”\n\nShe later listed off the names of several Coloradans arrested for their roles in the attack, including for kicking, punching and dragging police officers. Though body-worn camera footage shows the extent of the violence during the riot, Luck said Friday that “the vast majority” of Jan. 6 rioters “walked around the people’s house” and “took a little tour.”\n\nThough Republican lawmakers accused Democrats of wasting time, Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, posted on social media that Republicans were planning to “fight for six hours and (Democrats) won’t be able to pass any bills!!!!”\n\nThe House Republicans’ filibuster lasted more than five hours. Democrats then brought forward a bill regulating the sale of gun ammunition — which Republicans were also set to oppose at length — in the late afternoon.\n\nRep. Scott Bottoms, a Colorado Springs Republican and declared gubernatorial candidate, said he would use the resolution as a campaign issue and predicted it would win him hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\nMabrey defended the urgency of the resolution. It is a declaration of the state’s values, he said, and the country’s values.\n\n“It is a violation of the norms of our country that the president pardoned all these people — people who assaulted police officers. (Trump) is saying he does not want to let justice happen,” Mabrey said. \n\nA Colorado judge in 2023 found Trump engaged in insurrection for his actions around the Jan. 6 riot, and the Colorado Supreme Court found he should be disqualified from the 2024 ballot because he violated the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court overruled the Colorado court’s ban on Trump from the ballot but left the insurrection finding in place. There has been no formal conviction of Trump on the basis of insurrection, however.\n\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot.","summary":"\"We need to stand up and protect the rule of law and our democratic norms.

This is up from the current 2.3%.\n\nThe Prime Minister will also deliver an invitation from the King for a state visit to the UK, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe US president is known to admire the royal family.\n\nSir Keir’s trip to Washington will come after Ukraine marks three years since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. A defence announcement is expected to mark the occasion.\n\nIt will also come after a visit to Washington by Emmanuel Macron.\n\nMr Trump said Sir Keir and the French president “haven’t done anything” to end the war in Ukraine in the last three years.\n\n“They didn’t do anything either (to end the war).

Trump nominated McFadden to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 2017 and then was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 84-10.After Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, the AP said it would not abide by the change since the body of water \"has carried that name for more than 400 years.\"The AP spokesperson Lauren Easton previously told Newsweek that, \"Freedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people.

Compounding the problem, pandemic era federal funds have mostly run out. And federal outlays for homeless services, like other federal funding streams, are uncertain under President Donald Trump.\n\nVega Pedersen called on Metro and the state to backfill $85 million of what her budget advisers project will be a $104 million gap between the county’s available funds and the cost of continuing its current homelessness services into the next fiscal year. \n\n“Multnomah County has done what we said we were going to do by getting money out the door quickly in ways that are improving conditions in neighborhoods all across the county we serve to the benefit of our entire region and state,” Vega Pedersen said.\n\nShe also proposed that officials in Washington County and Clackamas County agree to engage in “conversations” with Multnomah County officials to determine regional spending priorities going forward. Neither county was able to offer immediate comment.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Vega Pederson said that if the county is unable to fill the budget gap, hundreds of shelter beds and other services currently provided by the county’s homeless services department would go away. She declined to name any specific programs that would be cut. A more detailed proposed budget for the homeless services department is expected to be made public late Friday afternoon, county officials said. \n\nVega Pedersen said she had spoken to Gov. Tina Kotek about her request for $55 million from state coffers for the next fiscal year’s budget. She is arguing that Multnomah County is disproportionately responsible for helping the state’s homeless population and deserves a larger portion of the funds.\n\nAbout 18% of Oregon’s residents live in Multnomah County, according to U.S. Census data. And 31% of the state’s homeless population lived in Multnomah County in 2023, according to the latest federally mandated count. Updated numbers from a January 2025 count are expected this spring.\n\nIn addition, Vega Pedersen sent a letter Friday asking Metro President Lynn Peterson for $30 million of that agency’s “unspent administrative…funds to help us to continue our critical homeless services work and prevent further crisis on our streets.” The county would pass on $10 million of that to Portland, according to the letter.\n\nOther local officials, speaking on background, reported being surprised at the huge potential shortfall.\n\n“Our team will be working over the coming days to come up with ideas on how to address this,” Metro spokesperson Nick Christensen wrote in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive. “Our top priority – everyone’s top priority – needs to be helping people get housed and sheltered, and maintaining our successes.”\n\nThis is a developing story that may be updated.\n\nLillian Mongeau Hughes covers homelessness and mental health for The Oregonian.

The US President has said the figure stands at $300 billion.\n\nThe prospect of extracting Ukraine’s natural resources has evidently been part of the Trump administration’s plan from the outset. \n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the US President, embarked on a trip to Kyiv last autumn shortly before Zelensky unveiled is Victory Plan and suggested that Ukraine’s mineral reserves could be put up for sale. \n\nGraham and other lawmakers at the time released a statement in which they positioned Ukraine as a potential economic partner of the US that could reduce America’s reliance on the likes of China for rare earth minerals. \n\nLast week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered Kyiv a deal as part of ongoing negotiations to secure Ukraine’s long-term security in the event of a ceasefire agreement with Russia.\n\nAccording to a private draft of the proposal seen by The Telegraph, this would see the US take 50% of revenues received by Ukraine from the extraction of natural resources.\n\nIt would also grant the US 50% of the financial value of ‘all new licenses issued to third parties’ for the future monetization of these resources.\n\nBessent said such an ‘economic commitment’ would grant Ukraine a ‘long-term security shield’ provided by Washington – an idea that Zelensky first proposed as part of his ‘Victory Plan’ unveiled before Western allies and Ukraine’s parliament in October. \n\nAt that time, the Ukrainian President said Kyiv could sign an agreement with the US, EU and other unnamed allies that would allow for joint investments and use of Ukraine’s natural resources. \n\nBut upon reviewing the deal proposed last week by Bessent, Zelensky and his aides discovered that there were no concrete security guarantees outlined in the document. \n\nInstead, it seemed more akin to the likes of an exploitative contract imposed on vanquished adversaries, not a mutually beneficial agreement between allies.\n\nIt came shortly after Trump suggested that Kyiv could begin to compensate the US for aid sent over the last three years with ‘like $500 billion worth’ of critical minerals.\n\nUkraine has trillions of dollars worth of natural resources, including many rare earth minerals vital for the manufacture of modern technology – though many are found in the industrial heartlands in the east, currently occupied by Russia.\n\nMining analysts and economists say Ukraine currently has no commercially operational rare earth mines. \n\nMany companies slowed or ceased operations at the start of the war, and restarting industry in a war-torn country will present a mammoth challenge for any companies willing to take the risk.\n\nZelensky refused to sign the deal as offered last week, telling reporters over the weekend: ‘It was not in our interests today… not in the interests of sovereign Ukraine’.\n\nSenior government sources told the Financial Times that the deal provided scant details of what this ‘long-term security shield’ would look like. \n\n‘When we looked at the details there was nothing there [about future US security guarantees],’ one official said, while another told The Telegraph that a clause in the contract awarded the US ‘a lien on revenues’. \n\nIn other words, the official said, the contract meant ‘pay us first, and then feed your children’.\n\nZelensky told reporters later Monday that any US-Ukraine economic treaty must see security guarantees ‘included at least somehow’, adding that his country was not just a ‘simple supplier of raw materials’.\n\n‘Ukraine is blessed with significant lithium, titanium, and other rare earth minerals that are needed by the American economy.\n\n‘Expanding economic cooperation with Ukraine makes America stronger and accelerates Ukraine’s economic recovery,’ the statement read.\n\n‘An agreement with Ukraine in this area would make the US less dependent on foreign adversaries for rare earth minerals.’\n\nEarlier this month, Zelensky also showed reporters the location of Ukraine’s mineral deposits, unfurling a map on a table in the heavily defended president’s office in Kyiv.\n\nAround half of it looked to be on Russia’s side of the current frontlines, but large amounts of vital resources were found in central Ukraine. \n\n‘If we are talking about a deal, then let’s do a deal, we are only for it,’ Zelensky said two weeks ago, emphasizing Ukraine’s need for security guarantees from its allies as part of any settlement.\n\nBut Ukraine claimed the contract offered by Bessent was ruthless, seeking to exploit the country’s vast resources for little in return. \n\nAccording to the private draft seen by the Telegraph, the contract not only covered mineral resources, but the ‘economic value associated with… oil and gas resources, ports, other infrastructure (as agreed)’, leaving it unclear what else might be encompassed. \n\n‘This agreement shall be governed by New York law, without regard to conflict of laws principles,’ it stated, going on to say that ‘for all future licences, the US will have a right of first refusal for the purchase of exportable minerals’.\n\nAn analysis of the contract’s terms by the Telegraph concluded that, if the terms of the draft dated February 7, 2025 draft were accepted by Ukraine, Trump’s demands would amount to a higher share of Ukrainian GDP than reparations imposed on Germany following World War I.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump appears to have won his trade standoff with Volodymyr Zelensky, as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post:

including black Americans, won’t be in New York — thanks to the #Resistance","text":"Speaking at a Black History event Thursday in the White House, President Donald Trump praised the memory of Prince Estabrook, a slave and Massachusetts Minuteman who was wounded at the 1775 Battle of Lexington.\n\nTrump noted that the African American patriot was “one of the first in the nation to spill blood in that very, very tough time,” and went on to announce that his statue will be erected in the coming National Garden of American Heroes — a project the president put forth in his first term, and has revived.\n\nThe new “statue park,” Trump explained, will “honor hundreds of our greatest Americans to ever live, including countless black American icons.”\n\nTo great applause, the president named Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass and Muhammad Ali, among others, as examples of the caliber of American heroes whose statues will populate this new park.\n\nKobe Bryant, Trump added, will be included, as will the NASA mathematicians featured in “Hidden Figures.”\n\nSounds great! If only the nation already had a world-class national “statue park,” featuring bronze-cast representations of the greatest Americans.\n\nImagine if New York City had an attraction such as this.\n\nOh, wait — we do: The Hall of Fame for Great Americans, inaugurated in 1901, stands proudly atop a Bronx bluff overlooking the Harlem River.\n\nSituated on the former NYU campus, now Bronx Community College, the Hall of Fame was designed by the great Stanford White as a colonnade around the majestic Gould Library.\n\nNow fallen into obscurity, the Hall of Fame was once a national obsession and tourist attraction drawing tens of thousands of visitors annually.\n\nNominations to the Hall of Fame were closely covered by the national media through the 1950s.\n\nNew plaques and busts were installed once a decade, attended by pomp and presidents.\n\nThe whole thing was taken very seriously; changes to the voting process were debated in The New York Times.\n\nThis once-glorious site is now a dilapidated mess. The pavers and ceiling tiles are cracked, and limestone cornices have fallen apart.\n\nSteps to reach the Hall of Fame from Sedgwick Avenue have crumbled.\n\nEven the website for the Hall of Fame isn’t quite sure if the place is actually open.\n\n“While we are closed,” it reads, “please refer to our Hall of Fame Brochure.” \n\nThe only work that’s been done on the Hall in years was the removal, in 2017, of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nFixing the site will cost about $12 million, none of which is forthcoming.\n\nCUNY, which technically administers it, prefers — quite plausibly — to use its money for other ends.\n\nIt’s a shame that President Trump wants to build a brand new National Garden of American Heroes when we have the foundation for it right here in his old backyard.\n\nImagine if he put all the money to fund his Garden into repairing and expanding the already beautiful Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Bronx would blossom. It would be, as Trump likes to say, incredible.\n\nBut there’s no chance that will happen. New York’s political class, out of step as usual with the popular mood, thinks it’s still 2017, and that its job is to “#Resist,” as if the Empire State was occupied territory.\n\nThe day after Trump’s victory in November, state Attorney General Tish James and Gov. Kathy Hochul held a bizarre joint press conference promising to “fight” Trump “every step of the way.”\n\nThe one local Democrat who has indicated his willingness to work with the White House, Mayor Eric Adams, has been pilloried for it — and is barraged with calls for his immediate removal — by a cadre of minnows who think they are sharks.\n\nThe American people are generally pleased with the MAGA agenda, and polls show they think things are looking up.\n\nThere is a breeze of patriotism rippling flags across the land.\n\nMeanwhile, the leaders of our state scarcely see themselves as part of America.\n\nTheir cynicism, louche ethics and terrible policies have cratered the quality of life from Montauk to Malone.\n\nThey wouldn’t want a National Garden of American Heroes if it was gift-wrapped for them — especially not if it came from Trump.\n\nThey’d find it embarrassing and gauche.\n\nTheir loss. And New York’s.\n\nSeth Barron’s book, “Weaponized,” will be published by Humanix this year.","summary":"New York’s political class, out of step as usual with the popular mood, thinks it’s still 2017, and that its job is to “#Resist.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/opinion/trumps-garden-of-heroes-including-black-americans-wont-be-in-new-york-thanks-to-the-resistance/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/faces-bust-bust-thomas-jonathan-24551924-e1740176745281.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:46:08","author":"Seth Barron","authors":["Seth Barron"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.127},{"id":293077454,"title":"Wesley Donehue: from humble beginnings to political power player","text":"While working at BI-LO as a teenager, Donehue’s first major purchase wasn’t a car — it was a computer.\n\n“I’m a real nerd, a sci-fi nerd.

But We Need a New Nominee.\"In a recent interview for the Broadway adaptation of his hit film, Good Night and Good Luck, Clooney, 63, addressed what lead him to writing the controversial op-ed less than four months before the historic election. \n\nClooney revealed the moment his support for Biden shifted took place at the fundraiser he attended shortly before the piece was released, when he noticed the former president \"was less sharp\" and watched him be led off stage by ex-President Barack Obama.He noted how he had spoken with Biden for hours at a Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. a year prior, but while speaking with the then-81-year-old at the event in Hollywood, he realized \"saw someone much less sharp.\" \n\nClooney additionally placed blame on the press, saying: \"The media, in many ways, dropped the ball.\" \n\nWhile he reiterated, \"I've always liked Joe Biden and I like him still,\" he doubled-down on how he the incapacities he saw made it difficult for him to continue defending his record and publicly supporting his campaign.The Oscar-winner continued: \"The Biden administration was terrible at explaining that we're a world economy, where we were actually doing better than all the other G7 countries. \n\n\"They were bad at telling the story because their messenger was not working at his best, to say the least.\" \n\nLater in the interview, Clooney addressed meeting Trump earlier in his career – and compared him to Ebenezer Scrooge. \n\nHe said: \"He was a New York guy. He'd be at a restaurant and he'd be like, 'What's the name of that cocktail waitress?'\"Clooney also said he hopes Trump will experience a \"Scrooge\" moment and change course on his policies.\n\nHe said: \"We've got to hope that he can have that Scrooge night where he wakes up and there are some ghosts of Christmas there that say, 'There's some good things you can do for people.'\"\n\nThis was not the first time Clooney has issued a message for Trump in recent weeks. During an appearance on Stephen Colbert's late night show, the movie star spoke openly about his political beliefs and Kamala Harris losing the presidential election.While discussing his feelings on Trump seizing power again, he referenced the January 6 insurrection as he joked: \"Well I don't know, what am I supposed to do? Storm the f------ Capitol?\"\n\nHe then sent other message to Trump, saying: \"Good for you. I hope you do well because our country needs it, and we will meet you in 3.5 years and see where we go next.\"","summary":"George Clooney recalled seeing 'someone much less sharp' when speaking with now former president Joe Biden at a fundraiser.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/george-clooney-joe-biden-reveals-moment-support-shifted-donald-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/0qRAP2ZBO/0x0/hollywood-turns-back-george-clooney-joe-biden-op-ed-pp-1721077738387.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:45:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.022},{"id":293074776,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: Outside the Maine-stream","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

He’s also the communications director of the White House, because he dictates the message. He executes the agenda,” she said Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “One of the things I love about President Donald Trump, and I think what makes him such a great leader, is that he’s so deeply involved in every decision that is made, every speech that is written, every executive order that is signed.”\n\nWhile most politicians read a script written for them by staff, Trump “cares about every word he is saying and every action he is taking,” including the punctuation and capitalization of words.\n\nThe president’s mood is “jubilant, excited, exhilarated, and defiant,” the press secretary said.\n\n“This is the most transparent and accessible president we have ever had, despite what the media wants to say,” said Leavitt, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2022 and now at 27 is the youngest-ever presidential press secretary. \n\n“Extensive preparation” goes into each press briefing, Leavitt said, thanking the team at the White House that helps her prepare. She also leans on policy experts “to figure out what is fake news versus what is truth.”\n\n“So, a lot of preparation, a lot of reading, talking to the president to understand his thinking,” she said, “and then when I got to the podium, I realized the president is delivering on everything he said he was going to do, which makes my job as his spokeswoman easy, because I’m not working for a politician who’s lying, and we have to spin. I’m working for a man who said things, and he’s delivering on those things every day.”\n\nThe White House Press Office has a strategy of “offense,” Leavitt explained, adding:\n\nWe are on offense every single day, and the president leads from an offensive mindset. We are not going to apologize for cutting waste, fraud, and abuse from our government. \n\nWe are not going to apologize for mass deporting illegal immigrant criminals who have broken our nation’s laws and terrorize our communities, and we are not going to apologize for slashing regulations and undoing the disastrous policies of the previous administration.\n\nThat’s what the president said he was going to do, and that’s what the majority of our fellow Americans want.\n\nShe said the media will not succeed in sowing division in her press office. \n\n“The president is leading with that positive, ‘happy warrior’ attitude,” she said, “and it transpires to the rest of the White House every day.”\n\nLeavitt said what motivates her work is her 7-month-old son, Nico, and “all of the other children in this country.”\n\n“I want my son to grow up in a free and patriotic America that we can be proud of,” she said.","summary":"President Donald Trump is involved in every aspect of the White House&#8217;s communications strategy, press secretary Karoline Leavitt says. “He&#8217;s the president of United States....

And how do we get out? \n\nTo Trump’s critics, these events were inevitable. In their view, Trump has always had an affection, or a blind spot, for autocrats, particularly Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nSo Trump was predestined to make a deal that would undermine beleaguered Ukraine and present new problems for US allies in Europe.Yet this analysis doesn’t account for an element of Trump’s approach evident since last spring, when he supported passage of a long-delayed US aid package for Ukraine and described the country’s survival as “important” to the United States. \n\nThis element grew in importance during the US presidential campaign and afterward, as Trump insisted that he could end the war and achieve a sustainable peace quickly — initially claiming he could do so in 24 hours. \n\nHis team even unofficially put out key details of this plan: It required concessions by Ukraine (territorial compromise and at least a 20-year moratorium on NATO membership) and by Russia (acceptance of the deployment of European troops in a demilitarized zone and major arms supplies to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression). \n\nWhile Ukraine signaled flexibility on territory, Russia publicly rejected the Trump team’s ideas. \n\nThat’s why Trump, during his first days back as president, identified Putin as the obstacle to peace, and spoke of the possibility of applying pressure on Moscow.Why would Trump do all this — effectively making clear that he now owns this war — if his aim was to sell out Ukraine? \n\nAfter asserting for months that he can establish a stable peace in Ukraine quickly, he can’t credibly blame his failure to do so on President Joe Biden. But if Trump’s aim hasn’t been to sell out Ukraine, what explains his team’s recent rhetoric and actions?\n\nThe answer lies in the idiosyncrasies of Trump’s diplomacy. While generally ready to use bombast and threats with allies, his rhetorical approach to tyrants of militarily powerful countries can be softer. \n\nThis was evident in Trump’s dealings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un during his first term.\n\nAfter labeling Kim “Rocket Man,” Trump resorted to flattery to achieve a nuclear deal with North Korea. \n\nUltimately, however, Trump walked away from negotiations once convinced he could not get a good agreement.Except for his one outburst of honesty about Putin as an obstacle to peace in Ukraine, Trump’s approach to Russia has been of this softer variety — evident especially since the Feb. 12 telephone call between him and Putin. \n\nWhen that led to a meeting between US and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia without Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed concern, sparking an intemperate reaction from Trump, and then a louder exchange between the two. \n\nNone of it was good for either side: Zelensky needs US support against Putin’s ongoing aggression and Trump wants a fast, enduring peace, which isn’t possible without Ukrainian buy-in. \n\nPutin wants to stall a deal so he can have more time to take additional Ukrainian territory and kick Ukraine’s troops out of Russia’s Kursk oblast.\n\nTrump’s sparring with Zelensky gives Putin reason to think he need not compromise, placing the US president in a pickle of his own making. That hurts Trump politically. Though his MAGA base may enjoy the rhetorical fireworks, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, which have been generally supportive of Trump, have called him out for creating this predicament. \n\nMore gently, over a dozen Republican lawmakers have publicly recited facts that contradict most of the claims Trump made in recent days.\n\nAll the while, Putin just sits back and enjoys the spectacle.This situation is far from hopeless. The tensions between Trump and Zelensky are superficial. \n\nOn Friday, Trump backtracked somewhat on his claim Zelensky “started” the war, saying only he and Biden could’ve avoided it via better diplomacy.\n\nMeanwhile, Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special presidential envoy, has been in Kyiv for talks with the Ukrainian leader and his team. \n\nThey’ve reportedly continued to discuss a deal on rare-earth and critical minerals, and perhaps other topics, which may give both presidents occasion to return to the pressing business of coordinating positions in order to persuade Putin to end his war on Ukraine.\n\nThis could get Trump out of his pickle, and put the onus for peace back where it belongs: on the Kremlin.\n\nThe Trump team could expedite this by making clear in public that, in fact, Russia is the aggressor.\n\nAnd the Zelensky team can keep things on track by conveying any concerns it has with the Trump team’s tactics in private channels.\n\nJohn Herbst, former ambassador to Ukraine and Uzbekistan, is senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center.","summary":"There's a way out for Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/opinion/how-trump-can-get-himself-out-of-his-ukrainian-pickle-and-end-the-war/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/u-s-president-donald-trump-98949929-e1740178588774.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:38:20","author":"John Herbst","authors":["John Herbst"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":293070406,"title":"How Trump's Unprecedented First Month of Rapid-Fire Executive Orders Stacks Up Against His Campaign Promises","text":"In his first month since returning to the White House for a second term, President Donald Trump has used his presidential powers to issue dozens of executive orders.As of February 20, Trump has signed a total of 73 orders, 68 of which have been published and gone into effect, that are intended to transform the government, American society and how the U.S. collaborates with the rest of the world. These orders cover a range of policy areas, including initiatives to curb illegal immigration, efforts to downsize the government and reforms that impact public health.On Trump's inauguration day, January 20, he signed a total of 26 orders. In one of his first acts as president, making good on his campaign promise to repeal birthright citizenship, Trump signed the Protecting The Meaning And Value of American Citizenship action, which said children born to parents who are not legal or permanent residents should not be considered U.S. citizens.Although dozens of actions Trump has signed since Jan. 20 have gone into effect, many have faced legal challenges and criticism from advocacy groups and civil rights leaders.As Ben Michael, Attorney at Michael & Associates told The Latin Times, not every single one of Trump's executive orders can be enforced instantly. \"There can be circumstances in which these orders are challenged, for example, if an order is thought to be outside the purview of the executive branch or unconstitutional,\" Michael said. \"That's how his executive order about birthright citizenship actually ended up getting blocked by a federal court.\"Birthright citizenshipTrump's Protecting The Meaning And Value of American Citizenship order, signed on Jan. 20, was temporarily blocked by federal courts in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maryland. It was also challenged by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). According to Cody Wofsy, Deputy Director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project, the ACLU has sued over various issues including birthright citizenship and access to asylum.\"The Trump administration very much wants people to be afraid and remove themselves from American society. Many of the things they are doing are illegal and unconstitutional and there have been a wide range of lawsuits already,\" Wofsy told The Latin Times.In May of 2023, the Trump campaign released a video renewing his intentions of ending the constitutional right, although he has been pushing for it since his first presidential term back in 2018.\"The United States is among the only countries in the world that says even if neither parent is a citizen or even lawfully in the country, their future children are automatic citizens the moment the parents trespass onto our soil,\" Trump said in 2018.ImmigrationOne of his best-kept campaign promises has been immigration. In his first month, President Trump signed several orders to regulate and curb illegal crossings. On January 20, he repealed several Biden-era initiatives, which included shutting down the CBP One app, ending parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, and calling for a \"physical wall and other barriers\" on the southern border.During his campaign, Trump promised to conduct \"the largest mass deportation plan\" in American history and one month into his presidency, he has passed several measures that include mass arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and housing undocumented immigrants in detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay.When asked if Trump's crackdown on immigration came as a surprise, Wofsy said \"It is unprecedented and it isn't. We have been here before during Trump's first administration. A lot of the things that we have seen over the last month were test-driven during his first administration...we have seen some of this playbook before,\" he added.In addition, his executive order titled Securing Our Borders pushed for a prompt removal for individuals who violate federal or state laws, including immigration laws.Wofsy says that the Trump administration is \"engaging in very aggressive immigration enforcement\" and using different tools to \"avoid giving people a basic and fair hearing.\"Other immigration executive orders signed by Trump include:\nClarifying The Military's Role In Protecting The Territorial Integrity Of The United States\nInitial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions\nProtecting The American People Against Invasion\nProtecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats\nRealigning The United States Refugee Admissions Program\nTradeAnother one of the talking points during Trump's first month in office has been the trade wars between the U.S., Mexico, Canada and China. During the last months of his campaign trail, Trump warned he'd introduce elevated tariffs to North American trade partners as part of his broader plan to curb undocumented immigration and illicit drug trafficking from both countries.Trump first introduced the idea of implementing tariffs at a campaign rally in Savannah, Georgia, in September 2024, where he said he planned to \"put a 100% tariff on every single car coming across the Mexican border.\"In October, at another rally, he threatened to increase the tariffs as high as 200% on vehicles imported from Mexico. \"We'll put a tariff of 200% on if we have to,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to let it happen. We're not letting those cars come into the United States.\"Although he has signed multiple executive orders to implement the tariffs, he paused them on February 3 after reaching an agreement with Canada and Mexico that included thousands of Mexican troops being mobilized to the southern border and the introduction of a \"fentanyl czar\" in Canada. The 10% tax on all Chinese goods is still in effect.Actions against gender identity, gender-based rights and gender-affirming medical careA few of Trump's flurry of executive orders targeted gender identity and federal support for gender-affirming medical care, abolishing policies established during the Biden administration.One of the orders he signed on January 20 was the Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government, which declared that U.S. policy only recognizes two sexes, male and female, and directed federal agencies to use the term \"sex\" instead of \"gender\" and to ensure federal personnel records and government issued documents, such as passports, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\"His Protecting Children From Chemical And Surgical Mutilation action states that federal funds should not be used for gender-affirming medical care for minors and bars federal employee health insurance plans from covering surgeries and hormone treatments.Additionally, he signed an order that prohibited transgender people from serving in the military as well as the use of pronouns in the Defense Department. It also bars transgender women from female facilities for sleeping, changing or bathing and transgender men from such male facilities.Trump also signed an executive order requiring the enforcement of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts government funding for most abortions.His latest action against the LGBTQ community came on Feb. 5, with an order that bars federal funds from educational programs that allow transgender women and girls to participate in women's sports.According to NPR, the Trump campaign spent at least $17 million on ads highlighting Democrats' taking transgender rights to extremes. Anti-transgender rhetoric was frequently used by the Trump campaign throughout the trail, including during one of Trump's last appearances at the Madison Square Garden rally, in November.\"We will get ... transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women's sports,\" Trump said.CrimeDuring his first month back in office, Trump signed a couple of executive orders related to crime. To start, he called on key cabinet secretaries to create a list of cartels and similar groups to be designated as foreign terrorist organizations. On Feb. 20, the Department of State fulfilled that request by designating six Mexican cartels and two other Latin American criminal groups as FTOs and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).Throughout his campaign, Trump also signaled he would resume federal executions and make more people eligible for capital punishment, including people convicted of drug and human trafficking and migrants who kill U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers.During his first day in office, Trump signed the Restoring Death Penalty and Protecting Public Safety order, which in part defends the use of capital punishment \"where possible\" and directs the attorney general to seek the death penalty if a law enforcement officer is murdered or if someone illegally in the U.S. commits a capital crime.\"These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,\" Trump said of traffickers when he announced his 2024 candidacy. \"We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,\" he added.EducationIn the education sector, Trump's Ending Radical Indoctrination In K-12 Schooling order called for Cabinet heads to develop strategies to eliminate federal funds from being used for \"discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.\"He also passed an order that directs the education secretary to issue guidelines to educational institutions to end COVID-19 vaccine mandates.During his campaign, Trump's Agenda47 proposed eliminating the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) which, according to the DOE website, \"establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education.\" In one of his campaign videos, he said states should be the ones with control over schools and not the federal government.In 2019, his administration tried to decrease the DOE's funding by up to $7.1 billion. Among the proposals, he suggested eliminating 29 programs, including after-school and summer programs for students in high-poverty areas.Foreign affairsAs part of his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan, Trump introduced the order Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness, which pushed for the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in federal references, as well as reverting the name of the nation's tallest mountain in Alaska, which was renamed Denali in 2015 (though it was already referred to as such by Native Americans for thousands of years) to Mount KcKinley.Another one of his Jan. 20 orders stated the U.S.'s intent to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) and paused funds, support and resources given to the WHO.On February 12, he signed the One Voice For America's Foreign Relations order, which declared all foreign policy officials must \"faithfully implement the President's policy\" and called on agencies to ensure they follow through.Trump attempted to remove the U.S. from the WHO during his first presidential term, but the withdrawal process requires one year of advance noticed, and six months later Biden revoked Trump's action before it took effect.In the past, Trump has said his withdrawal from the WHO was about \"being ripped off.\"\"Everybody rips off the United States and that's it -- it's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said last month.EnergyOn Jan. 20, he signed the Putting America First In International Environmental Agreements order, which called for the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to submit a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. For Janelle Kellman, global climate leader and candidate for California's lieutenant gubernatorial position in 2026, pulling from the Paris Agreement signals that the U.S. is \"retreating from global leadership.\"\"Whether it is global climate leadership, or innovation or the economy...we are kind of losing our status,\" she said. \"What this does is it strains our clean energy sector while also straining our international alliances. On the flip side, who does this benefit? Does it benefit the everyday person? No,\" Kellman said.She added that in her opinion, Trump's executive orders \"do nothing to solve things like more good-paying jobs, improve public safety...these are the real problems for Americans across the country.\"Trump has been a climate-change skeptic for years and his decision to encourage the production of fossil fuels comes as no surprise.Back in June 2024, Karoline Leavitt, who was then Trump's campaign national press secretary, said Trump wanted to withdraw the U.S. from the climate agreement. Trump himself railed against the Paris Accord during a debate with former President Joe Biden, saying the agreement was \"a rip off of the United States\" and \"a disaster.\"Government efficiencyTrump has been in constant communication with SpaceX owner and head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Elon Musk to downsize of the government.He renamed the United States Digital Service the U.S. DOGE Service and created guidelines for the new organization aimed at \"modernizing federal technology and software to maximize government efficiency.\"The idea to create DOGE and cut government spending came from a conversation between Musk and Trump on X in August, in which Musk proposed a \"government efficiency commission\" to ensure taxpayers' money would be well spent.According to The New York Times, Trump and Musk held regular meetings with hopes that the SpaceX founder would be part of the second Trump administration. On Nov. 12, he named Musk head of DOGE.For a full disclosure of all executive orders Trump has signed during his presidency, click here.Originally published on Latin Times","summary":"As of February 20, Trump has signed a total of 73 orders, 68 of which have been published and gone into effect.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/how-trump-unprecedented-first-month-68-executive-orders-stacks-against-campaign-promises-3764659","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4584197/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:36:04","author":"Héctor Ríos Morales","authors":["Héctor Ríos Morales"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":293070056,"title":"Supreme Court Doesn't Let Trump Fire Federal Watchdog","text":"In its first ruling on legal battles tied to President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, the Supreme Court on Friday temporarily allowed the head of the federal agency that protects government whistleblowers to remain in office.In an unsigned order, the justices ruled that Hampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, could stay in his position at least until Feb. 26, when a lower court's temporary order protecting him is set to expire.The high court did not grant or deny the administration's request to remove Dellinger immediately.

Reciprocal tariffs will bring back fairness and prosperity to the distorted international trade system and stop Americans from being taken advantage of,” said the fact sheet. It gave no further details.\n\nThe digital service taxes aimed at U.S. tech giants including Alphabet’s Google, Meta’s Facebook, Apple and Amazon have been a source of trade disputes for years.\n\nBritain, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, India, Austria and Canada have imposed the taxes, levied on revenues earned from digital services sold within their borders.\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative’s office during Trump’s first term found them to discriminate against U.S. companies and readied retaliatory tariffs.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s trade chief, Katherine Tai, in 2021 followed up on those probes and announced 25% tariffs on over $2 billion worth of imports from six countries, but immediately suspended them to allow negotiations on a global tax deal to continue.\n\nThose negotiations led to a 15% global corporate minimum tax that the U.S. Congress never ratified. Talks on a second component, meant to create an alternative to the digital taxes, have largely ground to a halt with no agreement.\n\nTrump on his first day in office effectively pulled the U.S. out of the global tax arrangement with nearly 140 countries, declaring that the 15% global minimum tax has “no force or effect in the United States” and ordering the U.S. Treasury to prepare options for “protective measures.”\n\nA new Trump order could allow USTR’s retaliatory duties to be reactivated. They were designed to offset the amount of digital service taxes collected.\n\nIn 2021 USTR said it would impose 25% tariffs on about $887 million worth of goods from Britain, including clothing, footwear and cosmetics, and on about $386 million worth of goods from Italy, including clothing, handbags and optical lenses.\n\nUSTR said at the time it would impose tariffs on goods worth $323 million from Spain, $310 million from Turkey, $118 million from India and $65 million from Austria. USTR separately suspended tariffs on $1.3 billion worth of French cosmetics, handbags and other goods.","summary":"Trump's order directs his administration to consider responsive actions like tariffs to 'combat' digital service taxes imposed on U.S. tech companies by foreign countries.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11030201/trump-digital-services-tax-tariffs-canada/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1da5bf0b763c4c1e94ad783c341a3eee8b3237c139749aa2b978f12591cedb00_bd24ee.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:31:39","author":"Globalnews Digital,Reuters","authors":["Globalnews Digital","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":293075962,"title":"Hong Kong Bar Association chair urges global unity against planned US sanctions on judges","text":"The Hong Kong Bar Association’s new chairman has called for legal associations worldwide to join hands in opposing potential punitive measures from the US against judges and prosecutors, saying any interference in judicial processes will undermine the administration of justice.\nSenior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet, in his first interview with an English-language media outlet since helming the group representing barristers in Hong Kong, also shared plans to relaunch the body’s pro bono scheme later this year and partner with more non-profit groups to help those who could not afford legal services.\nMaurellet, a Hong Kong-born Eurasian and a corporate law specialist fluent in English, Cantonese and French, succeeded Victor Dawes last month amid uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and concerns over the potential implications for Hong Kong’s legal community.\nA bipartisan group of American lawmakers recently introduced a bill aimed at sanctioning Hong Kong’s judges and prosecutors involved in the cases of activists charged under the national security law.\nThe bill, if passed, would require the US president to decide within six months whether to introduce the sanctions under existing legislation.\nWhen asked about the impact of such potential actions, Maurellet said: “All forms of interference [in legal and judicial work] are actually bad and undermine the administration of justice. So we hope that other legal associations around the world will join us in opposing this.”\nCiting Trump’s executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) earlier this month over investigations of Israel, he said the wide condemnation it attracted showed that the legal community worldwide recognised that such punitive measures were “unhelpful”.\n“Nobody has been able to explain why these proposed measures would improve anything, and why the rule of law and the administration of justice would be better … we condemn it in the strongest possible terms,” he said.\nCountries including the United Kingdom, Germany, and France criticised the sanctions as detrimental to international justice, with United Nations experts expressing grave concerns about their impact on the global rule of law.\nCommenting on the previous sanctions Washington imposed on Hong Kong, Maurellet said those measures had a limited impact on the city’s ability to attract legal talent, citing an uptick in the number of lawyers arriving.\nWhile the professional body did not provide an exact number, it observed a rise in the number of jurisdictions presented by barristers, growing from 13 in 2015 to 18 this year. Some new members were from Germany, Israel, Portugal and Thailand.\nThe Beijing-imposed security law, enacted in 2020, has drawn condemnation from Western countries, which say it has undermined Hong Kong’s rule of law and judicial independence.\n\nThe domestic security law, required by Article 23 of the Basic Law mini-constitution, has resulted in several notable convictions following its implementation nearly a year ago.\nLast September, a 27-year-old man was handed a 14-month jail term for wearing a T-shirt with a seditious protest slogan on it. Another 29-year-old man was sentenced to 10 months behind bars for writing words with seditious intention on the back of bus seats.\nIn response to concerns about the domestic law’s implementation, Maurellet said: “It takes quite a bit of time for matters to first go through the courts … At this stage, it’s very difficult to form any definitive view.”\nFollowing his uncontested election as chairman last month, he expressed hopes for more overseas non-permanent judges to sit on the top bench following departures in recent years.\nIn an interview with the Post, Maurellet explained that their presence served as “a sign of confidence” in the common law world.\n“It is a huge strength to Hong Kong. It’s quite exceptional, it’s very hard to think of any other place that would have allowed it,” he said. “It’s not just a question of providing credibility, but I think there is substantial benefit in having the experience.”\nThe number of overseas judges at the top court has gone from 15 before Beijing imposed the 2020 national security law to six. Last year, five foreign judges from countries including Britain and Canada decided not to serve in Hong Kong any more.\nMaurellet also shared the association’s plan to relaunch its pro bono legal service in the second half of this year as he saw “gaps” to fill in this area.\nHe said 300 barristers had been providing legal advice for free or at a reduced fee, primarily focusing on criminal appeals. By partnering with more NGOs, he hoped to broaden the scope of the programme to cover areas including domestic abuse and migrant issues.\nAmong the four existing key partners is Equal Justice. Its founder and director Kay McArdle said the Bar Association’s enhanced scheme could expedite access to legal advice for those in urgent need.\n“We’re a referral agency, but the difficulty with [the duty lawyer free legal advice scheme] is that it’s not immediate. It takes between two and six weeks to get an appointment. The appointment is 20 minutes,” she said.\n“[The relaunch] means that we can spend more time not looking for lawyers, but getting to the people who need the legal support.”\nMcArdle said her group, launched in 2020, assisted more than 2,000 people who could not afford legal service through its network of 100 law firms and barristers’ chambers, noting a significant increase in demand for family and divorce cases post-Covid.","summary":"Senior Counsel Jose-Antonio Maurellet says any interference in judicial work will ‘undermine the administration of justice’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3299699/hong-kong-bar-association-chair-urges-global-unity-against-planned-us-sanctions-judges","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/22/7c9e6c2e-4c61-46f2-9387-59d3263b3eae_4fe6fc49.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-21 23:30:19","author":"Natalie Wong","authors":["Natalie Wong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":293070402,"title":"US Proposes Ukraine UN Text Omitting Mention Of Occupied Territory: Diplomats","text":"The United States proposed Friday a United Nations resolution on the Ukraine conflict that omitted any mention of Kyiv's territory occupied by Russia, diplomatic sources told AFP.Washington's proposal comes amid an intensifying feud between US President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky which has seen Trump claim it was \"not important\" for his Ukrainian counterpart to be involved in peace talks.It also appeared to rival a separate draft resolution produced by Kyiv and its European allies, countries that Trump has also sought to sideline from talks on the future of the three-year-old war.The Ukrainian-European text stresses the need to redouble diplomatic efforts to end the war this year, noting several initiatives to that end, while also blaming Russia for the invasion and committing to Kyiv's \"territorial integrity.\"The text also repeats the UN General Assembly's previous demands for an immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.
