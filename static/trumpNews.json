The US Constitution doesn’t give him that power","text":"By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and ALI SWENSON\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday vowed more changes to the way elections are conducted in the U.S., but based on the Constitution there is little to nothing he can do on his own.\n\nRelying on false information and conspiracy theories that he’s regularly used to explain away his 2020 election loss, Trump pledged on his social media site that he would do away with both mail voting — which remains popular and is used by about one-third of all voters — and voting machines — some form of which are used in almost all of the country’s thousands of election jurisdictions. These are the same systems that enabled Trump to win the 2024 election and Republicans to gain control of Congress.\n\nTrump’s post marks an escalation even in his normally overheated election rhetoric. He issued a wide-ranging executive order earlier this year that, among other changes, would have required documented proof-of-citizenship before registering to vote. His Monday post promised another election executive order to “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm elections.”\n\nThe same post also pushed falsehoods about voting. He claimed the U.S. is the only country to use mail voting, when it’s actually used by dozens, including Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nSimilar complaints to Trump’s, when aired on conservative networks such as Newsmax and Fox News, have led to multimillion dollar defamation settlements, including one announced Monday, because they are full of false information and the outlets have not been able to present any evidence to support them.\n\nTrump’s post came after the president told Fox News that Russian President Vladimir Putin, in their Friday meeting in Alaska, echoed his grievances about mail voting and the 2020 election. Trump continued his attack on mail voting and voting machines in the Oval Office on Monday, during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe announcement signals yet another way that Trump intends to stack the cards in his favor in the 2026 midterm elections, after he already has directed his attorney general to investigate a Democratic fundraising platform and urged states to redraw their congressional districts to help the GOP maintain its majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of Trump’s latest election post and why Congress is the one entity that can implement national election rules.\n\nTrump’s post\n\nTrump for years has promoted false information about voting, and Monday was no exception.\n\nHe claimed there is “MASSIVE FRAUD” due to mail voting, when in fact voting fraud in the U.S. is rare. As an example, an Associated Press review after the 2020 election found fewer than 475 cases of potential fraud in the six battleground states where he disputed his loss, far too few to tip that election to Trump.\n\nWashington and Oregon, which conduct elections entirely by mail, have sued to challenge Trump’s earlier executive order — which sought to require that all ballots must be received by Election Day and not just postmarked by then. The states argue that the president has no such authority, and they are seeking a declaration from a federal judge in Seattle that their postmark deadlines do not conflict with federal law setting the date of U.S. elections.\n\nTrump also alleged that voting machines are more expensive than “Watermark Paper.” That’s a little-used system that has gained favor and investments among some voting conspiracy theorists who believe it would help prevent fraudulent ballots from being introduced into the vote count. Watermarks would not provide a way to count ballots, so they would not on their own replace vote tabulating machines.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions still have voters use electronic ballot-marking devices to cast their votes, the vast majority of voters in the U.S. already vote on paper ballots, creating an auditable record of votes that provides an extra safeguard for election security.\n\nIn his post, Trump also claimed that states “are merely an ‘agent’ for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes” and must do what the federal government “as represented by the President of the United States” tells them to do.\n\nElection lawyers said that’s a misrepresentation of the U.S. Constitution. It also flies in the face of what had been a core Republican Party value of prioritizing states’ rights.\n\nThousands of elections, none under presidential control\n\nUnlike in most countries, elections in the U.S. are run by the states. But it gets more complicated — each state then allows smaller jurisdictions, such as counties, cities or townships, to run their own elections. Election officials estimate there are as many as 10,000 different election jurisdictions across the country.\n\nA frequent complaint of Trump and other election conspiracy theorists is that the U.S. doesn’t run its election like France, which hand counts presidential ballots and usually has a national result on election night. But that’s because France is only running that single election, and every jurisdiction has the same ballot with no other races.\n\nA ballot in the U.S. might contain dozens of races, from president on down to city council and including state and local ballot measures.\n\nThe Constitution makes the states the entities that determine the “time, place and manner” of elections, but does allow Congress to “make” or “alter” rules for federal elections.\n\nCongress can change the way states run congressional and presidential elections but has no say in the way a state runs its own elections. The president is not mentioned at all in the Constitution’s list of entities with powers over elections.\n\n“The president has very limited to zero authority over things related to the conduct of elections,” said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nCourts have agreed — no presidential involvement\n\nParts of Trump’s earlier executive order on elections were swiftly blocked by the courts, on the grounds that Congress, and not the president, sets federal election rules.\n\nIt’s unclear what Trump plans to do now, but the only path to change federal election rules is through Congress.\n\nAlthough Republicans control Congress, it’s unclear that even his party would want to eliminate voting machines nationwide, possibly delaying vote tallies in their own races by weeks or months. Even if they did, legislation would likely be unable to pass because Democrats could filibuster it in the U.S. Senate.\n\nMail voting had bipartisan support before Trump turned against it during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election, but it’s still widely used in Republican-leaning states, including several he won last November — Arizona, Florida and Utah. It’s also how members of the military stationed overseas cast their ballots, and fully eliminating it would disenfranchise those GOP-leaning voters.\n\nThe main significance of Trump’s Monday statement is that it signals his continuing obsession with trying to change how elections are run.\n\n“These kinds of claims could provide a kind of excuse for him to try to meddle,” Hasen said. “Very concerned about that.”\n\nAssociated Press writer Eugene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report.","summary":"The same post also pushed falsehoods about voting.","url":"https://www.denverpost.com/2025/08/18/trump-elections-constitution/","image":"https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Elections_69649-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 21:21:01","author":"Gqlshare,The Associated Press","authors":["Gqlshare","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":352207836,"title":"White House mulls 10% Intel stake after CEO meeting","text":"The White House may be ready to take a 10% stake in Intel, fueling ongoing speculation an investment is being hammered out, according to Bloomberg.

(EPA Images pic)\nWASHINGTON: The fates of nations have rarely, if ever, been decided by sartorial choices.\nBut Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was certainly hoping that a spot of fashion diplomacy Monday could get US counterpart Donald Trump to help his country reach a peace deal with Russia.\nDespite the life-and-death matters unfolding in Ukraine, much of the speculation among the White House press corps was about whether Zelensky would wear a suit.\nIn February, Ukraine's wartime leader was ridiculed by a right-wing US reporter for wearing military-style garb instead of a business suit when he visited the Oval Office.\nThat mocking exchange set the tone for an astonishing blow-up a few minutes later when Trump and vice president JD Vance proceeded to berate Zelensky for not being \"grateful\" for US support against Russia's invasion.\nWhat a difference six months makes.\n\"I can't believe it, I love it!\" said Trump, 79, as he admired Zelensky's smart black jacket and collared black shirt upon the Ukrainian leader's arrival at the White House.\n\"It's the best I had,\" joked Zelensky, a former television comedian before turning president.\n'You look fabulous!'\nThe light-hearted appreciation for the 47-year-old's outfit continued inside the Oval Office itself - the scene of Zelensky's earlier humiliation.\n\"President Zelensky, you look fabulous in that suit!\" said Brian Glenn, the reporter for Real America's Voice who had asked the original question back in February.\nTrump joined in, saying \"I said the same thing\" - and telling Zelensky that \"that's the one that attacked you last time.\"\n\"I remember,\" deadpanned the Ukrainian, before adding to the American reporter that \"you are wearing the same suit\" as six months ago.\nZelensky also turned on the charm for Trump - a billionaire who is rarely seen in anything except one of his trademark tailored blue suits - in other ways.\nHe brought a letter for Melania Trump from his wife Olena thanking the US first lady for writing to Putin and urging him to save children's lives.\nThe focus on Zelensky's outfit - instead of the nitty-gritty of peace negotiations to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of people - may seem bizarre to some.\nBut it also underscores the extent to which foreign leaders have had to woo a notoriously capricious US president.\n'Do I look ok?'\nZelensky in particular has had to work hard to win over Trump, who has long been skeptical about US support for Ukraine and its multi-billion-dollar war cost.\nTrump has also openly expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, not least during their extraordinary cordial greetings during their summit in Alaska last week.\nThe US leader had also echoed several of Putin's talking points about the war, including in recent days on the need for Ukraine to give up Crimea and its ambitions of joining Nato.\nHence the multi-pronged diplomatic offensive at the White House on Monday - beginning with Zelensky and his black jacket, and followed up with a posse of European leaders.\nThe Europeans paid homage to what they said were Trump's efforts to reach a peace deal, but their visit was also designed as a show of support for Kyiv against any call for too many concessions.\nThe Ukrainian was reportedly given training on how to deal with Trump by European leaders, especially Finnish President Alexander Stubb - who himself wore a double-breasted suit and won praise from the American president for his youthful vigor.\nZelensky was notably less pugnacious than in February - and even thanked Trump for a map that showed how much territory Russia had taken from Ukraine.\nNato chief Mark Rutte meanwhile made light of the debate about Zelensky's attire.\n\"Do I look OK?\" the Dutchman said to Trump's protocol chief with a laugh as he buttoned up his suit jacket on arrival at the White House.","summary":"The Ukrainian leader turned to fashion diplomacy in a bid to win Donald Trump’s support for a peace deal with Russia.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2025/08/19/suits-you-fabulous-zelensky-outfit-wows-trump","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1d5dfd19-volodymyr-zelensky-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 21:10:55","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.152},{"id":352208386,"title":"Trump Angry Not A Single Visiting European Leader Wearing Lederhosen, Tiny Hat","text":"WASHINGTON—Taking offense that European leaders had, in his view, disrespected the White House by showing up inadequately dressed to Monday’s closely watched Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, President Donald Trump reportedly fumed that not a single one of them had arrived in lederhosen and a tiny feathered hat. “It’s rude and, frankly, very nasty that you would come here today in such inappropriate clothing,” said an irate Trump, interrupting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s pleas for Ukrainian aid as he chastised her decision to forgo painted wooden clogs, a puffy milkmaid dress, and Pippi Longstocking braids. “When you think of Europe, you think of the striped shirts with the scarf and beret, the Viking hat with the horns—hell, even a bullfighting costume would have been great.

Some also said a ceasefire would be necessary before further negotiations or any trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\nHere are some key takeaways from the high-stakes meetings.\n\nTrump says US will give Ukraine 'very good protection'\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the United States will be involved in security assistance for Ukraine but did not elaborate on what exactly that would look like or give any specifics.\n\n\"We're going to be discussing it today, but we will give them very good protection, very good security,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president later confirmed that Putin said Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine.\n\nTrump didn't go quite as far as special envoy Steve Witkoff, who told CNN that Russia agreed to \"Article 5-like\" protections. Article 5 is the agreement of collective defense among NATO nations stating an attack against one member is considered an attack against them all.\n\nTrump said Europe would need to shoulder much of the burden when it comes to security guarantees, but that the U.S. will play a role.\n\n\"They are first line of defense because they're there,\" Trump said before adding, \"But we're going to help them. And also we'll be involved.\"\n\nTrump walks back ceasefire demand\n\nAfter previously pushing for a ceasefire and threatening severe consequences for Russia if Putin did not stop the war, President Trump appeared to back off that demand.\n\n\"I don't think you need a ceasefire,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand strategically, like, well, you know, one country or the other wouldn't want it.\"\n\nHe continued that he likes \"the concept of a ceasefire for one reason, because you'd stop killing people immediately.\"\n\nTrump pushes for a trilateral meeting, Zelenskyy says Ukraine 'ready'\n\nTrump continued to push for a trilateral meeting between himself, Zelenskyy and Putin -- something he had hoped to set up immediately following his summit with Putin on Friday but was unsuccessful.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine is \"ready\" for a trilateral discussion.\n\n\"I think it's going to be when,\" Trump said, \"not if.\"\n\nEuropean leaders back up Zelenskyy on security guarantees, ceasefire\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy sat down with a host of European leaders in the East Room following their bilateral talks in the Oval Office.\n\nAt the table were NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finland President Alexander Stubb.\n\nNearly all the leaders stressed the need for security guarantees for Ukraine, with several saying it should look similar to Article 5 obligations. Ukraine is not a member of NATO but the nation has pushed for membership, something Russia is strongly opposed to.\n\n\"The fact that you have said that I'm willing to participate in the security guarantees is a it's a big step. It's really a breakthrough,\" NATO's Rutte told Trump. \"And, it makes all the difference. So also, thank you for that.\"\n\nFrance's Macron and Germany's Merz challenged Trump on a ceasefire, insisting it's a necessity for moving forward.\n\n\"The next steps ahead are the more complicated ones now ... To be honest, we all would like to see a ceasefire,\" Germany's Merz said. Merz said he cannot imagine a trilateral meeting would be able to occur without a ceasefire in place.\n\nTrump says he will speak with Putin after meetings\n\nTrump said he will call Putin after his meetings Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House.\n\n\"We're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today, and we may or may not have a trilat. And if we don't have a trilat, then the fighting continues. And if we do, we have a good chance -- I think if we have a trilat that there's a good chance of maybe ending it,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But he's expecting my call when we're finished with this meeting,\" Trump added of Putin.\n\nABC News' Meredith Deliso contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's met at the White House for a high-stakes talks on Ukraine's future and Russia's invasion.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/key-takeaways-trump-zelenskyys-oval-office-meeting-discuss/story?id=124751645","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a2133fa3-9c50-4996-a0f6-6ddbeafca67e/donald-trump-10-gty-gmh-250818_1755538547080_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:57:58","author":"Alexandra Hutzler","authors":["Alexandra Hutzler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":352207540,"title":"Fateh slams Walz for picking ‘wealthy’ and ‘politically connected’ University of Minnesota regents","text":"It is probably no surprise Republicans are upset with who Gov. Tim Walz picked for the University of Minnesota Board of Regents.\n\nA little more surprising? State Sen. Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis and chair of the very committee that is supposed to select regents, also expressed frustration. \n\n“Rather than empowering student voices on the board, the governor sided with a handful of wealthy, well-connected lobbyists who worked to shut student voices out of the board,” Fateh emailed. “This process shouldn’t be about giving preferential treatment to those who are politically connected, it should be about who is best qualified to serve the public.”\n\nWhile Fateh’s response is (obviously) critical of the governor, it also pours cold water on the idea that DFL lawmakers were in cahoots with Walz to have the divided Minnesota Legislature punt on appointments. That, in theory, would have let the governor make secretly agreed upon liberal selections. \n\nFateh, the chair of the Senate Higher Education Finance and Policy Committee, says that Walz never sought his advice during the governor’s two-month long selection process.\n\nMeanwhile, the governor’s office points out that the Legislature abandoned its own process for picking regents, leaving the choice to Walz. The governor’s office said that in making his selections he adhered to the same process as he would any appointment, such as a judge or head of a state agency. \n\nAlso, this is where I should point out that Fateh is running for mayor of Minneapolis and Walz endorsed the incumbent candidate, Jacob Frey. \n\nStill, at a time when the U of M is in the crosshairs of the Donald Trump administration and dealing with scrutiny over another tuition hike, the discontent from all sides about the regents picks is notable. \n\nTo review, the regents are a 12-member board that makes decisions on everything from the multibillion annual budget to regulating campus speech. The Legislature picks regents to serve six-year terms. \n\nBut the Legislature failed to name board members in the most recent legislative session. The governor’s picks are on an interim basis until a majority of the Legislature agrees on new regents.\n\nAs to Fateh’s charge of political connections, three of the four selections have given money to Walz campaigns. \n\nSamuel Heins, whose namesake is part of the Minneapolis-based corporate litigation outfit Heins Mills & Olson, has donated 250 times to Democratic candidates and committees, according to Open Secrets, including $14,100 total to Walz’s runs for the governor and Congress.\n\nJoel Bergstrom, a retired recruiter who helped companies find executives, donated $500, per Open Secrets. And Ellen Luger, who last worked in Italy for the United Nations, has contributed $3,400 to Walz campaigns. \n\nLuger, the spouse of former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Andy Luger, also served as a national finance committee director for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run. On LinkedIn, Luger said that she “organized fundraising events with the presidential candidate across the country” and “completed the campaign as one of the top 10 fundraisers in the country.” \n\nMessages left with Heins, Bergstrom and Luger were not returned by Monday afternoon. \n\nRichard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who applied for the regents board positions, said that it is the wrong time to make partisan appointments. \n\n“He undermines the integrity of the board if Trump comes after us,” said Painter, who ran as a DFLer for the U.S. Senate in 2018. “This should not be DFL U.”\n\nDaniel Wolter, who also unsuccessfully applied for a seat, said his background with the GOP, including as a spokesperson for former Gov. Tim Pawlenty, did him in. \n\n“I am clearly a Republican and I understood the ramifications of that,” Wolter said.\n\nFateh’s beef is slightly different. He did like the governor’s selection of Kowsar Mohamed, a doctoral student at the U of M, and wanted another student on the board.\n\nThe Minneapolis lawmaker was mostly upset that Walz picked Heins and Bergstrom, neither of whom came before the state Legislature when they were in control of the selection process. \n\nWhere Fateh and other critics are in alignment is the fear that regents will make decisions without enough familiarity of the school’s faculty, students and staff to challenge Rebecca Cunninghham, the university president. \n\n“The board needs to be an entity that is able to push back,” Wolter said.","summary":"The Democratic state lawmaker joins GOP critics questioning whether the governor’s selections best serve university.\n\n\nThe post Fateh slams Walz for picking ‘wealthy’ and ‘politically connected’ University of Minnesota regents appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2025/08/fateh-slams-walz-for-picking-wealthy-and-politically-connected-university-of-minnesota-regents/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NorthropUofM640.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:54:25","author":"Matthew Blake","authors":["Matthew Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.201},{"id":352203780,"title":"Trump, Zelensky Open To Trilateral With Putin As Macron, European Leaders Push For \"Quadrilateral\"","text":"Trump, Zelensky Open To Trilateral With Putin As Macron, European Leaders Push For \"Quadrilateral\"Trump, Zelensky Open To Trilateral With Putin As Macron, European Leaders Push For \"Quadrilateral\"\n\nLast Updated:August 19, 2025, 02:23 IST Crux VideosFrench President Emmanuel Macron called for a four-way meeting including Europeans in response to US President Donald Trump's hopes of bringing together the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. \"I think as a follow up we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting, because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,\" Macron said at a White House meeting bringing together European leaders, Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. n18oc_world n18oc_crux\n\nPreviousNext\n\nClick here to add News18 as your preferred news source on Google.

Before that, Anand said NATO countries typically focused on shoring up the security along the eastern flank in Europe.\n\n\"NATO's gaze also has to shift westward and north because of the changing geopolitical landscape, especially following February 24, 2022,\" she said in a call back from Finland with reporters.\n\n\"We are seeing increased activity, for example, in the Northwest Passage, we are seeing Russian infrastructure moved further and further north on the other side of the Arctic Circle. So our priority, in terms of Canada's Arctic foreign policy is to ensure that we leave no stone unturned, to protect and defend Canada's sovereignty, especially in the Arctic.\"\n\nAnand's meetings on Monday came the same day European leaders, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were at the White House discussing with U.S. President Donald Trump ways to end the war in Ukraine. The conflict is more than a decade old, with Russia annexing Crimea in 2014, before launching a wider war in 2022.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney last week participated virtually in talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders ahead of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Carney was not involved in Monday's discussions at The White House and Anand did not say whether he had been invited, when asked Monday.\n\nAnand said Canada's position on the matter has not changed.\n\n\"Decisions regarding the future of Ukraine belong to Ukrainians alone,\" Anand said. \"That is Canada's position and there's no ambiguity on that front about this.\"\n\nAnand said tightening security and economic ties with the Nordic region means a combination of both economics and security partnerships.\n\nTalks in Washington were still ongoing Monday afternoon. Trump has talked about swapping land between areas occupied by Russia and Ukrainian territory, but many world leaders say this would undermine the integrity of borders, and incentivize Putin to further destabilize Europe.\n\nZelenskyy has said Kyiv needs security guarantees, which involve meaningful commitments of military force by more powerful countries if Russia makes more incursions into Ukraine, under any ceasefire or peace agreement.\n\nSome have called for Ukraine to join the NATO military alliance, which Putin has repeatedly characterized as a threat to Russia's security. When asked whether Ukraine should join the alliance, Anand said it's up to the Ukrainian government what groupings it aspires to join.\n\nAnand will meet Tuesday with Finnish President Alexander Stubb, after he returns to Helsinki from the White House.\n\nAmong the topics of discussion with Anand's counterparts will be how Canada can convince other countries that international law is fundamental, not just for peace in Ukraine but around the world.\n\nHer role is \"to ensure that my counterparts around the world are aware of Canada's position and to build the bridges necessary, to ensure that other countries also view international law, territorial integrity (and) the rules-based international order as fundamental institutions that must be protected and respected,\" she said.\n\nThe ministers will also talk about the intersection of critical minerals and security, she said.\n\nTypically, Anand said, \"one would separate out projects that were focused on the economy and projects that were focused on defence and security.\"\n\nNow, she said, \"thinking in those silos is no longer appropriate, because Canada's economic security is tied deeply to our sovereignty overall and indeed protecting and defending our very country.\"","summary":"Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Monday the federal government is leaving &quot;no stone unturned&quot; to defend Canada's North as changes in the global order in recent years are having direct implications for Canada's Arctic sovereignty.\n\nAnand was in Helsinki to meet with her counterpa...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/Canada/567317/Anand-says-war-in-Ukraine-influencing-Canada-s-Arctic-security-policy","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/cp/2025/8/8244e50c46032d7498c85051cd8b631d6662305d6a2a2c22796be1cb0dd1474c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:52:00","author":"Dylan Robertson, The Canadian Press - Aug 18, 2025 / 1:52 Pm | Story: 567317,The Canadian Press","authors":["Dylan Robertson, The Canadian Press - Aug 18, 2025 / 1:52 Pm | Story: 567317","The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":352208468,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel says voting for Stephen Colbert at the Emmys is the 'least we could do at this point'","text":"Jimmy Kimmel is advocating for his friend and fellow late-night host Stephen Colbert to finally nab the hard-fought-for Outstanding Talk Series win at the Emmys this year.\n\n In a conversation with Variety shortly after CBS' parent company, Paramount, announced that The Late Show will end in May amid its Trump administration-sanctioned $8 billion merger with Skydance, Kimmel explained to the outlet why he chose to use his show's FYC billboard to declare his intention to vote for Colbert.\n\n \"Well, it seems like voting for Stephen is the least we could do at this point, and I think it will be a nice statement if he does win,\" Kimmel said. \"Obviously, awards don't mean much, but every once in a while they do, and in this case, I think it will. So I fully expect Stephen to win the Emmy as I think people are very, very upset about what happened to him and his show.\"\n\n Colbert's show has been nominated nine years in a row but has never won in the category.\n\n When asked why people should vote for Colbert's show, Kimmel complimented the late-night host for being a \"very ethical person.\"\n\n He continued, \"He is the salt of the earth. He is a humble person and an extremely smart person. I hope that whatever he does next is even more powerful than what he'd been doing. And I think that's very possible.\"\n\n The announcement of The Late Show's cancellation, which will end the franchise after it has aired for 33 years, provoked backlash from famous faces and fans alike.\n\n Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has been candid about her disapproval over Paramount settling the lawsuit brought by Trump over a 2024 60 Minutes interview with his contender in that year's presidential election, Kamala Harris — is among the move's most vocal detractors.\n\n \"CBS canceled Colbert's show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump — a deal that looks like bribery,\" the Massachusetts senator wrote on X on Thursday. \"America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons. Watch and share his message.\"\n\n Kimmel expressed skepticism to Variety that Paramount's decision was financial, even with reports that Colbert's show was losing $40 million a year.\n\n \"The idea...is beyond nonsensical. These alleged insiders who supposedly analyze the budgets of the shows — I don't know who they are, but I do know they don't know what they're talking about,\" Kimmel asserted. \"They seem to only be focused on advertising revenue and have completely forgotten about affiliate fees, which number in the hundreds of millions — probably in total billions — and you must allocate a certain percentage of those fees to late-night shows.\"\n\n Kimmel countered that it is \"surprising how little the media seems to know about how the media works.\"\n\n \"There's just not a snowball's chance in hell that that's anywhere near accurate. Even that — that's all you need to know. Suddenly, he's losing $40 million a year? I will tell you, the first 10 years I did the show, they claimed we weren't making any money — and we had five times as many viewers on ABC as we do now,\" Kimmel said of his late-night show. \"Who knows what's true? All I know is they keep paying us —and that's kind of all you need to know.\"\n\n Many critics have questioned the timing of the announcement, pointing out that Colbert had recently criticized CBS' corporate parent, Paramount Global, for agreeing to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump over an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on 60 Minutes in November. Trump has long disliked late-night hosts' jokes about his administration and celebrated news of The Late Show's cancellation on social media, writing that Colbert's \"talent was even less than his ratings.\"\n\n He then praised Fox News late-night comedian Greg Gutfeld, who Trump wrote \"is better than all of them combined, including the moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show,\" referring to Jimmy Fallon.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n For his part, Colbert has not backed down, continuing to openly criticize Trump and his administration throughout the president's second term.

The high-level meeting in Washington, D.C., marks a significant diplomatic push to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been ongoing since February 2022.\nDuring the talks, President Trump reiterated his ambition to broker a peace deal and confirmed he is hopeful about organising a trilateral summit involving the US, Russia, and Ukraine. “I think it’s going to be when, not if,” Trump said, expressing confidence on the possibility of direct talks between all three nations. While no specific timeline has been established, Trump emphasised that diplomatic groundwork is underway following his recent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe August 15 meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska marked the former’s first direct engagement with the Russian leader since returning to office. Monday’s meeting was Trump’s second in a row with the Ukrainian President this year, underlining his administration’s urgent push for a negotiated settlement.\nRecalling his earlier optimism, Trump added, “It’s possible it might not be able to be done. On the other hand, it’s possible that it will. We have to give it our best. That’s all you can do.”\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, speaking briefly during the summit, proposed that Europe be formally included in any high-level negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine. “I think as a follow up, we would need probably a quadrilateral meeting. Because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,” Macron said.\nOther European leaders in attendance expressed appreciation for the US president’s efforts. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni highlighted a noticeable shift in Russia’s stance since Trump’s re-engagement, “After three years that we didn’t see any kind of sign from the Russian side that they were willing for dialogue, so something is changing.”\nTrump, in turn, assured his European counterparts of his commitment to finding a peaceful resolution. “I’m optimistic that, collectively, we can reach an agreement,” he stated. The ongoing summit builds momentum around a potential diplomatic breakthrough in one of the most devastating conflicts in recent European history.","summary":"Trump emphasised that diplomatic groundwork is underway following his recent discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/when-not-if-trump-confident-on-trilateral-peace-talks-with-russia-ukraine-ws-l-9513144.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Image-New-5-2025-08-23aabb675e419fb19ef751ddadad249a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:47:34","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.055},{"id":352206312,"title":"Air Canada flight attendant ‘unlawful’ strike exposes major fault lines in Canadian labour law","text":"Air Canada flight attendants say they will continue to defy a government back-to-work order after the federal labour relations board declared the strike “unlawful.” The walkout, which began early on Aug. 16, grounded hundreds of flights and left passengers stranded.\n\nLess than 12 hours into the strike, the federal government intervened in the dispute between Air Canada and the union representing its flight attendants. Minister of Jobs and Families Patty Hajdu invoked Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code to impose binding arbitration and order employees back to work. \n\nThe Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) condemned the move, accusing the government of “crushing flight attendants’ Charter rights.”\n\n Read more:\n Air Canada flight attendants have issued a strike notice: Here's what you need to know\n\nAir Canada reportedly encouraged the government to intervene, while CUPE pushed for a negotiated solution, arguing binding arbitration would ease pressure on the airline to negotiate fairly.\n\nAfter a Sunday hearing, the Canada Industrial Relations Board released an order reiterating flight attendants should “cease all activities that declare or authorize an unlawful strike of its members” and “resume the performance of their duties.”\n\nAs an expert in unions and the politics of labour, I see this dispute as highlighting several fault lines in Canada around work, how we value it and the ways the law affects workers.\n\nMark Carney’s labour dilemma\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney currently faces the first labour crisis of his term. Carney had worked alongside labour leaders in the face of United States President Donald Trump’s tariff threats, even appointing Lana Payne, president of the Unifor trade union, to the new Canada-U.S. Relations Council.\n\nThe federal government’s decision to invoke Section 107 to send Air Canada and its flight attendants to arbitration continues a growing trend of its increasing use. \n\nSection 107 has been part of the Canada Labour Code since 1984. It was rarely used for decades, but became more common last year when Justin Trudeau’s government invoked it several times to end work stoppages at ports, rail yards and Canada Post.\n\nThis is part of a longer history. Dating back to the 1970s, federal and provincial governments started interfering with free and fair collective bargaining through back-to-work legislation or by imposing contracts on public sector workers.\n\nWhat has changed in recent decades is the federal government’s growing creep into the private sector. Under Stephen Harper’s Conservative government, there were increasing threats to use back-to-work legislation, targeting CN Rail, CP Rail and Air Canada. These interventions were justified as protecting an economy emerging from a global financial crisis. The Harper government followed through with back-to-work legislation in the Air Canada and CP Rail cases.\n\nIf the Carney government continues to use back-to-work legislation, it could alienate unions that once saw him as a potential ally. Yet the public may be more receptive to it, given the country’s economic weakness and continued Trump threats. \n\nThe Air Canada strike could effect the trajectory not only of the government, but also the labour movement as well. It’s a strike that has major consequences for all workers in Canada, and its outcome will signal to workers across the country what they can expect in these uncertain times.\n\nDefying the law is rare\n\nCUPE’s decision to defy the Canadian government’s use of Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code comes with big risks but also potential victories. \n\nA union or workers defying the law is hardly unprecedented, but is increasingly rare in an era where unions have been in an overall decline in Canada and globally. \n\nThe risks are significant for workers: heavy fines, termination of employment or even jail time for flight attendants and union officials. \n\nIf CUPE is successful, it would have a galvanizing effect, sending a message to workers across the country that they can stand up not only to their bosses, but to the state, in order to improve their labour circumstances.\n\nHowever, for any kind of unlawful strike to be successful, there must be an incredible amount of unity among the workers. While CUPE leadership and the Canadian labour movement are strongly supportive of continuing the strike, rank-and-file flight attendants must be willing to stand their ground. \n\nEven in a legal strike, unions only take the step of stopping work if they have an overwhelming amount of the membership on board. That need for solidarity is even greater for illegal action. \n\nThe reason why Canada has laws allowing unions, workplace safety and strikes is because of industrial militancy that often defied the law to force governments to enact legislation allowing for unions and strikes. \n\nThe flight attendant strike could be a barometer of increased labour organizing and action experienced across Canada since the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether that momentum for the labour movement can continue.\n\nWork and gender\n\nAnother key issue at the heart of the strike is the gender wage gap, which continues to be an issue in Canada. While it has narrowed during this century, women in Canada still earn on average 12 per cent less than men. This gap is even wider for women who are newcomers, Indigenous, transgender or living with disabilities.\n\nThis disparity is closely tied to sectors where women are overrepresented, such as flight attendants, a workforce overwhelmingly made up of women. Across the Canadian workforce, 56 per cent of women are employed in the “5 Cs”: caring, clerical, catering, cashiering and cleaning. These occupations tend to be precarious and underpaid.\n\nWhile airlines are part of transportation, the work that flight attendants perform is unmistakably service-based and covers much of the 5 Cs, including emotional labour and customer care.\n\nFor Air Canada flight attendants, the situation is compounded by the fact they are paid only while the plane is in motion, meaning they often perform unpaid work.\n\nThe gender dynamics become even clearer when comparing the treatment of flight attendants with that of Air Canada pilots. \n\nIn 2024, Air Canada pilots — who are mostly men — won a 26 per cent wage increase in the first year of their new contract and a 42 per cent increase overall. Air Canada’s most recent offer to its flight attendants was only an eight per cent increase in year one and 38 per cent overall. \n\n“Air Canada’s male-dominated workforce received a significant cost-of-living wage increase. Why not the flight attendants, who are 70 per cent women?” Natasha Stea, president of the CUPE division that represents the Air Canada flight attendants, said in an Aug. 15 CUPE article.\n\nIn this context, the Air Canada strike is also a spotlight on systemic gender inequality, the undervaluing of service work and the fight for fair compensation in occupations dominated by women.","summary":"The dispute exposes several fault lines in Canada around work, how we value it and how the law impacts workers.","url":"https://theconversation.com/air-canada-flight-attendant-unlawful-strike-exposes-major-fault-lines-in-canadian-labour-law-263325","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/685895/original/file-20250818-56-tx6928.JPG?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C167%2C4800%2C2400&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:45:37","author":"Gerard Di Trolio,Labour Studies,McMaster University,PhD candidate","authors":["Gerard Di Trolio","Labour Studies","McMaster University","PhD candidate"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.224},{"id":352201716,"title":"Trump admits that Melania loves Barron more than him: ‘I hate to say it’","text":"President Donald Trump has admitted that First Lady Melania Trump loves their son more than him - and that her love for children prompted her to write a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin urging him to end the war in Ukraine. \n\nTrump made the comments during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday, saying that the First Lady had been so moved by the images of children dying amid the fighting that she took the step to directly address the Russian leader in a letter, delivered by her husband when the leaders met in Alaska on Friday. \n\n“She’s got a great love of children, she has a wonderful son that she loves probably more than anybody, including me, I hate to say it,” said Trump during the Oval Office sit-down with Zelensky, referencing their son Barron, 19. “But she loves her son, she loves children, and she hates to see something like this happening.”\n\nWhile Barron Trump appeared during the 2024 campaign, he’s rarely been seen with his father in recent months. \n\nOn Friday, Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska but was unable to reach a peace or ceasefire deal. During the meeting, Trump delivered the letter from Melania in which she pushed Putin to remember the children caught in the middle of the war of aggression started by Russia in February 2022. \n\n“Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or magnificent city center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger,” she wrote. \n\n“In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone—you serve humanity itself,” she added. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with the stroke of the pen today. It is time.”\n\nTrump published the letter on social media ahead of his meeting with Zelensky, their first get-together since their infamous tet-a-tet in February, when both Trump and Vice President JD Vance ambushed the Ukrainian leader in the Oval Office.\n\nOn Monday, however, Zelensky was backed up by a cadre of European leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nAfter being criticized by Vance in February for not being grateful enough, Zelensky repeatedly thanked Trump for his “efforts to stop killings and stop this war” and for the military aid Washington has supplied to Kyiv. \n\nZelensky also handed a letter from Ukrainian First Lady Olena Volodymyrivna Zelenska addressed to the U.S. first lady.\n\nThe president was asked on Monday afternoon if it could be “the end of the road” for American support for Ukraine if a peace deal isn’t reached. \n\n“I can never say that,” said Trump.\n\n“It’s never the end of the road,” he added. “People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would not say it’s the end of the road.”","summary":"‘She’s got a great love of children, she has a wonderful son that she loves probably more than anybody, including me,’ president says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-melania-barron-b2809877.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/30/21/04/GettyImages-2194369757.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xUQqVNul-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:45:11","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.267},{"id":352201674,"title":"Trump wrongly claims no other country uses mail-in ballots during latest rant","text":"Donald Trump falsely claimed that no other country uses mail-in ballots, asserting they are \"corrupt\" and lead to \"massive fraud\". \n\nThese remarks were made to reporters at the White House, with Volodymyr Zelensky present and silent beside him. \n\nContrary to Trump's claims, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance confirms that 12 countries, including Canada, Germany, and South Korea, allow all voters to cast ballots by post. \n\nThere is no evidence to support Trump's allegations of corruption concerning mail-in voting, despite him previously encouraging Republicans to use them. \n\nWatch the video in full above.","summary":"","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/trump-mail-in-ballots-voting-video-b2809887.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/17/04/US-UKRAINE-RUSSIA-CONFLICT-DIPLOMACY-41f6d3c9.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FLkGqiKd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:44:54","author":"Holly Bishop","authors":["Holly Bishop"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":352201606,"title":"Tesco shopper who was beaten in the street after she stood up to shoplifters reveals how her ordeal has ruined her life","text":"Black Friday\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nPrince Harry\n\nKing Charles III\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Aug 18th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelensky declares he's 'ready' to sit down for face-to-face peace talks with Putin as Trump refuses to rule out boots on the ground - as US President convenes historic Oval Office love-in with united European leaders\n\nMoment irate US tourist grabs 14-year-old female 'pickpocket' by the ponytail and tells her 'you're not getting away' before police arrest young thief in Venice\n\nWarning issued as major broadband provider set to enforce £50 fee to use your email account\n\nThe humiliating truth about HSTikkyTokky and his lavish life: He's the controversial 'finfluencer' who claims to earn £20m a year in Dubai... but this is how much he's really making - and why bailiffs are chasing his mother\n\nThese are the nine surprisingly common bedroom mistakes that can ruin your relationship and sex life... and how you can fix them, according to a top sexpert\n\nWhat the new Ukraine could look like: How war-torn country could be carved up with Russia demanding the entire Donbas, US offering NATO-style security and front lines 'frozen'\n\nUltra rare conjoined twins are spotted with a newborn in tow nine months after sparking pregnancy rumours - but how can they have a baby?\n\nInside the devastating split between YouTube golden couple Tanya Burr and Jim Chapman... as we reveal what REALLY happened to their missing dog: MOLLY CLAYTON\n\nOminous past Pookie's kept hidden from her millions of fans... as source reveals whispers swirling since she married Jett\n\nEXPOSED: Cotswolds elite who snort cocaine with their teens.

Email sophie.carlin@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SOPHIE CARLIN, TRAINEE REPORTER \n Published:21:42 BST, 18 August 2025 |Updated:21:43 BST, 18 August 2025 \n\nA Tesco shopper who was beaten in the street after she stood up to shoplifters has revealed how her ordeal has ruined her life. \nEmilie Martin, 39, of east London, was shopping at the chain supermarket in the capital's Hackney area in 2015 when the horrifying attack happened. \nThe event manager spotted a gang of teenagers stealing sandwiches which, with no security guard to be seen, she reported to the store manager. \nThe worker told her the staff were powerless to stop them, confessing the group targeted the store nearly every day. \nBut Ms Martin did not realise the youths had overheard the encounter - and when she left the store, they surrounded her and sprayed her with a drink. \nAfter threatening to call the police, she was punched in the face. Her attackers were never caught. \nThames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber last week called for the public not to stand by when they see shoplifting - but call it out. \nNearly ten years on from her experience, Ms Martin, after seeing his comments, has now spoken out again, to warn the public of the risks such confrontations can carry. \n\nEmilie Martin (pictured, with her injuries after her ordeal), 39, of east London , was shopping at the chain supermarket in the capital's Hackney area in 2015 when the horrifying attack happened\n\nThe event manager (pictured at the time) spotted a gang of teenagers stealing sandwiches which, with no security guard to be seen, she reported to the store manager\n\nBut Ms Martin did not realise the youths had overheard the encounter - and when she left the store, they surrounded her and sprayed her with a drink. After threatening to call the police, she was punched in the face (pictured, her injuries)\nShe told The Telegraph the shocking ambush has left her with an array of physical health problems, including permanent scarring and breathing issues.\nThe brave bystander has had two operations on her eye and nose, which were left swollen, bruised and bloodied by the attack. \nEven a decade on, she is still awaiting a procedure for the chronic sinusitis the attack left her with, having spent a whopping 18 months on an NHS waiting list. \nThis kind of sinus swelling is common and usually goes away on its own - but Ms Martin has fought it every day since her violent ordeal. \nShe has also been diagnosed with PTSD, leaving her hyper-vigilant and highly anxious - and dubbing substantive mental health support on the NHS a 'mirage'. \nMs Martin now has to avoid Tesco, Hackney Central and any news reports about similarly violent shoplifting gangs because they set her on edge too much. \nIn fact, going to any supermarket now makes her extremely nervous - and she also crosses the road any time she sees a group of teenage boys \nMs Martin said the Metropolitan Police has 'shown little concern' about what happened and Tesco claimed CCTV footage of what happened was accidentally lost. \n\nThe shocking ambush (pictured, her injuries) has left her with an array of physical health problems, including permanent scarring and breathing issues\n\nMs Martin said the Metropolitan Police has 'shown little concern' about what happened and Tesco claimed CCTV footage of what happened was accidentally lost.

That's a bigger problem with society, people who [don't do anything] – you're part of the problem.' \n\nThames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Matthew Barber (pictured) last week called for the public not to stand by when they see shoplifting - but call it out\n\n Shoplifters think they can rob shops with impunity, police chief warns \nMs Martin explained in an open letter to the Thames Valley PCC that she understood his point and agreed the public has a role in stopping shoplifting. \nBut she said there needs to be more comprehensive protection and help for those who stick their head above the parapet to do the right thing. \nShe questioned if the police chief knew what he was really asking in urging the public to confront shoplifters - as her experience had made her fully aware of the risks. \nMr Barber responded, dubbing her ordeal 'horrific', saying he understood why it had stuck with her ever since. \nHe said it highlighted society must do everything in its power to reduce crime - and showed offences like shoplifting are not as victimless as many might think. \nThe Thames Valley PCC said Ms Martin's experience was one of those sad examples, which must be avoided, of no one stepping in to help. \nThe police boss emphasised it was the police's job to reduce crime and catch criminals in the act. \nBut everyone must band together, he underlined, to ensure we do not live in a society where people simply look the other way when crime occurs. \n\nMs Martin explained in an open letter to the Thames Valley PCC that she understood his point and agreed the public has a role in stopping shoplifting. Pictured: File photo of security tags on meat at Tesco \n\n Moment brazen 'shoplifter' is confronted by hero Iceland worker as pair wrestle over bag \nMs Martin's brave response to his comments marks only the second time she has spoken publicly about her experience. \nShe said she knew many have done as she did - spoken out against shoplifting, faced repercussions and been left without adequate support - and wanted them to know they are not alone. \nThe courageous woman said she wants her experience to prompt improvements to CICA's dealings with victims. \nShe also called for rules forcing large retailers like Tesco to hang on to relevant CCTV in violent cases like this, with penalty fines to punish breaches. \nA Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: 'This was investigated thoroughly at the time and regrettably, we were unable to identify a suspect.\n'The Met Police is working to support shopkeepers and tackle theft in the capital, this year solving 163 per cent more shoplifting cases than in the same period last year.\n'If you see criminal activity taking place, please call the police on 101 or 999 in an emergency.'\nA Government spokesperson said: 'We understand the devastating impact of shop theft on retailers. \n\nIt comes as shoplifting surges to a record high across the UK, spiralling out of control in stores throughout the nation. Pictured: File photo of a recent shoplifting crime caught on camera at a Sainsbury's supermarket in London \n\n Police chiefs say shops should have 'greeters' to deter shoplifters \n'Since Ms Martin applied for compensation in 2017, we have improved how victims apply for compensation with a better online system and improved training for staff so the process is more straight-forward.\n'Our landmark Crime and Policing Bill will also end the effective immunity for theft of goods under £200 and bring in a specific offence for assaulting retail workers, while the Tackling Retail Crime Together Strategy is gathering data to better target and respond to perpetrators.'\nIt comes as shoplifting surges to a record high across the UK, spiralling out of control in stores throughout the nation. \nRates rose by 20 per cent to hit another record, according to official figures released last month. \nPolice recorded 530,643 offences in England and Wales in the year to March 2025 - the highest figure since records begun and up from 444,022 in the previous year. \nShoplifting has become an increasing nightmare for High Street shops, with only a tiny minority of offenders ever charged. \nThe epidemic is illustrated by sickening CCTV revealing thieves casually walking out of stores with armfuls of high-value goods. \nAnd the crisis is particularly acute in London, which has recorded a shocking 50 per cent boom in shoplifting, up from 53,202 in 2023 to 80,041 last year. \nThe Metropolitan Police, Thames Valley PCC, Tesco and the East London NHS Foundation Trust have been approached for comment. \nLondonNHSTesco\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTesco shopper who was beaten in the street after she stood up to shoplifters reveals how her ordeal has ruined her life\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

For the last several months, the U.S. president has sought to broker a deal between the two countries to end the three-and-a-half-year-long war, but has hit various roadblocks.\n\nWhile Trump and Putin’s meeting did not end in an official deal, Trump said it was a positive conversation – he repeated those vague assertions publicly on Monday. \n\n“I’ve known him for a long time, I’ve always had a great relationship with him,” Trump said on Monday. “I think President Putin wants to find an answer, too. We’ll see.”\n\nThe Independent has asked the White House for comment. \n\nBut it is clear that Putin may be willing to strike a deal, under the right terms. That could include Ukraine handing over the remainder of the Donbas region to Russia – a controversial plan that Trump appeared open to. \n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, seeking to seize territory of the region that once was part of the U.S.S.R. However, Putin baselessly claimed he was initiating the war to protect Russians in the Donbas region from Ukrainians who he accused of being Nazis. \n\nUkraine, and its allies, have said the country should not give up its territory to Russia, the aggressor. \n\nWhile Trump had previously said an immediate ceasefire necessary, he appeared to drop that condition after his meeting with the Russian president as well. \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived at the White House on Monday to discuss details of Putin’s conversation with Trump. \n\nOther leaders, including Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, E.U. Commisioner President Ursula von der Leyen, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte joined the meeting.\n\nAs part of Trump and Putin’s discussion, Russia supposedly told the Trump administration that the U.S. and its European allies could extend security guarantees to Ukraine.\n\nTrump reaffirmed that the U.S. would support Ukraine though he did not specify what they may look like. \n\nThe U.S. president said he was planning to speak with Putin after meeting with European leaders.","summary":"US president whispered that Putin ‘wants to make a deal for me’ before meeting with European leaders in the White House","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-hot-mic-putin-ukraine-russia-deal-b2809873.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/19/07/GettyImages-2230151474.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/htqbJJbI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:42:35","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.225},{"id":352208860,"title":"PODCAST: ¿Dónde el presidente Trump ha desplegado la Guardia Nacional para hacer tareas de inmigración?","text":"Los gobernadores de todo el país ya han comenzado a autorizar el uso de la Guardia Nacional de sus estados para apoyar los esfuerzos federales de control en inmigración.\n\nDesde que era candidato a la presidencia, Donald Trump ha dicho que utilizaría a la Guardia Nacional como parte de los esfuerzos para deportar a millones de migrantes en todo el país.\n\nAdemás de usar a la Guardia Nacional, que es una fuerza militar de los estados que se integra a la reserva militar, el presidente Trump también ha desplegado al ejército, para hacer cumplir políticas migratorias en la frontera.\n\nEn su segundo mandato, el presidente Trump ha desplegado la Guardia Nacional en la frontera sur y recientemente, ordenó el envío de tropas a la capital, Washington D.C., alegando que era necesario para “restablecer el orden público”.\n\nAdemás de la capital, en las últimas semanas salió a la luz un memorándum al que tuvo acceso el periódico The New York Times, en el que los funcionarios del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE por sus siglas en inglés) informaban que la Guardia Nacional sería enviada para ayudar en el “procesamiento de extranjeros”, es decir, ayudaría a los agentes de ICE con tareas administrativas y de oficina, gestión de casos y transporte.\n\nLa Guardia Nacional se desplegará en 20 estados como Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Carolina del Sur, Texas, Utah, Virginia, entre otros estados.\n\nEl Pentágono informó a The Intercept que estas tropas trabajarán bajo el Título 32, lo que significa que estarán controladas por el estado y no por el gobierno federal, a diferencia de lo que ocurre en Los Ángeles y en la frontera sur.\n\nLos gobernadores de todo el país ya han comenzado a autorizar el uso de la Guardia Nacional de sus estados para apoyar los esfuerzos federales de control de la inmigración. \n\nEn Nevada, por ejemplo, el gobernador republicano Joe Lombardo, ha dado un paso que ningún líder de Nevada había dado antes: activar la Guardia Nacional del estado para apoyar las operaciones de ICE.\n\nEn Nevada hay alrededor de 200.000 personas indocumentadas, y el estado no cuenta con políticas santuario, sin embargo, en agosto, el gobierno federal lo tildó de “estado santuario”.\n\nUn portavoz de la Guardia Nacional de Nevada dijo al medio The Nevada Independient que la solicitud es para apoyo administrativo, logístico y de oficina, no para tareas policiales, con unos 35 guardias, menos del 1 por ciento del total de la Guardia Nacional del estado, apoyando la solicitud.\n\nAsí que para hablar de cómo se está llevando a cabo el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional en Nevada, invitamos a Isabella Aldrete, quien es reportera para The Nevada Independient donde cubre política y cómo ésta afecta a los latinos. \n\nMás detalles en nuestra conversación a continuación.\n\nCiudad Sin Límites, el proyecto en español de City Limits, y El Diario de Nueva York se han unido para crear el pódcast “El Diario Sin Límites” para hablar sobre latinos y política.

US Tariffs Hit Swiss Export Economy HardWhile pharmaceutical products, the key product of Swiss exports, are currently exempt, the US president Donald Trump has threatened to hike tariffs up to 250% if drug companies don not lower their drug prices, according to the report.Swiss Jobs at Risk Across Key Export SectorsThe Swiss corporate union federation, Economiesuisse, warned that the impact could be severe, as per the report. The business umbrella organisation highlighted that, “If customs duties were to be levied on medicines, many jobs in the pharmaceutical industry would also be affected,\" as quoted in the Swissinfo.ch report.

The tariffs are likely to impact $40 billion of non-exempt Indian exports such as gems and jewellery, textiles and footwear. The EAC meeting assumes significance as it coincides with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s two-day visit to India, beginning from Monday.

I mean, we’re going to give, we have people waiting in another room right now, they’re all here, from Europe.\n\n“Biggest people in Europe.\n\n“And they want to give protection, they feel very strongly about it, and we’ll help them out with that.”\n\nMr Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff had suggested measures similar to Nato’s article five mutual defence provision – that an attack on one member is an attack on the entire bloc – could be offered by the US without Kyiv joining the alliance.\n\nThe president appeared to rule out a ceasefire in his meeting with Mr Zelensky, when he said: “I don’t think you need a ceasefire.”\n\nDuring multilateral talks later, Mr Trump said: “All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace.”\n\nHe repeated his claim that a ceasefire might not be “necessary” and added: “I like the ceasefire from another standpoint – you immediately stop the killing – but I believe a peace agreement at the end of all of this is something that’s very attainable and it can be done in the near future.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president described the talks as “really good”, saying they had been “the best” so far.\n\nHe continued: “We are very happy with the president that all the leaders are here and security in Ukraine depends on the United States and on you and on those leaders who are with us in our hearts.”\n\nMr Zelensky wore a black shirt with buttons and a black blazer to the meeting at the White House.\n\nHis attire appeared to become a point of irritation for Mr Trump during a previous meeting in February, when he was wearing a black polo bearing the Ukrainian coat of arms, and the US president said: “He’s all dressed up today.”\n\nIn their latest meeting, Mr Trump indicated he agreed with a reporter who described Mr Zelensky as looking “fabulous in that suit”.\n\nMr Zelensky earlier said he wanted to thank first lady of the United States Melania Trump, who on Friday penned a plea to Mr Putin, imploring him to protect the “innocence” of children.\n\n“Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all – so that every soul may wake to peace and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded,” she wrote.\n\nMr Zelensky presented Mr Trump with a letter from his wife.\n\nSir Keir, who met with Mr Zelensky and several other European leaders on Monday before arriving at the White House, described potential trilateral talks as a “sensible next step” amid multilateral efforts to secure peace in Ukraine.\n\nHe said: “We all want peace. The war in Ukraine’s had a huge impact, particularly on the Ukrainians who’ve borne the brunt of it, but it’s also had an impact on Europe and on the United Kingdom.\n\n“There’s not a family or community that hasn’t been affected.\n\n“When we talk about security, we’re talking about the security not just of Ukraine, we’re talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well, which is why this is such an important issue.”\n\nThe Prime Minister sat next to Mr Macron during multilateral talks and Mr Trump introduced him to delegates as a “friend” who was “doing really well” in office.\n\nSir Keir told Mr Trump: “Your indication of security guarantees, of some sort of article five-style guarantees, fits with what we’ve been doing with the coalition of the willing which we started some months ago, bringing countries together and showing that we were prepared to step up to the plate when it came to security.\n\n“With you coming alongside, the US alongside, what we’ve already developed, I think we could take a really important step forward today – a historic step, actually, could come out of this meeting in terms of security for Ukraine and security in Europe.”\n\nHe added: “I also feel that we can make real progress towards a just and lasting outcome.\n\n“Obviously, that has to involve Ukraine and a trilateral meeting seems the sensible next step.\n\n“So, thank you for being prepared to take that forward, because I think if we can ensure that that is the progress out of this meeting – both security guarantees and some sort of progress on (a) trilateral meeting of some sort to bring some of the difficult issues to a head – then I think today will be seen as a very important day in recent years.”","summary":"The US president hosted several European leaders at the White House on Monday.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-volodymyr-zelensky-keir-starmer-ukraine-white-house-b1243495.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/08/18/19/b13627f2a4735b72790201cff5bac5c1Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU1NjI3NzMx-2.81292597.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:35:06","author":"Will Durrant","authors":["Will Durrant"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.252},{"id":352201724,"title":"With the Putin-Trump plan, Ukraine has a choice – of sorts","text":"Donald Trump promised a “Big Day at the White House”, and in terms of diplomatic “optics”, it lived up to the billing. He found himself entertaining four presidents (European Commission, Finland, France, Ukraine), two prime ministers (Italy, the UK), the German chancellor and the secretary general of Nato. It was an unprecedented gathering, and one that spoke to the geopolitical importance of the issues discussed.\n\nIt was also striking that the Russian president was fussed over rather more a few days ago in Alaska, with Vladimir Putin greeted on touchdown by President Trump and with a flypast of B2 bombers. That was a generally more sycophantic reception than the European posse were granted, and Mr Trump even allowed Putin to take control of the agenda, cheekily permitting the Russian war criminal to play the role of host by the end of the shameful proceedings.\n\nStill, at least this time around, Volodymyr Zelensky escaped being ambushed for another televised scolding in the Oval Office. Now that Mr Trump has reverted to his previous alignment with Moscow “talking points”, that is a mercy. \n\nAs for substance, the Washington summit, despite its stellar cast, left the situation more or less where it was before the signatories went through the cycle of “grin and grip” photocalls and their wary conversations.\n\nAfter Putin mesmerised President Trump, again, into being an active advocate for Kremlin policy, it was clear what kind of deal would greet President Zelensky and his distinguished minders when they arrived in DC. Russia’s terms were the same as they have been for many months: that Ukraine should accept the loss of Crimea, evacuate and surrender the parts of the Donetsk province it still holds; and renounce any ambition to join Nato.\n\nIn return, Putin undertook to put the terms of such a deal into Russian legislation, with a promise – eerily echoing Adolf Hitler before the Second World War – that the Donbas represents his last territorial demand. The novel element was that America would make some as-yet undefined commitment to guaranteeing a reduced Ukraine’s changed borders. It is said that this would be similar to the “all for one, one for all” mutual security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of the Nato treaty, but would not formally amount to Nato membership, presumably to appease Putin.\n\nTo borrow a phrase from another peace process, Ukraine has been presented with a “land for peace” deal. And that peace will be an uneasy one. \n\nIt was no surprise that President Zelensky didn’t tear Mr Trump’s arm off in his eagerness to take the surrender deal back to Kyiv. As Mr Zelensky has long made clear, the territorial integrity of Ukraine is not his to bargain away. Ukraine belongs to its people. Any settlement, and especially one as radical, not to say humiliating, as this would have to command the acquiescence of an exhausted but proud people. That is up to them – not Mr Zelensky or Mr Trump, nor even Mr Macron, and still less the Russian president. \n\nThe Putin-Trump plan, for that is what it amounts to, will have to be considered by Ukraine and her allies in Europe and beyond in the “coalition of the willing”. Nations such as Canada, Japan, Australia and Turkey will also have to have a say, though it is principally a European enterprise under the leadership of Britain and France. Ukraine has a choice, but so does Europe, in effect, and it is Europe’s attitude that is key to whether Ukraine can fight on.\n\nThe question, then, is whether Europe is prepared to continue to back Ukraine if it decides it cannot accept the Russian-American terms. The vague US security guarantee that is being discussed may not be a reliable one, given that the Trump administration is equivocal and transactional even about going to war to save Poland or Britain if they came under Russian attack. America as a nation – not just the Maga movement – has turned isolationist, and that is the new reality and context under which Europe is being forced, reluctantly, to face taking responsibility for its own future. \n\nThis is actually where we were before Mr Trump became “disappointed” with Putin and came up with his plan, now abandoned, for an immediate ceasefire. That’s gone. Mr Trump is back on Russia’s side, and he wants an end to the war, on Russian terms, even if he talks about some sort of security guarantee. Yet who would rely on Mr Trump’s word?\n\nIf Europe finds that “peace” package unacceptable, then it will have to find a way to replace American financial and military assistance for Ukraine. That means sacrifices, even if the burden is shared with other global partners. It may be that America continues to provide high-tech weaponry, provided the coalition of the willing pays – but even that cannot be taken for granted.\n\nOn the other side, Russia has become a war economy, effectively propped up by Chinese loans, Indian trade, plus North Korean manpower and equipment and whatever Iran can offer these days. Is the coalition of the willing, in other words, prepared to pay the price and bear the burden of defeating the Russian-led axis of evil? Or is it, in reality, only ready to allow the Ukrainians to fight indefinitely (which is unrealistic), and risk Russian control of Ukraine and its resources?\n\nPerhaps the Russian economy and its war machine will collapse under the strains, but perhaps not in time to save Ukraine. Do Europeans want to endure Putin enjoying his victory parade from the balcony of the presidential palace in Kyiv, as loathsomely symbolic as Hitler inspecting Paris in 1940? If Europe won’t rescue Ukraine and push the Russians back, then this is the beginning of the end for Ukraine, and this will turn out to have been a big but bleak day indeed at the White House.","summary":"Editorial: Volodymyr Zelensky and his European allies have been presented with a ‘land for peace’ deal – one that guarantees that any peace will be an uneasy one","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/trump-zelensky-washington-white-house-starmer-b2809797.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/17/45/U-S--President-Trump-meets-with-Ukrainian-President-Zelenskiy-and-European-leaders-in-Washington-D-C.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LRzsSeFa-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:31:28","author":"Editorial","authors":["Editorial"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.011},{"id":352206204,"title":"Putin dials Modi, briefs him on Alaska summit","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and shared an assessment of his recent meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska.Putin and Trump had met for nearly three hours on Friday to discuss a possible resolution of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.In his call to Modi, Putin shared details of his meeting with Trump.Posting a message on X, Modi said, \"Thank my friend, President Putin, for his phone call and for sharing insights on his recent meeting with President Trump in Alaska.

The Virginia districts will have to defend their embrace of radical gender ideology over ensuring the safety of their students.”\n\nLoudoun County was the first district to announce it was keeping its gender policy. \n\nAt a closed-session meeting on Tuesday, the board voted 6-3 to keep its Policy 8040, which allows students to use the locker rooms and restrooms that correspond with their gender identity. \n\nA Loudoun County school spokesperson said that the federal interpretation of Title IX conflicts with current state and federal law protecting transgender students.\n\n“After consultation with legal counsel, the Board voted 6-3 not to comply with this request due to the tension between the OCR position and current law.

Because when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent,” CNN quoted him as saying during the Summit.\nThough it seems unlikely that Trump will pay heed to the idea in the near future, yet Macron’s point underlines that they believe the security of not just Ukraine but entire Europe is at stake.\nThe German leader said that the path is open for more serious negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but noted that there is a need to work on the ceasefire.\n“Now the way is open for complicated negotiations. I can’t imagine that the next meeting will take place without a ceasefire. So let’s work on that,” he said.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanked Trump for his willingness to end the Ukraine war.\n“It is an important day — a new phase — after three years that we didn’t see any kind of sign from the Russian side that they were willing for dialogue, so something is changing — something has changed — thanks to you,” she said.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the Summit “historic” and said that Trump’s indication of “Article-5 style” security guarantees corresponds with work the “Coalition of the Willing” has been doing for the past months, CNN reported.\nHe said that the coalition is “prepared to step up to the plate” when it comes to ensuring Ukraine’s security.","summary":"Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy and other European leaders at White House and held a multilateral meeting with them on Monday.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-zelenskyy-european-leaders-meeting-white-house-macron-miloni-germany-nato-ukraine-russia-9513092.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Trump-Zelenskyy-meeting-7-2025-08-b1534615f8fcbfa92e376411514a68ae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:29:20","author":"Ashesh Mallick,News18","authors":["Ashesh Mallick","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.174},{"id":352206196,"title":"Zelensky Trump White House meeting: Ukrainian President and European leaders press for security guarantees","text":"President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine met with US President Donald Trump and an extraordinary delegation of European leaders at the White House on Monday, seeking to defend his nation’s interests as Trump presses for a quick peace agreement with Russia that would require Ukraine to make sweeping concessions.\n\nWearing a black suit instead of his usual military clothing, and backed by European presidents and prime ministers who had rushed to Washington to support him, Mr Zelensky was greeted warmly by Mr Trump.\n\nInside the Oval Office, the two presidents showed few signs of their once-frayed relationship, talked positively about the United States’ playing a role in security guarantees for Ukraine, and expressed their eagerness to arrange a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace... President Zelensky and President Putin can talk a little bit more about that... But I believe a peace agreement at the end of all of this is something that’s very attainable,” Mr Trump said at The White House.\n\nBut details of any progress toward peace were scarce. And Mr Zelensky, now 3 1/2 years into a war instigated by Russia, is expected to soon confront a difficult choice: surrender territory in exchange for vague promises for Ukraine’s future security, or hold his ground and risk reigniting Mr Trump’s anger.\n\nDuring the portion of a meeting with European leaders and Mr Zelensky that was open to reporters, Mr Trump listened as Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France pressed for a ceasefire, something Mr Trump had said Friday he wanted and then abandoned as a condition after his meeting with Putin.\n\nThe initial interactions were a striking departure from the combative tone of Mr Zelensky’s previous visit to the White House in February, when Mr Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated him in the Oval Office on live television. Mr Vance said nothing this time, and both presidents were genial. Mr Zelensky absorbed jokes about his black suit and handed Mr Trump a letter his wife had written to first lady Melania Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump, a sceptic of multilateral alliances and deeply desiring of a Nobel Peace Prize, was not specific about what security guarantees for Ukraine would look like, although he said the US would help in some way, and he did not rule out involving US troops.\n\nHe said he believed he could secure a joint meeting with Mr Putin and Mr Zelenskyy “if everything works out well today” and that there was a “reasonable chance in ending the war” through such a meeting.\n\nMr Trump told reporters, with Mr Zelensky sitting beside him, that he had communicated indirectly with Mr Putin earlier Monday and would speak with him later in the day.\n\nMr Trump also continued to push back on criticism that he had given Mr Putin a major diplomatic victory by hosting him for a summit Friday in Alaska, asserting that it was difficult for Putin to have come to the United States. In reality, it was the first time Mr Putin had been warmly embraced in the West since the war made him an international pariah.\n\nMr Zelensky said he is ready for a trilateral meeting, though he has steadfastly rejected ceding any land to Russia. But as Mr Trump has aligned more closely with Russia after his warm meeting with Mr Putin, Mr Zelensky now faces increased pressure to convince the United States that Ukraine should get a better deal.\n\nMr Trump has swung between saying in their last Oval Office meeting that Mr Zelensky does not hold “the cards” in the war, to more recently expressing public frustration that Mr Putin was stringing him along and agreeing to sell more arms to European nations that would be earmarked for Ukraine. Asked at the outset of their Monday meeting which side held more cards now, Mr Trump said he didn’t want to discuss that and repeated his oft-stated desire for the war to end.\n\nIn a sign of the alarm among allies after Friday’s Trump-Putin summit meeting, a posse of European leaders — including Keir Starmer of Britain; Macron; and two leaders whom Mr Trump generally likes, Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Alexander Stubb of Finland — rushed to Washington in an effort to show solidarity with Ukraine and “to defend the interests of the Europeans,” according to Macron.\n\nSeveral top European officials have warned that if Mt Putin, who has a history of breaking diplomatic commitments, is not stopped in Ukraine, he could try to take more European territory by force.\n\nMr Zelensky on Sunday labelled talk of US security guarantees “a significant change” in the US position. But he doesn’t have the authority to make the most important concession that Mr Putin appears to be demanding: giving up all of the eastern Donbas region, including territory that Ukraine still controls, to Russia. Ukraine’s constitution requires a referendum to cede territory, and the vast majority of Ukrainians oppose doing so.\n\nHere’s what else to know:\n\n— Suiting up: During his famously acrimonious meeting with Mr Trump in March, Mr Zelensky’s military-style attire became a talking point. On Monday, perhaps wary of a repeat, the Ukrainian president adopted a more statesmanlike ensemble: black field jacket, black shirt and black slacks. Mr Trump took note.\n\n— Deadly strikes: Hours before the meetings in Washington, Russian attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia killed at least 10 people, including a child, and injured dozens of others, Ukrainian authorities said. Mr Zelensky condemned the strikes as a deliberate attempt to put pressure on Ukraine amid the talks.\n\n— Putin’s plan: Before meeting with Mr Putin on Friday in Alaska, Mr Trump had said that there would be “severe consequences” if the Russian leader did not agree to a ceasefire. But since the meeting, Mr Trump has backed Mr Putin’s plan for skipping ceasefire discussions and proceeding to a sweeping peace agreement based on Ukraine ceding land to Russia, which now occupies almost 20 per cent of Ukraine.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"THE NEW YORK TIMES: The US President has hinted that a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia would require a territorial exchange, as Volodymyr Zelensky met Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/world/zelensky-trump-white-house-meeting-ukrainian-president-and-european-leaders-press-for-security-guarantees-c-19727643","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19727643/fcce3c8d64b1a72b5779dc82a7dc539739933016-16x9-x0y285w5481h3083.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:27:37","author":"David E.

The first bill calls for a Nov. 4 special election, the second for approving a proposed map, and the third for signing off on reimbursement for county election costs. \n\nThe move is a countermeasure by California Democrats to “neutralize” the pressure Trump has publicly put on Texas Republicans and other red states to redraw their congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nThe California map, unveiled Friday, was drawn by congressional Democrats with input from those in the state legislature. If approved, it would turn three Republican-held seats into safe Democratic seats and turn two others into seats that lean Democratic.\n\nTEXAS DEMOCRATS RETURN TO STATE FOR SECOND SESSION ON GOP REDISTRICTING\n\n“We’re not here because we dislike independent redistricting, we’re here because Donald Trump and his Republican supporters are trying to rig the next election,” U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) said. “We decided as a delegation that we could not just stand there and allow Trump to distort the next election and continue to harm the people we represent.” \n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) slammed the effort on social media, posting that he had “instructed the [National Republican Congressional Committee] to use every measure and resource possible to fight the California Democrats’ illegal power grab.”\n\nJohnson also called California’s redistricting effort “a partisan stunt” and a “slap in the face” to Californians who support an independent redistricting commission.\n\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Corrin Rankin echoed the statement, vowing to legally challenge the effort and arguing that voters in 2010 already voted to remove partisan influence from how maps are drawn.\n\n“It is really a calculated power grab that dismantles the very safeguards voters put in place,” Rankin said. “This is Gavin the Gaslighter overturning the will of the voters and telling you it’s for your own good.”\n\nNewsom has said he would not pursue a push to redraw California’s congressional districts as long as Texas Republicans ended their efforts, which is unlikely. \n\nAt stake is control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Currently, Republicans have a seven-seat edge in the House, with four vacancies.\n\nTrump has been able to enact his agenda, including passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, because the GOP controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. If Democrats flip the House, they could render Trump a lame duck during his last two years in office by blocking his legislation and launching congressional investigations.\n\nOn July 30, Texas state lawmakers rolled out their proposed map, which would create 30 Republican congressional seats compared to eight Democratic districts. This would be an expected five-seat boost for the GOP from its current 25-13 breakdown. In opposition, dozens of Texas House Democrats left the state to deny the GOP majority the quorum needed to vote on redrawn maps. Absent lawmakers, however, signaled they were ready to return after California moved forward with its own plan. \n\nRUBIO PULLS 6,000 STUDENT VISAS AFTER TRUMP ORDER TO REVIEW FOR ‘SECURITY RISKS’\n\nRepublicans are also exploring ways to add a dozen or more districts in Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and Indiana.\n\nIn response, states controlled by Democrats, including California, Illinois, and Maryland, have pledged to fight back.","summary":"California lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin their march toward passing Gov.

The president was seated beside European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. \n\nTrump’s meetings with Zelenskyy and the European leaders comes just days after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. \n\nAfter the meeting with Putin, Trump said he thinks a deal to end the war could be reached quickly. Reports indicate Putin is demanding Ukraine give up the Donbas region to Russia in exchange for an end to the war and security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has opposed ceding any Ukrainian territory to Russia in the past. \n\nSecurity Guarantees \n\nSitting around a table in the East Room of the White House, Trump and all the European leaders delivered brief remarks before the start of their closed-door meeting. Each leader stressed the importance of a peace deal that includes security guarantees for Ukraine. \n\n“President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine, and this is one of the key points that we need to consider, and we are going to be considering that at the table,” Trump said, adding that the leaders also plan to discuss “who will do what” among the leaders gathered. \n\n“I am optimistic that, collectively, we can reach an agreement that would deter any future aggression against Ukraine,” Trump said. \n\n“This is very positive that the United States gives such [a] strong signal to security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said.\n\nFrance’s Macron called security guarantees necessary for peace in Ukraine, and Italy’s Meloni said the discussion of security guarantees would be a first order of business. \n\nPutin has indicated he is willing to agree to NATO Article 5-type security protections for Ukraine as part of a peace plan. Article 5 guarantees protection for NATO member countries, stating that an attack on one NATO ally is considered an attack against all NATO members. \n\nTrilateral Meeting \n\nFollowing the meeting with the European leaders, Trump said, he will hold a call with Putin and said the next step in the dealmaking process is a trilateral meeting. \n\nThe “sensitive” issue related to territory and so forth will be discussed during that trilateral meeting, Zelenskyy said. \n\nBritish leader Starmer said a “historic step could come out of this meeting, in terms of security for Ukraine and in Europe,” adding that the resolution to the war will require “a trilateral meeting, which would be the sensible next step.” \n\nTrump said he thinks peace between Russia and Ukraine is very attainable and a not a matter so much of if, but when. \n\nPraise for Trump \n\nZelenskyy and each European leader thanked Trump for his work toward ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. \n\n“I think in the past two weeks, we probably had more progress in ending this war than we have in the past three-and-a-half years,” Finland’s Stubb said. “And I think the fact that we are around this table today is very much symbolic in the sense that it’s Team Europe and Team United States helping Ukraine.” \n\n“The path is open.

The war in Ukraine’s had a huge impact, particularly on the Ukrainians who’ve borne the brunt of it, but it’s also had an impact on Europe and on the United Kingdom. There’s not a family or community that hasn’t been affected.\n\n“When we talk about security, we’re talking about the security not just of Ukraine, we’re talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well, which is why this is such an important issue.”\n\nSpeaking to Donald Trump, Sir Keir added: “With you coming alongside, the US alongside, what we’ve already developed, I think we could take a really important step forward today – a historic step, actually, could come out of this meeting in terms of security for Ukraine and security in Europe.”\n\nEarlier, Trump described Sir Keir as his “friend” during his introduction of the leaders. “Prime Minister Starmer of the United Kingdom, our friend and my friend, and doing really well – and people like him a lot,” Mr Trump said. \n\nThe meeting between Sir Keir, Mr Trump, Mr Zelensky and the leaders of France, Germany, Finland, Italy, the European Union and Nato comes after the US leader met with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin last week. \n\nThere were no concrete agreements publicised from last week’s meeting but Mr Trump entered into Monday’s talks optimistic that a trilateral meeting with Russia and Ukraine’s leaders could be possible in the near future. If it happens, it would be the first face to face talks between Putin and Mr Zelensky since the Russian leader launched his full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russian forces had already occupied parts of eastern Ukraine for eight years prior to that all-out assault. \n\nPrevious face-to-face meetings between the two leaders to end the first rounds of fighting prior to 2022 failed to achieve a permanent truce, ultimately presaging Russia’s full-scale invasion. \n\nThe White House meeting on Monday was the first time that Mr Zelensky had met with Mr Trump in Washington DC since an astonishing shouting match in February between the Ukrainian leader and US vice president JD Vance played out in front of the media and culminated in the intended day of diplomacy being cut short without an agreement. \n\nMr Vance accused Mr Zelensky of failing to show gratitude for American support for Ukraine while the Ukrainian president drew the ire of Mr Trump after suggesting Russia posed a threat to US security. \n\nThe tone of Monday’s talks were markedly more positive. Mr Zelensky described his discussions with Mr Trump as “very good” as the pair laughed together. \n\nThe Ukrainian leader said: “We are very happy with the president that all the leaders are here and security in Ukraine depends on the United States and on you and on those leaders who are with us in our hearts.”","summary":"Sir Keir Starmer praised the White House meeting with eight European leaders, including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky, and Donald Trump as a possibly “historic step”  towards ending Vladimir Putin’s war","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/us/starmer-ukraine-trump-zelensky-meeting-b2809863.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/19/19/SEI262581252.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:22:44","author":"Tom Watling","authors":["Tom Watling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.256},{"id":352195456,"title":"Not a Handshake!

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accompanied by European leaders, arrived at the White House on Monday, where he was received by US Donald Trump. For his high-stakes talks with Donald Trump on the war with Russia, Zelenskyy wore a black suit-style jacket and shirt, notably without a tie.

As he handed over the letter, Zelensky said with a smile, “My wife, first lady of Ukraine, gave the letter. It’s not to you, to your wife.” The White House talks between Zelensky and Trump came just three days after Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Washington renewed efforts to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine.

Mediators Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, have struggled to secure a lasting truce in the conflict, which has triggered a dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut after receiving a new proposal from meditators, Hamas said it was ready for talks. “Hamas has delivered its response to the mediators, confirming that Hamas and the factions agreed to the new ceasefire proposal without requesting any amendments,” the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Israel has yet to respond.\n\nA Palestinian source familiar with the talks said mediators were “expected to announce that an agreement has been reached and set a date for the resumption of talks”, adding that guarantees were offered to ensure implementation and pursue a permanent solution. Another Palestinian official earlier said mediators had proposed an initial 60-day truce and hostage release in two batches. The proposal comes more than a week after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to expand the war into Gaza City and nearby refugee camps, which has sparked international outcry as well as domestic opposition.\n\nAn Islamic Jihad source told AFP the plan envisaged a 60-day ceasefire “during which 10 Israeli hostages would be released alive, along with a number of bodies”. Out of 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s October 2023 attack, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. The Islamic Jihad source said “the remaining captives would be released in a second phase”, with negotiations for a broader settlement to follow. They added that “all factions are supportive” of the Egyptian and Qatari proposal.\n\nUS President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!” “The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.” Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel “will agree to an agreement in which all the hostages are released at once and according to our conditions for ending the war”.\n\nMeanwhile, in a now familiar scene in Gaza, AFP footage from the southern city of Khan Yunis showed crowds of mourners kneeling over the shrouded bodies of their loved ones who were killed seeking aid the day before. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, visiting the Rafah border crossing with Gaza on Monday, said Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was visiting “to consolidate our existing common efforts in order to apply maximum pressure on the two sides to reach a deal as soon as possible”.\n\nAlluding to the dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people living in the Gaza Strip, where UN agencies and aid groups have warned of famine, Abdelatty stressed the urgency of reaching an agreement. “The current situation on the ground is beyond imagination,” he said. Egypt said on Monday it was willing to join a potential international force deployed to Gaza, but only if backed by a UN Security Council resolution and accompanied by a “political horizon”.","summary":"GAZA (AFP): Hamas has accepted a new ceasefire proposal for Gaza without requesting amendments, a source from the group told AFP Monday, after a fresh diplomatic push to end more than 22 months of war.

Thanking President Putin, Mr Modi “underlined India’s consistent position for a peaceful resolution of the (Russia-Ukraine) conflict through diplomacy and dialogue and reiterated that India supports all efforts in this regard”, New Delhi said in a statement.After the call, Mr Modi posted on social media platform X: “Thank my friend, President Putin, for his phone call and for sharing insights on his recent meeting with President Trump in Alaska. India has consistently called for a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict and supports all efforts in this regard. I look forward to our continued exchanges in the days to come.” Prime Minister Modi had referred to the Russian President as his “friend” after the call earlier this month as well. The two phone calls within days have both taken place after President Trump earlier this month had announced imposition of a 50 per cent tariff on India, including a penalty of 25 per cent for buying Russian oil, that is scheduled to kick in from August 27. There was, however, no direct reference to any discussion on the American tariffs imposed on India in both the statements of the Indian government following the two calls between Mr Modi and Mr Putin this month. After the Alaska summit “went well”, President Trump has indicated he may not have to impose the 25 per cent penalty tariffs on India. Soon after the summit ended, a relieved New Delhi had last Saturday hailed the two Presidents for “their leadership in the pursuit of peace” (to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict) as “highly commendable”. It is however significant that while Mr Putin has called Mr Modi after the Summit, no such effort has been made by President Trump, which could be a fallout of the raging India-US trade tensions. Also, Mr Modi is expected to meet President Putin soon at the Chinese port city of Tianjin where the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit will be held later this month. The call on Monday also comes ahead of the visit of external affairs minister S. Jaishankar to Moscow later this week. In a statement on Monday evening, New Delhi said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a telephone call today from President of Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. President Putin shared his assessment of his meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska last week… The two leaders also touched upon a number of issues of bilateral cooperation with a view to further strengthen the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia. The two leaders agreed to remain in close touch.” Earlier this month on August 8, in a firm signal to Washington that India will continue its close ties with Russia, Mr Modi had spoken to President Putin, with both leaders then “reaffirming their commitment to further deepen the special and privileged strategic partnership between India and Russia”. Mr Modi had said he “looked forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year” for the 23rd India-Russia annual summit and had extended an invitation in this regard to the Russian leader. India had said in a statement then that “President Putin briefed Mr Modi on the latest developments” concerning the Russia-Ukraine conflict, following which Mr Modi “thanked President Putin for his detailed assessment” and “reiterated India’s consistent position for peaceful resolution of the conflict”.","summary":"Modi thanks Russian Prez for phone call, reiterates wish for peaceful resolution.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/putin-briefs-pm-on-trump-meet-1898334","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/08/18/1949304-modi.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-18 20:18:40","author":"Sridhar Kumaraswami","authors":["Sridhar Kumaraswami"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":352198936,"title":"Zelensky, Trump express hope for trilateral talks with Putin to bring end to Russia-Ukraine war","text":"WASHINGTON (AP): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump expressed hope that their critical meeting Monday with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine.\n\nThe US president also said he would back European security guarantees for Ukraine as European leaders gathered in Washington to show support for Ukraine at the extraordinary White House meeting.\n\nTrump stopped short of committing US troops to the effort, saying instead that there would be a “NATO-like” security presence but that all those details would be hashed out in their afternoon meeting with EU leaders.\n\n“They want to give protection and they feel very strongly about it and we’ll help them out with that,” Trump said. “I think its very important to get the deal done.”\n\nTrump’s engagement with Zelensky had a strikingly different feel to their last Oval Office meeting in February. It was a disastrous moment that led to Trump abruptly ending talks with the Ukrainian delegation after he and Vice President JD Vance complained that Zelensky had shown insufficient gratitude for US military assistance.\n\nZelensky at the start of the meeting presented a letter from his wife, Olena Zelenska, for Trump’s wife, Melania. The US first lady over the weekend sent a letter to Putin urging him to bring an end to the brutal 3 1/2 year war.\n\nTrump at one point needled Zelensky over Ukraine delaying elections. They had been scheduled for last year but were delayed because of the ongoing Russian invasion. Ukrainian law does not allow presidential elections to be held when martial law is in effect.\n\nTrump joked that a similar circumstance wouldn’t play well in the US.\n\n“So let me just say three and a half years from now — so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections, oh, I wonder what the fake news would say,” Trump said.\n\nZelensky faced criticism during his February meeting from a conservative journalist for appearing in the Oval Office in a long sleeve T-shirt. This time he appeared in dark jacket and buttoned-shirt.\n\nZelensky has said his typically less formal attire since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022 is to show solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nMonday’s hastily assembled meeting comes after Trump met on Friday with Putin and has said that the onus is now on Zelensky to agree to concessions of land that he said could end the war.\n\n“If everything works out today, we’ll have a trilat,” Trump said, referring to possible three-way talks among Zelensky, Putin and Trump. “We’re going to work with Russia, we’re going to work with Ukraine.”\n\nTrump also said he plans to talk to Putin after his meetings with Zelensky and European leaders.\n\nZelensky expressed openness to trilateral talks.\n\n“We are ready for trilateral as president said,” Zelensky said.\n\nTrump first held one-on-one talks with Zelensky. The two will later gather with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nThe European leaders were left out of Trump’s summit with Putin. They want to safeguard Ukraine and the continent from any widening aggression from Moscow. Many arrived at the White House with the explicit goal of protecting Ukraine’s interests — a rare show of diplomatic force.\n\nAhead of Monday’s meeting, Trump suggested that Ukraine could not regain Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, setting off an armed conflict that led to its broader 2022 invasion.\n\n“President Zelensky of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,” Trump wrote Sunday night on social media. “Remember how it started. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!”\n\nZelensky responded with his own post late Sunday, saying, “We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably.” He said that “peace must be lasting,” not as it was after Russia seized Crimea and part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine eight years ago, and “Putin simply used it as a springboard for a new attack.”\n\nZelensky said in a social media post he met with Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Monday ahead of his scheduled talks with Trump to discuss the battlefield situation and the shared “strong diplomatic capabilities” of the US, Ukraine and Europe. He also held talks with European leaders at the Ukrainian embassy in Washington.\n\nEuropean heavyweights in Washington\n\nOn the table for discussion with European leaders are possible NATO-like security guarantees that Ukraine would need for any peace with Russia to be durable. Putin opposes Ukraine joining NATO outright, yet Trump’s team claims the Russian leader is open to allies agreeing to defend Ukraine if it comes under attack.\n\n“Clearly there are no easy solutions when talking about ending a war and building peace,” Meloni told reporters. “We have to explore all possible solutions to guarantee peace, to guarantee justice, and to guarantee security for our countries.”\n\nThe European leaders are aiming to keep the focus during the White House talks on finding a sustainable peace and believe forging a temporary ceasefire is not off the table, according to a European official.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the leaders are also looking to keep pressure on Russia to end the fighting and want to get more concrete assurances from the US about security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal.\n\nZelensky outlined what he said his country needed to feel secure, which included a “strong Ukrainian army” through weapons sales and training. The second part, he said, would depend on the outcome of Monday’s talks and what EU countries, NATO and the US would be able to guarantee to the war-torn country.\n\nTrump briefed Zelensky and European allies shortly after the Putin meeting. Details from the discussions emerged in a scattershot way that seemed to rankle the US president, who had chosen not to outline any terms when appearing afterward with Putin.\n\nAhead of Monday’s White House meetings, Trump took to social media to say that even if Russia said, “We give up, we concede, we surrender” the news media and Democrats “would say that this was a bad and humiliating day for Donald J. Trump.”\n\nFollowing the Alaska summit, Trump declared that a ceasefire was not necessary for peace talks to proceed, a sudden shift to a position favored by Putin.\n\n‘A very big move’\n\nEuropean officials confirmed that Trump told them Putin is still seeking control of the entire Donbas region, even though Ukraine controls a meaningful share of it.\n\nTrump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said the US and its allies could offer Ukraine a NATO-like commitment to defend the country if it came under attack as the possible security guarantee, with details to be worked out.\n\nZelensky came into the talks look to prevent a scenario in which he gets blamed for blocking peace talks by rejecting Putin’s maximalist demand on the Donbas. It is a demand Zelensky has said many times he will never accept because it is unconstitutional and could create a launching pad for future Russian attacks.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump expressed hope that their critical meeting Monday with European leaders at the White House could lead to three-party talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to his war on Ukraine.

The native Texan did give a 10-gallon hat tip college cheer teams, which have traditionally included men.\n\n'I don't have anything against male cheerleaders,' he began.\n\n'The Texas A&M Aggies have been doing this for decades,' he continued, playfully making the hook'em hand gesture of the rival Texas Longhorns. 'There have been male cheerleaders around a long time.'\n\nThe problem, as Cain sees it, is that the NFL's male cheerleaders are more dancers than the burly guys who spend Saturdays pumping up the crowd at college stadiums.\n\n'There is something different than what is going on in the NFL,' Cain said, arriving at his point. 'And if we're really being honest, we're talking about male cheerleaders being female cheerleaders. That's what's happening with these men who are cheering on the Minnesota Vikings.'\n\nFailla agreed saying 'this is not good,'\n\nOf course, since Hegseth is a Minneapolis native and diehard Vikings fan, Cain naturally thought the defense secretary might be able to get involved.\n\n'I do know somebody who is a Minnesota Vikings fan, and I imagine he had a pretty big hand in those B-52s flying over Vladimir Putin's head today in Alaska,' Cain said, referring to Donald Trump's brief meting with the Russian President. 'So I don't know, maybe we need to call the Secretary of Defense.'\n\nFailla responded by yelling: 'Oh d***.'\n\nHe then made it abundantly clear whom Cain was discussing.\n\n'For those of you who don't follow cabinet positions, that man he was mentioning rhymes with 'Pete Hegseth,' Failla joked.\n\nCain then added: 'And the man who would show up to Fox and Friends weekend ever Sunday dressed in purple. Several places. Socks, wristbands, tie.'\n\nThe Vikings recently added Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn to the cheer squad.\n\nThere has been some uproar over their inclusion on the team, but the Vikings have since defended their position in a statement.\n\n'While many fans may be seeing male cheerleaders for the first time at Vikings games, male cheerleaders have been part of previous Vikings teams and have long been associated with collegiate and professional cheerleading,' the statement read.\n\n'In 2025, approximately one-third of NFL teams have male cheerleaders. Every member of the Minnesota Vikings Cheerleaders program has an impressive dance background and went through the same rigorous audition process. Individuals were selected because of their talent, passion for dance and dedication to elevating the game day experience.
