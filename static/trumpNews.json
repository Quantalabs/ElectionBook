So we should be prepared for all outcomes,' he added. A BBC spokesman said it 'will review the letter and respond directly in due course'.\n\nIn a scathing letter, the President's lawyers demanded – by Friday night – a full retraction, immediate apology and an offer of compensation from the BBC over the 'fabricated depiction' of Donald Trump on Panorama \n\nYesterday, BBC chairman Samir Shah (above) admitted to an 'error of judgment' over the editing but rejected claims of systemic bias and stopped short of issuing a direct apology to Mr Trump\n\nIn the legal letter, Mr Trump's lawyer, Alejandro Brito, demands that 'false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements' made about the President are retracted immediately. \n\nThe letter warns: 'Failure to comply will leave President Trump with no choice but to pursue any and all legal rights and remedies available to recover damages for the overwhelming financial and reputational harm that the BBC has caused him.'\n\nIf the BBC fails to respond by the looming deadline, Mr Trump will be 'left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights... including by filing legal action for no less than 1,000,000,000 dollars (£760 million) in damages,' the letter states. \n\nThe correspondence, dated November 9, bluntly concludes: 'The BBC is on notice. PLEASE GOVERN YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY.'\n\nA spokesman for Mr Trump's legal team said: 'The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the presidential election.\n\n'President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception, and fake news.'\n\nIn other developments yesterday:\n\nA civil war broke out between the BBC board and its news operation over the impartiality row, with fingers being pointed from both sides;\n\nThere were suggestions it may take as long as nine months to find a replacement for Mr Davie, but he is said to have 'had enough' and will look to relinquish the role sooner; \n\nThe BBC was on alert for more possible resignations as critics called for a clear-out of executives; \n\nDowning Street acknowledged mistakes had been made but backed the corporation, despite growing calls to scrap the licence fee. \n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said he had spoken to Mr Trump on Friday about the scandal and the President was 'absolutely enraged' when concerns over the clip first emerged in a leaked document. 'He just said to me: 'Is this how you treat your best ally?' he said.\n\nThe airing of the Panorama documentary, Trump: A Second Chance?, in the week before the US went to the ballot box amounted to 'election interference' by the BBC, Mr Farage said.\n\nMr Trump was 'stitched up on the eve of a national election', he added.\n\nDirector-general Tim Davie quit the BBC on Sunday after five years in the corporation's top job \n\nThe threat of legal action is likely to put further pressure on the corporation, which was labelled 'corrupt' and 'dishonest' by the President following Sunday night's shock double resignation.\n\nHowever, a defiant Ms Turness defended the corporation and her colleagues against the claims.\n\n'Of course our journalists aren't corrupt. Our journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality and I will stand by their journalism,' she said as she turned up for work yesterday.\n\n'I stepped down over the weekend because the buck stops with me. But I'd like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased.'\n\nDowning Street also appeared to rally around the BBC, insisting it was not corrupt or institutionally biased.\n\nIn the blistering legal letter, Mr Trump's lawyers accused the BBC of a 'reckless disregard for the truth' and said the doctored clip was 'published to deliberately denigrate President Trump'.\n\nIt said the broadcast 'maliciously' altered what Mr Trump said by 'editing together footage from the start of the speech with a separate quote' uttered an hour later. \n\nIt also accused the BBC of deliberately editing out Mr Trump saying that he expected people to be 'marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard'.\n\n'The timing of the fabricated documentary is evident. The BBC's reckless disregard for the truth underscores the actual malice behind the decision to publish the wrongful content, given the plain falsity of the statements,' the letter says.\n\nIt said 'tens of millions of people worldwide' had viewed the 'fabricated statement' aired on the BBC's various platforms.\n\n'Consequently, the BBC has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm.'\n\nListing Mr Trump's demands, the letter continues that the BBC must immediately issue a full retraction 'of the documentary and any and all other false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading, and inflammatory statements about President Trump in as conspicuous a manner as they were originally published'.\n\nIts third and final demand is that the BBC must 'appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused'.\n\nA memo by former editorial advisor Michael Prescott leaked last week raised concerns over the doctoring of Mr Trump's speech, and the BBC's coverage of trans issues and Gaza.\n\nThe splicing of several clips together made it appear that Mr Trump had told supporters he was going to walk to the US Capitol with them to 'fight like hell'.\n\nMr Shah said there have been more than 500 complaints since the leaked memo was published, adding: 'We accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.'\n\nHowever, the chairman attacked the author of the critical dossier, accusing Mr Prescott of giving a 'personal account' that gave only a 'partial' view of events.\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTrump tells BBC - grovel or I'll sue you for $1bn: Meltdown at Broadcasting House as president gives Friday deadline for Panorama apology, retraction and compensation\n\nAdd comment","summary":"As the embattled national broadcaster admitted to an 'error of judgment' when it doctored footage of a 2021 speech by Mr Trump, the US President's lawyers put the BBC 'on notice'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15278527/meltdown-Broadcasting-House-Trump-BBC-apology.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/11/00/103735853-0-image-m-32_1762821755750.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/03/312601355069115629/1024x576_MP4_312601355069115629.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-11 01:11:04","author":"Editor,Grant Tucker,Interdeep Bains","authors":["Editor","Grant Tucker","Interdeep Bains"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.491},{"id":377676526,"title":"Police release photo after sisters with two young children are 'assaulted and racially abused' near central London Tube station","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Nov 11th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo swap their trademark pink and green looks for sultry gowns after being mocked for 'annoying' red carpet exchange as they attend the London premiere of Wicked: For Good\n\nSir Keir Starmer ducks demands to ditch the licence fee as he rallies behind the BBC and insists it is 'stronger than ever'... while Trump threatens to hit the corporation with a $1billion lawsuit\n\nPictured: Woman, 34, stabbed to death in 'unprovoked attack' in Birmingham city centre - as man, 21, appears in court charged with her murder\n\nIf you're taking pills for heartburn, you MUST know about the side-effects, says DR MARTIN SCURR.

Antigua Tribune – Daily Antigua &amp;","text":"Muslim voters in the United States overwhelmingly favoured Democratic candidates in last week’s elections, amid mounting anger at President Donald Trump’s policies, a new exit poll suggests.\n\nThe survey, released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Monday, shows 97 percent of Muslim voters in New York backed democratic socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nVirginia’s Democratic Muslim American Senator Ghazala Hashmi also received 95 percent of the Muslim vote in the state in her successful bid for lieutenant governor, according to the poll.\n\nNon-Muslim, more centrist Democratic candidates received strong backing from Muslim voters as well, the CAIR study showed.\n\nVirginia’s Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill – Democratic congresswomen who won the gubernatorial races – both received about 85 percent support from Muslim voters, according to the survey.\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 50, which approved a congressional map that favours Democrats, won 90 percent support from Muslim voters, the poll suggested.\n\nCAIR said it interviewed 1,626 self-identified Muslim respondents for the survey.\n\nThe group said the results showed high turnout from Muslim voters.\n\n“These exit poll results highlight an encouraging truth: American Muslims are showing up, speaking out, and shaping the future of our democracy,” the group said in a statement.\n\n“Across four states, Muslim voters demonstrated remarkable engagement and commitment to the civic process, casting ballots that reflect their growing role as active participants in American life.”\n\nThe November 4 election, one year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, offered a boost for Democrats.\n\nBut the race for New York, which saw Trump endorse former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, saw a spike of Islamophobic rhetoric, particularly from Republican lawmakers and commentators.\n\nCAIR said Muslim voters showed that they are rising up in “the face of anti-Muslim bigotry” to “build a better future for themselves and their neighbors, proving that participation, not prejudice, defines our nation’s strength”.\n\nThe survey’s results show that the Democrats are recovering the support of some Muslim voters who deserted the party in last year’s presidential election due to former President Joe Biden’s uncompromising support for Israel amid the brutal assault on Gaza.\n\nCAIR said it recorded 76 Muslim candidates in last week’s election, 38 of whom won.\n\nIn Michigan, the Detroit suburbs of Hamtramck, Dearborn and Dearborn Heights elected Muslim mayors in the polls.\n\nSeveral Muslim candidates are vying for seats in Congress in next year’s election, including Abdul el-Sayed, who is seeking a US Senate seat in Michigan.","url":"https://antiguatribune.com/us-democrats-recovered-support-from-muslim-voters-poll-suggests/","image":"https://antiguatribune.com/app/uploads/2025/11/afp_68fc083fc917-1761347647-shyZtL.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 01:06:06","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ag","sentiment":0.078},{"id":377676530,"title":"Aimee Lou Wood puts on a leggy display in pinstriped shorts as she attends a cast and crew screening for Daddy Issues series two","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTuesday, Nov 11th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAriana Grande and Cynthia Erivo swap their trademark pink and green looks for sultry gowns after being mocked for 'annoying' red carpet exchange as they attend the London premiere of Wicked: For Good\n\nSir Keir Starmer ducks demands to ditch the licence fee as he rallies behind the BBC and insists it is 'stronger than ever'... while Trump threatens to hit the corporation with a $1billion lawsuit\n\nPictured: Woman, 34, stabbed to death in 'unprovoked attack' in Birmingham city centre -

He also shut down criticism he received for accepting the invitation. \n\nThe conversation kicked off after Hines noted that the “whole [2024] election was cuckoo birds.”\n\nMaher then pointed to a paper he had framed on the set of his podcast with all of the insults Trump has aimed at him over the years. He said the president signed the document when they dined together earlier this year. \n\nClaiming that he “earned every one of those” insults from the president, he continued, “You know, it’s not like I was ever deceived before or after I had dinner with him, and I want to have dinner with him again.” \n\n“I think he needs more people … and he likes talking to people,” Maher added. \n\nHines, who is married to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., quickly agreed, telling the comedian that she was “surprised” by how “very curious” Trump was when she met him. The actor has been criticized for supporting her husband, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist. \n\nTrump “really likes to listen to people,” she added. \n\nMaher interrupted Hines to mention how he had been crucified and “hated” by his critics for saying the same thing about the right-wing political leader, whose actions some have likened to those of a dictator. \n\n“I think he actually wants more people around him for a stimulating conversation. I was very surprised. … They hated me for it,” he added, before noting that “so many important people” that he’s met “don’t feel like they’re really listening” when you speak with them. \n\nDeclaring that he “didn’t get that with [Trump] at all” after sitting down with him, Maher continued, “I got a guy who looked in my eye … was listening to what I said [and] waited until I finished, even when it was contradictory.” \n\n“He never got blustery or mad about [our opposing opinions]. He said some things that I don’t agree with and some things that I think are just, you know, plainly not right, like, you know [him running for a] third term.” \n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of running for a third term since at least 2020, and even went as far as selling “Trump 2028” merchandise beginning back in April. The move is barred by the Constitution. \n\nMaher’s commentary on the dinner previously drew harsh criticism, with Democratic strategist James Carville adding to the chorus, The Hill reported at the time. \n\n“I think Bill Maher was had. He went there and he talked about how charming and measured Trump was,” Carville said. “This was the same guy that day was reveling in a guy who was illegally deported to El Salvador and refused to bring him back, who loves to hurt people, loves to inflict pain.”\n\nWatch Maher’s “Club Random” podcast below.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-maher-dinner-trump_n_69124939e4b0b840aac1615a?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/691271b11700001e4d9c5249.jpg?cache=8IPWGTtVm9&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:42:44","author":"Jazmin Tolliver","authors":["Jazmin Tolliver"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":377674668,"title":"Social Media Is Eating Up Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Shocking Turn From Trump","text":"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is shocking lots of people with her recent statements contradicting President Donald Trump and calling out “weak Republican men” including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nEven more surprising: She actually said positive things about Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after the former House speaker announced her retirement last week.\n\nAlthough some have speculated that Greene is trying to change her image from loony conspiracy theorist to semi-reasonable conservative in preparation for a 2028 presidential run, the pivot is confusing to some people, like the president himself.\n\nIn a press conference on Monday, Trump was asked for his response to Greene’s recent critique that domestic policy should take priority over foreign affairs ― and her acknowledgment that grocery prices have not, as he has falsely claimed, decreased.\n\n“Yeah. So, uhh,” Trump began. “I don’t know what happened to Marjorie,” he said before adding, “She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think.”\n\nTrump then expressed confusion over Greene’s willingness to leave the MAGA bubble to appear on mainstream media outlets like CNN and on shows like “Real Time With Bill Maher” and “The View.”\n\n“So when somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s now catering to the other side — I don’t know what, you know, I guess she’s got some kind of an act going — but I’m surprised at her,” Trump said. “But when somebody like Marjorie goes over and starts making statements like that, it shows she doesn’t know.” \n\nAfter Trump griped about Greene’s seeming defection from his side, Greene told CNN in a statement that she hasn’t changed.\n\n“I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!” she said, according to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\nThe unexpected split between the two big-name Republicans has, predictably, attracted lots of attention on the internet.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-shift-trump_n_691265c5e4b091c6c286012e?origin=home-politics-feed-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69126b831700004f4c9c5241.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:38:49","author":"David Moye","authors":["David Moye"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":377674064,"title":"US Democrats recovered support from Muslim voters, poll suggests  - Bahamas Spectator – Bahamas &amp;","text":"Muslim voters in the United States overwhelmingly favoured Democratic candidates in last week’s elections, amid mounting anger at President Donald Trump’s policies, a new exit poll suggests.\n\nThe survey, released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) on Monday, shows 97 percent of Muslim voters in New York backed democratic socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nVirginia’s Democratic Muslim American Senator Ghazala Hashmi also received 95 percent of the Muslim vote in the state in her successful bid for lieutenant governor, according to the poll.\n\nNon-Muslim, more centrist Democratic candidates received strong backing from Muslim voters as well, the CAIR study showed.\n\nVirginia’s Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey’s Mikie Sherrill – Democratic congresswomen who won the gubernatorial races – both received about 85 percent support from Muslim voters, according to the survey.\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 50, which approved a congressional map that favours Democrats, won 90 percent support from Muslim voters, the poll suggested.\n\nCAIR said it interviewed 1,626 self-identified Muslim respondents for the survey.\n\nThe group said the results showed high turnout from Muslim voters.\n\n“These exit poll results highlight an encouraging truth: American Muslims are showing up, speaking out, and shaping the future of our democracy,” the group said in a statement.\n\n“Across four states, Muslim voters demonstrated remarkable engagement and commitment to the civic process, casting ballots that reflect their growing role as active participants in American life.”\n\nThe November 4 election, one year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, offered a boost for Democrats.\n\nBut the race for New York, which saw Trump endorse former Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, saw a spike of Islamophobic rhetoric, particularly from Republican lawmakers and commentators.\n\nCAIR said Muslim voters showed that they are rising up in “the face of anti-Muslim bigotry” to “build a better future for themselves and their neighbors, proving that participation, not prejudice, defines our nation’s strength”.\n\nThe survey’s results show that the Democrats are recovering the support of some Muslim voters who deserted the party in last year’s presidential election due to former President Joe Biden’s uncompromising support for Israel amid the brutal assault on Gaza.\n\nCAIR said it recorded 76 Muslim candidates in last week’s election, 38 of whom won.\n\nIn Michigan, the Detroit suburbs of Hamtramck, Dearborn and Dearborn Heights elected Muslim mayors in the polls.\n\nSeveral Muslim candidates are vying for seats in Congress in next year’s election, including Abdul el-Sayed, who is seeking a US Senate seat in Michigan.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/us-democrats-recovered-support-from-muslim-voters-poll-suggests/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2025/11/afp_68fc083fc917-1761347647-RNpaJF.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:35:24","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":0.078},{"id":377673140,"title":"US-Syria meeting: Trump holds first-ever White House meeting with Al-Sharaa; America partially waives Caesar Act sanctions — top points","text":"US President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday, welcoming Syria into a US-led global coalition to fight the Islamic State group. The meeting marked the first visit to the White House by a Syrian head of state since Syria gained independence from France in 1946.Al-Sharaa arrived at the White House around 11.30 am and shortly after began a closed meeting in the Oval Office. He entered via West Executive Avenue rather than the West Wing driveway normally used for foreign leaders’ arrivals. He left about two hours later, greeting a throng of supporters outside before getting into his motorcade, AP reported.Syria to join US-led coalition to defeat IS group: ReportSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, according to BBC report.Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although Trump has moved to restore them after the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.The talks between the two countries focused on Syria’s role in defeating Islamic State, the reconstruction effort and the lifting of sanctions. Trump praises Al-Sharaa “We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that’s part of the Middle East,” Trump told reporters.

The American people do. It is a rule of thumb that for every person who marches, there are 10 to 20 who sympathize. That would equate to 70 million to 140 million people, as a record 7 million participated. While some complain that these rallies don’t do anything, they are an essential demonstration of the depth and breadth of popular sentiment and resistance, and they serve to hearten and motivate people to engage.\n\nPhil Rapier\n\nLet’s have the courage\nto rethink how we move\n\nEvery morning on my way to school, I watch cars inch along the freeway, engines humming, exhaust drifting into the air we all breathe. It’s not anyone’s fault — it’s just how our cities were built. But it doesn’t have to stay this way.\n\nTransportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in California, and we feel it in every asthma attack, every hazy sunset and every heat wave that keeps us indoors. Yet buses are late, trains are crowded and biking still feels unsafe. If we want people to choose cleaner ways to get around, we need to make them reliable, affordable and safe, rather than just idealistic.\n\nClean air shouldn’t be a luxury. It should be the baseline for living here. The Bay Area has the talent and creativity to lead the nation in climate solutions. We just need the courage to rethink how we move.\n\nAdministration keeps\nchipping away at rights\n\nRe: “Trump administration speeds up new rules that would make it easier to charge some protesters” (Nov. 6).\n\nMy blood is boiling after having read the article reporting Donald Trump’s administration once again attacking our rights, speeding up laws and rules that make it easier for federal officers to arrest protesters who are near immigration facilities.\n\nThis is something that should alarm not only Californians but Americans as a whole. Peaceful protest is a core First Amendment right, but now we have rules targeting those who wear masks or cause “obstruction.” We cannot accept a system that is attacking our constitutional rights and freedom of speech. The Trump administration has time and time again abused its power, and it keeps getting worse. Voices are being silenced at a time when we need our voices to be heard more than ever.\n\nI urge everyone who reads this to oppose these rules and contact their federal representatives and demand they block them.\n\nAndres Espinoza\n\nApathetic, ignorant\nvoters rewarded Trump\n\nDonald Trump can thank digital sources and television for his second election. Americans get their news primarily from TV, social networks and digital sources. They don’t read. If Americans still read, no doubt they would have stumbled across Project 2025 and learned what the Republicans’ plans were for the country.\n\nInstead, Americans watch sound bites on TV, believe inaccurate social posts and vote for personalities. Given that, you would think they would have known what to expect from a person who relished saying “you’re fired.”\n\nNow polls show more than 12% higher disapproval than approval of Trump’s actions. We have the lazy, uninformed American voters to thank for the demise of our democracy. We brought this upon ourselves.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nShutdowns a destructive\nway to negotiate budget\n\nRe: “Passengers facing delays, frustration” (Page A1, Nov. 8).\n\nThe shutdown of important parts of the U.S. government when allocated funds exceed funds available is a bipartisan problem. We witnessed that solving the problem with a government shutdown was extortionate in President Trump’s first term, and we again witnessed that itwas extortionate over the last month.\n\nThis problem needs to be fixed permanently. Congress needs to come together and re-legislate the process, since having necessary government programs cease is a very destructive way to handle budgetary shortfalls. And an available alternative, increasing the national debt, is already available and a well-used procedure.\n\nTrue, this debt does cause a problem over the long term. A large part of our current spending is paying off the current deficit. But this problem should be handled at allocation, not when the funds become due.\n\nIn short, the current process enables societal pain and policy-making extortion at public expense. It should be changed.\n\nWallace Clark\n\nInvestigation won’t\nfind the beef\n\nRe: “Trump calls for investigation of rising beef prices” (Page A4, Nov. 8).\n\nRising beef prices have been a reality in this country for years. During the Bush administration, Brazilian meat packers acquired American meat processing companies. Through greed-based consolidation and globalization, the U.S. lost control of its ability to regulate beef prices via a competitive market.\n\nNeither beef ranchers nor the American public have benefited from this short-sighted error. Having the DOJ “investigate” this fact will be relatively meaningless, as globalization presents meat buyers with a “take it or leave it” option in a non-competitive marketplace.\n\nAs is typical, it provides a convenient presidential talking point distraction, but, as usual, nothing of substance.","summary":"Also: How we move &#124; Undermining rights &#124; Ignorant voters &#124; Destructive shutdowns &#124; Beef investigation.

While he met with Trump behind closed doors, the US Treasury Department announced a 180-day extension of its suspension of enforcement of the so-called Caesar sanctions, but only the US Congress can lift them entirely.Trump met with Sharaa in the first-ever visit by a Syrian president to Washington, six months after their first meeting in Saudi Arabia, where the US leader announced plans to lift sanctions, and just days after the US said he was no longer a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\".preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}In an unusually muted welcome, Sharaa, who once had a $10 million US bounty on his head, arrived without the fanfare usually given to foreign dignitaries. He entered through a side door where reporters only got a glimpse instead of through the West Wing main door where cameras often capture Trump greeting VIPs.Speaking to reporters, Trump praised Sharaa as a \"strong leader\" and voiced confidence in him. \"We’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful,\" he said.But Trump also gave a nod to Sharaa's controversial past. \"We’ve all had rough pasts,\" he said.Promising \"continued sanctions relief,\" the Treasury Department announced a new order to replace its May 23 waiver on enforcement of the 2019 Caesar Act, which imposed sweeping sanctions over human rights abuses under Assad. The move essentially extended the waiver by another 180 days,Sharaa, 43, took power last year after his Islamist fighters launched a lightning offensive and overthrew longtime Syrian President Assad just days later on December 8.Syria has since moved at a dizzying pace, away from Assad's key allies Iran and Russia and toward Turkey, the Gulf - and Washington.Security was also expected to be a top focus of Sharaa's meeting with Trump, who in a major US policy shift has sought to help Syria's fragile transition.The US is brokering talks on a possible security pact between Syria and Israel, which remains wary of Sharaa's former militant ties. Reuters reported last week that the US is planning to establish a military presence at a Damascus airbase.Syria recently signed a political cooperation declaration with the US-led \"Global Coalition to Defeat Islamic State,\" the Syrian information minister said in a post on X on Monday.ASSASSINATION PLOTSJust hours before the landmark talks, word emerged of two separate Islamic State plots to assassinate Sharaa that had been foiled over the last few months, according to a senior Syrian security official and a senior Middle Eastern official.Over the weekend, the Syrian interior ministry launched a nationwide campaign targeting Islamic State cells across the country, arresting more than 70 suspects, government media said.Sharaa's arrival at the White House was muted. Most heads of state are driven up the driveway festooned with their national flags. But on Monday there was none of that.Following the meeting, Trump sharply rebuked US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said on X that she would \"really like to see nonstop meetings at the WH on domestic policy not foreign policy and foreign country’s leaders.\"Saying the Georgia Republican had \"lost her way,\" he added: \"I have to view the presidency as a worldwide situation ... We could have a world on fire where wars come to our shores very easily.\"As Sharaa left the compound, he exited his motorcade just in front of the White House and briefly greeted a cheering crowd of supporters, some waving Syrian flags.Sharaa was expected to strongly advocate for a repeal of the Caesar Act, which will help spur global investment in a country ravaged by 14 years of war and which the World Bank estimates will take more than $200 billion to rebuild.Several influential members of Congress have called for the lifting of the 2019 Caesar sanctions, passed in response to human rights abuses under Assad. A few of Trump’s fellow Republicans want the sanctions to stay in place, but that could change if Trump applies pressure.Syria's social fabric has been more recently tested. New bouts of sectarian violence left more than 2,500 dead since Assad's fall, deepening civil war wounds and putting into question the new rulers' ability to govern for all Syrians.Trump's focus on Syria comes as his administration seeks to keep intact a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas militants and push forward on his 20-point plan for an end to the two-year-old war there.DRAMATIC SHIFTSSharaa's own turnaround is no less impressive than his country's. He joined al-Qaeda in Iraq around the time of the 2003 US-led invasion and spent years in US prison there, before returning to Syria to join the insurgency against Assad.In 2013, the US designated Sharaa, then known as Abu Mohammad al-Golani, as a terrorist for his ties to al Qaeda. He broke ties with the group in 2016 and consolidated his influence in Syria's northwest.The US removed the bounty on Sharaa in December, and just last week, the United Nations Security Council lifted terror-related sanctions designations on him and his Interior Minister Anas Khattab.- EndsPublished By: Satyam SinghPublished On: Nov 11, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/donald-trump-supports-syria-president-sharaa-historic-washington-meeting-glbs-2817081-2025-11-11","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/trump--syria-112248495-16x9_0.png?VersionId=RJiBfGMMYoJvPSeUm1opyKnM5OEGF4Gm?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:23:42","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.007},{"id":377673836,"title":"Netizens React To Donald Trump Calling Erika Kirk Over For A Kiss: 'Nightmare Breath Check'","text":"Erika Kirk joined President Donald Trump at the swearing-in of the US Ambassador to India ceremony on Monday.

In the video, she approaches him, they hold hands, she bends close to him, and he kisses her on the cheek. She smiles at him, and they shake hands.​The brief interaction caught the social media users' attention.

Former United States Representative Adam Kinzinger shared his thoughts on X in December 2023, saying he was 'surprised how people close to Trump haven't talked about the odour.' He added that it was 'truly something to behold' while suggesting that they should 'Wear a mask if you can.'Kinzinger doubled down on his take about Trump's scent on Jimmy Kimmel Live. He described it as a mix of 'armpits, ketchup, makeup, and a little butt.'Comedian Kathy Griffin, who worked with Trump on The Apprentice, shared the same sentiment about his alleged smell. She recounted spending a day with Liza Minnelli to host a challenge. According to Griffin, they 'tried to ignore him, but he does smell really bad.'Trump's alleged body odour also made it to various discussion forums. One asked on Quora if Trump 'smells repulsively,' and another user, who claimed to have met Trump twice, confirmed it.'He smells like a dirty diaper and has horrible halitosis plus dumb as a box of rocks ( my apologies to the rocks),' the Quora user replied.​Erika Kirk's Attendance At Swearing-In Ceremony QuestionedWhile some social media users were focused on Donald Trump's smell, others were more concerned about Erika Kirk's attendance at the event.

What IS clear is that the BBC's prestige and power have eroded significantly as it has done such a poor job of navigating the political and cultural landscape. \n\nOn Sunday, the Culture Secretary claimed the BBC’s editorial decisions were not always “well thought through” and fell short of the “highest” expectations.She said: “My concern about what is happening at the BBC is twofold.

Inside the H-1B visa controversy","text":"Following months of controversy, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation in September decrying the systemic abuse of the H-1B visa program, which he said is fueling the \"large-scale replacement of American workers\" that \"has undermined both our economic and national security.\" To address this, Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for companies seeking to obtain an H-1B visa, a move that has been widely criticized by business leaders, especially in the tech industry. Debate over the program has split both the American public and the GOP, with one side saying the visa holders are poaching American jobs and the other saying it is vital to U.S. competitiveness. So, what are H-1B visas, and why have they become a political flashpoint? TRUMP ADMIN REVEALS OVER 100 INVESTIGATIONS INTO H-1B ABUSES AS IT PLEDGES 'EVERY RESOURCE' TO PROTECT US JOBS What is an H-1B visa? An H-1B visa is a non-immigrant work visa that allows companies in the U.S. to hire highly-skilled foreign workers in specialty occupations for an initial period of three years, which can be extended to six years. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website states that the visas are meant for individuals of \"exceptional merit and ability.\" Individuals must have at least a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field. Which industries are the H-1B visas most common in? By far the industry most heavily utilizing H-1B visas is the tech industry, which accounts for roughly 60% to 70% of all the new applications in recent years. Other top industries include consulting and professional services, engineering and manufacturing, healthcare and medical research and higher education. DESANTIS SAYS HE WON’T TOLERATE H-1B VISA ‘ABUSE' IN FLORIDA UNIVERSITIES How many foreign workers hold these visas? There is no official figure for the number of people currently holding H-1B visas. There is a yearly cap of 65,000 people who can obtain H-1B visas. The program allows for an additional 20,000 individuals holding master’s degrees or above. Notably, most universities and non-profit research organizations are cap-exempt, further increasing the number of people being approved each year. The Pew Research Center estimated that about 400,000 H-1B visa applications were approved last year under the Biden administration. Where do visa holders come from? Nearly 3 out of every 4, 73%, of H-1B visa holders come from India, according to Pew. The country with the second-highest number of visa holders is China, with 12%. The remaining 15% comes from a mix of other countries, with no single country reaching the 2% threshold. Who is against H-1B visas? The H-1B visa program has been criticized on both sides of the political aisle, including from Trump to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. TRUMP’S $100K H-1B VISA OVERHAUL COULD HIT TECH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HARDEST Critics say the current program has veered away from its original intent to attract top talent to work in the U.S. and instead is being used by employers to import cheap foreign labor, depress wages, and cut out American workers. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Senate Judiciary Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reintroduced bipartisan legislation in September to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B program to protect American workers and stop the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries. On the state level, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued guidance in October to combat the university loophole. DeSantis directed the Florida Board of Governors to end the practice of higher education institutions \"importing foreign workers on H-1B visas instead of hiring Americans\" by requiring universities to \"put American graduates first and ensure taxpayer-funded schools serve the American workforce.\" Who supports H-1B visas? On the other side of the debate, prominent figures such as Elon Musk have advocated for H-1B visas because the program is essential for the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge. Shortly before Trump returned to the Oval Office, Musk said, \"The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B\" and pledged to \"go to war\" in support of the program. However, Musk also noted his belief that \"the program is broken and needs major reform.\" DOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES He proposed \"raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically.\" Business leaders have said the H-1B program is important in competing with countries such as China, which just recently launched a similar program, called the K-visa, to attract top talent to the country. The program went into effect on Oct. 1. The H-1B program also has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Are Visa holders taking American jobs away? On Sept. 19, Trump issued a presidential proclamation titled \"Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,\" in which he said the H-1B visa program was being \"deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" Trump said this abuse has been used by companies to \"artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.\" The president wrote that \"the large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security.\" TRUMP ADMIN REVEALS OVER 100 INVESTIGATIONS INTO H-1B ABUSES AS IT PLEDGES 'EVERY RESOURCE' TO PROTECT US JOBS As such, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee, effective Sept. 21, 2025. The restriction will expire one year from the effective date. Trump also directed his administration to \"initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the admission as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high-paid aliens.\" Meanwhile, another DHS rule will narrow the definition of \"specialty occupation\" that will allow the department officials to increase worksite compliance inspections before and after an H-1B petition, and require the petitioner’s employer to make the application directly — a move to stop companies from bringing in H-1B immigrants and then contracting them to other companies. What’s next? The debate over H-1B visas promises to continue in the coming months and years. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued the Trump administration to stop its implementation of the $100,000 application requirement, which it says would \"make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program.\" The lawsuit argues that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including a requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The chamber previously warned that restrictions on the H-1B program \"have the potential to inflict serious harm upon many American companies.\" The case is currently ongoing. It remains to be seen whether Congress will ultimately weigh in one way or another on the issue.","summary":"Debate over the H-1B program has split both the American public and the GOP, so what is the program and why has it become a political flashpoint during the Biden and Trump admins?","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-workers-being-replaced-inside-h-1b-visa-controversy","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/trump-h1b-visa.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:16:04","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":377669506,"title":"Big Brother stunner’s controversial past","text":"And her notoriety has already proven controversial among some fans of the franchise, who’ve declared her too famous for a spot on the show and even accused her of being the dreaded “i” word: An influencer.\n\nHolly’s vibe was apparent from the moment she appeared on stage with host Mel Tracina during Sunday’s premiere, waiting to be let into the Big Brother house. \n\nWhile other excited contestants rattled off the usual reality TV clichés about their plans to be themselves and tell it like it is, a poised Holly took her moment with the host to deliver an extended on-air plug about the designer labels she was wearing from head to toe.\n\n“Not Holly responding as if she was this famous influencer attending a red carpet and giving credits to the designer of her clothing,” one viewer noted on X.\n\nInside the house, Holly regaled her fellow contestants with tales of her high-profile past as a model and, before that, as a soccer player for Australia’s under-18s team.\n\nAnd in one unintentionally humorous exchange after what appeared to be several drinks, Holly earnestly explained that she’d faced many challenges over the years because of her stunning beauty and her long, flowing locks. In fact, she had cut her hair into a bob purely in an attempt to make people take her more seriously. \n\nIf it worked for Posh Spice …\n\n“Holly talking about pretty privilege and being serious …” one viewer tweeted.\n\n“I was so low on Holly when she first came on. But by the end when she got drunk and talked about the importance of her Bob I’ve never been so high,” said another.\n\nSome of Holly’s housemates seem to have taken a shine to her – none more so than 21-year-old aspiring MMA fighter Colin, who appears absolutely smitten and even gave her the shirt off his back as the contestants awaited the delivery of their luggage (his pants went next, and he appears to have stayed in his undies for the remainder of his time so far in the Big Brother house). \n\nColin might feel a little more intimidated when he learns of Holly’s dating history. In August last year, she went Insta-official with high-end real estate agent and Luxe Listings Sydney reality star Gavin Rubinstein, before they split in April this year. \n\nLong before that, though, she reportedly dated Jamaican sprint champion Usain Bolt. The pair were first linked in 2017 after reportedly meeting at Crown Casino in Melbourne. They split a year later, and Holly’s next boyfriend was an English Premier League footballer whose identity she never revealed publicly.\n\n“He actually called the company I was working for at the time to ask for my details to invite me to Fashion Week,” she said of the mystery man at the time. \n\nHolly’s high-profile past soon caught the eye of Big Brother fans, with one viewer sharing a screenshot of her (private) 103,000-follower-strong Instagram account and expressing their disappointment over her selection: “It was going so well.. At least the rest seem relatively normal so far,” they wrote.\n\nBut Holly’s not actually the only housemate this year who already has a sizeable following: Vinnie Brigante, barber and aspiring singer-songwriter, has 155,000 followers on TikTok and has supported country superstar Zach Bryan in concert. \n\nMeanwhile, another Big Brother contestant is also causing controversy this week: The show’s oldest-ever participant, 67-year-old Jane, was voted in by the public during the season’s second episode after wowing viewers with her bubbly personality. \n\nBut it was only after she was confirmed as a contestant that those who voted learned another fact about her: She’s an “avid and passionate Donald Trump lover,” information some fans complained they would’ve liked while casting their votes.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/reality-tv/big-brother-stunner-hollys-highprofile-past-causes-controversy/news-story/1146807d3ba5166122d3af4dc6c36edc","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2a21b317685e64f496b16c44f0542372","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:16:00","author":"Nick Bond","authors":["Nick Bond"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":377672230,"title":"Uncertainty looms in Bay Area amid possible end to government shutdown","text":"Oliver Alcazar, an unemployed construction worker who’s training for a desk job after injuring his foot, was relieved to see his federal SNAP food benefit restored Sunday with $258 for his family of three for November.\n\nEven so, on Monday, he joined hundreds who lined up at the San Jose Flea Market — where the nonprofit Hunger at Home was providing families packages of apples, pears, zucchini, bread and chicken — fearing the federal aid program remains in jeopardy amid the ongoing congressional funding stalemate that has spawned the country’s longest government shutdown.\n\n“It’s a little bit scary to the family, because we don’t know whether everyone’s dietary needs are going to be met,” Alcazar said.\n\nDespite movement on a possible deal to break the congressional impasse, full restoration of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other federal operations affected by the funding lapse remained unclear — an unsettling situation for those who depend on them. SNAP funding restoration came on Friday amid a whirlwind of court rulings and federal and state actions.\n\n“We anticipated having less people due to the fact that the SNAP program was reloaded,” said Ewell Sterner, Hunger at Home’s CEO. “However, we’re seeing a larger line than we had last week. I think it’s the anxiety, the unknown, being weeks without the benefits, so getting caught up.”\n\nLast week saw a rapid-fire sequence of events over SNAP, called CalFresh in California and known informally as food stamps. After the shutdown began Oct. 1, the Republican administration of President Donald Trump warned SNAP benefits for November would not be paid unless Democrats agree to continue government funding and end the partial shutdown.\n\nOn Thursday, a district judge in Rhode Island ordered the administration to fully fund SNAP during the government shutdown. Shortly after, California officials released food assistance to the 5.5 million residents who rely upon it. Then federal officials ordered states to “undo” the welfare spending, saying it was “unauthorized” after yet another court decision.\n\nIt was hardly the only federal program affected by the funding lapse. Airports across the country including in the Bay Area were seeing increasing disruption of their flights as the Federal Aviation Administration grappled with more staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, who have been asked to work without pay.\n\nA potential end to the 40-day government shutdown was in sight. A small group of moderate Democrats moved last weekend to break from party leadership and support plans to fund the government that would not promise extended health care subsidies — the reason why Democrats said they’ve withheld their votes all along.\n\nIf and when the shutdown ends, CalFresh benefits would start reliably flowing again. That possibility was cold comfort in the Bay Area on Monday. Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration’s attempt to “claw back” the food assistance spending, in his words. Officials in Contra Costa County paused their plans to send out $21 million on debit cards to CalFresh recipients who’d been stiffed this month.\n\nContra Costa County Supervisor Candace Andersen told this news organization Monday that CalFresh recipients in the county had received their benefits for the month of November. The $21 million will remain slotted for food assistance should the need arise, Andersen said. She noted that the shutdown could drag into December, or the assistance could vanish from residents’ EBT cards as the Trump administration seeks to reclaim it.\n\n“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Andersen said. “There is a lot of unknown.”\n\nCalifornia’s Democratic members in Congress have slammed the Trump administration for refusing to fund SNAP during the government shutdown. But many were furious over the weekend with the news that the group of moderate Democrats in the Senate planned to buck the party with a funding plan that includes food assistance.\n\nThat’s because the nascent agreement between the Democratic senators and Republican leadership does not currently include any guarantee to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are at the heart of the shutdown.\n\nCalifornia senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla ripped into the government funding proposal on social media and said they’d be opposing it. So did Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nEven so, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of Silicon Valley called for Schumer’s ouster on X. Khanna is an ambitious lawmaker aligned with the progressive wing of the party who has called for a “new generation of leadership” within the political party.\n\n“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” he said on the social media site. “If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sam Liccardo, who represents Silicon Valley and the Peninsula, co-introduced a bill last week to extend the health subsidies in a pared back form. He’s teamed up with Rep. Kevin Kiley, an Eastern California Republican. It’s unclear if their plan would gain much traction in the House; on Monday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said he wouldn’t promise to hold a vote on the subsidies as part of a deal to reopen the government, ABC reported.\n\nAt the San Jose Flea Market, Hunger at Home served about 300 families by Monday morning, double the normal amount. By 10 a.m., when the line would normally end, 120 cars had yet to go through.\n\nIn the parking lot, Alexandrea Musquiz said she received her $87 CalFresh payment on Friday, an amount that doesn’t go far. As she, too, waited in line at the food bank, she also worried Congress might not fully restore benefits.\n\n“I’m hoping, I’m praying, that they do,” Musquiz, 37, said. “But, I mean, I don’t know. We don’t know anything that’s going to happen in the near future, so all we can do is just cross our fingers and just hope.”","summary":"Federal assistance arrived for Bay Area recipients last week, but the future is still up in the air.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/10/uncertainty-looms-in-bay-area-amid-possible-end-to-government-shutdown/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SJM-L-SNAPFOLO-3.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:14:01","author":"Grant Stringer,Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Grant Stringer","Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":377669752,"title":"Trump threatens air traffic controllers over shutdown absences","text":"NEW YORK - An additional 2,000 US flights were cancelled on Nov 10 as President Donald Trump threatened to dock pay for air traffic controllers who called in sick during the government shutdown.\n\nAfter Mr Trump ripped absent aviation workers as unpatriotic, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (Natca) labour union hailed members working without pay as “unsung heroes” in a statement that called for Congress to immediately end the shutdown.\n\n“Enough is enough,” the union said. \n\nThe back-and-forth highlights the mounting strain on the aviation industry as the record-breaking shutdown hit day 41, though a \n\nThe air traffic control system was already under strain prior to the shutdown due to understaffing, and is facing a surge in passengers with upcoming Thanksgiving holiday travel.\n\nBesides more than 2,000 cancellations, some 7,100 flights involving US airports were delayed on Nov 10, according to tracking website FlightAware.\n\nThe Trump administration last week ordered 10 per cent reductions in flights at dozens of airports, including some of the nation’s busiest, due to “staffing triggers.”\n\nMr Trump took to social media on Nov 10 to threaten that controllers who do not return to work “will be substantially ‘docked.’”\n\n“All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!” he demanded on his Truth Social platform.\n\nMr Trump said he was recommending a bonus of US$10,000 (S$13,025) to the “GREAT PATRIOTS” who did not take time off during the shutdown.\n\nHis statement was posted just as the air traffic controller union was concluding a press conference, timed to the second consecutive zero-dollar pay cheque for its members.\n\nUnion president Nick Daniels called an emerging deal in Congress a “right step in the right direction.”\n\n“Air traffic controllers should not be the political pawn during a government shutdown,” said Mr Daniels, who has spoken in increasingly dire terms since federal funding first lapsed on Oct 1.\n\nA Natca statement released later on Nov 10, following Mr Trump’s social media threat, said controllers “deserve our praise.”\n\n“This nation’s air traffic controllers have been working without pay for over 40 days,” the union said. \n\n“The vast majority of these highly trained and skilled professionals continue to perform one of the most stressful and demanding jobs in the world, despite not being compensated. Many are working six-day weeks and ten-hour days without any pay.” \n\nDemocratic congressman Rick Larsen called Mr Trump’s comments “nuts.”\n\n“The women and men working long hours in air traffic control towers to keep the aviation system running deserve our thanks and appreciation, not unhinged attacks on their patriotism,” said the Democrat from Washington state.\n\n Working two jobs\n\nProspects for a resolution to the longest shutdown in US history looked brighter on Nov 10, after enough Democrats in the US Senate joined Republicans to advance a Bill to fund the government through January.\n\nHowever, Mr Daniels noted that after a lengthy shutdown in 2019 it took two and a half months for all controllers to receive back pay.\n\nMeanwhile, “January 30 will loom around the corner,” he added, alluding to uncertainty about what will happen after the next spending bill expires.\n\nMr Daniels was joined at the event by Ms Amy Lark, who works at an air traffic facility in Virginia.\n\nHer family is having to make do without two pay cheques, because Ms Lark’s husband also works for the agency.\n\n“Yesterday, my kids asked me how long we could stay in our house. Having to answer that question was heartbreaking,” said Ms Lark.\n\nShe also described increased stress at work because of colleagues who have been up late working as an Uber driver or another job, while others face trouble paying for childcare.\n\nThe cutbacks are also forcing travellers to adapt.\n\n“It’s a little crazy this morning,” said Mr Jack Nicks at Miami International Airport, who said he double-checked to make sure his flight would be ready for takeoff.\n\n“I have other friends that are flying today.

It remains unclear how the probe is connected to Florida, drawing speculation that prosecutors are linking the case to the investigation into the president’s hoarding of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the Justice Department.\n\nThe officials allegedly under investigation and subject to the latest Justice Department subpoenas were already scrutinized under probes from former counsel John Durham and former Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose investigations found no evidence to support charges against them.\n\nLast month, former CIA director John Brennan — who led the nation’s intelligence agency during the investigation — was criminally accused of making false statements to Congress about his role in the probe.\n\nIn a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan claimed Brennan “knowingly made false statements” to the panel during an interview in May 2023.\n\nThe allegations stem from the so-called Steele dossier, a series of largely discredited documents compiled by a former British intelligence officer, which accused the president and his allies of conspiring with the Kremlin.\n\nThose documents’ sensational allegations were largely uncorroborated, while Republicans alleged that the memo was part of a Democratic-led conspiracy to undermine Trump’s campaign.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies ultimately determined that Russian-backed interference in 2016 sought to boost Trump through a coordinated disinformation campaign while damaging his then-opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe president and his allies continue to attack the findings in the so-called “Russiagate” investigation while vowing to seek revenge against those involved.\n\nThe Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into allegations that national security officials conspired to link Trump to Russia’s election interference campaign in an effort to delegitimize his campaign, following claims from Trump’s intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard that the Obama administration “manufactured and politicized intelligence to lay the groundwork for what was essentially a years-long coup” against Trump.\n\nTrump — after campaigning on a theme of “retribution” and pledging to be a “warrior” and “justice” to those who were “betrayed” by the government — has also publicly demanded his Justice Department prosecute his opponents.\n\nIn quick succession, grand juries indicted former FBI director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security director John Bolton. They have pleaded not guilty.","summary":"Trump’s allies seek ‘justice’ with sweeping federal probe targeting critics and political opponents","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-conspiracy-investigation-florida-subpoenas-b2862557.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/10/23/15/GettyImages-2232069335.jpg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/cfMwU7De-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:13:41","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":377673166,"title":"Ahmed al-Sharaa meets Trump as US extends Syria sanctions relief  - St. Lucia Chronicle – Daily St Lucia News","text":"The United States has issued a new waiver to lift the most serious sanctions against Syria, as interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa visits Washington.\n\nThe move on Monday coincided with al-Sharaa’s meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House, underscoring Damascus’s push to forge strong economic ties with the West after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nIt also highlighted al-Sharaa’s stunning transformation from an al-Qaeda leader to the president of Syria, who is cultivating friendly relations with the US.\n\nThe Syrian presidency said al-Sharaa and Trump held talks “focusing on bilateral relations between Syria and the United States, ways to strengthen and develop them, and a number of regional and international issues of common interest”.\n\nFor his part, Trump heaped praise on al-Sharaa after the meeting.\n\n“He comes from a very tough place, and he’s a tough guy.

We need solutions,” he said.\n\nHis comments came as a new UN analysis of countries’ climate plans found that the pledged reductions fall far short of the drop needed by 2035 to limit temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures.\n\nIf this threshold is breached, the world will experience far more severe impacts than it has so far, experts say.\n\n“Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva stressed at the start of COP30.\n\nBrazil’s leader condemned those seeking to undermine efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\n“They attack institutions, they attack science and universities,” he said. “It’s time to inflict a new defeat on the deniers.”\n\nThe United States is not sending any delegates to COP30 in keeping with President Donald Trump’s anti-climate change stance.\n\n“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” the US’s former special envoy for climate, Todd Stern, said of the Trump administration’s decision.\n\nCOP30 President Andre Correa do Lago said the US’s absence “has opened some space for the world to see what developing countries are doing”.\n\nPablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru, urged world leaders to do more than simply give pledges at this year’s conference.\n\n“We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” he said.\n\nIn a letter to COP30 that was published on Monday, dozens of scientists expressed their fears about the melting of glaciers, ice sheets and other frozen parts of the planet.\n\n“The cryosphere is destabilising at an alarming pace,” they wrote. “Geopolitical tensions or short-term national interests must not overshadow COP30.

So true.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan said, “We are forever indebted to those who have given their lives that we might be free.”\n\nThis Veterans’ Day, let’s thank and remember the men and women who wore our nation’s uniform. Let’s especially thank and remember those who gave their lives so that we, and future generations, might live in freedom.\n\nPete Campbell\n\nLaw meant to protect\nthreatens free speech\n\nRe: “California law to protect Jewish students faces challenge over free speech concerns” (Nov. 3).\n\nI thank the California teachers and parents who have sued to block a law passed in October establishing a new Office of Civil Rights to “protect Jewish students from antisemitism.” The new law doesn’t define antisemitism and leaves teachers in fear of punishment if they teach facts about Israel or Zionism that a state bureaucrat considers antisemitic.\n\nThis setup will suppress teachers’ freedom of speech and students’ right to learn. What if the new antisemitism coordinator is a fervent Israel supporter who condemns all those, like Human Rights Watch, who call Israel an apartheid state, or those, like Amnesty International, who call Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide? The law’s supporters, such as the Anti-Defamation League, are working hard to get someone like that hired.\n\nIn the interests of our students’ education and of freedom, this so-called antisemitism law should be invalidated. Let teachers teach.\n\nDavid Spero\nSan Francisco\n\nLet’s address vote\nmaps nationally\n\nNow that Proposition 50 has passed and we have balanced the scales somewhat, it is time for Gov. Newsom and all the people who care about our democracy to come out loudly for a constitutional amendment that addresses some of the issues around gerrymandering.\n\nThe amendment should forbid the use of information on voters, including gender, race, income, political affiliation, religion, etc., to create congressional districts. Unless it is critical to getting balanced counts, the district should keep natural boundaries like county, city and postal districts intact.\n\nCurrently, our country is on a race to the bottom, and this is a small but important way to bring some sanity to our politics.\n\nJohn Holton\n\nWhat’s missing defines\nTrump’s presidency\n\nDonald Trump’s presidency is marked not by what he does, but by what he fails to do.\n\nHe neglects core issues — affordable housing, health care, education and fair wages — while advancing policies favoring the wealthy. His leadership style lacks empathy, dignity and responsibility, modeling hostility and self-interest rather than civic virtue. Trump’s divisive rhetoric ridicules opponents and deepens national wounds instead of healing them. Internationally, he alienates allies and aligns with autocrats, weakening America’s global standing. Domestically, he undermines democratic institutions, dismisses electoral legitimacy and disregards constitutional principles. On climate change — the defining challenge of the era — he offers denial instead of action.\n\nThese absences aren’t mere oversights but moral and civic failures that cost lives, corrode trust and diminish the nation’s future. True leadership requires showing up for people and principles — something Trump repeatedly fails to do.\n\nPaul Osborn\nMorgan Hill\n\nWith tariffs, Americans\npay for Trump’s faults\n\nDonald Trump told the American people — with a straight face — that tariffs are not a tax but “income” for the Treasury, paid by foreign governments. Yet before the Supreme Court, his own lawyer said the quiet part aloud: It’s a tax. Chief Justice Roberts confirmed it — Americans pay it.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed, Trump replied, “I think, no, I don’t agree. I think they might be paying something.”\n\nThat “something” is nearly $200 billion already drained from American pockets — expected to reach $3.3 trillion within 10 years. A tax by any other name, imposed unilaterally and illegally, since presidents cannot levy taxes — only Congress can.\n\nAnd for what? No benefit. No progress. Just a costly illusion of strength sold as “economic patriotism.” The truth is simpler — and darker: Americans are paying for one man’s ignorance, deceit and lust of power.\n\nMorgan Hill\n\nWill Trump face justice\nfor maritime killings?\n\nRe: “Senate votes down legislation to limit Trump’s ability to attack Venezuela” (Page A3, Nov. 7).\n\nIt is horrifying that President Trump has already committed 66 cold-blooded murders by destroying 17 small Venezuelan boats 2,000 miles from the U.S. coastline — clearly in international waters.\n\nEven more horrifying is that 51 Republican senators are aiding and abetting Trump’s murderous rampage by voting against bipartisan legislation to require Trump to seek approval from Congress for his obviously illegal military actions — as clearly required by the U.S. Constitution (Article II, Section 2) and the War Powers Resolution of 1973.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, has said that Trump’s systematic attacks against Venezuelan civilians during peacetime should be treated under international law as crimes against humanity.\n\nWill there be a Nuremberg-like trial for Trump and his aides and abettors?\n\nDave Whitaker","summary":"Also: Free speech &#124; Voting maps &#124; What's missing &#124; Americans pay &#124; Maritime killings.

Those who didn't could be identified via \"medical record reviews\" and expelled.\n\nAir Force yanks transgender members' pensions\n\nAmid the purge, the Air Force told transgender troops in May that those being expelled after 15 to 18 years of service could apply for early retirement benefits. All the plaintiffs received their official retirement orders the following month.\n\nThen, on Aug. 4, the Air Force changed its mind.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I am disapproving\" of all of those airmen's applications for retirement benefits, Brian Scarlett, the acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo.\n\n'It feels like a betrayal': The Air Force promised retirement to trans members of 15 to 18 years. Then it reneged.\n\n\"The military, the Air Force, is seeing my service as meaningless,\" said Logan Ireland, 37, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\nIreland, who served for 15 years, told USA TODAY that he had lined up his finances and started applying to other jobs when his retirement was suddenly rescinded. While his command team has been supportive, officials have not responded to his requests to speak to higher-ups in the military, he said.\n\n\"I want to know why,\" he said. \"Why is my retirement being taken from me?\"\n\nThe Air Force has said the group of people who lost benefits had an opportunity to apply for voluntary separation pay. The Air Force said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nShannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights and an attorney representing the group, said some plaintiffs could stand to lose millions of dollars. They and their families will also lose military healthcare, Minter added.\n\nMinter said the military only rescinds retirement pay in extremely rare circumstances. He pointed to an Air Force policy that lists \"fraud, manifest error, mathematical error, mistake of law, or substantial new evidence\" as the only acceptable rationales for revoking pensions.\n\n\"Ordinarily, when the military, in this case the Air Force, issues retirement orders, those are sacrosanct,\" said Minter. \"It is unheard of for such an order to be rescinded, much less with no explanation and no justification.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in allowing the ban on transgender people serving in the military to take effect in May.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/10/trans-troops-air-force-lawsuit-retirement/87196393007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/10/USAT/87198717007-usatsi-25815122.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2906,1635,x0,y247&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-11 00:00:57","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":377669832,"title":"Will 'deluded and loathed' BBC deputy who is 'staunch defender of doctored Donald Trump footage' be next Beeb boss to be swept away?","text":"Pressure was mounting on the deputy director of the BBC News last night to follow his colleagues out of the door as part of a complete clear out.\n\nDespite the impartiality scandal which has rocked the corporation and led to the resignations of director-general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, her deputy Jonathan Munro remains in post.\n\nBut a BBC source had told the Daily Mail that Mr Munro was ‘among the most staunch defenders of the doctored Trump footage’ and defended Panorama at a meeting of the BBC’s editorial watchdog in May.\n\nHe told colleagues, including Michael Prescott, the author of the internal report on impartiality: ‘There was no attempt to mislead the audience about the content or nature of Mr Trump’s speech before the riot at the Capitol.

I look forward to doing a great job for you'. \n\nIn August, Trump nominated Sergio Gor as India's next ambassador and Special Envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September, Gor had emphasised that India is 'one of the most important relationships our nation (US) has in the world.' \n\nAhead of his swearing-in, he had visited India in October and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, EAM S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval.

Practicing against Smith-Njigba at Ohio State is different than guarding him in a Week 10 battle at Lumen Field.\n \"It's the league,\" Burke said. \"It's the best of the best week in and week out. It's a game of margins, game of inches. Everybody has got to do their job.\"\n The team's response, despite being down early in the game, was a testament to their brotherhood, Burke added. He also said that the team will need to have amnesia to overcome these losses.\n With eight games remaining, and three being within the NFC West, more tests are inbound for the Cardinals.\n \"They understand why that happened and what we need to do better moving forward,\" Gannon said. \"I did tell them that we got to learn from it and then we got to flush it, because just like any win or loss, it doesn't matter how you get there. The most important thing is the next week. That's where our focus will be going into San Francisco.\"\n\n Discover moreFinancial market data subscriptionPolitical news updatesGeopolitical analysis reportsEnergy sector analysisWorld news coverageBitcoin market trendsAPEC conference insightsRoyal family newsBreaking news alertUS refugee policy\n\n Discover moreInternational relations booksGlobal economic forecast reportsGeopolitical analysis reportsMedia analysis toolsPolitical news updatesAI legal brief writing softwareTravel booking servicesInternational trade reportsAI in lawNewspaper subscription\n\n Trump allies believe Zelensky should leave Ukraine 'immediately' - mediaDiscoverPutin's bodyguards carriedDiscoverBuzzFondEin 27-Jähriger lebt in diesem Schuppen - sieh dir das Innere an!Read MoreSkipZelensky warns Ukraine won't pay debt to USDiscoverTrump warns Musk ofDiscover\n\nTrump allies believe Zelensky should leave Ukraine 'immediately' - mediaVladimir Zelensky should departure for France as frustration is growing in Washington, according to a New York Post report Read Full Article at RT.comBig News NetworkPutin's bodyguards carriedBig News NetworkZelensky warns Ukraine won't pay debt to USBig News NetworkTrump warns Musk ofUS President Donald Trump has warned Tesla CEO Elon Musk of serious consequences if he gives funding to Democratic candidates to run against Republicans who vote in support of the GOP's...Big News NetworkTipperary records two fatal early Sunday morning collisionsBig News NetworkLiam Neeson says he always gets told the same thing when visiting the USBig News Network\n\n Read This Next\n\n Wall Street surges as Senate signals end to shutdown\n\n China presses Netherlands for action to resolve Nexperia dispute\n\n Pfizer bags $10 billion Metsera deal as Novo exits after FTC warning\n\n Lower prices widen access to weight-loss drugs, but limits remain\n\n Modern cars collect driver data, raising privacy concerns\n\nBig News Network\n\nBig News Network News Agency\nMidwest Radio Network\nMainstream Media\n\nBIG NEWS NETWORK.COM\n\nContact & Support\nTerms & Conditions\n\nPRODUCTS & SERVICES\n\nNews Releases\n\nCopyright © 1998-2025 Big News Network All rights reserved.

It's been reduced very substantially. Yeah, we're going to be bringing the tariffs down. At some point, we're going to be bringing them down.' \n\nEarlier on November 5, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal indicated that talks on the India-US Bilateral Trade Agreement are 'going on very well', but said that there are 'many sensitive and serious issues' and it would take time.\n\n'Talks are going on very well. There are many sensitive issues, many serious issues, so naturally, it takes some time,' Minister Goyal told ANI, when asked to provide an update on India-US trade talks.\n\nOn October 23, negotiators of both countries had a virtual discussion. So far, five rounds of talks have been completed since March for the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement, initially decided to be inked by the 'fall of 2025.'\n\nThe bilateral trade agreement, formally proposed in February following directives from leaders of both countries, aims to more than double trade volumes from the current USD 191 billion to USD 500 billion by 2030.\n\nCommerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal was in the United States in September, leading high-level trade negotiations as both nations work toward concluding a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement. Goyal was accompanied by a delegation of senior ministry officials, including Special Secretary and India's Chief Negotiator Rajesh Agrawal.\n\nIn mid-September, a team of United States officials led by Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, Brendan Lynch, had 'positive and forward-looking' discussions with the officials from India's Department of Commerce in New Delhi, and it was decided to intensify efforts to achieve early conclusion of a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

Jean Carroll at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s and later defamed her.\nTrump’s lawyers argued in a lengthy filing with the high court that allegations leading to the USD 5 million verdict were “propped up” by a “series of indefensible evidentiary rulings” that allowed Carroll’s lawyers to present “highly inflammatory propensity evidence” against him.\nCarroll, a longtime advice columnist and former TV talk show host, testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack in the dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury retailer across the street from Trump Tower.\nThe jury also found Trump liable for defaming Carroll when he made comments in October 2022 denying her allegation.\nTrump’s lawyers, led by St. Louis, Missouri-based attorney Justin D. Smith, called Carroll’s claims a “politically motivated hoax.” They accused the trial judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, of warping federal evidence rules to bolster Carroll’s “implausible, unsubstantiated assertions.” They said that by upholding the verdict, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was in conflict with other federal appeals courts on how such rules should be applied.\n“President Trump has clearly and consistently denied that this supposed incident ever occurred,” Smith and his co-counsel wrote. “No physical or DNA evidence corroborates Carroll’s story. There were no eyewitnesses, no video evidence, and no police report or investigation.” A message seeking comment was left with Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan.\nIn September, when Trump’s lawyers first indicated they would appeal to the Supreme Court, she said, “We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review by the United States Supreme Court.” A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the Supreme Court appeal was part of the president’s crusade against “Liberal Lawfare.” “The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes,” the statement said.\nA three-judge appellate panel upheld the verdict in December 2024, rejecting Trump’s claims that trial Judge Kaplan’s decisions spoiled the trial, including by allowing two other Trump sexual abuse accusers to testify. The women said Trump committed similar acts against them in the 1970s and in 2005. Trump denied all three women’s allegations.\nIn June, 2nd Circuit judges denied Trump’s petition for the full appellate court to take up the case. That left Trump with two options: accept the result and allow Carroll to collect the judgment, which he’d previously paid into escrow, or fight on in Supreme Court, whose conservative majority — including three of his own appointees — could be more open to considering his challenge.\nTrump skipped the 2023 trial but testified briefly at a follow-up defamation trial last year that ended with a jury ordering him to pay Carroll an additional USD 83.3 million. The second trial resulted from comments then-President Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir.\nJudge Kaplan presided over both trials and instructed the second jury to accept the first jury’s finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Judge Kaplan and Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, are not related.\nIn their Supreme Court filing, Trump’s lawyers said Kaplan compounded his “significant evidentiary errors” at first trial by “improperly preventing” Trump from contesting the first jury’s finding that he had sexually abused Carroll, leading to an “unjust judgment of USD 83.3 million.” (AP) MNK MNK","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-throw-out-e-jean-carrolls-usd-5-million-verdict-9697686.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/07/News18_World_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-07-4401653589b9d10b46b8abb07f758342.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 23:57:34","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.025},{"id":377674654,"title":"Canada Loses Measles Elimination Status, Putting U.S. On Notice","text":"Canadian health officials announced Monday that the country has lost its measles elimination status due to an outbreak of the infectious disease persisting in the country for more than a year, and the United States may not be far behind.\n\nOfficials said they received notice about the designation from the Pan American Health Organization, or PAHO, a branch of the World Health Organization, after it confirmed that Canada had seen sustained transmission of the same measles strain for more than 12 months ― one of the main metrics used to determine a country’s elimination status.\n\nThe change brings a nearly 30-year public health victory to a screeching halt. Canada first achieved elimination status in 1998, meaning the country had gone a year or more without continuous domestic transmission of a measles strain. The U.S. followed in 2000. \n\nIn just the first 10 months of the year, Canada has seen around 5,000 cases of measles across 10 jurisdictions. That’s compared to around 1,700 cases from an outbreak across the U.S., which has around eight times Canada’s population.\n\nThere were 23 new cases in the last week of October alone, Canadian officials noted. \n\nThe outbreak has resulted in two deaths, both of premature newborns infected while in utero. \n\n“While transmission has slowed recently, the outbreak has persisted for over 12 months, primarily within under-vaccinated communities,” the Public Health Agency of Canada announced.\n\nIn both Canada and the U.S., the current outbreaks started in Mennonite communities, which were both severely undervaccinated.\n\nCanadian officials urged uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine in their announcement Monday.\n\n“The measles vaccine is the best way to protect you and your family,” the agency stated. “By staying vigilant and working together to increase measles vaccine coverage, we can prevent outbreaks and keep our communities safe against this preventable disease.”\n\nCanada will not be able to claim elimination status again until the country has gone a full year without the strain from the current outbreak spreading.\n\nExperts have warned for months that the U.S. may be on track to lose its measles elimination status, too. PAHO is expected to make that decision if cases linked to a Texas outbreak in January persist through the end of 2025. \n\nSuch a status change, which reflects the spread of a deadly disease that carries several long-term side effects, including permanent brain damage and hearing and vision loss, could make it more difficult for Americans to travel.\n\n“It could affect U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to specific countries if they don’t want the risk of measles getting introduced to their country,” Brittany Kmush, associate professor and graduate director of Syracuse University’s Public Health Department, told HuffPost in July. “It could affect other people’s ability to come visit the U.S. Other countries might require proof of measles vaccination before they can reenter their home country.”\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist chosen for the role by President Donald Trump, has repeatedly spread misinformation about MMR vaccines, claiming earlier this year that people sickened by the measles virus may just lack “good nutrition” and a “good exercise regimen.” He’s also repeatedly pushed unverified treatments for measles and claimed people who derive natural immunity from the virus may gain protection from cancer and cardiac disease.\n\nIn June, researchers found that the MMR vaccination rate among American children had fallen around 3% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, lining up with the rise of anti-vaccine misinformation. That shift followed over a decade of more stable MMR vaccination rates, the study’s authors told HuffPost.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/canada-measles-elimination-status_n_69123d59e4b03f26059cf543?origin=home-zone-b-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69127344170000604d9c5250.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-10 23:57:16","author":"Lydia O'connor","authors":["Lydia O'connor"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.077}]}
