This is a 90% decrease from January when OFO encountered 32,346 inadmissible ones, and a 93% decrease from February 2024 when OFO encountered 49,272 inadmissible migrants.\n\nCPB monitors 300 ports of entry secured by U.S. Border Patrol and Air and Marine Operations.\n\nWorking with the Department of Defense, CPB has dramatically increased active patrols of the international borders.\n\n\"President Trump and Secretary Noem have sent a clear message: if you cross the border illegally, you will be deported without an opportunity to try another day, or in a few hours,\" the agency said.\n\nSo far this year the total number of U.S. Border Patrol and field operations encounters are 502,547.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024 there were 2,901,142 enforcement actions with 3,201,144 in 2023, 2,766,582 in 2022 and 1,956,519 in 2021.\n\nThe most during Trump's presidency was 1,148,024 in 2019.\n\nIn June 2024, the Biden administration announced a new executive action on immigration that bars asylum to migrants who cross the southern border unlawfully. An average of no more than 2,500 migrants who unlawfully cross the U.S. southern border per day potentially will be eligible for asylum, Biden said.\n\nThis year there have been 4,323 criminal noncitizens encountered and 289 criminal noncitizens with outstanding wants or warrants by Border Patrol.\n\nIn 2024, there were 17,048 criminal noncitizens encountered and 954 criminal noncitizens with outstanding wants or warrants by Border Patrol\n\nDeportations\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported around 11,000 migrants last month compared with just over 12,000 in February 2024, NBC reported. Of the people deported last month, roughly half did not have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, the data showed.\n\nWhen removing recent border crossers and counting only immigrants deported after first being arrested by ICE, nearly 4,300 immigrants were deported this February compared with about 2,100 in February 2024.\n\nCBP has launched the CBP Home mobile app for those undocumented migrants or those with revoked parole to voluntarily notify the U.S. government of their intent to depart. This was as a result of an executive order by Trump.\n\n\"President Trump and Secretary Noem have made it clear: leave voluntarily now for a chance to return and live the American dream. If not, individuals will be found, deported, and permanently barred from reentry,\" the release said. \"The choice is clear.\"\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan has said the administration's deportation policy is \"worst first,\" meaning it will prioritize removing people with criminal records or suspected national security threats.\n\nLast year, ICE told Congress it had identified 435,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions in the country who were not in custody.\n\nICE was holding almost 44,000 migrants in detention through the end of February, which is 10% more detainees than at the end of the Biden administration, according to the agency's public data.\n\nDrug seizures\n\nThrough February, CBP seized more than 10,900 pounds of drugs, consisting of 2,584 pounds of cocaine, 1,266 pounds of fentanyl, 5,683 pounds of methamphetamine, 135 pounds of heroin, 664 pounds of marijuana and 640 pounds of other illicit substances such as amphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, hashish, steroids, and xylazine.\n\nAlso, CBP intercepted 140 weapons and seized over $1.3 million in illicit U.S. currency.\n\nWorking with federal, state, local, tribal, territorial partners, there was a cumulative seizure of more 13,348 pounds of illegal drugs, more than $1.97 million in illicit U.S. currency, more than 180 weapons, and CBP arrests of 317 individuals affiliated with and/or connected to those with direct ties to transnational criminal organizations","summary":"U.S. Customs and Border Protection in February apprehended 8,347 migrants attempting to cross the southern border, the lowest in history, as arrests of undocumented people in the nation are rising.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/03/12/Border-patrol-apprehensions-down/4171741823050/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4171741823050/2025/upi_com/84f45ec003146e7e5184f5aa2b49e98d/v1.2/Apprehension-of-migrants-at-border-reach-all-time-low-of-330-per-day-in-February.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:59:08","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.036},{"id":299592002,"title":"NASA astronauts face more difficulties as Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket launch is postponed","text":"The mission to rescue NASA’s stranded astronauts has been delayed yet again, marking another setback in the nine-month-long saga. \n\nSpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket was supposed to launch from Kennedy Space Center at 7:48pm ET Wednesday, but the mission was scrubbed at the 11th hour.\n\nThe mission was taking four astronauts to replace Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore who have been stuck on the International Space Station (ISS) since June.\n\nThe quad of astronauts were all ready to go and strapped into their seats when the mission was aborted less than 30 minutes before they were due to launch.\n\nIt’s a disappointing outcome for NASA and SpaceX, and undoubtedly the two astronauts stranded in space. \n\nBoth NASA and SpaceX will now reconvene on Thursday evening to have a second attempt at launching. Commentators from SpaceX said there would also be an opportunity on Friday if the original backup launch also fails.\n\nThis would have let Williams and Wilmore flee the ISS two days later and be back on Earth with the families by Sunday. \n\nThe delay comes as Elon Musk said he offered to bring the pair home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would’ve made Donald Trump ‘look good’ in the presidential race against Kamala.\n\nThe next rescue mission has been rescheduled for March 13 at the earliest, which means Williams and Wilmore will not return to Earth until at least Monday. \n\nAt 6.55pm, just 50 minutes before takeoff and moments before the launch was scrubbed, SpaceX shared behind the scenes photos of the astronauts on X, captioned: ‘Crew-10 is go for launch!’\n\nBut something went wrong with the clamp arm in an incident commentators described as a ‘hydraulic ground issue’ moments later, sparking an immediate halt on the mission.\n\nThe crew were taken from the rocket one at a time and led to several waiting Teslas, which are specially designed for the astronauts. They were driven to a quarantine location in Florida, where they must remain until the next launch attempt. \n\n‘We will not launch unless we know we can do so safely and reliably,’ a SpaceX commentator said in the livestream of the event. \n\nThe four-person crew included Japan’s Takuya Onishi, Russia’s Kirill Peskov, and NASA’s Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers.\n\n‘We are going to take a little bit of an adventure,’ McClain, who is a US Army colonel and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter pilot, told Florida Today\n\n‘We’re ready to high-five them, bring them home.’\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were originally scheduled for an eight-day mission, but were forced to stay after technical issues plagued the Boeing’s Starliner that brought them to the ISS.\n\nThe plan is for them to return inside SpaceX’s Crew-9 Dragon capsule that is already docked to the ISS. Williams and Wilmore will be accompanied by NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Aleksandr Gorbunov when they undock.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk explained that the Biden administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and intentionally ‘pushed the return date past the inauguration date.’\n\nMusk donated $288 million to Trump’s campaign and appeared at several MAGA rallies. \n\nThe SpaceX CEO also noted that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\nNASA officials have not directly addressed these claims. \n\nBut during a Friday press briefing, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of the agency’s Space Operation Mission Directorate, said SpaceX has been working with NASA to develop a backup return plan for the Starliner mission since last July.\n\n‘The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,’ Bowersox said.\n\nHe also admitted that there ‘may have been conversations’ in the White House about delaying the return for political reasons, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to depart about two days after the Crew-10 mission arrives. \n\nTypically, a departing ISS crew shares the space station with the incoming crew for about five days in what’s known as a ‘handover period.’ \n\nThis allows them to get the new crew up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between teams.\n\nBut this time, NASA decided to shorten the handover period to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Starliner crew in case the weather interferes with their targeted return date.\n\nWhen Williams and Wilmore launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5, they were only supposed to spend eight days on the ISS. \n\nBut a series of technical issues with their ship, including thruster failures and helium leaks, ultimately drove NASA to send the faulty spacecraft home without its crew in September. \n\nBowersox said that NASA and SpaceX discussed adding a mission or bringing the currently docked capsule home early, ‘but we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we’ve got in our budget.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe mission to rescue NASA&#8217;s stranded astronauts has been delayed yet again,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: NASA astronauts face more difficulties as Elon Musk&#8217;s SpaceX rocket launch is postponed first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nasa-astronauts-face-more-difficulties-as-elon-musks-spacex-rocket-launch-is-postponed/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Stranded-NASA-astronauts-suffer-another-setback-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:53:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.759},{"id":299591992,"title":"Federal student loan website crashes on Wednesday following significant Education Department layoffs","text":"WASHINGTON – An hours-long outage Wednesday on StudentAid.gov, the federal website for student loans and financial aid, underscored the risks in rapidly gutting the Department of Education, as President Donald Trump aims to dismantle the agency.\n\nHundreds of users reported FAFSA outages to Downdetector starting midday Wednesday, saying they were having trouble completing the form, which is required for financial aid at colleges nationwide.

Seven of the civil rights agency’s 12 regional offices were entirely laid off, including busy hubs in New York, Chicago and Dallas. Despite assurances that the department’s work will continue unaffected, huge numbers of cases appear to be in limbo.\n\nThe Trump administration has not said how it will proceed with thousands of cases being handled by staff it’s eliminating. The cases involve families trying to get school services for students with disabilities, allegations of bias related to race and religion, and complaints over sexual violence at schools and college campuses.\n\nSome staffers who remain said there’s no way to pick up all of their fired colleagues’ cases. Many were already struggling to keep pace with their own caseloads. With fewer than 300 workers, families likely will be waiting on resolution for years, they said.\n\n“I fear they won’t get their calls answered, their complaints won’t move,” said Michael Pillera, a senior civil rights attorney for the Office for Civil Rights. “I truly don’t understand how a handful of offices could handle the entire country.”\n\nDepartment officials insisted the cuts will not affect civil rights investigations. The reductions were “strategic decisions,” spokesperson Madison Biedermann.\n\n“OCR will be able to deliver the work,” Biedermann said. “It will have to look different, and we know that.”\n\nThe layoffs are part of a dramatic downsizing directed by President Donald Trump as he moves to reduce the footprint of the federal government. Along with the Office of Civil Rights, the top divisions to lose hundreds of staffers in the layoffs included Federal Student Aid, which manages the federal student loan portfolio, and the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees assessments of whether the education system is working and research into best teaching practices.\n\nTrump has pushed for a full shutdown of the Education Department, calling it a “con job” and saying its power should be turned over to states. On Wednesday he told reporters many agency employees “don’t work at all.” Responding to the layoffs, he said his administration is “keeping the best ones.”\n\nAfter the cuts, the Office for Civil Rights will only have workers in Washington and five regional offices, which traditionally take the lead on investigating complaints and mediating resolutions with schools and colleges. Buildings are being closed and staff laid off in Dallas, Chicago, New York, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n\nMany lawyers at the New York City office were juggling 80 or more cases, said one staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear for reprisals. The branch often mediated cases with New York City schools, the nation’s largest district, and its lawyers were handling a high-profile antisemitism investigation at Columbia University — a priority for Trump.\n\nThe staffer described several pending cases involving students with disabilities who are wrongly being kept out of school because of behavioral issues. With limited oversight from the office, they said, school districts will be less likely to comply with legal requirements.\n\nPillera, who had said before the cuts that he was leaving the department, said it’s unclear how complaints will be investigated in areas that no longer have offices.\n\n“We have to physically go to schools,” Pillera said. “We have to look at the playground to see if it’s accessible for kids with disabilities. We have to measure doorways and bathrooms to see if everything is accessible for kids with disabilities.”\n\nEven before the layoffs, the civil rights office had been losing staff even as complaints rose to record levels. The workforce had fallen below 600 staffers before Trump took office, and they faced nearly 23,000 complaints filed last year, more than ever.\n\nTrump officials ordered a freeze on most cases when they arrived at the department, adding to the backlog. When Education Secretary Linda McMahon lifted the freeze last week, there were more than 20,000 pending cases.\n\nHistorically, most of the office’s work deals with disability rights cases, but it has fielded growing numbers of complaints alleging discrimination based on sex or race. It has also played a prominent role in investigating complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia amid the Israel-Hamas war and a wave of campus demonstrations that spread across the country last year.\n\nCraig Trainor, Trump’s appointee over the office, directed staff to focus on antisemitism cases as a top priority last week. In a memo, he accused former President Joe Biden of failing to hold colleges accountable and promised tougher action against violators.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing, McMahon said the goal is not to defund key programs but to make them operate more efficiently. She vowed to uphold the agency’s civil rights work but said it might fit better being moved to the Justice Department.\n\nThe civil rights office was not the only division to lose attorneys key to the Education Department’s portfolio. Tuesday’s layoffs have nearly eliminated all staff working in the department’s Office of the General Counsel, say two people familiar with the situation, who didn’t want to speak publicly for fear of reprisals.\n\nAttorneys in the division advised the department on the legality of its actions, helped enforce how states and schools spent federal money meant for disadvantaged K-12 students, and watched for conflicts of interest among internal staff and appointees, among other things.\n\nOf the approximately 100 staff members working before Trump took office, only around two dozen remain. The majority of those still employed advise the department on higher education, including financial aid programs.\n\nAn email the Education Department sent to all staff after the layoffs said there will need to be significant changes to how they work.\n\n“What we choose to prioritize, and in turn, not prioritize, will be critical in this transition,” the message said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAmong more than 1,300 layoffs announced Tuesday were roughly 240 in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Massive layoffs in Education Department&#8217;s civil rights office leave discrimination cases unresolved first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/massive-layoffs-in-education-departments-civil-rights-office-leave-discrimination-cases-unresolved/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Education-Department-layoffs-gut-its-civil-rights.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:43:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.029},{"id":299590366,"title":"Trump’s ‘border czar’: I’ll double ICE agents in NY state if Hochul doesn’t cooperate on immigration","text":"At a stop in Albany on Wednesday, Donald Trump’s “border czar,” Tom Homan, threatened to double the number of immigration agents in New York state if Gov.

According to NASA, the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft was scheduled for around 7:48 p.m. local time from Kennedy Space Center but an issue with an arm on the ground launch system prevented the launch, leading to a scrub of the attempt. The postponement was announced with more than 40 minutes left on the countdown clock, with officials providing no indication of when the launch system would be ready for a retry. There are two remaining launch windows during the workweek, each about 20 minutes earlier than the previous day, but engineers have not indicated whether the necessary hydraulic repairs will take hours or days to complete. Members of the SpaceX Crew-10 mission, made up of NASA astronauts Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, are expected to remain on Florida’s Space Coast until an official launch date is set. FUTURE OF NASA’S MEGA MOON ROCKET IN QUESTION AFTER MAJOR BOEING ANNOUNCEMENT Astronauts Williams and Wilmore, who are aboard the International Space Station, have garnered headlines over how long their mission has been extended, even though their ride back to Earth has been at the space station since Sept. 29.Since 2000, NASA has operated under the principle that it tries not to leave the space station without a significant contingent of American astronauts on board the flying observatory, and an early departure of Crew-9 would only leave one American and two Russians aboard. The space agency states that once Crew-10 arrives at the space station, a short handover period will occur before Crew-9 prepares for departure. The return of Williams, Wilmore, and NASA astronaut Nick Hague, along with Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, will depend on weather conditions off the Florida coast, with a splashdown not expected before March 17. BOEING STARLINER RETURNS HOME WITHOUT ASTRONAUTS, MARKING THE END OF A TUMULTUOUS MISSION Boeing's Starliner, the spacecraft previously designated to bring Williams and Wilmore home, safely landed in the New Mexican desert in September, despite concerns over its operations. The Starliner program now faces an uncertain future, with only one approved method currently available for astronauts to return to U.S. soil. The space agency’s goals are likely to remain in flux until Jared Isaacman, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead NASA, is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut with close ties to Elon Musk, has previously flown on two SpaceX missions.","summary":"The crew of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission was expected to launch from the Kennedy Space Center around 7:48 p.m. local time on Wednesday.

They hailed from institutions such as Tsinghua University, the University of Tokyo, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.\n“The event allowed foreign university leaders to get a better understanding of Hong Kong … It’s about seeing, learning and experiencing the city first-hand, and [let them know] we have five universities among the world’s top 100,” she said.\nThe summit was hosted by the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship, a group she founded last year, inspired by the growing importance of “people-to-people” diplomacy, a strategy Beijing has often emphasised amid rising geopolitical tensions.\nShe is convinced that such civilian-led initiatives can, at critical times, achieve more than governments.\n\nHer savvy move may well be one answer to the call made to Hong Kong at China’s recently concluded key political meetings, the “two sessions”.\nPremier Li Qiang, in his government work report, underscored the city’s mission to “deepen international collaboration and exchanges”, among other priorities.\nThe clarion call may seem familiar as Hong Kong considers itself a place where the world’s denizens congregate to work, live and play.\nBut it gained special significance given that the last time the city’s international role was highlighted in the central government’s annual work plan was more than a decade ago.\nBeijing last formally pledged support to Hong Kong’s participation in international and regional economic cooperation in 2012.\nAfter Li underscored China’s need to work with the international community in light of the “increasingly complex and severe external environment” facing the country, two other senior mainland Chinese officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang and Beijing’s liaison chief Zheng Yanxiong, echoed in a similar vein and pledged support for the financial hub’s international role.\nThe renewed emphasis has much to do with timing. China and the United States are caught in a geopolitical rivalry set to be exacerbated with Donald Trump’s return to the White House, starting with his decision to impose more tariffs on China.\nAt a press conference last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called Beijing an “anchor” in an uncertain world, saying it was unacceptable for a major power to “pursue self-interest at the expense of others”.\nAnalysts said that Hong Kong could have a key part to play as Beijing calibrated its role on the world stage while friends and foes alike reel from the impact of Trump’s “America first” policy.\n\nBut the city also had its own battles that it must win to be relevant to China, they cautioned.\nFor the past few years, it has had to fight negative perceptions following the enactment of two security laws after the 2019 social unrest and also find its own footing without being overreliant on capital and talent from the mainland.\nInternational relations expert Wilson Chan Wai-shun said Hong Kong must reassess its resources and roles amid evolving global geopolitics.\n“We first need to know the cards we have,” said Chan, also co-founder of Pagoda Institute think tank. “It will be ideal if Hong Kong can support China’s foreign policies in its own way while safeguarding the city’s societal interests.”\nGeopolitics at play: go south?\nCK Hutchison Holdings’ recent decision to sell its Panama Canal port operations to a US-led investor group backed by BlackRock brought into sharp relief how unexpectedly the financial hub could be caught in the crosshairs of the current geopolitical tensions.\nThe conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family sold its port operations there and elsewhere outside China after Trump repeatedly described the canal as being under Chinese control.\nThe growth in Li’s port empire since the 1990s has often been studied as a textbook example of Hong Kong’s internationalism. CK Hutchison expanded its port operations across continents, showing how Hong Kong, for decades, could leverage its strengths to foster international investments and collaborations.\nBut the current geopolitical situation presents challenges and requires a new adroitness on the part of private companies and the government as they engage with overseas counterparts.\n\nCity authorities have been relying on their 14 Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) to “tell good stories” about Hong Kong and “rebut inaccurate or misleading reports”. But the ones on American soil have been in the global spotlight as US politicians lobby for them to be closed and a spy scandal has rocked the UK office.\nBut Hong Kong has set its sights elsewhere. Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu, who is sanctioned by the US over the national security law, has directed the city to look for new markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia, plugging its calling card as a “superconnector” and “super value-adder” between the mainland and the world.\nLee has been on two official visits to six Asean countries, including Singapore and Malaysia, and the Middle East since taking office. Key officials, such as Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, have also been on many such trips in pursuit of new connections for the city.\nStarry Lee Wai-king, Hong Kong’s sole representative on the NPC Standing Committee, the nation’s top legislative body, said it was more critical than ever for Hong Kong to foster more ties with the global south.\n“And it is not to say that Hong Kong gives up connections with the West. We still should maintain the ties with them despite challenges,” she said.\nMeanwhile, former city leader Leung Chun-ying, now a vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country’s top political advisory body, argued that international exchanges were not just limited to finance and trade, but also education, culture, arts, sports and charity.\nCraft a new narrative\nWhile embarking on such outreach plans, Hong Kong must find ways to change the conversation, brand experts said.\nOtherwise, it will not be able to shake off the reputational damage it suffered after the imposition of the security laws and the electoral overhaul following the 2019 protests.\nCritics tend to harp on how Hong Kong appears to be little different from mainland cities with what they call a backsliding of freedoms.\nJonathan Cummings, former APAC president of Landor, the global branding firm behind the “Asia’s World City” label, said that when he used existing tools to evaluate Hong Kong as a brand, the city scored high in “awareness” and “differentiation” but lacked “relevance”.\n“People know Hong Kong is different. They understand it’s old and new, East meets West, all of these lovely contrasts that really make Hong Kong,” he said.\n“What they do not understand is Hong Kong’s role in the world today. And this is where you get those comments like ‘it’s just another Chinese city’, or ‘it’s purely a financial hub’, and all of these slightly limiting comments.”\nHong Kong adopted a branding campaign in 2001 to tell the international community its drive to become Asia’s World City. The key visual – a yellow and red dragon that incorporates the Chinese and English names of Hong Kong – is still widely used in official promotional materials.\nCummings said how the Hong Kong brand that was communicated internationally needed a “refresh”.\nRecent campaigns to present the city internationally had been “superficial” or “too specific” around particular sectors rather than conveying the importance of Hong Kong to the global economy, he said.\nHe added that, for example, Hong Kong played a critical role in areas such as finance and aviation, and few people internationally knew of the developments in innovation and technology like academic research and the start-up scene.\nThe Hong Kong government, meanwhile, has adopted a combative style and even formed a rebuttal team to respond to allegations.\nIn 2024, it issued 58 statements focused on “condemning” someone or some outfit while it sent 15 letters to foreign media to “respond and clarify” their “false and misleading” claims.\nInternational relations expert Wilson Chan Wai-shun also noted that the administration’s propaganda-style narrative in convincing foreign audiences, for example, solely praising the positive sides of the city, could be “counterproductive”.\n“Repeatedly using the propaganda narratives will only exacerbate the misunderstandings. How could it be effective? … It is important to breach cultural differences so they understand what you are saying,” he said.\n\nStaying diverse\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, expats left the city in droves in the face of strict restrictions, and while some have returned, the “international” profile of Hong Kong has changed.\nIn 2022 when Hong Kong marked the 25th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, President Xi Jinping asked the city to “expand convenient and smooth international connections”.\nHe reiterated the call during Macau’s 25th anniversary ceremony in December, telling both cities to “broadly expand international connections, and enhance global influence and attractiveness with a more open and inclusive attitude”.\nHowever, much of the growth in capital and talent the government sought to draw in recent years has been driven by the mainland, which has, in turn, fuelled more concerns over whether the city can remain diverse.\nMainlanders took up to 95 per cent of the 92,000 approved cases of the government’s Top Talent Pass Scheme. Their influx reversed the trend of a declining population in 2021 and 2022.\n\nA Post report showed the proportion of first-year, non-local undergraduates at the city’s public universities who come from the mainland increased to 75 per cent, with 5,582 students in the 2024-25 academic year, after the government doubled the cap on such intakes.\nMeanwhile, the proportion of non-local students enrolled in the city’s 54 international schools dropped from 75.5 per cent in the 2018-19 academic year to 65.1 per cent in 2023-24.\nGovernment data shows that the number of foreign companies with regional headquarters in Hong Kong declined by 13 per cent from 1,541 in 2019 to 1,336 in 2023 amid the onset of the Covid-10 pandemic and social unrest. The number in 2024 ticked up to 1,410.\nReinvent financial hub to seek global funds\nHong Kong’s positioning as “three centres” – for international finance, trade and shipping – has been emphasised by the government, alongside its status as a hub to gather talent from across the world.\nIn his budget speech recently, Paul Chan said the key to enhancing the strengths of Hong Kong’s international financial centre lay in institutional and product innovation, as well as financial connectivity.\nRock Chen Chung-nin, a local NPC deputy, said that bringing more foreign capital should be a major step in strengthening Hong Kong’s internationalisation.\n“The city should first aim at promoting the strong stock market to foreign investors who have low or even zero asset allocation in the city, suggesting to them that continuing with their current allocation might mean losing money,” he said.\nHong Kong’s stock exchange came in fourth in the global IPO rankings last year, with nearly 90 per cent of the offerings hailing from the mainland. The city could afford to ride on this standing by being more aggressive with other foreign companies, analysts said, to further broaden its base.\nChen said the city should also tell foreign investors, especially those interested in blockchain businesses, that Hong Kong’s proposed Stablecoins Bill was edging closer to becoming law, paving the way for the coins to be a bridge between Web 3.0 and traditional finance.\nChen suggested the government could team up with foreign nationals who had long lived in Hong Kong to promote the city overseas.\n“It will be more convincing for such a group of people telling their friends, relatives and former colleagues what Hong Kong is really like, ” Chen said.\nAI, fintech and biotech to drive growth\nTechnology has been a major battleground in the US-China rivalry. The tech race is not just about innovation, but also about shaping the global supply chain and application.\nIn this year’s two sessions, tech and artificial intelligence (AI) dominated dialogues, with the country riding high on the spectacular arrival of start-up DeepSeek on the global scene, rivalling other players.\nIn Hong Kong, Chan announced in his budget a HK$1 billion (US$128.6 million) fund to establish an AI research and development institute.\nJohnny Ng Kit-chong, an NPC deputy and tech entrepreneur from Hong Kong, suggested that the effort on mega-events should focus on financial technology and play to the city’s strengths rather than being a hodgepodge of agendas.\n“It will save us time and trouble to identify specific targets we want to engage with to develop AI,” he said, noting more than 20,000 had registered for the Bitcoin Asia 2025 conference in Hong Kong in August.\n\nJonathan Choi Koon-shum, chairman of Hong Kong-based conglomerate Sunwah Group, said technology achievements Hong Kong already enjoyed could be a selling point.\nChoi, a member of the CPPCC, pointed to the city’s many biotech successes, such as the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s new modular robotic surgery system.\n“We’ve promoted that during our trip to Dubai and people there were surprised to know Hong Kong could produce such hi-tech but cost-effective products,” he said.\nMeanwhile, more business groups are preparing for trips to forge ties with other countries in response to Beijing’s call.\nThe Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce will lead a delegation to the US next month in which it plans to meet local business groups and companies, and fight for meeting trade officials in a bid to clear their misunderstanding of the city.\nThe Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, which Choi chairs, has set its sights on strengthening connections with Central Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, as part of its 2025 agenda.\nAs Choi noted, part of the task of changing the narrative was to change the conversation and focus on the city’s achievements and ambitions, not get steered onto other people’s agendas.\n“What is done by people may be more easily accepted and more persuasive.

Commentators from SpaceX said there would also be an opportunity on Friday if the original backup launch also fails.\n\nThis would have let Williams and Wilmore flee the ISS two days later and be back on Earth with the families by Sunday. \n\nThe delay comes as Elon Musk said he offered to bring the pair home eight months ago, but the Biden Administration shot it down because it would've made Donald Trump 'look good' in the presidential race against Kamala.\n\nThe next rescue mission has been rescheduled for March 13 at the earliest, which means Williams and Wilmore will not return to Earth until at least Monday. \n\nAt 6.55pm, just 50 minutes before takeoff and moments before the launch was scrubbed, SpaceX shared behind the scenes photos of the astronauts on X, captioned: 'Crew-10 is go for launch!'\n\nBut something went wrong with the clamp arm in an incident commentators described as a 'hydraulic ground issue' moments later, sparking an immediate halt on the mission.\n\nThe crew were taken from the rocket one at a time and led to several waiting Teslas, which are specially designed for the astronauts. They were driven to a quarantine location in Florida, where they must remain until the next launch attempt. \n\n'We will not launch unless we know we can do so safely and reliably,' a SpaceX commentator said in the livestream of the event. \n\nThe four-person crew included Japan's Takuya Onishi, Russia's Kirill Peskov, and NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers.\n\n'We are going to take a little bit of an adventure,' McClain, who is a US Army colonel and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter pilot, told Florida Today\n\n'We're ready to high-five them, bring them home.'\n\nWilliams and Wilmore were originally scheduled for an eight-day mission, but were forced to stay after technical issues plagued the Boeing's Starliner that brought them to the ISS.\n\nThe plan is for them to return inside SpaceX's Crew-9 Dragon capsule that is already docked to the ISS. Williams and Wilmore will be accompanied by NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov when they undock.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk explained that the Biden administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and intentionally 'pushed the return date past the inauguration date.'\n\nMusk donated $288 million to Trump's campaign and appeared at several MAGA rallies. \n\nThe SpaceX CEO also noted that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\nNASA officials have not directly addressed these claims. \n\nBut during a Friday press briefing, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of the agency's Space Operation Mission Directorate, said SpaceX has been working with NASA to develop a backup return plan for the Starliner mission since last July.\n\n'The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,' Bowersox said.\n\nHe also admitted that there 'may have been conversations' in the White House about delaying the return for political reasons, but he was not part of the discussions.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore are expected to depart about two days after the Crew-10 mission arrives. \n\nTypically, a departing ISS crew shares the space station with the incoming crew for about five days in what's known as a 'handover period.' \n\nThis allows them to get the new crew up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between teams.\n\nBut this time, NASA decided to shorten the handover period to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Starliner crew in case the weather interferes with their targeted return date.\n\nWhen Williams and Wilmore launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, they were only supposed to spend eight days on the ISS. \n\nBut a series of technical issues with their ship, including thruster failures and helium leaks, ultimately drove NASA to send the faulty spacecraft home without its crew in September. \n\nBowersox said that NASA and SpaceX discussed adding a mission or bringing the currently docked capsule home early, 'but we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we've got in our budget.","summary":"SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was supposed to launch from Kennedy Space Center at 7:48pm ET Wednesday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14492027/setback-stranded-NASA-astronauts-Elon-Musk-spacex.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/23/96135157-0-image-a-40_1741821901348.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:29:31","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor,Ellyn Lapointe","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor","Ellyn Lapointe"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.759},{"id":299584492,"title":"Do you feel guilty?' - Watch BBC reporter challenge smuggler as he follows lethal drugs trade","text":"President Donald Trump sees his trade war as a way of pressuring Mexico to do more to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US. \n\nBBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville travelled to the US-Mexico border and tracked down fentanyl smugglers - before speaking to addicts in Philadelphia. \n\nWatch as he meets some of the drug operatives and challenges them over the deaths their pills are causing.\n\nCameraman: Darren Conway","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cx20y477yrwo","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f0c8/live/27083a90-ff97-11ef-a8b1-950887ddc6e5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:29:20","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.423},{"id":299584486,"title":"Trump: Tariffs on Indian drugs will be a bitter pill for Americans","text":"With Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariffs on India looming next month, millions of Americans may have to brace for steeper medical bills.\n\nLast week, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made an unscheduled trip to the US for discussions with officials, hoping to strike a trade deal.\n\nIt followed Trump's announcement that he would impose tariffs - which are government taxes on foreign imports - on India by 2 April, in retaliation to India's tariffs on American goods. \n\nGoyal wants to stave off tax increases on India's critical export industries like medicinal drugs.\n\nNearly half of all medicines taken in the US come from India alone. Generic drugs - which are cheaper versions of brand-name medications - imported from countries like India make up nine out of 10 prescriptions in the US.\n\nThis saves Washington billions in healthcare costs. In 2022 alone, the savings from Indian generics amounted to a staggering $219bn (£169bn), according to a study by consulting firm IQVIA.\n\nWithout a trade deal, Trump's tariffs could make some Indian generics unviable, forcing companies to exit part of the market and exacerbating existing drug shortages, experts say.\n\nTariffs could \"worsen the demand-supply imbalances\" and the uninsured and poor will be left counting the costs, says Dr Melissa Barber, a drug costing expert from Yale University.\n\nThe effects could be felt across people suffering from a range of health conditions.\n\nOver 60% of prescriptions for hypertension and mental health ailments in the US were filled with Indian-made drugs, according to the IQVIA study funded by the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). \n\nSertraline, the most prescribed antidepressant in the US, is a prominent example of how dependent Americans are on Indian supplies for essential drugs. \n\nMany of them cost half as much as for those from non-Indian companies.\n\n\"We are worried about this,\" says Peter Maybarduk, a lawyer at Public Citizens, a consumer advocacy group fighting for access to medicines. One in four American patients already fail to take medicines due to their costs, he adds.\n\nTrump is already reportedly facing pressure from US hospitals and generic drugmakers because of his tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThe raw materials for 87% of the drugs sold in the US are located outside the country and primarily concentrated in China which fulfils around 40% of global supply.\n\nWith tariffs on Chinese imports rising 20% since Trump took office, the cost of raw materials for drugs have already gone up.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg8ke45gq0o","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bb6d/live/38ddfed0-fdb7-11ef-b5c6-2785113aea78.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:29:20","author":"Archana Shukla And Nikhil Inamdar","authors":["Archana Shukla And Nikhil Inamdar"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":299590942,"title":"Oil up 2pc on tighter US supplies","text":"NEW YORK: Oil prices rose 2% on Wednesday, as US government data showed tighter oil and fuel inventories than expected, though investors kept an eye on mounting fears of a US economic slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.\n\nBrent futures rose $1.33, or 1.9%, to $70.89 a barrel at 10:55 a.m. EDT (1455 GMT), while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained $1.45, or 2.2%, to $67.70 a barrel.\n\nUS crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than an expected 2-million barrel rise, US government data showed on Wednesday.\n\nUS gasoline inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.9 million-barrel draw, while distillate stocks also dropped by more than expected.\n\n“This week, the oil build was smaller than expected and gasoline and diesel draws were larger than expected,” said Josh Young, Chief Investment Officer, Bison Interests. “This evidences stronger demand and could see oil prices rise as a result.”\n\nIn recent days, crude futures have been supported by a weaker US dollar and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) moving away from earlier calls of strongly oversupplied oil markets this year, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo.\n\nThe dollar struggled to lift off a five-month low against other major currencies on Wednesday, as traders digested tit-for-tat US-EU tariffs and a potential Russia-Ukraine ceasefire.\n\nThe dollar index which fell 0.5% to fresh 2025 lows on Tuesday, boosted oil prices by making crude less expensive for buyers holding other currencies.\n\nHowever, signs of cooling inflation offered investors some respite after US consumer prices increased less than expected in February. But improvement is likely temporary against the backdrop of aggressive tariffs on imports that are expected to raise the costs of most goods in the months ahead.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s economic policies so far have centered on a blitz of tariff announcements. Some have taken effect and others have been delayed or are set to kick in later. Markets worry that tariffs could raise prices for businesses, boost inflation and undermine consumer confidence in a blow to economic growth. “Fears of a US recession, weakness in US stock markets and concerns over tariffs affecting key oil players such as China, introduced additional market uncertainty and these factors could continue to fuel a bearish sentiment, putting a lid on oil prices,” said Hassan Fawaz chairman and founder of brokerage GivTrade.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries kept its forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in 2025, saying air and road travel would support consumption.\n\n“Trade concerns are expected to contribute to volatility as trade policies continue to be unveiled. However the global economy is expected to adjust,” OPEC said in the report. OPEC also published figures showing a 363,000 bpd increase in production by the wider OPEC+ group in February, led by a jump in Kazakhstan which is lagging in its adherence to OPEC+ output quotas.","summary":"NEW YORK: Oil prices rose 2% on Wednesday, as US government data showed tighter oil and fuel inventories than expected, though investors kept an eye on mounting fears of a US economic slowdown and the impact of tariffs on global economic growth.\n\n\nBrent futures rose $1.33, or 1.9%, to $70.89 a barrel at 10:55 a.m. EDT (1455 GMT), while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures gained $1.45, or 2.2%, to $67.70 a barrel.\n\n\nUS crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than an expected 2-million barrel rise, US government data showed on Wednesday.\n\n\nUS gasoline inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.9 million-barrel draw, while distillate stocks also dropped by more than expected.\n\n\n“This week, the oil build was smaller than expected and gasoline and diesel draws were larger than expected,” said Josh Young, Chief Investment Officer, Bison Interests. “This evidences stronger demand and could see oil prices rise as a result.”\n\n\nIn recent days, crude futures h","url":"https://www.brecorder.com/news/40352632/oil-up-2pc-on-tighter-us-supplies","image":"https://i.brecorder.com/large/2025/03/130057269badf81.jpg?r=005730","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:28:25","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"pk","sentiment":0.039},{"id":299590174,"title":"Solomon Islands leader takes aim at Trump over 'regrettable' climate position","text":"The Solomon Islands prime minister has pushed back on Australia's attempts to extract strategic concessions from his country in return for a $190 million policing package announced late last year, saying officials are trying to hammer out a \"compromise\" on the issue. \n\nIn an exclusive interview, Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele spoke to the ABC's The Pacific program in Honiara this week — the first time a sitting Solomon Islands leader has sat down with the ABC in almost six years.\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Mr Manele discussed his first year in office after replacing the enigmatic Manasseh Sogavare as the Pacific nation's leader, highlighting the key economic and strategic issues facing Solomon Islands. \n\nHe also weighed in on the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, labelling it \"regrettable\". \n\nSpeaking on the ambitious $190 million policing package Australia is providing to expand the Pacific nation's police force and build a major new police training centre in Honiara announced just before Christmas, the prime minister said officials were still locked in negotiations over a memorandum of understanding to implement it. \n\nAustralia has rolled out the initiative as it tries to entrench its position as the country's key security partner and stop China from expanding its policing presence in Solomon Islands under controversial security and police agreements struck in 2022 and 2023. \n\nOne Solomon Islands government source told the ABC that Australia was trying to use the agreement to force China out of policing cooperation and training in Solomon Islands. \n\nWhen announcing the package last year, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declined to say whether Australia had pressed Solomon Islands to cap or reduce the number of Chinese police in the country, but said the agreement would \"[make] sure that Australia remains the security partner of choice\" for Honiara.\n\nMr Manele told the ABC there were \"one or two differences\" between Australia and Solomon Islands over the \"language\" in the agreement, although he didn't spell out what they were.\n\nBut he also emphasised that the agreement would need to be endorsed by his cabinet before it could become a reality, and stressed that Solomon Islands should \"take the lead\" on its own policing decisions. \n\n\"Caucus and cabinet will have the final say as far as our side is concerned,\" he told the ABC.\n\n\"It's important for us to take the lead. It's important for us to be in the driver's seat.\" \n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC that Australia was \"Solomon Islands' partner of choice — with the largest development and security cooperation programs in Solomon Islands, and substantial infrastructure cooperation, economic and people-to-people links.\"\n\n\"Negotiations are underway on a MOU on implementation and governance arrangements. This discussion is ongoing,\" they said.\n\nTrump's 'unfortunate' position\n\nMr Manele also took aim at Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement on climate change, calling it \"regrettable\" and damaging.\n\n\"It will affect global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as global efforts to mobilise financing to address the impacts of climate change,\" he said.\n\n\"[It's] very unfortunate because it will be countries in the Pacific including Solomon Islands, we're the ones that will suffer disproportionately.\n\n\"We're the ones least responsible for climate change [but] we face the brunt of climate change. So it's unfortunate the US has taken that position.\"\n\nWorld War II bombs a 'serious problem'\n\nMr Manele also raised concerns over the Trump administration’s sweeping aid cuts to USAID and State Department development programs around the globe, with the impact being felt in Solomon Islands.\n\nMr Manele said he was worried about losing US support for a program that contributes to safely defusing unexploded shells and bombs that still litter Solomon Islands after lethal battles between the US and Japan during World War II.\n\nHe also suggested that he might approach other countries already funding programs to remove ordinance -- including Australia, New Zealand and Japan -- to help plug the gap.\n\nA DFAT spokesperson said it was currently \"undertaking an assessment of current needs in our region following the USAID announcements.\"\n\n\"This assessment is being informed with partner governments, NGOs and the United States,\" they said.","summary":"In an exclusive interview, and the first time a Solomon Islands leader has sat down with the ABC in almost six years, new prime minister Jeremiah Manele says 'differences' remain over a new policing agreement with Australia.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-13/solomon-islands-prime-minister-interview-trump-australia/105042638","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/180cab4ad26528c550c248d8877cf7cf?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=277&cropW=493&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:27:35","author":"Chrisnrita Aumanu-Leong,Stephen Dziedzic","authors":["Chrisnrita Aumanu-Leong","Stephen Dziedzic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.032},{"id":299585468,"title":"Laura: Democrats, for political reasons, refuse to understand this","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle March 12, 2025 07:03 \n\n Laura: Democrats, for political reasons, refuse to understand this \n Fox News host Laura Ingraham traces President Donald Trump's foreign economic stance to the 1980s on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Tags THE INGRAHAM ANGLESHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRPOLITICS","summary":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham traces President Donald Trump&apos;s foreign economic stance to the 1980s on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369946208112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3940a90b-5ebf-4675-8970-62e7d5753ec1/f7a26aaa-b0f3-46b8-89d7-75c65587d0a3/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:26:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.398},{"id":299589762,"title":"Martin's big outing was all laughs and smiles - but Irish public may not have found it as funny","text":"Take our survey • Win a prize\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

Get in, get out and don’t embarrass yourself – or us – in between.\n\nOthers though, will feel the Taoiseach was too deferential to Trump and his Vice President JD Vance.\n\nLaughs as Vance showed off his shamrock socksAlamy\n\nThroughout his few days in the US this week, the Taoiseach’s confidence appeared to build.\n\nOn the first day of the trip, he didn’t want to entertain hypothetical questions about how his meeting with Trump might play out, but after meeting with Texas Governor – and staunch Trump supporter – Greg Abbott on Monday, he clearly got a sense from him that Trump’s America remains friendly to Ireland.\n\nStill though, after the dressing down Zelenskyy received when he visited the Oval Office two weeks ago, the Taoiseach would have been naive not to have been a bit concerned heading into the meeting.\n\nHis gameplan yesterday in the end was straightforward: keep the smile on the face, nod a lot, and when you have to broach the difficult topics, keep Trump on board through compliments. \n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt points it felt like the Taoiseach was almost gentle-parenting the President, particularly when it came to his comments on the Middle East and Ukraine. \n\nAt three points during the day, first at the Vice President’s breakfast, then in the Oval Office and later at the shamrock ceremony, the Taoiseach spoke highly of the US’s role in securing peace in Northern Ireland. \n\nHe used this as his entry point to talk about Ireland’s ambition to see peace in Ukraine and the Middle East. It was the definition of subtle diplomacy, but many might argue it was too subtle and the Taoiseach missed an opportunity.\n\nThe Taoiseach would argue though that that was not what yesterday was for – his repeated refrain has been that this was a day to promote Ireland.\n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump himself made it clear that that was also his view when he told one Irish reporter who asked about the Occupied Territories Bill and Ireland’s relationship with Israel: “Well you’re not from Israel that’s for sure.” \n\nOverall, the Taoiseach did his best to steer clear of the noise and bring things back on track when there were moments of danger.\n\nAnd there was plenty of both noise and danger during the 50-minute public meeting in front of the press and cameras in the Oval Office.\n\nThere was more than one point during the day when Martin’s humouring of Trump put him in danger at home. \n\nOne of the most notable came when he laughed along as Trump told reporters that Ireland’s housing crisis was a “good problem” to have because it showed that the country was doing well. \n\n“That’s a pretty good answer, Mr President,” Martin said in response. \n\nRelated Reads\n\nAs it happened: The Taoiseach invited Trump and Vance to visit as Washington celebrated Ireland\n\nThe Journal / YouTube\n\nIt was a moment of plamás in a high-stress environment, but for anyone in Ireland dealing with the reality of the housing crisis it was a kick in the teeth. \n\nThere were also other points in the Oval Office when Martin sat silently throughout Trump’s cutting comments on the European Union.\n\nNo doubt, neighbouring EU leaders would have wanted to hear the Taoiseach put forward some line of defence. \n\nThe Taoiseach would likely counter it was not a day to focus on international issues. His backers might also argue that it was best just to avoid a row as any sharp exchanges between the pair would be replayed internationally – in the end likely serving to make the current transatlantic standoff on tariffs even worse.\n\nRegardless of whether the Irish public rated the Taoiseach’s performance yesterday or not, one thing was very clear: Both Trump and Vance appeared to have genuine respect for him. \n\nThat was evident in how they allowed him to say his piece on tariffs and the trade imbalance. \n\nThere was also a sense that both men were on their best behaviour and that Trump in particular was visibly being careful in some of his responses to tricky questions from the press.\n\nWith all the toasts, speeches, green ties and bowls of shamrock, they saw yesterday as a celebration of the bond between the US and Ireland and that was that.\n\nWhether we are happy to be or not, the message from the White House yesterday was that – for the moment at least – the Irish are in Trump’s good books.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nJane Matthews\n\nView 7 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Martin's big outing was all laughs and smiles - but Irish public may not have found it as funny”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Martin's big outing was all laughs and smiles - but Irish public may not have found it as funny”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Some have already reached the justices on an emergency basis, as the administration argued lower court judges blocking aspects of President Donald Trump’s agenda were exceeding their authority.\n\nBelow are some of the biggest issues making their way through the courts.\n\nElon Musk’s DOGE\n\nDOGE and the actions taken by Musk’s team to reduce government spending have been a primary target for lawsuits.\n\nThe results of these challenges have been mixed: On Monday, a district court judge, who noted DOGE’s “unusual secrecy,” found that DOGE is likely subject to public records requests.\n\n“The authority exercised by USDS across the federal government and the dramatic cuts it has apparently made with no congressional input appear to be unprecedented,” Judge Christopher Cooper, an Obama appointee, wrote Monday.\n\nIn lawsuits challenging DOGE’s access to Treasury Department data, several judges have declined to restrict access. Clinton-appointed Judge Kollar-Kotelly did not block DOGE’s access on Friday after temporarily restricting it to just two employees.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan, the Obama-appointed judge who oversaw Trump’s federal Jan. 6 indictment last year, handed the Trump administration a key victory by declining Feb. 18 to grant a request from Democratic attorneys general to temporarily block DOGE’s access to data systems at multiple agencies.\n\n“The court is aware that DOGE’s unpredictable actions have resulted in considerable uncertainty and confusion for Plaintiffs and many of their agencies and residents,” Chutkan wrote. “But the ‘possibility’ that Defendants may take actions that irreparably harm Plaintiffs ‘is not enough.'”\n\nYet DOGE employees are still limited from accessing the Treasury’s payment system under a February ruling from a federal judge in New York. (RELATED: Lawyers Already Trying To Use Trump’s Address To Congress As ‘New Evidence’ Against DOGE)\n\nA judge blocked the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management from sharing some “sensitive personal information” in February.\n\nSeveral groups also sued in February to prevent DOGE from accessing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data.\n\nSpending Freezes\n\nOne of the first emergency applications from the Trump administration the Supreme Court has had to confront was related to the freeze on foreign aid spending.\n\nBiden-appointed federal Judge Amir Ali found Monday that the foreign aid spending freeze was unlawful, issuing a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from implementing the freeze.\n\n“The Executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress’s exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place,” he wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously declined to halt Ali’s previous temporary restraining order requiring the administration to pay out $2 billion in foreign aid funds, which Ali initially gave the administration 36 hours to fulfill. Justice Samuel Alito, in a dissent joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, said he was “stunned” by their failure to call out “judicial hubris.”\n\n“As the Nation’s highest court, we have a duty to ensure that the power entrusted to federal judges by the Constitution is not abused,” Alito wrote.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit brought by Democratic state attorneys general challenging the Trump administration’s federal funding freeze, Judge John McConnell held March 6 that the freeze “fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government.”\n\n“It imposed a categorical mandate on the spending of congressionally appropriated and obligated funds without regard to Congress’s authority to control spending,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote in his decision.\n\nFiring Federal Workers\n\nEmployees who have been terminated across multiple agencies also filed legal challenges to reclaim their positions.\n\nIn a lawsuit brought by several labor unions and nonprofits, Judge William Alsup, a Clinton appointee, found Feb. 27 that the termination of probationary employees was likely illegal. (RELATED: Judge Assigned To Hear DNC’s Lawsuit Against Trump Donated To Biden)\n\nTwenty Democrat state attorneys general also sued over the Office of Personnel Management directive to terminate probationary employees on Thursday.\n\nBounds Of Executive Authority\n\nMultiple executive branch officials fired by Trump sued to reclaim their jobs, including former leaders of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n\nIn a decision Thursday, Obama-appointed Judge Beryl Howell held Gwynne Wilcox’s removal from the National Labor Relations Board was illegal.\n\nHampton Dellinger, former head of the Office of Special Counsel, received the most attention for his lawsuit, which he dropped March 6 after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Trump administration in allowing his removal. Dellinger noted he would be unlikely to succeed at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit panel wrote in an opinion issued Monday that the government “has sufficiently demonstrated that Dellinger exercises at least enough authority to contradict the President’s directives,” finding the government was likely to succeed on the merits.\n\nThe Supreme Court dismissed the matter as moot after Dellinger dropped his challenge. The Trump administration had asked the justices to consider the issue on an emergency basis after a district court ordered Dellinger’s reinstatement.\n\nThe Trump administration has signaled its intent to argue that Supreme Court precedent limiting presidents from removing some federal officials without cause, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, should be overturned.\n\nAnother lawsuit filed by the Democratic party alleges Trump’s executive order asserting control over agencies could jeopardize independence the party relies on in the Federal Election Commission (FEC). The case was assigned to Judge Ali, a former Democrat donor and clerk for the Supreme Court of Canada who also ruled against the administration’s foreign aid spending freeze.\n\nExecutive Orders\n\nDemocrat-aligned groups and states have quickly filed lawsuits against Trump’s executive orders on gender ideology, birthright citizenship and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), some within hours of signing.\n\nTrump’s order ending birthright citizenship has been blocked in multiple district courts and three federal appeals courts.\n\nThe First Circuit Court of Appeals held Tuesday that the Trump administration did not make a “strong showing” that states named in the lawsuit lacked standing to challenge the order.\n\n“The Government expressly declines to make any developed argument that it is likely to succeed on appeal in showing that the Executive Order is either constitutional or compliant with 8 U.S.C. § 1401,” Chief Judge David Barron, an Obama appointee, wrote. “Nor does the Government contest that, for more than a century, persons in the two categories that the Executive Order seeks to prevent from being recognized as United States citizens have been so recognized.”\n\nA federal judge in Maryland blocked in February parts of Trump’s orders on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the federal government.\n\nTrump’s orders on gender ideology and restricting federal funding to institutions that offer child gender transitions were also quickly met with lawsuits.\n\nTwo judges have ordered the administration to maintain funding to hospitals that provide child sex changes. Another judge has blocked the transfer of transgender-identifying inmates into facilities that align with their biological sex.\n\nJudge Howell temporarily blocked on Wednesday portions of Trump’s executive order directing government contractors to disclose if they do business with the law firm Perkins Coie, which represented Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Democrats, and limiting access to government buildings for employees of the firm.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It expects, understandably, its allies to do more for themselves. And I suppose in that sense, this Chinese visitation, this Chinese navy circumnavigation of Australia, is another sign, that we are going to have to do a lot more for ourselves when it comes to our military strength and our preparedness for tensions and dare I say it possible conflicts to come,” Abbott said.\n\nHowever, Albanese did acknowledge that Beijing’s notification of the live-fire exercises was not good enough.\n\n“Defence confirmed that China did comply with international law, and that’s important,” Albanese said on Feb. 22.\n\n“I think they could have given notice, but given Australia has a presence from time to time in the South China Sea, its location is hinted at there by the title of the sea, that we engage in activities that are lawful.\n\n“Notification did occur of this event, what we have done is to make representation, saying that we think best practice would be to give more notice, and we’ve done that through diplomatic channels, as is appropriate.”","summary":"Abbott warned the latest actions served as a warning that 'we can't take for granted that the Pacific is a calm lake.'","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/tony-abbott-describes-ccp-live-fire-exercises-as-act-of-intimidation-5824041","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/14/id5629021-GettyImages-488238000-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:07:46","author":"Monica O’shea","authors":["Monica O’shea"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":299584886,"title":"SpaceX launch scrubbed hours after Hegseth shares message to rescue mission crew: ‘Wish you Godspeed’","text":"SpaceX and NASA scrubbed the planned rocket launch of Crew-10 to the International Space Station (ISS) on Wednesday due to a hydraulic issue with one of the ground systems, according to officials giving a live broadcast of the event.

The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will carry a crew of four to the ISS for a six-month residency. The mission is set to usher in the much-anticipated homecoming of Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Suni Williams. \"President Trump said to Elon Musk, ‘get the astronauts home and do it now' – and they're responding,\" Hegseth continued. \"And they're bringing NASA astronauts, [who] also happen to be retired U.S. Navy Capt. Butch Wilmore and retired U.S. Navy Capt. Suni Williams, home.\" The American astronauts have been stranded on the ISS for nine months after arriving there in June of last year. They were only supposed to stay for about a week. Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft had transported the pair of astronauts from Earth to the ISS. However, it returned to Earth unmanned in September. This came after Starliner suffered \"helium leaks\" and \"issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters\" while docking with the ISS.

Yet, U.S. Army Colonel Anne McClain and U.S. Air Force Major Nichole Ayers,\" Hegseth said. \"So this is Army, Air Force and Navy tonight.\" In addition to McClain and Ayers, Crew-10 also includes an astronaut from Japan and one from Russia. BOEING'S STARLINER SPACECRAFT LANDS BACK ON EARTH WITHOUT A CREW Wednesday's launch comes after President Donald Trump asked SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to rescue the stranded astronauts sooner than NASA had planned.

Only governments, operating openly, should fulfill government roles.\n\nIn addition, as the unfolding ActBlue scandal illustrates, we need to make it harder for untrackable foreign cash to flow to American candidates and causes. \n\nDemocratic fundraising colossus ActBlue appears to have served as a knowing conduit for illegal overseas contributions, given under false or assumed names, that were “smurfed” — broken up into small chunks — to avoid attention and end-run campaign-finance laws. \n\nNo precautions were taken to stop illegal donations from Russia, China, Venezuela and Iran, according to the House Administration Committee. \n\nNow, with Republicans in charge of Congress and Trump in the White House, ActBlue’s management and staff are bolting.\n\nMost importantly, we need to shrink the size of both the federal government and its budget. \n\nUSAID is no more, and Trump has promised to abolish the Department of Education. \n\nThat’s just the beginning. \n\nMany more cuts to the bureaucracy must follow.\n\nRequiring a balanced budget will go farther still toward reining in corruption and fraud. \n\nToday, with everything paid for by endless borrowing, it’s easy to funnel money to political projects.\n\nWithout unlimited funds, that’s much harder to do: Popular programs would have to take a hit.\n\nMake the government smaller, force tough choices, and we’ll make Washington less corrupt. \n\nLet the parasites work for a living for a change.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.","summary":"Make the government smaller, force tough spending choices, and we’ll make Washington less corrupt.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/12/opinion/trump-is-deworming-dc-now-keep-the-parasites-out-for-good/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/DJT3545.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:03:11","author":"Glenn H.

The US President's astonishing threat can be seen on the Mirror in full today following his address in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said: \"I can do things financially that would be very bad for Russia . It would be devastating for Russia. But I don't want to do that because I want to see peace.\" It comes amid hope in Europe a pause in the fighting could come in the next 24 hours . US officials are in Russia to discuss the potential 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine , it is understood. Vladimir Putin is yet to respond to Mr Trump's fresh pressure. However, the US leader added: \"Hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia. I’ve gotten some positive messages, but a positive message means nothing. This is a very serious situation.\" He added that the conflict \"could start World War Three\". Mr Trump, 78, met Micheál Martin , the Irish prime minister, on Wednesday. Meanwhile, defence ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Poland gathered at the Val-de-Grace chapel in Paris to discuss accelerating European security and plans for a “reassurance force” inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. Sébastian Lecornu, the French foreign minister, said: “We are hoping to see a ceasefire tomorrow.” John Healey, the UK defence secretary, said: “I say to President Putin, over to you now. You said you want to talk, prove it. Accept the ceasefire, start negotiations and end the war. Make no mistake, the pressure is now on Putin.\" Although he is yet to comment on the developments, Mr Putin, 72, appeared in uniform on Tuesday as he visited a command point for Russian troops involved in the counteroffensive in the Kursk region . Fighting has intensified in the area over recent days after months of Ukrainian forces successfully holding Russian territory. US arms deliveries to Ukraine finally resumed on Wednesday. Following nine-hour talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the White House agreed to lift its suspension on military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russia's invasion, and also removed restrictions on sharing intelligence put in place last week. When Mr Trump met the Irish Taoiseach, he accused Ireland of ripping off the United States . Awkward scenes unfolded in the White House when the outspoken US President spoke of a \"massive\" trade imbalance between the two countries and accused the Irish Government of drawing US pharmaceutical companies away through attractive tax rates.","summary":"With a pause in the fighting in Ukraine looking likely, Donald Trump has increased the intensity of the pressure on Russia with an astonishing threat about money","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trumps-chilling-threat-vladimir-34850447","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article34850455.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_President-Trump-Hosts-Irish-Taoiseach-Micheal-Martin-At-The-White-House.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:02:09","author":"Bradley Jolly","authors":["Bradley Jolly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":299585470,"title":"'We don't need Canada,' says Grant Cardone","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nIngraham Angle March 12, 2025 06:16 \n\n 'We don't need Canada,' says Grant Cardone \n Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone discusses President Donald Trump reportedly considering additional tariffs on timber and lumber on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n Facebook Twitter Email Copy to clipboard Copy to clipboard Tags SHOWSWHAT TO WATCH | VIDEOSLATEST NEWS | VIDEOSON AIRTHE INGRAHAM ANGLEPOLITICSUS","summary":"Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone discusses President Donald Trump reportedly considering additional tariffs on timber and lumber on &apos;The Ingraham Angle.&apos;","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369945409112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/79db4491-e534-47da-87c8-470f70242af1/9ebd18d5-d414-4e73-a6ef-1568268ff5e9/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-13 00:02:02","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":299586198,"title":"Russia mulls Ukraine ceasefire proposal as G7 foreign ministers meet in Canada","text":"G7 foreign ministers are to meet in Canada as Russia considers a proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nPeace in Ukraine is likely to top the agenda for Thursday’s meeting in Charlevoix, Quebec, with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stressing the need to ensure Kyiv is “in the strongest possible position”.\n\nMr Lammy said: “If we do not achieve lasting peace in Ukraine, the instability and insecurity that has hit the living standards of working people in Britain will only get worse and Putin’s appetite for conflict and chaos will only grow.”\n\nThe meeting, which will also be attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, comes as the Kremlin considers a proposal for a 30-day ceasefire put forward after talks between the US and Ukraine.\n\nAmerican officials were expected to put the proposals directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin overnight on Wednesday, with Mr Rubio saying “the ball is truly in their court”.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was still awaiting “detailed information” on the proposal.\n\nThe G7 meeting is the latest in a round of diplomacy as the world scrambles to respond to Donald Trump’s push for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier in the week, military chiefs from Europe and beyond met in Paris to discuss plans for a peacekeeping force that could be deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nUK Defence Secretary John Healey said this work was “accelerating” after a meeting with his counterparts from France, Germany, Italy and Poland on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to host a summit of the “coalition of the willing” on Saturday.\n\nBut while Mr Lammy is set to push for continued support for Ukraine when he meets the G7 foreign ministers on Thursday, the meeting could also see tensions as the US seeks to avoid criticism of Moscow.\n\nThe Trump administration has already opposed UN resolutions condemning Russian aggression in Ukraine, and earlier in the week Mr Rubio said the US would not “sign on to any communique that’s not consistent with our position to bring both sides to the table”.\n\nMr Trump’s repeated claims that the US should absorb Canada as its 51st state could also prove to be a sticking point, although Mr Rubio told reporters on Wednesday it was “not what we’re going to discuss at the G7”.","summary":"G7 foreign ministers are to meet in Canada as Russia considers a proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.

All other culture war nonsense played a role, sure, but in the end, Trump upended the usual campaign dynamics by winning voters making less than $50,000, while former Vice President Kamala Harris won voters making more than $100,000. \n\nThe Democratic Party is now the party of the educated elite, while the Republican Party has become the party of the lower socioeconomic strata. \n\nEven though Trump won white voters handily by 57-42, Harris won college-educated white voters by 53-45, according to 2024 exit polls. Trump also won non-college white voters by 66-32. Overall, Harris won college-educated voters by 56-42 and lost non-college voters by 56-43. \n\nIn other words, Trump voters don’t buy Teslas. So how is this terrible politics for Trump? \n\nTens of millions of Americans voted for Trump because they believed his repeated promises that “Starting on Day 1, we will end inflation and make America affordable again.” \n\nInstead, Trump spent Day 1 renaming the Gulf of Mexico and Mount Denali in Alaska, starting nonsensical trade wars with Canada and Mexico, aligning himself with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, firing tens of thousands of government workers, slashing popular government programs—many of which directly benefit his own base—and otherwise doing everything but lower prices. \n\nAnd while he’s certainly full of excuses, none of them are, “Sorry, I got distracted. Let me get back to working on lowering prices.” \n\nIn fact, Trump is full steam ahead on his trade wars and deportation plans, which will only increase prices … by a lot. So now the stock market is tanking and Social Security is at risk.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is hosting Tesla infomercials at the White House to promote Musk’s Tesla vehicles—several of which cost more than $100,000.\n\nEven Trump’s beloved Fox News couldn’t ignore the horrendous optics of this stunt. \n\nTrump said he would buy an $80,000 red Tesla Model S for White House staff, since he doesn’t drive. But how will they charge the car? Trump is literally removing charging stations from all government buildings—just another example of how Trump’s hatred for EVs is in direct conflict with his need to please Musk. \n\nAt the end of the day, Trump doesn’t give a damn about his supporters, much less the broader American people. Of course, no one should be surprised, considering he said on the campaign trail, “I don’t care about you. I just want your vote.”","summary":"President Donald Trump’s ridiculous car salesman schtick at the White House Tuesday made a mockery of the Executive Office.

Our regulatory process and our subsidies to create this market, you’re 100% right,’ Newsom said.\n\nBannon added on, point out that Musk ‘left Canada to go to California.’\n\nNewsom didn’t disagree again, pointing out that after everything California did, the federal government wrote Musk a check. \n\n‘He’s been the beneficiary of billions and billions and billions of dollars of subsidies.’\n\nThe governor that asked him what he wanted Musk to do next as part of DOGE, if Bannon wants the ‘First Buddy’ to run programs like the FAA.\n\n‘I want the deconstruction of the administrative state. The better angels of Elon, that engineer’s brain, I think they kicked in when he saw our strategy,’ Bannon said.\n\n‘He sees that we have an apparatus and the administrative state is kind of anti-democratic.’\n\nBannon said that the ‘Deep State’ would ignore the desires of any Democrat, including Newsom, if they became president and remain the true rulers of America.\n\nAgain, Newsom agreed, when Bannon had a spontaneous thought for what Musk could do next.\n\n‘We should invite Elon, since you’re personal friends with these guys, Elon ought to take a California DOGE!’\n\nNewsom argued that California already had such a plan that had saved the state hundreds of billions of dollars. \n\n‘Let Elon come out and verify that. I think for the nation it’d be good and it would be good for you,’ Bannon said.\n\nEventually, Newsom did get to ask Bannon about whether Musk was ‘scared’ of Bannon after comments that included the War Room host calling Musk a ‘parasite.’\n\n‘I’m just a mick that yells into a microphone,’ he joked.\n\nThis time, Newsom hit back: ‘He’s marginally attacked you back. I’m curious your private thoughts on that. He’s a little scared of you, isn’t he?’\n\nAgain, Bannon demured.\n\nThe chat was the latest episode of Newsom’s new ‘This is Gavin Newsom’ podcast, which has sought to bridge a gap and invite conservatives to chat with the famously progressive governor.\n\nMuch like the first episode with Charlie Kirk, the talk with Bannon drew utter outrage from liberals that he would even talk to the Trump ally.\n\nAnti-Trump ex-Republican Congressman posted a furious video in response to the interview.\n\n‘I am in shock at the stupidity of @GavinNewsom inviting Steve Bannon on his podcast. Many of us on the right sacrificed careers to fight Bannon, and Newsom is trying to make a career and a presidential run by building him up. Unforgivable and insane.’\n\n‘STOP GIVING NAZIS A PLATFORM,’ wrote another Dem-aligned X account.\n\n‘On behalf of Democrats who don’t want Gavin Newsom to be our nominee in 2028 (or ever), I want to thank whoever has been advising him to have Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon on his new podcast. You’re doing the lord’s work,’ said Adam Carlson.\n\nPhillip Germain added: ‘Steve Bannon told Gavin Newsom that Trump won the 2020 election and there was absolutely no pushback. What are we doing here?’\n\nIn the interview with TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, he distance himself from Democrats’ belief that transgender women should be playing women’s sports. \n\nKirk asked him: ‘Would you say no men in female sports?’\n\n‘Well, I think it’s an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,’ Newsom responded. ‘It is an issue of fairness. It’s deeply unfair.’\n\nKirk challenged him to call out the case of AB Hernandez, a high school trans athlete dominating women’s long jump and triple jump in California.\n\nNewsom avoided that case but said he agreed with Kirk’s overall stance that it was unfair for women to compete with an athlete born a man. \n\nBut he went on to say that it was important to ensure that vulnerable communities were protected. \n\nNewsom is widely expected to run for president in 2028.

I want to talk about Europe very briefly. \n\nEurope is greeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as if he’s a rock hero and giving us all sorts of dramatic, melodramatic, psychodramatic pronouncements that they are going their own way because of the Trump isolationism, and sometimes it’s Trump Jacksonianism. They can’t count on us. And Ukraine was the catalyst. But let’s look at that issue for a moment. \n\nWe have 500 million people in Europe and they’re very upset that 330 million people across the ocean will not help 40 million people fighting 140 million people in Russia.\n\nIn other words, of all the players in this drama, it’s Europe who should be in the driver’s seat. They have 500 million people. And yet, when we look at their expenditures, nine countries out of the 32, 11 years later, have not increased their NATO contributions to 2%. \n\nWhat should they be doing? They should be meeting with the Trump administration and telling the American people why countries in Europe still won’t meet their military responsibilities.\n\nThey’re also running a $200-plus billion trade surplus with the United States. They need to tell us—instead of just saying, “We don’t want to get in a tariff war; Trump is a protectionist”—just explain to us why we in Europe believe that we deserve a $200 billion surplus each year with the United States. And maybe you could explain why your tariffs are not symmetrical with ours. We just need to know. We need to know that very quickly, in fact.\n\nAnother thing we need to know from Europe that we’re not getting, besides their surplus and the inability for all the NATO nations to meet their responsibilities and their promises of 11 years ago, is what is the strategy for Ukraine? \n\nThey’re very angry that President Donald Trump temporarily cut off some aid to Ukraine to urge Mr. Zelenskyy to consider a truce so he can negotiate a more lasting peace and stop the Stalingrad slaughter between Ukraine and Russia. I don’t even mean between Ukraine and Russia. It’s basically caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and they’re on the defensive, but Ukraine has not been able, strategically, to show a pathway to strategic resolution and victory.\n\nAgain, my interest and your interest is, what’s the alternative position by Europe? Is it we have 500 million people, we’re going to rearm, we’re going to divide up tasks? Finns have great artillery. They will supply the artillery to Ukraine. The Swedes and the French have good air forces. They will supply the air cover. The Germans have a tradition of great tank-making. They’re not very productive in tank production today. But perhaps they’ll promise to send 500 tanks. And then outline a position or a trajectory or a pathway where they can force, apparently, Russian President Vladimir Putin all the way back to where he was either in February 2022 or maybe even 2014.\n\nBut we don’t get any of that. We don’t get anything but rah-rah talk that we’re all Europeans. We’re not Donald Trump. We’re going to stick together. We’re going to put boots on the ground. We have what? Logistical capacity, armor, air force. \n\nWhy can’t they just get together and get an exact, detailed plan of military wherewithal, coupled with a strategy, coupled with a renewed commitment to meet their NATO promises, coupled with an explanation to the American people why they feel that $200-plus billion trade surplus is essential to Europe’s survival and it is not a result of asymmetrical and unfair trade practices?\n\nThat’s all we’re asking for.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

NASA opted for SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule to bring the stranded astronauts back. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk later baselessly suggested the astronauts were left in orbit “for political reasons,” referring to the Biden administration. Musk also said the return of Wilmore and Williams was “postponed kind of to a ridiculous degree,” backing up President Donald Trump, who claimed without evidence the Biden administration abandoned the astronauts and was going to “leave them in space.” The astronauts later replied to Trump’s comments in an interview with CNN, with Williams saying, “I don’t think those words are quite accurate…We are part of something bigger than ourselves, we are part of the International Space Station.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSpaceX Launches Ship To Bring Back Astronauts Stranded On International Space Station (Forbes)\n\nMusk Says US Astronauts Are Stranded On Space Station For ‘Political Reasons’—As They Reject Claim (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and Nasa could try to launch again in the coming days.\nNasa had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams.\nThe American space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than Nasa had planned.\nA planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and US Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.\n\nSpaceX’s rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral at 7.48pm with a crew of two US astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.\nWilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station’s other astronauts and have remained safe, according to Nasa. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.\n“It’s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,” Williams said of her family. “We’re here, we have a mission – we’re just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we’re up in space and it’s a lot of fun.”\nThe flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought – without offering evidence – to blame former US president Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.\nThe demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in Nasa’s human space flight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but Nasa swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.\nWhen the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others – Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov – can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.\nWilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives to keep the ISS staffed with enough US astronauts for maintenance, according to Nasa.\n\nWilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing’s Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. Nasa deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft.\nThis led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.\nBoeing built Starliner under a US$4.5 billion contract with Nasa to compete with SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the US space agency’s only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil.\nLast year’s mission had marked Starliner’s first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before Nasa could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\nStarliner’s development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar Nasa contract worth at least US$4 billion.","summary":"Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing’s faulty Starliner.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3302148/spacex-flight-retrieve-stranded-us-astronauts-called-over-launch-pad-problems","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/13/6873ea1e-6bf6-45af-9e35-3487ae516dae_2c96f480.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:54:43","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.604},{"id":299590612,"title":"Trump hosts Irish prime minister, alleges Ireland takes advantage of US in trade deals","text":"President Donald Trump welcomed Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin on Wednesday for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebration at the White House, where he added Ireland to the list of countries he says are taking advantage of the United States.Martin countered by noting Ireland's contributions to the U.S.It was Trump's first Oval Office meeting with a foreign leader since his recent sit-down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which morphed into a shouting match as they jousted over ending Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The session ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave the White House.Martin, who offered only gentle pushback to some of Trump's comments, returned to the White House in the evening and presented Trump with a bowl of shamrocks at an early St. Patrick's Day celebration. The duo also attended an annual luncheon at the Capitol.The president's banter during the Oval Office meeting also touched on Vice President JD Vance's shamrock-themed socks and Trump nemesis Rosie O’Donnell 's recent move to Ireland.The Republican president has been sparring with U.S. allies and adversaries alike over trade, slapping double-digit tariffs on imports from countries from Canada to China and in between. During the appearance with Martin, Trump repeated his claim that the European Union was created just to stick it to the U.S.Asked if Ireland, a member of the EU, was taking advantage, too, Trump said, “of course they are. I have great respect for Ireland and what they did and they should have done just what they did, but the United States shouldn’t have let it happen.” He was referring to the concentration of U.S. pharmaceutical companies in Ireland, due to the country's tax policies.“We had stupid leaders. We had leaders that didn’t have a clue or let’s say they weren’t businesspeople, but they didn’t have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies,\" Trump said.Martin countered that the trade relationship is “a two-way street,” adding that Ireland's two largest airlines buy more aircrafts from Boeing Co. than anyone else outside of America.More than 700 Irish companies are also based in America, creating thousands of jobs, Martin said. “That's a little known fact that doesn't turn up in the statistics,” he added.“I understand where you're coming from, fully,” Martin told Trump, “but I think it's a relationship that we can develop and that will endure into the future.”RELATED STORY | Europe, Canada retaliate against Trump's 25% tariffs on aluminum, steelAt one point, Trump became distracted as he talked about inflation in the U.S.“By the way, I love these socks.

O’Donnell, who is gay, recently announced that she moved to Ireland in January, citing a lack of equal rights in America.Trump found a way to sneak his penchant for professional fighting into the discourse.As the meeting wrapped, Trump was asked to name his favorite person in Ireland. Trump referred to Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor, partly because \"he's got the best tattoos I’ve ever seen.”Trump is well known for his support of Ultimate Fighting Championship and attended bouts during the 2024 presidential campaign.He noted that Martin’s father was an acclaimed boxer, but motioned to Martin saying, “You’re so smooth,” suggesting he did not look like a boxer.“I’m a pretty good defensive boxer,” Martin joked in reply.","summary":"President Donald Trump welcomed Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin to the White House Wednesday, where he added Ireland to the list of countries he says are taking advantage of the United States.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/trump-hosts-irish-prime-minister-alleges-ireland-takes-advantage-of-us-in-trade-deals","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6c6287/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3839x2015+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2Ff1%2Fd6eb225f4b72b3ab1cef30112bb2%2Fap25071567363240.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:54:12","author":"AP via Scripps News","authors":["AP via Scripps News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.03},{"id":299583172,"title":"What is a recession, and how can you prepare for one?","text":"The word “recession” is spinning around media reports and Americans’ minds this week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 900 points at closing Monday, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Donald Trump’s world-rattling tariffs would be “worth it” even if they led to a downturn.\n\n\"These policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\" Lutnick told CBS News when asked whether the tariffs would be worth it if they lead to a recession. \"It's worth it!” \n\nHere’s what you need to know about a recession — and what experts say you can do to prepare:\n\nEconomists use the term “recession” to describe a period of decline in economic activity, explains the International Monetary Fund. \n\nOne popular definition of a recession is at least two quarters of negative real gross domestic product, or GDP, which is the total value of goods and services in a country.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-profit that tracks U.S. business cycles, defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” For the bureau to ultimately call a recession, the economic downturn has to be significant, spread across sectors and not limited to a short period of time.\n\nThe bureau uses six key indicators to determine if there’s a recession. These factors include personal consumption, personal income, and manufacturing and trade sales, among others. \n\nA downturn in gross national product (the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. over a year), a rise in unemployment and falling stock prices can all signal a recession is coming, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nA recession typically lasts more than six months and it can take a country years to recover.\n\nThe U.S. isn’t in a recession right now. But experts say it’s best to prepare beforehand in case trouble strikes.\n\nKyle Newell, certified financial planner and owner of Newell Wealth Management, told Time that people should ramp up their savings to prepare for potential layoffs — which often go hand-in-hand with recessions.\n\n“We want to make sure [people] have enough cash reserves, hopefully without having to touch a 401(k), or anything of that nature, to live,” Newell told the magazine. \n\nHe suggests that a two-income household should have three months of expenses saved, while a single-income household should have six months of expenses saved.\n\nNewell also warned that workers — especially younger ones — should keep investing in their retirement account and shouldn’t panic if they see their 401(k) go down.\n\n“The stock market will start declining before a recession happens,” he told Time. “And oftentimes people's 401(k) are tied to the stock market, so they may see value go down. They should know not to panic, because they have the time to make it up.”\n\nNo, the U.S. is not currently in a recession. Despite layoffs across the federal government, the overall job market has remained sturdy, so far.\n\nFurthermore, four of the six indicators measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research are pointing toward economic growth, ZipRecruiter’s chief economist Julia Pollack told CBS News.\n\nBut an increasing number of economists see the odds of a future recession rising.\n\nThe impacts of a recession will vary from one person to another. However, millions will likely experience layoffs and face difficulty finding employment during a recession. \n\nThose who keep their jobs might see their bosses freeze pay raises or cut bonuses as businesses are forced to tighten their belts.\n\nInvestment portfolios could also tank, while lenders may be more hesitant to provide loans.","summary":"One way to  prepare for a recession is by beefing up your savings account, experts say","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/what-is-a-recession-and-how-can-you-prepare-for-one-b2714086.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/05/7/08/Trump-Speech-atklzt0y.jpeg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KtyrRJVe-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:49:28","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.03},{"id":299582002,"title":"Carney to Shrink Cabinet When He Takes Over as Canada’s Leader on Friday","text":"The former Bank of England and Bank of Canada governor won the Liberal Party leadership race Sunday with more than 85% of the vote.

The choice could be that stark","text":"Beware of hyperbolic headlines. But in this case, I’m afraid, as Ulrike Herrmann’s very readable book The End of Capitalism makes clear, the choice between capitalism and civilisation really does seem to be either/or – and the end will probably come a lot sooner that we thought.\n\nReview: The End of Capitalism: Why Growth and Climate Protection are Incompatible – Ulrike Herrmann, translated by David Shaw (Scribe)\n\nAnyone who isn’t alarmed about the rapid and well-documented decline in the global environment, upon which we and our atypically comfortable lifestyles depend, really hasn’t been paying attention. You may not enjoy reading a book like this, but you really should read it – if only for your children’s sake. \n\nThe End of Capitalism appeared in Germany a couple of years ago, but it has lost none of its relevance or urgency. On the contrary, with Donald Trump in the White House promising to “drill, baby drill”, it could hardly be more timely.\n\nCould capitalism end?\n\nThe majority of potential readers are likely to disagree with Herrmann’s central claim that “climate protection will only be possible if we abolish capitalism”. \n\nThis is unsurprising. We have known nothing other than capitalism in the West for several hundred years. Attempts to do things differently in other parts of the world, such as the Soviet Union, generally did not go well socially or, more importantly, environmentally.\n\nOne of the reasons it’s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism, as philosopher Fredric Jameson famously claimed, is that people everywhere like the abundance of stuff that capitalism has been instrumental in producing. Living standards, especially in the West, but also in China, India and elsewhere, have risen unimaginably in a remarkably short space of time. It is not surprising that the beneficiaries have generally been pleased about this unprecedented change in their material circumstances.\n\nTrue, contemporary capitalism is characterised by a growing gulf between the richest and the poorest, both within and between countries. This is an awkward problem for “communist” China, but one that Australians and especially Americans seem relatively unconcerned about. Herrmann, too, is surprisingly relaxed about it. She argues that “capitalism made democracy possible – and it can be democratically controlled”. \n\nThis idea is currently being subjected to a searching real-time examination, as the Trump administration systematically eviscerates and transforms America’s system of governance to a point where sober and serious analysts consider it to be headed toward authoritarianism. Herrmann does not consider such a possibility, but she does provide a clear explanation of the rise of capitalism and the social and technological forces that have made it the most transformative force in human history. \n\nMore hyperbole? Lots of people have given up on organised religion, but not many have renounced consumerism. Unlikely as such a renunciation might seem, Herrmann argues that endless consumption is something we will have to give up if the environment is to remain habitable. The argument is simple and has been around since the Club of Rome published The Limits to Growth, half a century ago: a system that is predicated on ever expanding growth is incompatible with a world of finite resources, especially if one of those resources is a functioning natural environment.\n\nLots of people have spent the intervening 50 years pointing out why the authors of that book were wrong. It is likely they will be queuing up to tell Herrmann she is wrong, too – especially when she argues that “‘green growth’ does not exist”. \n\n Read more:\n Is inequality a natural phenomenon? Thomas Piketty argues it isn't – and proposes a way forward\n\nThe unpalatable options\n\nWe have been repeatedly assured that technology will come to the rescue. But Herrmann contends that “we no longer have the time to wait for possible technological breakthroughs. We must act immediately if we are to avert climate collapse.” \n\nThe seemingly irreconcilable problems, she argues, are highlighted in the cost of removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it somewhere. Despite all the hype, such technology has yet to be viably demonstrated at scale. This means “humanity will be forced to move away from fossil fuels and towards green energy”. \n\nUnfortunately for the likes of Peter Dutton, Herrmann is scathing about the prospects for nuclear power. There is some debate about precise figures, but the German experience, which is central to the book’s main arguments, suggests that even when Germany had 19 commercially run reactors, they could only provide around 13% of total energy consumed. Herrmann points out that “the nuclear energy sector is the only branch of industry in which costs consistently rise”. Reactors are, consequently, not viable without government subsidies.\n\nBefore admirers of green energy and especially “green growth” start feeling smug, it is important to note that Herrmann is equally sceptical about wind and solar. She claims that, between them, they provide less than 10% of Germany’s energy needs and won’t be of much use in periods of dunkelflaute: the “dark doldrums” when the sun doesn’t shine (much) and the wind doesn’t blow.\n\nIn 2024, however, after the publication of the German edition of Herrmann’s book, Germany generated 59% of its electricity from renewables, including 31.9% from wind and 14.7% from solar.\n\nNevertheless, energy storage is expensive and difficult, and the transition to green solutions is fraught. One example: it takes 35 kilograms of scarce minerals to make a traditional petrol driven car and 210 kilograms to make an electric one. Manufacturing the batteries for them generates a further 15–20 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nAs a result, “our planet is being ransacked […] Around one-third of all raw material consumption since 1900 took place in the short time between 2002 and 2015.” \n\nThis is why Herrmann argues that simply moving to green energy sources will not be sufficient, either to guarantee current needs or to adequately reduce our collective impact on the environment. \n\nIt is not only the automotive sector that will have to shrink. One of the industries that will be difficult to reform, much less shrink, is aviation. Over a single year, 90% of the world’s population will not fly at all and 1% will account for half of the global aviation emissions. This mirrors the grotesque levels of inequality in global wealth distribution. It means the rich will have to join the poor in “saying goodbye to flying”. \n\nOther examples of politically unpalatable sacrifices are given throughout the book. And the message is clear:\n\nThe challenges will grow, and the funds [to address them] will shrink. Consumption must fall, which immediately begs the question of who should cut back and by how much. Distribution conflicts will be inevitable.\n\nGiven that “technology will not enable us to produce enough green energy sufficiently cheaply to fuel ‘green growth’ […] the only remaining option is green shrinkage: fewer new buildings, fewer cars, fewer chemical products”.\n\nThis is a message that no policymaker anywhere in the world, democrat or autocrat, will want to hear. It is not just the rich industrialised countries that are wedded to the idea of economic expansion. Many developing countries would like nothing better than to join their wealthy counterparts. So would the people of the global south, which is why so many of them risk their lives to flee hopeless poverty.\n\nImprobable precedents\n\nUnlikely as the necessary reforms are to be realised, Herrmann suggests that wartime Britain offers a model of what can be achieved if the dangers are sufficiently immediate and existential. She points out that “rationing was so popular in Britain because everyone had exactly the same entitlement” – though no doubt the legendary “spirit of the Blitz” also had something to do with spending nights cowering in underground stations with hundreds of strangers while people dropped bombs on you. \n\nThis is not a flippant point. Without a dramatic change of consciousness on the part of “ordinary” people generally, and policymakers in particular, it is impossible to imagine the sorts of sacrifices that seem necessary to achieve the “shrinkage” being considered, much less enacted as “necessary prohibitions”. \n\nGiven that any actions would also need to have a global, rather than just a national rationale, a radical change of collective direction also seems improbable, to put it delicately, especially if it involves something resembling central planning.\n\nAnd yet Herrmann argues that there is no choice other than radical and seemingly unimaginable change if we are to survive in anything like a civilised condition:\n\nThere is no alternative for the industrialised countries. Either they end growth voluntarily, or the era of growth will end violently, when everything that forms the basis of our way of life has been destroyed.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I agree. I am not a climate scientist, but I recognise that there is an intellectual division of labour that is a central component of modernity. None of us is capable of knowing everything about the increasingly complex world in which we live. But if something like 99% of climate scientists agree on the causes and likely consequences of climate change, I am happy to take their word for it. What possible basis could I have to disagree?\n\nHerrmann may not be right about everything, but she is right about enough to cause any open-minded reader to think seriously about what the future looks like, especially for younger generations who will have to deal with the decisions we make – or don’t make – today. \n\nThis is hardly a novel insight. But it is striking that, for all our real understanding about the nature of the unprecedented challenge we collectively face, there is still an equally remarkable unwillingness or inability to act.\n\nLike many before her, Herrmann thinks that salvation could come from “below”, because “parties do not lead their voters, they follow them”. But given what is currently happening in the United States and elsewhere, the durability of democracy itself is uncertain. In a world where democracy is already in retreat, the environmental emergencies that will inevitably increase without meaningful action could make authoritarian responses even more likely.\n\nStill, what do I care? I’m a baby boomer with no kids. I live in one of the wealthiest, safest places on Earth. In Western Australia, we don’t even care about the rest of the country, let alone the rest of the world. Local politicians are planning to make an even bigger contribution to destroying the planet than we already do, because Woodside Energy wants to speed up the approval process for the controversial North West Shelf project. Good to know who’s running the state, at least.\n\nIt might have been useful if Herrmann had given a bit more attention to the politics of self-absorption or the slightly optimism-inducing literature on “degrowth”. \n\nThese are minor criticisms of what is a significant contribution to the literature on the climate crisis, though I fear The End of Capitalism may only be read by an already sympathetic audience. This remains a seemingly insurmountable obstacle faced by would-be reformers. I know it is considered de rigueur to strike an optimistic note when concluding discussions of this sort, but it is not easy, and may be dishonest. \n\nThere is no doubt that unmitigated climate change and environmental degradation will transform our lives and the political systems that circumscribe them. By the time they do, it may be too late to do anything useful, other than keep a lid on social breakdown. It won’t necessarily be the end of the world, but it may be the end of any human civilisation worthy of the name.","summary":"Ulrike Herrmann argues we no longer have the time to wait for technological breakthroughs that might solve the climate crisis.","url":"https://theconversation.com/the-end-of-capitalism-or-the-end-of-civilisation-the-choice-could-be-that-stark-250922","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/654693/original/file-20250312-68-rylhlx.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C248%2C5176%2C2584&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:44:30","author":"Adjunct professor,Australia-China Relations Institute,Mark Beeson,University of Technology Sydney","authors":["Adjunct professor","Australia-China Relations Institute","Mark Beeson","University of Technology Sydney"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.127},{"id":299577460,"title":"Albanese urges everyday Aussies to take matters into their own hands and retaliate against Trump's unjust tariffs","text":"Albanese urges everyday Aussies to take matters into their own hands and retaliate against Trump's unjust tariffs\n\nREAD MORE: Trump's brutal snub as Albo frantically tries to overturn US tariffs\n\nPODCAST: Trump’s tariff whiplash, Trudeau’s tears, and Hunter Biden’s ‘sugar brother’ – on the latest episode of Welcome to MAGAland\n\nBy MAX AITCHISON, POLITICAL REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 23:41 GMT, 12 March 2025 | Updated: 23:43 GMT, 12 March 2025\n\nAnthony Albanese has encouraged his countrymen and women to 'buy Australian' in retaliation against Donald Trump's punitive steel and aluminium tariffs. \n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed on Wednesday morning that Australia would not be exempt from the 25 per cent tariffs - as it had been during Trump's first term.\n\nThe Prime Minister ruled out imposing 'revenge' tariffs on the US because he claimed they were a form of 'economic self-harm' that was ultimately 'paid for by the consumers'.\n\nBut he did suggest a novel way in which Australians could fight back - and called on them to 'back Team Australia'. \n\n'One of the things that we can do is to buy Australian.

retrieve stuck astronauts","text":"SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming of U.S. astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have been stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.\n\nSpaceX called off the flight over a last-minute technical issue with the rocket's launchpad, officials said on a livestream of the launch countdown.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the next launch opportunity would be. The reason for the scrub suggests that SpaceX and NASA could try to launch again in the coming days.\n\nNASA had been set to launch a SpaceX rocket from Florida carrying a replacement crew for the International Space Station in a mission that would set up the return to Earth of Wilmore and Williams - stuck in space for nine months after a trip on Boeing's faulty Starliner.\n\nThe U.S. space agency had moved up the mission by two weeks after President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, called for Wilmore and Williams to be brought back earlier than NASA had planned.\n\nA planned eight-day stay on the orbiting station has dragged on for Wilmore and Williams, a pair of veteran astronauts and U.S. Navy test pilots. Starliner returned to Earth without them last year.\n\nSpaceX's rocket had been scheduled to blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral at 7:48 p.m. ET (2348 GMT) with a crew of two U.S. astronauts and one astronaut each from Japan and Russia.\n\nWilmore and Williams have been working on research and maintenance with the space station's other astronauts and have remained safe, according to NASA. Williams told reporters in a March 4 call that she is looking forward to seeing her family and pet dogs upon returning home.\n\n\"It's been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" Williams said of her family. \"We're here, we have a mission - we're just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nThe flight, known as Crew-10, normally would be considered a routine astronaut rotation. Instead, it has become entangled in politics as Trump and Musk have sought - without offering evidence - to blame former President Joe Biden for the delayed return of Wilmore and Williams.\n\nThe demands by Trump and Musk for an earlier return were an unusual intervention in NASA's human spaceflight operations. The mission previously had a target date of March 26, but NASA swapped a delayed SpaceX capsule with a different one that would be ready sooner.\n\nWhen the new crew arrives aboard the station, Wilmore and Williams and two others - NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov - can return to Earth in a capsule that has been attached to the station since September, as part of the prior Crew-9 mission.\n\nWilmore and Williams cannot leave until the new Crew-10 craft arrives in order to keep the ISS staffed with enough U.S. astronauts for maintenance, according to NASA.\n\nWilmore and Williams flew to the station in June as the first test crew of Boeing's Starliner, which suffered propulsion system issues in space. NASA deemed it too risky for the astronauts to fly home on the Boeing craft. This led to the current plan to bring them home in a SpaceX capsule.\n\nBoeing built Starliner under a $4.5 billion contract with NASA to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which since 2020 has been the U.S. space agency's only vehicle for sending ISS crew members to orbit from American soil. Last year's mission had marked Starliner's first test flight with astronauts aboard, a requirement before NASA could certify the capsule for routine astronaut missions.\n\nStarliner's development has been plagued with engineering issues and cost overruns since 2019, putting it far behind SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which was developed under a similar NASA contract worth at least $4 billion.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"SpaceX on Wednesday scrubbed the expected launch of a replacement crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station that would have set in motion the long-awaited homecoming…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/spacex-scrubs-astronaut-flight-that-was-to-retrieve-stuck-astronauts","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/d5/83/4d9015e3ff63ceb209365eb9c6a41016043b/tagreuters/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:36:25","author":"Japan Today Editor,Joey Roulette","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Joey Roulette"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.584},{"id":299575080,"title":"Federal Judge Orders Trump Administration to Pay Foreign-Aid Contracts for Finished Work","text":"A federal judge has ordered the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to make foreign-aid payments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for completed work, but gave administration officials some limited authority in deciding how money will be spent moving forward.\n\nTrump issued an executive order on his first day in office to halt spending for most foreign-aid programs established through Congress. Several Catholic NGOs that do humanitarian work overseas — including Catholic Relief Services and Jesuit Relief Services — immediately lost access to funds and subsequently laid off thousands of workers.\n\nAlthough NGOs must be paid for work they have already completed, the court order does not guarantee that any of those specific organizations will receive additional funds moving forward.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, ordered the administration to pay about $2 billion for work that was finished before Feb. 13. He ordered the government to make 1,200 payments over a four-day period, which is about 300 payments per day.\n\nHowever, Ali wrote in his order that the court intends to avoid “dictating operational decisions” and will not prevent the executive branch from reviewing or terminating individual contracts. He wrote that the court “is mindful of limitations on its own authority” and will not grant any requests from NGOs that “would unnecessarily entangle the court in supervision of discrete or ongoing executive decisions.”\n\n“The court must be careful that any relief it grants does not itself intrude on the prerogative of [the executive] branch,” Ali ruled.\n\nAlthough Ali granted the executive branch discretion on how foreign aid money appropriated by Congress will be spent, the order put significant restrictions on Trump’s plan to completely end spending on 83% of programs run by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nCourts have the authority to resolve “disputes between Congress and the president over foreign policy power,” the order states, and adds the Constitution “explicitly vests in Congress the power to spend” and the administration has not cited “any precedent or history allowing the president to dictate whether to spend foreign aid for the statutory purposes here.” \n\n“The executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress’s exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place,” Ali wrote.\n\n“The constitutional power over whether to spend foreign aid is not the president’s own — and it is Congress’s own,” he added.\n\nFor this reason, Ali found that Trump likely exceeded his executive authority in violation of the separation of powers because “the appropriations laws reflect an exercise of Congress’s own, core constitutional power to determine whether and how much money is spent.”\n\nThe order states that the administration must stop “unlawfully impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.” It adds that the administration must spend the foreign aid money in a way consistent with the rules set by Congress. \n\nApart from the broad mandate that the administration must act according to Congress’s intent, the order does not provide any specific mandates on what entities should receive the funds, where the money should go, or when the government must spend it.\n\nCatholic NGOs that had contracts terminated or suspended might not receive any more foreign aid funds from the United States during Trump’s term unless the president changes course and revives the old contracts or decides to enter into new partnerships with those organizations.\n\nBoth sides have the opportunity to appeal the court order.","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-pay-foreign-aid-contracts","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20230206110232_c9ce6bd4128062ed1504dc56eb1d9ea92810c446fd25fcba11d6ba74c15e81dc.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:32:43","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":299587074,"title":"SAD! Despite DOGE's drastic cuts, federal spending is up","text":"President Donald Trump and multibillionaire Elon Musk have justified the chaotic and cruel federal cuts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency by claiming that they’re saving taxpayers money.\n\n“We’ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things,” Trump said during his rambling address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. \n\nAnd in February, he even claimed that he would send checks to taxpayers worth 20% of DOGE’s savings.\n\nHowever, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s February Monthly Budget Review found that spending is actually higher than it was last year, with the federal government spending $605 billion in February 2025 compared to about $567 billion in February 2024.\n\n\"The federal government incurred a deficit of $308 billion in February 2025, CBO estimates—$11 billion more than the deficit recorded last February,\" the report said.\n\nSupposedly in the name of cost savings, Trump and Musk have fired thousands of federal employees—many of them veterans—with tens of thousands of more cuts planned in the coming months. \n\nTrump and Musk have also virtually shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development and canceled billions in government grants for everything from food assistance and medical research funding to climate change projects and more.\n\nYet those cuts have not made even a dent in federal spending, and instead have endangered national security and public health and threatened to send the country into a devastating recession.\n\n\"No sign DOGE significantly cut spending or the deficit in February according to CBO. Federal outlays grew 7% compared to last year and the deficit grew 5%,\" Brendan Duke, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities wrote on X.\n\nThe fact that DOGE’s cuts haven't actually saved taxpayers any money is likely why Musk said he's now coming for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which make up the majority of the roughly $7 trillion annual federal budget. \n\nThe CBO report found that the government spent $7 billion more on Social Security payments and $6 billion more on Medicare payments than it did in February 2024. \n\nThe government also spent $7 billion more on interest, $15 billion more on refundable tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, and $4 billion more on the Department of Homeland Security—which is carrying out Trump’s mass deportation plans.\n\n“Most of the federal spending is entitlements. So that’s the big one to eliminate. That’s the sort of half trillion, maybe six, $700 billion,” Musk said in an interview with Fox Business host and Trump toady Larry Kudlow. \n\nAlready there's been backlash to Trump and Musk's DOGE cuts, with angry voters showing up at GOP lawmakers' town hall meetings across the country. Republican leadership even told their members to stop holding town halls altogether to avoid any negative interactions that could be used against them in ads leading up to the 2026 midterms.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, backlash to cuts is exactly why the Trump administration is using DOGE, which is not an official government organization, to make the cuts rather than rely on Congress, where lawmakers are often afraid to cut programs that could lose them reelection.\n\n“Some members of the Trump administration got frustrated that Congress won’t cut spending and decided to go around them,” Jessica Reidl, an economic policy expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute, said. \n\nBoth Social Security and Medicare have overwhelming support from voters, and they are critical to the lives of senior and disabled Americans. So if Musk follows through on these cuts, backlash is likely to grow exponentially.","summary":"President Donald Trump and multibillionaire Elon Musk have justified the chaotic and cruel federal cuts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency by claiming that they’re saving taxpayers money.\n\n\n\n“We’ve taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things,” Trump said during his rambling address to a joint session of Congress earlier this month. \n\n\n\nAnd in February, he even claimed that he would send checks to taxpayers worth 20% of DOGE’s savings.\n\n\n\nHowever, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s February Monthly Budget Review found that spending is actually higher than it was last year, with the federal government spending $605 billion in February 2025 compared to about $567 billion in February 2024.\n\n\n\n\"The federal government incurred a deficit of $308 billion in February 2025, CBO estimates—$11 billion more than the deficit recorded last February,\" the report said.\n\n\n\nSupposedly in the name of cost savings, Trump and Musk have fired thousands of federal employ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/3/12/2309727/-SAD-Despite-DOGE-s-drastic-cuts-federal-spending-is-up?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1408138/story_image/AP25048803090764.jpg?1741812719","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:30:18","author":"Emily Singer","authors":["Emily Singer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.368},{"id":299574336,"title":"Maine Rep Who Was Censured for Posting About Transgender Athlete Sues House Speaker","text":"When a lawmaker in Maine posted a photo of a male high school athlete winning a girls pole vault state championship, her House colleagues silenced her. Now, she’s taking legal action. \n\nLess than two weeks after Maine Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Auburn, posted the photo on Facebook, the Maine House of Representatives voted 75-70 to censure her for posting the photo of the minor, meaning she can no longer speak or vote in the Legislature until she apologizes. \n\nThe post included photos of the male athlete from both a boys pole vault competition a couple of years ago and the girls pole vault championship this year. “Two years ago, John tied for 5th place in boys pole vault,” Libby said in the post. “Tonight, ‘Katie’ won 1st place in the girls Maine State Class B Championship.” \n\nLibby told the Daily Signal she will not apologize for the post. She filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Maine Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau, a Democrat, for the censure, claiming it violates her First Amendment right of free speech as well as her equal protection rights and the guarantee clause of Article IV of the Constitution, which protects the basic rights of political participation within state governments. \n\n“I have the constitutional right to speak out, and my constituents have the right to full representation in the Maine House,” Libby said in a statement shared with The Daily Signal. “Biological males have no place in girls sports. Our girls have every right, under federal law, to fair competition in sports. We will not let them be erased by the Democrat majority advancing a woke progressive agenda.” \n\nFecteau told Libby after the censure vote to keep kids out of the political fray. \n\n“Sharing images of kids online without their consent is a clear violation of the bond of trust and respect between citizens and their legislators,” Fecteau said in a press release, citing the Maine legislative code of ethics. “There is a time and place for policy debates. That time and place will never be a social media post attacking a Maine student. Maine kids, and all Maine people, deserve better.” \n\nFecteau deleted his X account shortly after issuing the censure and did not respond to The Daily Signal’s request for comment. \n\nHigh school senior and Maine native Casey Carlisle, a three-time varsity athlete, said she disagreed with Libby’s use of the photo but supported her efforts to protect girls sports. Carlisle is speaking up in her own right to protect girls sports after losing a Nordic skiing qualifier race to a “transgender” athlete last year. \n\n“To watch them finish the race and pass me was so defeating,” Carlisle told The Daily Signal, recalling the moment she saw the male pass her while climbing a hill toward the finish line. “It was like everything I had worked for was worth nothing in that moment.” \n\nProponents of women’s sports should continue to treat transgender individuals with respect while addressing the issue, Carlisle said, because the transgender athletes are competing in categories in which they have been told they are allowed to compete. \n\n“Our government should never have allowed it to get to that point,” Carlisle said. \n\nLibby insisted on social media that she broke no laws with her post and that the censure had more to do with the Maine Legislature’s support for transgenderism than with the ethics of posting the photo and name of a minor. She told The Daily Signal the censure is an attack on her right to free speech. \n\nCarlisle said as a female athlete, she is grateful to Libby. Somebody needed to say something so others could speak up, she said. \n\nThe incident escalated after Democrat Gov. Janet Mills told President Donald Trump her state will not implement his executive order that directs federal agencies to ensure entities that receive federal funding, such as schools and universities, do not allow males to play in female sports. \n\nIn a press briefing last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about Libby and Mills and said “the president won’t back down” on keeping males out of female sports. \n\nAs Libby’s story goes viral online, locals have shown support for her and the protection of girls sports, Steve Robinson, the editor-in-chief of local news site Maine Wire, told The Daily Signal. “I have felt an outpouring of support from folks in the state on this issue, and it very much follows what I’ve seen online,” Libby said. “The majority of people are supportive of not just me but of Maine girls and their rights. Their rights are the ones being infringed here so massively. … People just needed to see an example.”","summary":"When a lawmaker in Maine posted a photo of a male high school athlete winning a girls pole vault state championship, her House colleagues silenced...

If there's one thing Aussies love, it's free cash - but it will come at a cost to the budget.\n\nNo wonder the Opposition moved so quickly to support Labor's recent decision to increase Medicare funding by $8.5billion over the next four years.\n\nThe contest for government is always a two-horse race, which is why the closer polling day gets, more often than not the government narrows any deficit in the polls it faced during its three-year term in power.\n\nThe public is always happy to kick a government when it's performing poorly, and the Albanese government has been especially bad for a new first-term government. Bad polls ahead of an election only register voter dissatisfaction with the government, but they don't necessarily amount to voters changing their minds.\n\nWhen elections draw closer they focus voters' minds on the alternative, and the indications right now are that forced to choose between Labor and the Coalition, enough of the electorate is concerned about making a switch.\n\nIt's a bit like a football supporter who is unimpressed with how their team is performing during the season. Once game day arrives, however down and out they might feel about their own team, they still barrack for them over the other mob.\n\nOne term governments traditionally get a second chance, which is why no first-term government has lost a bid for re-election since 1931. The public, wary of the alternative, sticks with the incumbent, albeit reluctantly.\n\nWhen you throw in that voters are overwhelmingly in favour of a spending spree, even if it puts upward pressure on interest rates later in the year, it doesn't leave Peter Dutton and the Coalition much room to move once the campaign starts.\n\nBack Labor's spending and the Coalition is as fiscally reckless as they are. Oppose it and they risk the wrath of a public searching for handouts to help alleviate cost of living pressures.\n\nLabor slowly and steadily getting itself back in the electoral contest is reminiscent of what played out at the Aston and Dunkley by-elections that were held since the last general election in 2022.\n\nOn both occasions Labor was trailing according to published polls, courtesy of its poor mid-term performance. But as the by-elections drew closer and the two party contest became a reality, protest sentiments waned too and Labor won both seats.\n\nA similar result nationally is now looking likely at the federal election, as the public takes a closer look at the Coalition and determines that sticking with the devil they know (Labor and Albanese) is the lesser of evils compared with returning the Coalition to power so soon after Scott Morrison's defeat.\n\nLabor is strongly of the view that Dutton will be a drag on the Coalition vote, which explains why it has ramped up personal attacks directed at the Opposition Leader in recent weeks. This has included paid advertising as well as scripted lines delivered by MPs doing media.\n\nWhether the assumption is accurate or not, and irrespective of the drag on Labor's vote we know Anthony Albanese continues to be, the simple fact is that the new polling tells us plenty of voters still have doubts about the party they kicked out of government just three years ago.\n\nWhen you look at the Coalition's parliamentary ranks it hasn't renewed, or particularly addressed, gender inequity, and beyond the big target nuclear policy (which has its problems) there isn't much of an alternative policy vision either.\n\nAll of which adds up to a second Labor term, a point I have been making for many months now. Even if a minority Labor government requiring the support of the Greens remains the most likely alternative to electing Dutton as PM.\n\nAway from what 80 per cent approval for more spending in the Federal Budget says about Labor's political chances at the election, it's a dangerous phenomenon for the nation financially.\n\nAs Donald Trump risks a global recession with some of his policy decisions, the last thing we need is for Australia to be saddled with growing debt and higher recurrent expenditure baked into the budget.\n\nEspecially if it risks halting the downward trajectory of interest rates later in the year - a point the RBA has made on several occasions.\n\nA high interest rate recession with ballooning spending serving debt is a diabolical mix. If unemployment starts to rise, as it's forecast to do, the consequences could be catastrophic.\n\nBut election years rarely result in politicians putting such concerns first. Instead, they pander to public sentiment to win votes, and right now the public supports handouts to help alleviate home budgets under stress.\n\nThat's understandable human nature, but it's also short sighted, and the damage it might do to the economy will be eventually felt.\n\nBy then, however, the new spending will be locked in and Labor will have won the election. Potentially with bipartisan support for many of its spending promises, assuming the Opposition isn't courageous enough to taken them (and public opinion) on.","summary":"The reality of the election showdown ultimately becoming a two-horse race appears to be setting in for the Coalition.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14484319/PVO-Albanese-election-cash-splash.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/23/96134337-0-image-m-12_1741821444368.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-12 23:22:38","author":"Editor,Peter van Onselen","authors":["Editor","Peter van Onselen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.402}]}
