A basket of defense stocks rose 1.7%, following heavy air raids on Kyiv and assaults on southern Russian areas. A US official was due to meet a Russian delegation in Abu Dhabi as President Donald Trump cited progress on his peace proposal.Mining and energy shares outperformed, while autos as well as travel and leisure sectors lagged. European stocks gained on Monday following dovish Federal Reserve comments, as Governor Christopher Waller said he’s advocating an interest-rate cut in December. Traders will be watching a slew of retail sales and consumer confidence data later today for signs on where the monetary policy is moving next. “The Fed has a tradition of giving visibility to investors when it comes to interest rates decision and the volatility that we are witnessing currently is a reflection of its absence,” Raphael Thuin, head of capital market strategies at Tikehau Capital. “The lack of visibility on the Fed’s next move could be a big risk this year and for 2026 too.” In individual stocks, Kingfisher Plc jumped as much as 6.9% after the home improvement company boosted profit guidance.

Bush declared that the turkey presented to him would be spared.Bush famously remarked, “This guy will not end up on anyone’s dinner table… he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now.”Since that official proclamation, 60 turkeys have been pardoned.Public picks the namesThe public also participates through an annual naming poll.

His move caused confusion because it is the National Nuclear Security Administration, a branch of the Energy Department, that would carry out explosive nuclear weapons tests. \n\n\"Even one small U.S. nuclear test would give Russia and China the green light to conduct many large nuclear tests that would be much more useful for the development of new nuclear weapons that could pose a threat to U.S. national security,\" Markey wrote in a letter to Trump. \n\nMarkey, a co-chair of the Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group with members in the Senate and House of Representatives, has been a longtime leader of non-proliferation efforts in Congress. He had pushed Trump in 2020, during his first presidential term, against resuming explosive nuclear weapons tests. \n\nThe White House reiterated on Tuesday that the testing process will begin \"immediately\" and that Trump had instructed his administration to do it \"because of other countries' testing programs.\" \n\nTrump would like to see denuclearization, but he feels the action is appropriate to \"maintain a strong, credible and effective nuclear deterrent,\" a White House official said. \n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe said on social media on November 3 that Trump \"is right\" about other countries testing nuclear weapons. \n\nIn response to Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his top officials to draft proposals for a possible test of nuclear weapons, something Moscow has not done since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nTrump has suggested that Russia and China are conducting small nuclear tests that are hard to detect, known as hydronuclear tests, in violation of U.S. policy and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Markey said in the letter. \n\n\"Reports of such tests from 2019 raise concerns, but they are unconfirmed,\" Markey said. \"Even if true, they would not justify renewed U.S. nuclear testing.\"\n\nMarkey asked Trump for evidence by December 15 that Russia and China are conducting secret nuclear tests. He also asked Trump whether his statements reflect a misunderstanding of the difference between missile tests and nuclear explosive tests.

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccording to Turner, law enforcement personnel stand ready to assist with any complaints received through the hotline or website. The activity is coordinated with assistance from the FBI, the Department of Justice, and state and local partners.\n\nHe encouraged public housing residents to make use of the reporting platforms.\n\n“We'll clean up our public housing so that they can fulfill their function of sanctuaries for the most vulnerable people in our country, where American citizens can get a temporary hand up and then gain independence from government help,” the Housing secretary said, adding that the department wanted to assist American citizens specifically.\n\n“Illegal aliens have no place in public housing. It’s outrageous that people who should not be here come across our borders, and now usurp spots and housing units that support American people.\n\n“Establishing this hotline is an important step in fighting this injustice for both the people of Memphis and for Americans nationwide.”\n\nTurner said the hotline was part of President Donald Trump’s effort to make the city safe again, which includes the Memphis Safe Task Force. The task force was set up following a Sept. 15 directive from Trump that ordered the National Guard and government agencies to assist in restoring law and order in Memphis.\n\nMore than 3,000 violent fugitives have so far been arrested by the task force since the operation began in October, Turner said. This includes more than 300 known gang members and up to 12 homicide suspects.\n\nAn estimated 6.8 million Americans rely on public housing assistance, based on data from the National Center for Health in Public Housing (NCHPH).\n\nAccording to a September 2020 report from NCHPH, crime rates are higher in areas where Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC) Health Centers are located than the national average. These centers provide medical services to patients living in public housing or in close proximity to it.\n\n“There is an average of 505 violent crimes per 100,000 population in PHPC Health Center counties compared to the national average of 386 per 100,000,” the report reads.\n\nMixed-Status Families\n\nTrump signed an executive order in February ordering agencies to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”\n\nFollowing the executive order, Turner issued a letter to HUD grant recipients and stakeholders in April, informing them that federal housing assistance benefits will no longer be granted to illegal immigrants.\n\nthe letter reads.\n\nMeanwhile, in a Sept. 15 post, policy research group Urban Institute raised concerns about how HUD’s policies would affect mixed-status families in which members have varied immigration statuses.\n\nThe institute said that fewer than 1 percent of households receiving housing assistance are mixed-status and that the “HUD’s data request will have dire consequences” on this group, including psychological distress, financial hardship, and harm to children’s development.\n\nHUD said in a Nov. 21 statement that it has supported housing affordability for more than 1 million Americans this year.\n\nSince January 2025, the Federal Housing Administration, an agency under HUD, has insured mortgages for more than 700,000 homebuyers and refinance borrowers, which includes first-time homebuyers and senior citizens, it said.\n\nDuring this period, the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, has supported more than 430,000 Veterans Affairs loans, HUD said, adding that nearly a third of these loans went to first-time homebuyers.\n\nTurner said in a statement.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/hud-launches-hotline-crack-down-crime-illegal-immigrants-public-housing","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/image%20-%202025-11-25T103742.889.jpg?itok=hr1cr_9I","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 01:05:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.046},{"id":382238982,"title":"Takaichi’s gamble: Japan is trying to escape the debt trap","text":"Japan’s bond yields have been hitting decades-long highs.

US Economist makes BIG statement against India, alleges massive fraud of…, says 71 percent…","text":"The H-1B visa program is currently drawing considerable attention as an increasingly controversial subject in the American political arena regarding both Immigration and Employment. Initially intended to fill a skills gap in the workforce with skilled foreign labour this program has developed into substantial amounts of discussion regarding whether it is economical fair fraudulent or detrimental to US interests. The debate has intensified to such an extent that even top leaders appear divided. While US President Donald Trump defended the H-1B visa programme Vice President JD Vance seems to adopt a contrasting view. Former US House Representative and economist Dave Brat has made a bold statement against India. Read the detailed story below.\nDave Brat a former US House Representative and economist Dave Brat has singled out India concerning H-1B abuse and fraud. He claims that an Indian district is responsible for flooding the H-1B system with approximately 220000 applications approximately two-and-a-half times beyond their national allocation. Brat made this remark at a time when the Trump administration is intensifying its action on H-1B visas.\nDuring a conversation on Steve Bannons podcast Brat said When you hear H-1B think of your family because these fraudulent visas just stole their future.\nIn an episode of Steve Bannons War Room podcast Representative Brat discussed how he believed the H-1B system had been captured by industrial-scale fraud in part because visa allocations to India have exceeded statutory limits.\nHe stated that 71% of H-1B visas are issued to India while 12% are issued to China. Additionally he claimed that one Indian district Madras(Chennai) somehow managed to secure 2.5 times the annual congressional limit of 85000 H-1B Visas (a total of 220000) which he views as solid evidence of widespread fraud in the H-1B program.\n71 per cent of H-1B visas come from India and only 12 per cent from China. That tells you somethings going on right there Brat was quoted as saying by India Today. Furthermore he addedTheres a cap of only 85000 H-1B visas yet somehow one district in India -- the Madras (Chennai) district -- got 220000. Thats 2.5 times the cap Congress has set. So thats the scam.\nBrat is framing the situation as a direct attack on American workers. When one of these folks comes over and claims theyre skilled -- theyre not thats the fraud. Theyre taking away your familys job your mortgage your house all of that.\nIn 2024 the US Consulate in Chennai India processed approximately 220000 H-1B visa applications as well as 140000 new H-4 dependents according to media reports. The largest volume of applications processed by the consulate came from 4 different states in India (Tamil Nadu Karnataka Kerala and Telangana) which makes the Chennai US Consulate one of the busiest US H-1B processing centres in the entire world.\nThe allegations made earlier by Mahvash Siddiqui an Indian-American Foreign Service Officer who worked in the Chennai consulate nearly two decades ago have resurfaced as a result of this new report. In an interview Siddiqui claimed that the H-1B visa program was plagued with instances of counterfeit documents and fabricated qualifications with many applicants working through intermediaries.\nAccording to Siddiqui she said she had processed at least 51000 non-immigrant visas between 2005 and 2007 the majority of them H-1Bs. In her opinion approximately 80-90% of all the H-1B visa applicants from India had presented false degrees fake credentials or applications from less-than-highly-skilled workers.\nIn September this year President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation titled ‘Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers’ as an important initial step to reform the H-1B nonimmigrant visa programme.\nUnder the Proclamation certain H-1B petitions filed after September 21 2025 must be accompanied by an additional USD 100000 payment as a condition of eligibility. Meanwhile an American lawmaker will be introducing a bill to “completely eliminate” the H-1B visa programme and take away the pathway to citizenship that it offers “forcing” individuals to “return home” when their visa expires as per news agency PTI report.","summary":"Brat made this remark at a time when the Trump administration is intensifying its action on H-1B visas.","url":"https://www.india.com/news/world/220000-h1b-visas-for-one-indian-district-us-economist-dave-brat-big-statement-against-india-alleges-massive-fraud-over-h1visa-program-71-percent-visa-india-madras-chennai-district-2-5-times-cap-8200793/","image":"https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/title-2025-11-26T062701.470.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 01:00:56","author":"Sumaila Zaman","authors":["Sumaila Zaman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":382240906,"title":"Federal judge says immigration officers in Colorado can only arrest those at risk of fleeing","text":"By COLLEEN SLEVIN\n\nDENVER (AP) — A federal judge ruled Tuesday that immigration officers in Colorado can only arrest people without a warrant if they think those people are likely to flee.\n\nU.S. District Senior Judge R.

Email rory.tingle@dailymail.co.uk \nBy RORY TINGLE, HOME AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT \n Published:00:57 GMT, 26 November 2025 |Updated:00:57 GMT, 26 November 2025 \n\nYou're walking along a busy street when a text pops up on your phone. So far, so ordinary - but the reality could be far darker. \nFraudsters are increasingly targeting commuters using portable transmitters known as 'SMS blasters', a new report warns today. \nThese devices, which can send out mass messages to all phones nearby, are usually driven in vehicles through heavily populated areas of cities like London. \nThe texts purport to be from legitimate organisations and seek to persuade people to reveal their confidential private or banking details - a method dubbed 'smishing'. \nSMS blasters are enabling 'mass fraud at scale', according to Combatting Cybercrime against Mobile Devices, a new report by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). \nAuthor Joseph Jarnecki told the Mail they allowed criminals to target people without having to know their number and can also bypass operators' network monitoring.\nHe described the method as proof of the increasingly sophisticated nature of mobile phone scams, which he says 'pose a rising threat to national security'. \nChinese student Ruichen Xiong, 22, was jailed in June after he was caught driving around London with an SMS blaster in the boot of his black Honda CR-V. \nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe machines work by tricking nearby handsets into thinking it is a phone mast by appearing to have a stronger signal than nearby legitimate ones. \nBy doing so, the criminal is then able to send a text message to the victim's phone. \nXiong was able to send texts to tens of thousands of potential victims between March 22 and 27. \nThe messages purported to be from HMRC, with each user told to click on a link and enter their personal details in order to 'claim a tax refund'. \nXiong, who lived in Bow, East London, pleaded guilty to fraud by representation and was sentenced to 58 weeks in prison at Inner London Crown Court.\nAnother offender, 31-year-old Kong Ji Chen, took an SMS blaster with him during a rush hour Tube journey. \nInner London Crown Court heard how, at 5.30pm on Tuesday, July 1, a member of the public received a spam text message while travelling on the Victoria Line.\nThe text claimed to be from Parcel Mail and invited them to click on a link to update their personal details in order to receive a package. \nThe commuter was familiar with SMS blasters and grew suspicious of Chen when he noticed him loitering on the platform with a large suitcase and not getting onto any trains. \n\nRuichen Xiong, 22, was jailed in June after he was caught driving around London with an SMS blaster in the boot of his black Honda CR-V\n\nA photo of the device, which tricked nearby handsets into thinking it is a phone mast by appearing to have a stronger signal than nearby legitimate ones\n\n Fraudster who posed as a police officer to steal £27,000 of cash and jewellery from pensioner's home \nPolice arrested Chen outside Victoria station and opened his large green suitcase to find a portable battery attached to an electrical unit with a green flashing light and a black antenna. \nWhile the spammer was in custody, an officer checked his phone and saw that he had received the same spam text. \nFurther investigation found there had been 165 spam reports to mobile providers about the same message from the same number. \nChen was jailed for 24 weeks on October 15. \nIn his report, published today, RUSI's Joseph Jarnecki linked a rise in mobile phone-related fraud to organised cybercriminal networks. \nHe said other crimes, such as romance scams, have become 'lucrative and widespread'. \nMr Jarnecki also warned of malicious mobile phone apps that can 'harvest user data and credentials, display unwanted advertisements, conduct click fraud and spoof mobile banking sessions'.\n\nAnother offender, 31-year-old Kong Ji Chen, took an SMS blaster with him during a rush hour Tube journey \nThe researcher made a series of recommendations to policymakers, including advising competition regulators to 'account for cyber security' when making decisions and working with app stores to improve security.\nAlongside texts, scammers also continue to target victims using calls, with fraudsters now accounting for more than half of calls made to landlines, according to one report.\nData suggests that fourth fifths of people aged 65 and over continue to rely on their landline telephone - suggesting criminals are deliberately targeting the elderly.\nWith so many complaints about nuisance calls, many people have stopped answering the phone altogether. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe commuter mobile phone scam targeting your bank details: Warning as fraudsters use hidden 'SMS blasters' to blitz thousands of devices with spam text messages\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

The ruling follows his conviction for attempting to cling to power after losing the 2022 election.\n\nThe court on Tuesday, rejected an appeal from Bolsonaro’s lawyers challenging the sentence and ordered him to serve his time at a federal police facility in Brasília, where he is already in custody.\n\nBolsonaro was arrested on Saturday after police said he tampered with the ankle monitor during his house arrest. He told authorities his medications caused “hallucinations” and “paranoia,” and he feared the monitor could be used to snoop on him.\n\nHis lawyers had asked the court to allow him to serve the sentence at home because of health issues from a 2018 stabbing attack. The Supreme Court denied that request after the ankle monitor incident. Bolsonaro’s team plans to submit medical evidence again once he begins serving the sentence.\n\nIn September, the Supreme Court convicted Bolsonaro and seven allies of plotting to overturn the 2022 elections and assassinate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva before he took office. Prosecutors said Bolsonaro and his inner circle spent months undermining public trust in Brazil’s election system. After losing narrowly, they tried to retain power.\n\nThe plans included dissolving the Supreme Court, annulling election results, and giving the military broad authority.\n\nBolsonaro had been under house arrest since August. Police monitored him closely because the court considered him a flight risk.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro, commented on the arrest on Saturday. “That’s too bad,” he said. Asked for more, Trump added, “No. I just think it’s too bad.”\n\nThe United States sought to target Brazil over the court case by imposing tariffs of up to 50% on certain Brazilian imports while demanding the dropping of charges against Bolsonaro.\n\nHowever, in recent days, the Trump administration eased the pressure, granting additional tariff exemptions and reviving dialogue with the Brazilian government.\n\nSource: IANS","summary":"Washington, Nov 26 (SocialNews.XYZ) Brazil’s Supreme Court ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to begin serving a 27-year prison sentence.

That date for Bailey would be December 15. \n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on X that the story was 'completely made up' and posted a photo of Trump and Patel that she said was taken in the Oval Office on Tuesday.\n\nLeavitt said Trump and Patel were in a meeting when the report was published, and the president reacted to it by laughing and saying, 'What? That's totally false. Come on Kash, let's take a picture to show them you're doing a great job!'\n\nA spokesperson for MS NOW said the news organization stands behind its reporting which describes Patel as 'on thin ice' with the change potentially happening in the next few weeks.\n\nWhen reached by The Daily Mail for comment, a spokesperson for the FBI declined comment. \n\nMost recently, it was reported Patel was outraged when a SWAT team he assigned to watch his girlfriend ditched her as she performed the national anthem at a convention for the National Rifle Association.\n\nThe 45-year-old bureau head assigned an entire SWAT team from the agency's Atlanta field office to shadow his 27-year-old girlfriend Alexis Wilkins at the NRA's annual conference in April, The New York Times reports. \n\nBut when the agents saw that the event at the Georgia World Congress Center where she was to perform was secure and that Wilkins was in no apparent danger, they left before the event was over.\n\nWhen Patel then found out what had happened, he allegedly 'ripped' into the team's commander for leaving his girlfriend unprotected and slammed the agents' dismissal as a 'failure of the chain of command.'\n\nIt was not the first time Patel used his authority to grant his aspiring country singer girlfriend extra protection, either, as he also deployed 'elite FBI agents' who typically work with the Nashville office's SWAT team to watch her in her home city.\n\nBureau officials also said agents from the tactical division in Salt Lake City, Utah were ordered to provide protective detail to Wilkins at an event in September - despite having just worked long hours following the nearby assassination of Charlie Kirk. \n\nHer new level of extensive and unusually frequent taxpayer-funded SWAT security is 'highly unusual,' current and former FBI officials have argued - noting that typically girlfriends and spouses of officials do not get that level of protection.\n\n'The assignment of SWAT-qualified agents to guard his girlfriend are indicative of his lack of leadership experience, judgment and humility,' argued Christopher O'Leary, a former Marine and FBI agent who led a team that conducted 'high-risk missions.'\n\nSome have also argued that Wilkins does not face the threats necessary for this amount of attention, and that the agents assigned to protecting the singer could be kept from responding to more serious potential crimes. \n\nIn some instances, the agents received little notice before they were dispatched to protect Wilkins, the Times reports.\n\nAgents who were dispatched to protect the country singer also told the outlet it was unclear whether they would be afforded any protection against civil liability like what other federal agents who might use deadly force as part of their official duties receive. \n\n'There is no legitimate justification for this. This is a clear abuse of position and misuse of government resources,' former senior FBI agent Christopher O'Leary told MS Now earlier this month.\n\n'She is not his spouse, does not live in the same house or even the same city.'\n\nHelen Wray, the wife of ex-FBI Director Christopher Wray, also noted she only received a security detail when she was traveling with her husband. \n\nThe bureau has also tried to defend its extensive protection for Wilkins, claiming she has faced a slew of death threats since their relationship was made public. \n\n'Ms. Wilkins is receiving a protective detail because she has faced hundreds of credible death threats related to her relationship with Director Patel, whom she has been dating for three years,' a spokesperson told the Daily Mail. \n\n'Out of respect for her safety, we will not be providing additional details.'\n\nWilkins has gone public with some of the threats she has received online, sharing screengrabs on X which she said was just 'a morning in my DMs.'\n\nThe comments include an Instagram response writing that 'you should pray to christ and end your life! You're better off in his hands than on this earth.'\n\n'You need to touch a bullet,' wrote another.\n\n'Someone needs to kidnap her,' added one more.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House stood behind Patel without making any reference to Wilkins. \n\n'FBI Director Patel is restoring integrity to the FBI and doing an excellent job implementing the President’s agenda,' Abigail Jackson told the Daily Mail.\n\nMeanwhile, Patel is also facing backlash for using his government jet to watch Wilkins perform.\n\nIt has since been revealed the FBI director also used the government plane to attend a golf outing in Scotland, in which FBI agents coordinated his transportation and security arrangements with Scottish and British authorities.\n\nThat included deploying an advance team and round the clock security personnel known as 'ravens' to guard his plane.\n\nBut Patel's spokesperson, Ben Williamson, defended him, saying the dozens of trips Patel has made since he took office in February pale in comparison to the money spent by former FBI chiefs James Comey and Christopher Wray. He also claimed Patel pays a reimbursement in advance. \n\n'He's allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend. He doesn't do it often,' Williamson said. \n\nBut when then-Director Wray used the bureau's jet for personal travel, Patel was one of his strongest critics.\n\nIn a 2023 interview, Patel even chided Wray by name, saying he did not need a 'government-funded G5 to go on vacation.'\n\nHe then suggested 'we ground that plane' or charge '$15,000 each time it takes off.","summary":"Rumors about Patel's behavior have bubbled since he took the job, from reports of partying, to using a government jet to see beau Alexis Wilkins perform to even assigning her a SWAT team.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15326617/Trump-replacing-Kash-Patel-FBI-head-Alexis-Wilkins.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/26/00/104191289-0-image-m-37_1764117807663.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 00:46:05","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

They discussed the bombshell on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, and set up talks in Geneva.\n\nThe initial draft, agreed between Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Kremlin emissary Kirill Dimitriev, involved Ukraine ceding about a fifth of its territory, including parts that Russia has failed to occupy, plus vague security guarantees and possible membership of the EU — but not of Nato. Apart from rewarding Vladimir Putin’s aggression with territorial gains and the lifting of sanctions, the plan envisaged $100 billion of frozen Russian assets being invested in Ukraine, with 50 per cent of the profits flowing to the US.\n\nDonald Trump’s hawkish secretary of state, Marco Rubio, appears to have been excluded from the initial negotiations with Moscow (just as Putin has sidelined Rubio’s Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov), but he has been front and centre of the Geneva process. Any revised plan acceptable to Kyiv and its European allies will require Moscow’s acquiescence, which will not be forthcoming. The war, which Putin has lately stepped up, will drag on.\n\nAny sustainable modus vivendi requires agreement — and concessions — from both warring sides, and particularly the aggressor. Volodymyr Zelensky, beleaguered domestically by corruption charges against some of his closest associates, might have seemed like an easy target for the White House at this juncture. Political troubles also threaten some of his most vociferous European backers (including Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron), while the continent more generally heads in a far-right direction courtesy of centrist follies.\n\n Do global institutions mean anything anymore?\n\nNotably, none of those who rallied to the Ukrainian cause found any fault with UNSC Resolution 2803, which endorses a recolonisation of Gaza and offers no obvious pathway to a Palestinian state that a bunch of European powers have only recently endorsed. Equally, none of the Arab or Muslim states queried an arrangement whereby Israel continues to control over half of the territory where it has murdered more than 70,000 Palestinians. The barbarity has not been halted, as Israel defies the ceasefire almost every day to slaughter dozens more. No Palestinians had any say in the US/ Israeli truce deal, which enables a slightly more subtle genocide — with no repercussions, 80 years after the Nuremberg trials, for the perpetrators.\n\nThe so-called rule of law in the postwar settlement that followed the anti-Nazi crusade never meant very much as the Cold War unfolded, and the demise of Palestine in 1948 enjoyed the imprimatur of the UN as well as the US and the USSR. Occasionally, one encounters a degree of nostalgia for the old order, when the battle lines were clearer. The millions of lives lost in Korea, the Congo, Malaya, Indonesia and Vietnam during that era can hardly be ignored. The post-Cold War era involved genocides in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, long before Arab states joined the renewed Western plunder of Africa. The misguided ‘war on terror’ unleashed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America, meanwhile, has left gaping wounds from Iraq to sub-Saharan Africa that have been exploited by deleterious forces.\n\nThe UN remains a worthy symbol of the postwar order’s finest achievements, but the lack of renovation over the past 80 years means it struggles to make a difference. COP30 reflects its diminished clout. The Belém conference did not crumble, \n\nbut its unsurprising failure to pinpoint a path towards the eli-mination of fossil fuels in the face of resistance from a Sa--udi-led clique serves as yet another rem-i-nder that the oil and gas aficionados who control the world’s lungs will continue to throttle them.\n\nThe US attended neither COP30 (because its leader thinks climate change is a hoax) nor the G20 (because its leader thinks South Africa is involved in an anti-white genocide, an idea ridiculed by black and white South Africans alike), and it wasn’t much missed at either venue. As lame as the outcome was at Belém, it would likely have been worse if the US had participated. And likewise in Johannesburg, even though the communique of the first G20 in Africa managed only to cobble together 122 motherhood statements with little prospect of being implemented.\n\nBeyond the fossil fuel lobbyists, the persistent COP problem is that commitments — such as those relating to adaption or amelioration funds for poorer nations — remained unfulfilled, regardless of whether they are doubled or tripled. Likewise various other global or regional promises. It seems highly unlikely that what remains of multilateralism can rescue the world, let alone components such as Palestine, Ukraine or Sudan. \n\nmahir.dawn@gmail.com\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 26th, 2025","summary":"THE arrival in Kyiv last week of an American emissary with a Russian-drafted ultimatum for the Ukrainian leadership sparked a panic among the latter’s EU/Nato allies.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials have been trying to narrow the gaps between them over Trump's plan to end Europe's deadliest and most devastating conflict since World War Two, with Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on Russian terms, including territorial concessions.In a speech to what is known as the coalition of the willing allies, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Zelenskiy urged European leaders to hash out a framework for deploying a \"reassurance force\" to Ukraine and to keep backing Kyiv for as long as Moscow showed no inclination to end its war.\"We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe ... Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work,\" Zelenskiy said, according to his speech text.\"That framework is on the table, and we're ready to move forward together - with the USA, with the personal engagement of President Trump,\" he added.U.S. TO MEET WITH PUTIN, UKRAINE SEPARATELYLater on Tuesday, Trump said on social media that negotiations had left \"only a few remaining points of disagreement.\" He said he had directed his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and his Army secretary, Dan Driscoll, to meet at the same time with Ukrainian officials. Trump gave no details of the timing of the meetings.Live Events\"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,\" he added.A Ukrainian diplomat cautioned that territorial concessions remained a major sticking point, meaning a final deal was far from certain despite accords on various specific points. \"These are really tough questions for us,\" the diplomat said.Underlining the high stakes for Ukraine, its capital Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight in a Russian attack that killed seven people and again disrupted power and heating systems. Residents were sheltering underground wearing winter jackets, some in tents.ZELENSKIY MAY RETURN TO U.S.Trump said at a White House event earlier on Tuesday he thought a deal on Ukraine was getting close, saying, \"We're going to get there.\"Zelenskiy could visit the U.S. in the next few days to finalise a deal with Trump, Kyiv's national security chief Rustem Umerov said earlier on Tuesday, though there was no immediate confirmation of such a trip from the U.S. side.Kyiv's message hinted that an intense diplomatic push by the Trump administration could be yielding some fruit, but any optimism could be short-lived, as Russia stressed it would not let any deal stray too far from its own maximum objectives.U.S. and Ukrainian negotiators held talks on the latest U.S.-backed peace plan in Geneva on Sunday. Driscoll then met on Monday and Tuesday with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, a spokesperson for Driscoll said.A Ukrainian official said Kyiv \"supports the framework's essence, and some of the most sensitive issues remain as points for the discussion between presidents.\"Oil prices extended their declines after reports of Ukraine potentially agreeing to a war-ending deal.ZELENSKIY: WILL DISCUSS SENSITIVE ISSUES WITH TRUMPU.S. policy towards the war has zigzagged in recent months.A hastily arranged summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska in August raised worries in Kyiv and European capitals that the Trump administration might accept many Russian demands, though the meeting ultimately resulted in more U.S. pressure on Russia. The 28-point plan that emerged last week caught many in the U.S. government, Kyiv and Europe alike off guard and prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow.The plan would require Kyiv to yield territory beyond the almost 20% of Ukraine that Russia has captured since its February 2022 full-scale invasion, as well as accept curbs on its military and bar it from ever joining NATO - conditions Kyiv has long rejected as tantamount to surrender. The sudden push has cranked up the pressure on Ukraine and Zelenskiy, who is now at his most vulnerable since the start of the war after a corruption scandal saw two of his ministers dismissed, and as Russia makes battlefield gains.Zelenskiy could struggle to get Ukrainians to swallow a deal viewed as selling out their interests.Zelenskiy said on Monday the process of producing a final accord would be hard. Russia's unrelenting attacks on Ukraine have left many sceptical about how peace can be achieved soon.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an amended peace plan must reflect the \"spirit and letter\" of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at their Alaska summit.\"If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation (for Russia),\" Lavrov warned.

The sales slowdown reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday followed a long stretch of gains and marked a weak handoff to the fourth quarter. Economists said a sluggish labor market, characterized by an unemployment rate at a four-year high, was making consumers more selective about purchases. That development was reinforced by a survey from the Conference Board showing consumer confidence sagged to a seven-month low in November, with fewer households planning to buy motor vehicles, houses and other big-ticket items over the next six months. There was also a decline in those who said they were making vacation plans. Economists say President Donald Trump's sweeping duties on imports have raised prices for everyday commodities, including food. \"While spending has held up over 2025 despite worsening survey readings, many consumers may have reached their limit as rising prices and labor market concerns cut spending plans, at least for the near term,\" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide. Retail sales rose 0.2% after an unrevised 0.6% gain in August, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and anot adjusted for inflation, would rise 0.4%.Live Events On a year-over-year basis, retail sales increased 4.3%. The report, originally due in mid-October, was delayed by the 43-day shutdown of the U.S. government. Part of the sales increase reflected higher prices, with receipts at service stations advancing 2.0%. Sales had accelerated in prior months, in part as consumers rushed to buy battery-powered electric motor vehicles before the expiration of EV tax credits at the end of September. Sales at auto dealerships fell 0.3%. Furniture store sales increased 0.6%, while receipts at building material and garden equipment retailers and suppliers gained 0.2%. But sales at clothing retailers dropped 0.7% while those at electronics and appliance outlets decreased 0.5%. Online store sales eased 0.7%. Consumers also cut back spending on hobbies and sporting goods. They, however, dined out and visited bars more. Sales at food services and drinking places, the only services component in the report, increased 0.7% after surging 1.0% in August. Some economists argued the strength suggested discretionary spending remained in good shape. Others noted that spending was being driven by higher-income households, with many middle-income and lower-income consumers struggling, creating what they called a K-shaped economy. Though job growth rebounded in September, the labor market is weakening, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.4%. Labor market worries pushed down the Conference Board's consumer confidence index to 88.7 this month, the lowest level since April, from 95.5 in October. CONFIDENCE DETERIORATES ACROSS THE BOARD Confidence deteriorated in nearly all income groups and across the political spectrum, with the sharpest drop among consumers who identified themselves as independents. While the correlation between consumer confidence and spending has been weak, economists said households' worsening perceptions of the labor market suggested a pullback in consumption is likely. The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 9.7 from 10.3 last month. This measure correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's monthly employment report. \"A few years ago when we had negative consumer sentiment and continued spending strength, the period was referred to as a 'vibescession.' But things are different now,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet. \"Household financial conditions are more fragile than they were a few years ago, so any fear about the future economy may be well-founded.\" Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services fell 0.1% in September after a downwardly revised 0.6% increase in August. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have advanced 0.7% in August. The dip in core retail sales did not change economists' expectations that consumer spending picked up in the third quarter. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is estimating that GDP increased at a 4.0% annualized rate last quarter. The government said on Tuesday it would release the delayed third-quarter GDP estimate on December 23. The economy grew at a 3.8% pace in the April-June quarter. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. The Conference Board survey also showed that consumers anticipated higher inflation over the next 12 months. A separate report from BLS on Tuesday showed the Producer Price Index for final demand rebounded 0.3% in September, lifted by a 3.5% jump in the cost of energy goods and a 1.1% increase in food - mostly beef, fresh fruits and grains. That reading followed a 0.1% drop in August. In the 12 months through September, the PPI increased 2.7% after advancing by the same margin in August. There was also a strong increase in airline fares. But hotel and motel rooms as well as portfolio management fees fell. They are among the components that go into the calculation of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Indexes, the measures tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% inflation target. Economists estimated that the PCE Price Index, excluding food and energy, increased 0.2% in September after rising by the same margin in August. That estimate would keep the annual increase in core PCE inflation at 2.9%. The odds of another interest rate cut from the U.S. central bank in December have risen, despite concerns among some Fed officials about inflation. \"Downward progress on inflation remains stalled, but overall this set of price data are not convincing enough to move the Fed doves concerned about downside labor market risks closer to the inflation hawks, leaving the committee split ahead of December's meeting,\" said Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onfederal reservefedcommerce departmentUS retail salesUS retail sales growthjob marketUS jobs\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onfederal reservefedcommerce departmentUS retail salesUS retail sales growthjob marketUS jobs \n\nExplore More Stories123","summary":"American shoppers bought less in September.

Since then, the $22 billion program has been scrutinized by lawmakers and top defense officials.\n\nNear the end of his first term, President Donald Trump touted the program, saying the ships were the \"most beautiful.\" He reminded the audience at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum during the 2024 Republican National Convention that the deal would bring jobs to Wisconsin.\n\n“It was a big contract that everybody wanted,” Trump said. “I gave it to Wisconsin, but we’re going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states.”\n\nBut earlier this year, Trump criticized the program due to its increasing cost and for being behind schedule. In April 2024, the Navy revealed that the first frigate — whose construction began in 2022 — was expected to be delivered three years behind its contracted April 2026 deadline, largely due to challenges in hiring an experienced workforce.\n\nFincantieri is building the first two ships in the class, Constellation (FFG-62) and Congress (FFG-63), and Phelan said construction on those vessels will continue.

While Reuters could not determine the size of the contracts, a July Pentagon presentation seen by Reuters suggested awards for interceptor contracts would be about $120,000 each.The contracts have not yet been publicly announced, though a Space Force spokesperson confirmed the awards, declining to name the contractors. The spokesperson said that contracts under $9 million do not need to be publicly disclosed.Winners of these initial awards will compete for final production contracts that could be worth tens of billions of dollars.Live EventsThe contracts will fund the development of competing prototypes for phase interceptors that will shoot down a missile as it enters space, and the fire control stations to coordinate the signals from satellites and help interceptors launch and find their targets.The Space Force awarded Northrop Grumman and Anduril contracts valued at $10 million, according to values printed in the July Pentagon presentation, the sources said.Names of the companies that won contracts in both these award pools have not previously been reported.

That process often starts with a third party – usually the United Nations – referring them to the US refugee admissions programme.\n\nThen, US immigration authorities rigorously vet the applicants, who must show they faced persecution for their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership in a particular social group.\n\nSharif Aly, the president of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), said refugees are the most highly vetted immigrants in the country.\n\n“This order is one more in a long line of efforts to bully some of the most vulnerable members of our communities, by threatening their lawful status, rendering them vulnerable to the egregious conduct of immigration enforcement agencies, and putting them through an onerous and potentially re-traumatizing process,” Aly said in a statement.\n\nMark Hetfield, president of the humanitarian organisation HIAS, called the Trump administration’s move “unnecessary, cruel and wasteful”. His group assists new refugees in the US.\n\n“Refugees have already been more vetted than any other group of immigrants,” Hetfield told Reuters.\n\nTrump drastically reduced refugee admission during his first term and all but gutted the programme after his return to the White House in January.\n\nThe second Trump administration set a historic low of ​7,500 as the refugee admission cap for next year.\n\nThe president also ordered the programme to “primarily” resettle white South Africans, whom he says are facing discrimination by their government.\n\nOverall, Trump has pushed to restrict new arrivals to the US and crack down on noncitizens in the country.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/trump-administration-to-retroactively-vet-refugees-already-resettled-in-us/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2021-09-02T160516Z_1041404582_RC2AHP90MJR7_RTRMADP_3_AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT-USA-csegvg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 00:32:07","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":382240586,"title":"Trump to send top envoy to Russia in push to finalise Ukraine plan  - Bahamas Spectator – Bahamas &amp;","text":"Ukraine says it supports the “essence” of a United States plan to end its war with Russia, as US President Donald Trump said “progress” is being made on securing a deal and that he would dispatch his special envoy to Russia for talks with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nTuesday saw a flurry of diplomatic activity after US and Ukrainian negotiators met two days earlier in Geneva to discuss Trump’s initial peace plan, which had been seen in Ukraine as a Russian wish list calling on Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow, limit its military and give up on joining NATO.\n\nThe plan has since been modified, with the emerging proposal reportedly accomodating concerns of Ukraine and its European allies.\n\nSpeaking at a video conference of the so-called coalition of the willing – a group of 30 countries supporting Ukraine – President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv was ready to “move forward” with the as-yet-unpublished “framework”, though he still needed to address “sensitive points”.\n\nEarlier, a Ukrainian official had told the Reuters news agency that Kyiv supported “the framework’s essence”. Building on that sense of momentum, Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, who led negotiations in Geneva, told US news website Axios that the security guarantees Ukraine was seeking looked “very solid”.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump conceded that resolving the Ukraine war was “not easy”, but added, “We’re getting close to a deal.”\n\n“I thought that would be an easier [deal], but I think we’re making progress,” he said.\n\nTaking to his Truth Social platform later on, he said that he would send envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow to iron out “a few” remaining differences over the deal.\n\nHe said he hoped to meet “soon” with Putin and Zelenskyy, “but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages”.\n\nRussia, which had hammered Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with a deadly barrage of missiles the previous night, seemed unconvinced of progress.\n\nRussia has not yet seen the modified plan, which remains unpublished, but Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov underlined that it should reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at their Alaska summit earlier this year.\n\n“If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established, then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation [for Russia],” Lavrov warned.\n\nReporting from Moscow, Al Jazeera’s Yulia Shapovalova said there was a lot of “uncertainty” at the Kremlin, though there had allegedly been “behind-the-scenes interactions” between Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and US counterpart Steve Witkoff, “who reportedly worked on the initial stage” of Trump’s plan.\n\nThe Russian side, she said, was not happy about revisions to the peace plan.\n\n“Unlike the initial American plan presented by Donald Trump, which consisted of 28 points, the so-called European version doesn’t include withdrawing the Ukrainian armed forces from Donbas, it allows Kyiv to join NATO, and it doesn’t limit the size of its armed forces,” Shapovalova said.\n\nStill, US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll had earlier emerged upbeat from meeting with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, with his spokesman saying: “The talks are going well and we remain optimistic.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on X that there were “a few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out and will require further talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States”.\n\nReporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said it was “unclear when those talks will happen, who will be involved, and what they will look like”. But, she added, it was clear they would not be imminent, given the upcoming American Thanksgiving holiday on November 27.\n\nAs the US strained to bridge the gap between Ukraine and Russia, leaders in the coalition of the willing, who have pledged to underwrite and guarantee any ceasefire, moved fast on security guarantees and a reconstruction plan for Ukraine.\n\nIn the video meeting, co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in attendance, the leaders decided to set up a task force between the US and coalition countries to “solidify” security guarantees.\n\nTrump has not committed to providing back-up for a post-ceasefire “reassurance force” for Ukraine. The plan for the force involves European allies training Ukrainian troops and providing sea and air support, but would be reliant on US military muscle to work.\n\nSpeaking after the video call, Macron said discussions in Geneva had shown that there should be no limitations to the Ukrainian army, contrary to what had been outlined in the initial draft of the US plan.\n\nHe also said a decision on using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction, at the heart of a political and legal impasse in a Europe seeking funding for Ukraine, would be “finalised in the coming days” with the European Commission.\n\nWestern countries froze approximately $300bn in Russian assets in 2022, mostly in Belgium, but there has been no consensus on how to proceed. Some support seizing the assets, while others, like Belgium, remain cautious owing to legal concerns.\n\nAccording to reports, Trump’s plan would split the assets between reconstruction and US-Russia investments.\n\nMacron hit out at Russia, saying “continued pressure” should be put on Moscow to negotiate. “On the ground, the reality is quite the opposite of a willingness for peace,” he said, alluding to Russia’s overnight attacks on Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, which left seven dead and disrupted power and heating systems.\n\nIn his daily evening address, Zelenskyy said: “What is especially cynical is that Russia carried out such strikes while talks are under way on how to end the war”.","url":"https://bahamasspectator.com/trump-to-send-top-envoy-to-russia-in-push-to-finalise-ukraine-plan/","image":"https://bahamasspectator.com/app/uploads/2025/11/AP25329059123160-1-1764098395-5pkRgi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 00:32:05","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bs","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":382237196,"title":"School Assembly News Headlines For November 26: Top National, International & Other News","text":"News Headlines for School Assembly, November 26th: From Novak Djokovic becoming the oldest player to finish a season within the ATP Top 4 to the Supreme Court directing the Kerala government to promptly establish primary schools in areas currently lacking them, here are the top news highlights for November 26th.\nTop National News:\n– The Election Commission of India (ECI) has agreed to meet a delegation from the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) on November 28th, amidst escalating tensions in West Bengal over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.\n– India’s aviation ministry on Tuesday assured that flight operations across the country remain “smooth and stable” despite precautionary rerouting due to volcanic ash drifting from Ethiopia, stating there is “no cause for concern.”\nTop International News:\n– Pakistan on Tuesday denied launching air strikes in Afghanistan after the Taliban vowed to “respond appropriately” to the deadly raids it blamed on Islamabad.

The proposed path duplicates the existing Canal Trail, which is dedicated to bikers and pedestrians, is located two blocks south of Treat Boulevard and connects directly to the Iron Horse Trail for access to the Pleasant Hill BART station.\n\nThe city acknowledged both the high risk to bikers using the proposed paths and the negative impacts on traffic in this highly congested area. So, why is this project going forward?\n\nLarry McEwen\nWalnut Creek\n\nOpposing investment\npolicy is out of step\n\nRe: “Ethical investment policy approved” (Page B1, Oct. 10).\n\nThe Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) came out in opposition to an Alameda County Ethical Investment Policy at the Oct. 3 Board of Supervisors meeting. The supervisors passed the policy but delayed implementation.\n\nThe majority of Jews present at that meeting were mobilized by Jewish Voice for Peace and supported the policy.\n\nA September Washington Post poll found that the majority of U.S. Jews do not support current Israeli policies. The JCRC’s position of opposing a pro-human rights policy is not a mainstream position, and it is not aligned with Jewish values.\n\nThe JCRC accused Israel’s critics of antisemitism and expressed concern about Jewish safety. Associating Jews with the acts of a murderous regime makes Jews less safe. Jews are safer in a world that works for all, including Palestinians.\n\nWe urge the supervisors to implement the Ethical Investment Policy as soon as possible.\n\nCynthia Kaufman\n\nCalifornia must go its\nown way on health care\n\nRe: “Policyholders brace for price increases” (Page A1, Nov. 22).\n\nThe recent story harkens back to a pre-ACA time when people went without insurance because of the high costs of insurance premiums. What we need for California is a Cal-Care for all solution. However, this year, a Cal-Care bill was sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, and he vetoed it. The main reason is that the federal government is not willing to give money that is due to us, which messes with the state budget.\n\nStaying in the United States is not beneficial to California. In 2022, we gave $83 billion to the federal government, which ends up getting redistributed to other states. The California National Party is the only party that recognizes this and has universal health care (Cal-Care, or Medi-Cal for all) as part of its platform.\n\nConstitution will halt\nthird term for Trump\n\nRe: “Don’t think Trump won’t try for third term” (Page A6, Nov. 18).\n\nA letter writer opined that President Trump could seek a third term as president by being vice president on a ticket headed by JD Vance, and, after Vance won the presidency, Vance could, by prearrangement, resign, and Trump would become president.\n\nHowever, the 12th Amendment of the Constitution stipulates that one who is constitutionally ineligible to be president is also ineligible to be vice president, which would presumably prevent Trump from becoming president under this subterfuge.\n\nTrump could argue that the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him only from being “elected” — but not actually serving — as president for a third term. But the Supreme Court would likely reject this subterfuge on grounds that it conflicts with the plain intent of the 22nd amendment to prevent a person from serving a third term as president through the electoral process, as Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930s.\n\nRoderick Walston\n\nDon’t cancel comic;\njust move it\n\nRe: “Don’t cancel comic for having an opinion” (Page A8, Nov. 23).\n\nI am one of the people who have written to request that “Mallard Fillmore” be moved to the Opinion Page, since it is clearly political in nature. I’m not asking that it be censored or removed from the paper, just that it be recognized as political opinion.\n\nIn the past few days, “Mallard Fillmore” has implied that the media only looks for bad things about Donald Trump and twists the truth, that liberals are stealing our tax dollars to support their own political party, and only care about disease in an election year, and the media is hypocritically misleading us about the destruction of the White House East Wing. Meanwhile, “Pickles” taught Nelson to say I love you to his grandma, and “Luann” adopted a puppy. Which of these is not like the other?\n\nIncidentally, “Doonesbury” is offering more-than-20-year-old strips.

terrorism.\n\nThe families of 306 U.S. citizens harmed or killed during the attack filed a 272-page federal lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of North Dakota on Monday.\n\nThey say Malta-based Binance marketed its services to \"terrorist organizations, narcotics traffickers and tax evaders\" by emphasizing that Binance is \"beyond the reach of any single country's laws or regulations,\" the lawsuit says, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe plaintiff families accused Binance of conducting transactions that totaled more than $1 billion on behalf of Hamas and other terrorist organizations.\n\nBinance officials handled the transactions despite being warned of potential illegality by its compliance vendors and did not use common security checks, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe plaintiffs also claim Binance willfully handled at least $50 million in transactions for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other terrorist organizations after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israeli civilians that killed 1,200 and kidnapped 254 others.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed a month after President Donald Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao after he earlier pleaded guilty to money laundering charges, according to CNBC.\n\nZhao is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, along with Guangying Chen and Binance Holdings Ltd., who are accused of intentionally creating Binance to serve as a \"criminal enterprise to facilitate money laundering on a global scale.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs say the Binance officials knew Hamas and other designated foreign terrorist organizations regularly used the cryptoexchange and actively assisted them \"at a time when Hamas, in particular, was publicly directing its donors to send funds\" to its Binance cryptowallets.\n\nBinance officials also disregarded filing required suspicious activity reports and manipulated how qualifying transactions were reported to prevent any scrutiny by U.S. banking regulators, the plaintiffs argue.\n\nBinance \"actively tried to shield its Hamas customers and their funds from scrutiny by U.S. regulators or law enforcement -- a practice that continues to this day,\" the plaintiff families say.\n\nThe plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial, treble damages due to alleged international terrorism-related activities, legal costs and other damages.\n\nBinance officials told UPI they are aware of the federal complaint but cannot comment on active litigation.\n\nThe crypto exchange said it fully complies with internationally recognized sanctions laws and in 2025 had a direct exposure to illicit flows of less than 0.02% of platform volume, which it said is significantly below the industry average.\n\n\"We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars, expanded our global compliance-related workforce to over 1,280 specialists (22% of our entire workforce), and built real-time intelligence-sharing partnerships with law enforcement worldwide,\" Binance said.\n\n\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to working with regulators, law enforcement and our users to protect the

expanding offshore drilling in California","text":"A bipartisan group of lawmakers on the state and federal levels spoke out Tuesday against plans by the Trump administration for new offshore drilling in the Golden State, including parcels in Southern California and San Diego.\n\n“There’s very little support for drilling on our coastline,” California Assemblymember Laurie Davies, R-Laguna Niguel, said at a news conference in Solana Beach. “If we need to support or reject offshore oil drilling in the 74th Assembly District (in Orange County), it’s not gonna be just no, it’s gonna be hell no.”\n\nRep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, called on his colleagues in Congress to pass legislation he has introduced that would prevent new leasing for the exploration, development, or production of oil or natural gas in federal waters along the Southern California coast, from San Diego to the northern border of San Luis Obispo County.\n\n“We’re going to continue to fight this legislatively and legally, and from a communications perspective and any other tools that we’ve got in the toolkit,” Levin said.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced a five-year plan that included proposals for six offshore leases in federal waters off the coast of California. The southern-most potential lease site would extend from San Diego to San Luis Obispo.\n\nIf enacted, the move would mark the first new oil and gas leases in federal waters off the coast of California since 1984.\n\nThe draft map also includes expanding offshore drilling in Alaska and along the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico, renamed the Gulf of America by President Donald Trump via executive order earlier this year.\n\nBefore any lease sales are finalized, the Department of the Interior will host a 60-day comment period in which members of the public can make their voices heard.\n\nThere are already 23 oil and gas production facilities in federal waters off the coast of California, according to the State Lands Commission, although some of them are no longer profitable to maintain. Twenty-two of those produce oil and gas, while the other is a processing facility.\n\nIn state waters, there are three offshore oil platforms — one off of Santa Barbara County and two in the Huntington Beach area. Earlier this year, a facility called Platform Esther off Seal Beach was decommissioned by the Lands Commission.\n\nThere’s also a set of artificial islands that produce oil, including the THUMS Islands in San Pedro Bay near Long Beach.\n\nAccording to a November 2021 report from the California Energy Commission, offshore production from facilities in federal waters equated to just 1% of all crude oil processed in California refineries. Within state waters, the report said offshore facilities accounted for about 6% of total California production from 2011 through 2020.\n\nInterior Secretary Doug Burgum signed the proposal to expand offshore drilling last week as part of the Trump administration’s larger efforts for “unleashing American energy.”\n\n“The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production,” Burgum said in a statement. “By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.”\n\nCalifornians pay the highest average price for a gallon of gasoline in the country. According to AAA, the average price in San Diego on Tuesday stood at $4.787, compared to the national average of $3.055.\n\n“We all want to see energy costs come down but this is not the way to do that,” Levin said. “The amount of harm that this could do for the de minimis amount of new oil that you would produce, even under the best estimates from the fossil fuel industry … (is) simply not worth it.”\n\nLevin’s bill, HR 2862, is called the Southern California Coast and Ocean Protection Act. Brought forth in April, it’s awaiting a hearing in the House Natural Resources Committee.\n\nLevin, along with seven other Democrats, introduced the bill that seeks limits in states such as North Carolina, Florida, Rhode Island and New Jersey, as well as legislation that would extend drilling bans along the entire coast of California.\n\nDavies pointed to Senate Bill 237 — recently passed by the California Legislature — as a way to give California drivers some relief at the pump.

He might as well have stayed in Los Angeles covering the Kardashians, for all the reality show-level drama and hijinks on display last week on Capitol Hill.\n\nFrom boozing to busts, from calls for rebellion to cavorting with convicted pedophiles, members of Congress turned the greatest legislative body in the world into a pre-Thanksgiving feast of family dysfunction.Before we dig into the details, I offer a caveat: There are 535 members of Congress between the House and the Senate. A vast majority toil mightily in the service of their constituents and nation. Their workday is never-ending. \n\nA couple years ago, I broke bread with a freshman member of Congress who said in his eight months in Washington he had never left Capitol Hill. A veteran, high-ranking congressman came into a meeting so exhausted it took praying over him to resuscitate him. We were told another congressman had exactly seven minutes to hang out with us, and sure enough he was in and out with the efficiency of a cat burglar. Over and over, we saw reminders that members of Congress are people, regardless of party.But golly! Where do we start? How about with the Democrats?\n\nDel. Stacey Plaskett: Texting Buddy of Jeffrey Epstein\n\nWe learned that Del. Stacey Plaskett, delegate from the Virgin Islands, was texting back and forth with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein during a 2019 anti-Trump hearing. Epstein was coaching her on what to ask President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, complimenting her for a “good job,” even discussing her habit of chewing on her cheek.\n\nPlaskett tried to pass off the revelation as merely accepting a call from a “constituent.” Sure … and Bonnie and Clyde were just out for Sunday drives.\n\nAs The Daily Signal’s Oliva Pero reported, Plaskett and Epstein have a history going back to the Virgin Islands. She was general counsel for the government agency that gave Epstein’s companies hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks. She got the maximum donations from Epstein in her three campaigns before Epstein died. She went personally to his Manhattan home to hit him up for donations. \n\nI wonder how Plaskett liked the brush strokes on Epstein’s painting of Bill Clinton wearing Monica Lewinsky’s dress? Oh, and she was personally named in a lawsuit filed by six Epstein victims accusing Virgin Island government officials of helping facilitate Epstein’s activities.\n\nAt least to Plaskett, money talks louder than Epstein’s victims.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett: Confusing Jeffrey Epsteins\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, demonstrated again why she is more reality show dumpster fire than serious legislator. Crockett loudly shredded Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin for having taken donations from Epstein. One problem: Zeldin quickly pointed out that the donation came from an entirely different Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAmazingly, when called out by CNN (of all outlets) for this, Crockett declared, “I never said it was that Jeffrey Epstein.”\n\nYou have to applaud the shamelessness.\n\nIt’s not just false accusations Crockett has to worry about. The Daily Signal’s Fred Lucas reports the Texas congresswoman is facing investigation for “inconsistent financial disclosure statements regarding investments.”\n\nRep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick: Illegally Cashing in on COVID-19?\n\nRep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., was charged last week with 15 federal counts of swiping $5 million in COVID-19 money and using it for her congressional campaign and personal benefit.\n\nHer family owns a health care company. According to the Justice Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency overpaid the company millions in disaster relief funds through a COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract, and Cherfilus-McCormick and co-conspirators simply pocketed the cash.\n\nNot for long. Within two months, Cherfilus-McCormick had herself a $100,000 3-carat diamond ring and soon a seat in Congress.\n\nShe denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIf convicted, the congresswoman faces 53 years in prison. And to think she could have made her millions in politics the old-fashioned way: insider stock trading. Eh, Rep. Nancy Pelosi?\n\nThe Capitol Hill Six: Calling for Mutiny\n\nA half-dozen Democrat House members and senators conspired to urge the military and intelligence community to defy orders from Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.\n\n“Don’t Give Up the Ship?” Closer to “Take Over the Ship.”\n\nOh, they say “illegal orders,” but as The Daily Signal’s Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell reported Monday, Sen. Elissa Slotkin admits she is “not aware” of a single illegal order given by the president.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation’s Cully Stimson also detailed how one of the conspirators, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., was asked four times by Fox News’ Martha MacCallum what illegal orders Trump has given, and he hemmed and hawed like a randy teenage boy being asked his intentions by his date’s father.\n\nStimson, himself a 30-year judge advocate general, laid out not only the danger of this reckless call for the military to defy orders, but the absurdity.\n\nHe’s right. Think about it: Six members of Congress, all military and intelligent vets, openly call for the military to rebel against its civilian command. But to Democrats, flag-waving grannies and a dude in a Viking costume constitutes an “insurrection.”\n\nCrazy Isn’t Always Partisan\n\nYes, it was a crazy week for Democrats on Capitol Hill. But Republicans have nothing to boast about. They had their own week of hijinks and high drama. We’ll get to that in part two. \n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Fox News announced Thursday that California-based reporter Bill Melugin has been “promoted” to congressional correspondent.

Meyer's departure comes after the USDA has lost thousands of research staff to President Donald Trump's effort to shrink the federal government. Meyer has been the head of the USDA office responsible for assessing crops globally and publishing a monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report that can swing crop prices. The report is considered one of the most influential sources of supply and demand data for agricultural commodities worldwide. Starting on January 1, Meyer will join the University of Missouri to lead its Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, according to the university. In a statement from the university, he said the job was an opportunity to support the farm sector with agricultural policy development and to return home to Missouri. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said Meyer made a lasting impact at the agency. \"Secretary Rollins is deeply grateful for Seth Meyer's many years of dedicated service at USDA,\" she said in a statement. The USDA suspended the release of key reports, including weekly data on U.S. grain export sales, during the record-long government shutdown that ended this month.

Greg Abbott recently did in his state.\n\nTrump has firmly rejected that approach.\n\nInstead, his new executive order tasks the State and Treasury departments with evaluating the Brotherhood chapter by chapter and determining which components deserve the terrorist label.\n\nThis approach is likely to have a far greater and more lasting impact — because it matches the decentralized, even haphazard, organization of the Brotherhood itself.\n\nThe Brotherhood has no paramount leader and no central council or governing body.\n\nAs the founding branch, the Egyptian Brotherhood enjoys a special prestige, and its leader carries the title of Supreme Guide — but has no means of exerting control.\n\nNational branches go their own way, adapting to local conditions to maximize their growth and influence.\n\nThese facts matter because a terror designation can be challenged in court.\n\nIt’s rare, because the departments of State and Treasury traditionally build their cases cautiously and comprehensively.\n\nBut if the White House insisted on designating a group with no leader, no headquarters and no clear control over its constituent parts, the result would be a legal debacle.\n\nTo avoid that, the president has instructed the secretaries of State and Treasury to deliver a report within 30 days addressing whether any “Muslim Brotherhood chapters or subdivisions” meet the legal criteria for designation as terrorist groups, with a final decision to follow within 45 days.\n\nThe order specifically requires evaluation of the movement’s branches in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt.\n\nLast month, in a report assessing the merits of designating various Brotherhood branches, my colleagues and I found that action is more than warranted on the Lebanese and Jordanian fronts.\n\nIn Lebanon, the Brotherhood operates as the Islamic Group, which lavished praise on Hamas for the atrocities of Oct. 7 — then directed its militia to join Hezbollah in rocket attacks on northern Israel, relieving some of the pressure on Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn Jordan, where the Brotherhood spent decades reassuring authorities that it rejected violence, the state intelligence service this year found that the group’s members were manufacturing rockets and drones for a planned attack on “sensitive sites” in the kingdom.\n\nThe Brotherhood insisted that those arrested were acting independently, but Amman rejected that rationale and launched a crackdown.\n\nIt’s a different situation in Egypt, where the military dictatorship of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has spent a decade crushing the Brotherhood, jailing its leaders and dismantling its political arm.\n\nStill, the Egyptian Brotherhood has generated a pair of violent splinter groups that the first Trump administration designated as terrorist organizations.\n\nWhat’s clear is that the Egyptian Brotherhood has not changed its ideological orientation. \n\nOn Oct. 7 this year, its leader celebrated Hamas for how it had “awakened the cinder of jihad” in 2023, and called for those outside Gaza to provide the enclave with “military support.” \n\nOne critical question left open by Trump’s executive order is how to stop foreign governments, like those of Qatar and Turkey, from supporting Brotherhood chapters that cross the line into terrorism.\n\nBoth Ankara and Doha have remained firm supporters of Hamas even after Oct. 7, and their broadcasting arms, especially Qatar’s Al Jazeera, promote pro-Hamas and pro-Brotherhood narratives.\n\nIn theory, Washington could designate either Turkey or Qatar as a state sponsor of terrorism for this boosting — yet that label is reserved historically for the worst of the worst, and the two nations are, technically at least, US allies.\n\nThe first step may simply be for Trump to put an end to public praise for Ankara and Doha, while turning up the heat in private.\n\nIf that isn’t enough, the Treasury Department can hit individual officials with sanctions.\n\nThey are likely to need a wake-up call — much like the one the White House just directed at the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nDavid Adesnik is the vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.","summary":"President Trump's executive order aims to strangle the diffuse Muslim Brotherhood by designating its branches as terror groups.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/25/opinion/trump-tackles-the-muslim-brotherhood-wisely-piece-by-piece/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-mqs4g9vij-1764115650187.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764097665&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-26 00:21:54","author":"David Adesnik","authors":["David Adesnik"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":382234778,"title":"U.S. Justice Department stumbles in retribution campaign against Trump foes","text":"WASHINGTON -

Trump's ambitious proposal, widely protested by locals, sought to cement his legacy as a developer by erecting the world's tallest building.\n\n But Democrat Ed Koch, the city's well-regarded mayor at the time, wasn't sold on Trump's idea, growing particularly sour toward the project when the Queens-born developer asked for significant tax abatements that Koch claimed were \"three times\" higher than any amount afforded in history.\n\n The mayor insisted that agreeing to the deal would have excessively enriched Trump at the expense of public dollars, though Trump insisted his demands were fair and necessary in order to keep NBC from fleeing New York.\n\n Their disagreement in the spring of 1987 threatened to sink Trump's high-stakes negotiations, prompting an epic exchange of nasty letters and public comments between the two as Trump tried to bully a famously feisty politician into submission.\n\n Between the written notes and verbal jabs, Trump called Koch a \"horrible manager\" and \"moron\" who \"can't hack it anymore\" and \"should resign from office,\" according to archived newspaper articles that documented the showdown.\n\n In a press conference called specifically to gain an edge on Koch in the emerging PR battle, Trump said, ''The City of New York, is suffering, in my opinion, the worst corruption scandals in the history of the city and suffering from totally incompetent management,\" according to The New York Times.\n\n Koch, who leaked the scathing letters in a power move of his own, had responded to Trump's attacks by calling the developer \"greedy, greedy, greedy,\" and adding, ''If Donald Trump is squealing like a stuck pig, I must have done something right. Common sense does not allow me to give away the city's treasury to Donald Trump.''\n\n Though Koch at one point paused to reflect on the feud — saying, \"Donald Trump has engaged in invective, but I have no intention of letting this degenerate into a barnyard kind of contest\" — the mayor was also the one who delivered perhaps the most humiliating blow.\n\n In one sharp moment amid the back and forth, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, Koch referred to his rival as \"piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy Donald Trump.\"\n\n Trump's negotiations with NBC and the city ultimately fell through, and he was forced to abandon his dream to build the world's highest tower. After several years of setbacks and modifications, he started construction on a much more modest project in the neighborhood that was largely residential.\n\n Koch left office in 1989, and died in 2013, but his cutting insults during their most visible battle seemingly stuck with Trump.\n\n Nearly four decades later, Trump is handily the most powerful man in the world, in large part to a political strategy that relied heavily on name-calling against those who challenged him.\n\n Though he has long targeted journalists with shrugs of \"fake news\" and personal insults, he managed to stun the internet with one of his most recent outbursts, toward Bloomberg's Catherine Lucey, aboard Air Force One.\n\n When Lucey asked a topical question on Nov. 14 about Trump's former ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the 79-year-old president briefly channeled Koch to utter one of the most shocking lines from a commander-in-chief: \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy,\" he snapped, with a finger pointing squarely in her direction.\n\n Following the incident — which caused \"quiet, piggy\" to trend across social media, prompting countless memes and bewildered reactions — the White House doubled down in defense of the president's remark.\n\n In a statement to PEOPLE, a White House official said, “This reporter behaved in an inappropriate and unprofessional way towards her colleagues on the plane. If you’re going to give it, you have to be able to take.”\n\n The official did not provide any clarity on what made Lucey's behavior inappropriate, though a prominent colleague in the White House press corps, CNN's Kaitlan Collins, jumped to Lucey's defense, saying she does \"a great job.\"\n\n During a briefing on Nov. 20, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took a question about the \"quiet, piggy\" comment, chalking it up to Trump's unorthodox style that made way for his political rise.\n\n \"Look, the president is very frank & honest with everyone in this room,\" she said. \"You've all seen it yourselves. You've all experienced it yourselves. And I think it's one of the many reasons the American people reelected this president, because of his frankness.\"\n\n Leavitt, 28, claimed that Trump's directness to people's faces is \"a lot more respectful\" than former President Joe Biden's approach to media, adding, \"I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near-daily basis.\"\n\n The Air Force One moment allegedly wasn't the only time that Trump called a woman \"piggy,\" though it's certainly the most public.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n During Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, who won the title at age 19 while Trump was a co-owner of the organization, claimed that Trump threatened to take away her title after she gained weight.\n\n “He was overwhelming, I was so scared of him,” Machado said in Spanish at the time. “He’d yell at me all the time. He’d tell me, ‘You look ugly,’ or ‘You look fat.’ Sometimes he’d ‘play’ with me and say: ‘Hello, Miss Piggy,’ ‘Hello, Miss Housekeeping.’ ”","summary":"During a nasty public feud in the '80s, the mayor of New York ridiculed Trump as a greedy \"piggy.\" Decades later, at the peak of his power, Trump repurposed the stunning insult to hush a journalist asking about Epstein","url":"https://people.com/donald-trump-received-same-piggy-insult-hurled-at-reporter-11855668","image":"https://people.com/thmb/w5Z_oIZ1hCVTEaCfhSImj3kpMzo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(680x286:682x288)/donald-trump-air-force-one-111925-e561603cfcc24a23b9ffc7300a547edf.jpg","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/5wETfv58-zMCebKN4.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-26 00:20:20","author":"Kyler Alvord","authors":["Kyler Alvord"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.418},{"id":382234444,"title":"WH dismisses reports of Kash Patel’s firing; Trump poses with FBI director to shut down rumour","text":"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday denied a report that president Donald Trump was considering firing FBI Director Kash Patel.

\n\nNovember 25, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Cuts to HIV funding ‘most significant setback in decades’— UN \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGENEVA, Switzerland (AFP)—Dramatic international funding cuts have thrown the global HIV response into turmoil, the United Nations said Tuesday, warning that new infections could surge.\n\nThe UNAIDS agency cautioned that, since the United States and others abruptly slashed funding this year, the ecosystem sustaining HIV treatment and prevention in dozens of countries has been “shaken to its core”.\n\n“Clinics closed without warning, thousands of health workers faced job losses or lost salaries and life saving, testing, treatment and prevention services experienced widespread and continuing disruption,” UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva.\n\nPresenting a new report, she described it as the “most significant setback in decades”.\n\nByanyima pointed to “the abrupt pause by the United States” — previously the biggest funder of the global HIV response — after US President Donald Trump returned to the White House at the start of the year.\n\nBut she highlighted that other major donors had also significantly cut their foreign aid spending.\n\n“The cuts are dramatic across the board,” she lamented, warning of “devastating consequences”.\n\n– 630,000 AIDS-related deaths –\n\nIn its report, UNAIDS said that in 2024 around 1.3 million people contracted the disease.\n\nThat was 40 percent lower than in 2010, but remained more than three times higher than needed to reach the UN’s goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.\n\nAround 630,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses last year, down 54 percent since 2010, and 15 percent since 2020, the report said ahead of World AIDS Day next Monday.\n\nBut Byanyima warned Tuesday that the deep funding crisis had “exposed the fragility of the progress we fought so hard to achieve”.\n\nEven before the crisis, the global AIDS response was severely underfunded, with access to $18.7 billion in 2024 — 17 percent below what was needed, Byanyima said.\n\nAlready last year, some 9.2 million of the over 40 million people living with HIV around the world were not receiving treatment, Tuesday’s report showed.\n\nAnd Byanyima said that in 13 countries, the number of people starting on treatment had actually declined compared to last year.\n\nShe stressed though that a lot of effort had gone into ensuring that those living with HIV could continue accessing their treatment, and that such services now were “somewhat stabilised”.\n\nBut she voiced deep concern about a “collapse” in HIV prevention services, which were already under strain.\n\nIf left unaddressed, this risked resulting in “3.3 million additional new infections” by 2030, she warned.\n\nUNAIDS warned that the funding crisis was unfolding amid a deteriorating global human rights environment, with particularly severe consequences for marginalised populations.\n\nWith more countries criminalising same-sex relations, transgender expression and sex work, testing needed to detect an HIV infection could drop.\n\nByanyima said it was too soon to know if the current crisis would result in more deaths, since it “takes time before (HIV) weakens the body and somebody dies”.\n\n“This is the moment to choose,” she said.\n\n“We can allow these shocks to undo decades of hard won gains, or we can unite behind the shared vision of ending AIDS.\n\n“Millions of lives depend on the choices we make now.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: HIV HIV funding cut United Nation

There have been 62 homicides in Washington since May 25, including one last week, according to the MPD. The city has seen 123 homicides so far in 2025. Since National Guard troops were deployed to Washington on Aug. 11, there have been 24.

She did not address the discrepancy directly.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to end its monthslong deployment of National Guard troops in the nation’s capital.

He asked the judge to bar the White House from deploying Guard troops without the mayor’s consent while the lawsuit plays out.\n\nDuring the turkey pardoning, Trump said Washington “is now considered a safe zone,” making the erroneous claim that “we haven’t seen a murder in six months.”\n\nA Department of Justice report from January showed that total violent crime in 2024 was at the lowest it had been in more than 30 years, including a 32% drop in homicides from 2023, when it experienced a post-pandemic peak.\n\nHomicides in the past six months are down 46% from the same period last year, while homicides since the August deployment are down 38% from the previous period, MPD data shows. There has been a 29% decrease in homicides in 2025 to date compared to 2024.\n\nViolent crime during the National Guard’s initial one-month surge in Washington was down 39% from the same period last year, including a 53% drop in homicides, with seven during the surge, compared to 15 during the same timespan in 2024.\n\nArson is the only type of crime that has not seen a decrease, with a 0% change from last year to this year.\n\nThe city’s statistics came into question, however, after federal authorities opened an investigation into allegations that officials altered some of the data to make it look better.
