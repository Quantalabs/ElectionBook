It scheduled arguments for July 31.\n\nThe tariffs, used by Mr. Trump as negotiating leverage with U.S. trading partners, and their on-again, off-again nature have shocked markets and whipsawed companies of all sizes as they seek to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.\n\nThe ruling has no impact on other tariffs levied under more traditional legal authority, such as tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. \n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled on May 28 that the U.S. Constitution gave Congress, not the president, the power to levy taxes and tariffs, and that the president had exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law intended to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during national emergencies. The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling, and the Federal Circuit in Washington put the lower court decision on hold the next day while it considered whether to impose a longer-term pause.\n\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits: one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Centre on behalf of five small U.S. businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, and the other by 12 U.S. states. \n\nMr. Trump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA. The 1977 law has historically been used to impose sanctions on individuals or entities deemed enemies of the U.S. or to freeze their assets. \n\nMr. Trump is the first U.S. President to use it to impose tariffs. Mr. Trump has said that the tariffs imposed in February on Canada, China and Mexico were to fight illegal fentanyl trafficking at U.S. borders, denied by the three countries, and that the across-the-board tariffs on all U.S. trading partners imposed in April were a response to the U.S. trade deficit.\n\nThe states and small businesses had argued the tariffs were not a legal or appropriate way to address those matters, and the small businesses argued that the decades-long U.S. practice of buying more goods than it exports does not qualify as an emergency that would trigger IEEPA. At least five other court cases have challenged the tariffs justified under the Emergency Economic Powers Act, including other small businesses and the state of California.\n\n One of those cases, in federal court in Washington, D.C., also resulted in an initial ruling against the tariffs, and no court has yet backed the unlimited emergency tariff authority Mr. Trump has claimed.","summary":"The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., means Mr. Trump may continue to enforce, for now, his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on imports from most U.S. trading partners, as well as a separate set of tariffs levied on Canada, China and Mexico.","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-tariffs-may-remain-in-effect-while-appeals-proceed-us-appeals-court-rules/article69681328.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/qv6k8i/article69681332.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Trump_Les_Miserables_29468.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 01:10:20","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.016},{"id":330129780,"title":"World News | Jack Ciattarelli, Ex-state Lawmaker Backed by Trump, Wins New Jersey Republican Primary for Governor","text":"Trenton (New Jersey), Jun 11 (AP) Jack Ciattarelli, a former state lawmaker and small businessman, won the Republican primary in New Jersey's race for governor, cruising to victory with the support of President Donald Trump. Ciattarelli now heads into the general election seeking to win back the governorship after two straight Democratic victories. He's hoping to build on his 2021 performance when he came within a few percentage points of defeating Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. Also Read | Sweet Launch for Shubhanshu Shukla! From Halwa to Aamras, Know What Food Indian Astronaut Is Carrying to ISS for Axiom-4 Mission. New Jersey is one of two states with a governor's race this year — the other is Virginia — and could give both parties a chance to test strategies with voters ahead of next year's high-stakes mid-term elections. As he turns his attention to the general election, Ciattarelli confronts a balancing act in a state that leans toward Democrats but has shown a willingness to elect Republicans as governor. Also Read | 'Handcuffed, Crying, Treated Like a Criminal': Man Who Filmed Video of Handcuffed Indian at Newark Airport in US Says He 'Felt Helpless and Heartbroken' (See Pics and Video). On one hand, he and the president have embraced one another, and Ciattarelli remains popular with the GOP base, which has largely unified after eight years of Democratic control of state government. But to win in November, Ciattarelli will have to appeal to New Jersey's wider electorate, which has never supported Trump in his three presidential campaigns despite the president's strong ties to New Jersey, where he has owned casinos and other high-profile properties. Ciattarelli's campaign touts the president's 2024 performance in the state, where he lost by 6 percentage points compared to a 16-point defeat in 2020, as a sign that the GOP is poised for a comeback. It also notes a decline for Democrats in registration as an indicator that voters are disillusioned with the party that has long prevailed in most statewide elections, though they occasionally have tapped Republicans as governor. Ciattarelli defeated former talk radio host Bill Spadea, state Senator Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac and contractor Justin Barbera to win the GOP primary. A state Assembly member until 2018 when he stepped down to run for governor, Ciattarelli founded medical publishing company Galen Publishing and held local and county positions in Somerset. Trump's endorsement of Ciattarelli in the final month of the primary came after the candidate got to know and understand the \"Make America Great Again\" movement, the president said in a social media post. Trump's backing hinted at Ciattarelli's earlier criticism of Trump during his first run for the White House a decade ago, when he said Trump wasn't fit for the presidency. Now Ciattarelli is \"ALL IN,\" Trump said. Trump wasn't a factor for Thomas Walton, 45, who supported Ciattarelli because he said he thinks he's best suited to handle the state's financial matters. \"We've had the nation's highest property taxes for years, and no one ever does anything about them, especially the Democrats. He deserves the chance to change the way Trenton works,\" Walton said. The two open races for governor this year could offer signals about how the public is responding to Trump's agenda and whether Democrats have succeeded in their efforts to rebuild after defeat in 2024. Both parties will look to build their general election campaigns on widespread voter frustrations. For New Jersey Democrats, that means focusing on the parts of Trump's aggressive second-term agenda that are unpopular. Republicans, meanwhile, are casting blame for economic hardships on Democrats who've run state government for the last eight years. New Jersey has been reliably Democratic in Senate and presidential contests for decades. But the odd-year races for governor have tended to swing back and forth, and each of the last three GOP governors has won a second term. Democrats have the largest share of registered voters in the state, followed closely by independent voters and then Republicans, who have roughly 800,000 fewer registrations than the Democratic Party. But the GOP has made gains in recent years, shaving the Democrats' lead of more than 1 million more registrations to the current level.

Also Read | 'Handcuffed, Crying, Treated Like a Criminal': Man Who Filmed Video of Handcuffed Indian at Newark Airport in US Says He 'Felt Helpless and Heartbroken' (See Pics and Video). Sherrill built her campaign around her personal story — a Naval Academy graduate who flew choppers for the Navy, Sherrill went on to work as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey. She first ran for office in 2018, during the mid-term election in Trump's first term, winning in a district that the GOP had controlled for years. Her primary campaign, like those of her rivals, focused on finding ways to make the state more affordable, though she shied away during the primary campaign from offering a broad-based plan. She focused instead on more narrow steps such as lowering housing costs by boosting the number of development tax credits so more housing could be built. Sherrill overcame fellow Democratic Rep Josh Gottheimer, Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney and New Jersey Education Association head Sean Spiller. Part of her winning coalition included the endorsements of significant county party organisations like those in populous Essex and Middlesex, traditionally backbones of winning campaigns in the Garden State. She also sought to galvanise support among women, a key component of the party's base, winning endorsements from reproductive rights groups like EMILY's List. A win in November would give New Jersey its second female governor after Christine Todd Whitman held the office for two terms as a Republican. The current governor, Democrat Phil Murphy, is prohibited from seeking a third consecutive term because of term limits. He didn't endorse a successor in the primary.

Newsom's tenure over the country's biggest state has been, without question, an abject disaster. He turned the state into an authoritarian nightmare during the COVID-19 pandemic, mandating masks, lockdowns, school closures and COVID vaccines, all policies that accomplished nothing to stop the spread of the virus while causing immense damage to the general public. As if that wasn't enough to push people out, cost of living increases in California during his tenure have been extreme, pushing an already expensive state over the edge. Sure enough, for the first time ever, more people left the Golden State than moved in. Then the LA fires hit. Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass demonstrated their extreme incompetence, lack of preparation and woeful inadequacy as leaders, watching two cities effectively burn to the ground. And now there's riots. Downtown Los Angeles, and several other neighborhoods in the LA area, have faced rioting, violence, vandalism and property destruction since late last week. And Newsom, yet again, has found time to point the finger for his mismanagement at everyone but himself. In fact, a recent post from his press office contained a spectacular inaccuracy, blaming President Donald Trump for rioters destroying property in LA and attempting to kill law enforcement officers, by misleading the public about the timing of the riots. Even better, when OutKick asked his office about it, it doubled down. Gavin Newsom Doubles Down On Misinformation The Department of Defense justifiably posted about Newsom and California's failure to contain the rioting, saying that \"Los Angeles is burning, and local leaders are refusing to respond.\" This is inarguably true. Newsom, Bass, and local leadership have chosen to encourage the rioters instead of taking a firm stand and working with federal leadership to end the destruction. But Newsom's press office chose to blame Trump instead of taking responsibility. \"The Department of Defense is lying to the American people,\" Newsom's press office post read. \"The situation became escalated when THEY deployed troops. Donald Trump has manufactured a crisis and is inflaming tensions. He clearly can't solve this, so California will.\" That is a spectacular, purposeful lie. The National Guard was deployed because the situation had escalated. Because Newsom and Bass refused to do anything about it. As Vice President JD Vance posted on X Tuesday, violence and destruction started well before the National Guard got to LA. That's just one of many examples; as John Ekdahl pointed out on X, the federal facility in LA had been attacked by rioters before the National Guard was sent in. Truth and fact has never been Newsom's strong suit. But when OutKick contacted Brandon Richards, a Deputy Communications Director for Newsom, his only response was to link to a story proving Newsom's release false. Richards sent a link to a local news story saying that the National Guard had not yet reached LA when Trump thanked them for their service. Trump may have been wrong, but that doesn't make Newsom right. On the one hand, they're saying the situation only escalated when the National Guard was called in, then on the other hand, they're saying the National Guard hadn't arrived yet when there was rioting. Sounds like Newsom. When OutKick followed up to ask if the governor was unaware of the timing or was purposefully lying, Richards did not respond. Again, there was violence, rioting, property destruction and attacks on federal buildings and law enforcement before the National Guard was called up. Newsom and Bass refused to act. Then, seizing the opportunity to push blame onto Trump, they started misleading the public about who was to blame. And they won't correct the record. Nor will they do anything to stop the destruction of downtown LA by their supporters. Welcome to California.","summary":"California Governor Gavin Newsom sent out an inaccurate press release blaming President Donald Trump, and his office then refused to correct the record.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/gavin-newsom-issues-inaccurate-press-release-la-riots-refuses-correct","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-1175529449.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:51:57","author":"Ian Miller","authors":["Ian Miller"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":330130704,"title":"Gabbard says AI is speeding up intel work, including the release of the JFK assassination files (World)","text":"Artificial intelligence is speeding up the work of America's intelligence services, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to a technology conference, Gabbard said AI programs, when used responsibly, can save money and free up intelligence officers to focus on gathering and analyzing information.

At a global meeting in Korea last year, countries agreed to launch a network of publicly backed safety institutes.\n\nBut the mood had shifted by the time this year's AI Action Summit began in Paris.

Mikie Sherrill won New Jersey's Democrat gubernatorial primary on Tuesday night. The Associated Press projects that Sherrill has won the primary, which tees up a competitive race against three-time gubernatorial candidate and former GOP state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli to replace Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy, who is term-limited this year. Sherill swept a crowded field of Democrat candidates, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller, former New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney and fellow U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. Democrat and Republican candidates often mentioned President Donald Trump's name on the New Jersey campaign trail as Democrats positioned themselves as the most anti-Trump and Republicans vied to be the most pro-Trump candidate. It was Ciattarelli who landed the Trump endorsement as Democrats worked to contrast the president's vision with their own. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT, BUT PRESIDENT FRONT AND CENTER IN NEW JERSEY'S PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR New Jersey is one of just two governor's races in 2025, along with Virginia. Both will be used by politicians and pundits to gauge how Americans are responding to Trump's second term ahead of the midterm elections next year. TRUMP FRONT-AND-CENTER IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR AS EARLY VOTING KICKS OFF As they campaigned for the coveted nomination, Democrat candidates walked a fine line between building on Murphy's legacy and promising to change the status quo in Trenton. Like Murphy, Democrat candidates have rejected Trump's executive orders, his crackdown on illegal immigration and the Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts. Acting as the last line of defense to a sweeping Republican agenda, Democrat governors have often rejected Trump's executive actions during his second term. By suing the Trump administration to unlock federal funds or refusing to comply with ICE deportations, Democrat governors, including many rumored to harbor 2028 presidential ambitions, are often leading the party's resistance to Trump. Trump once again took center stage on Tuesday as Sherrill and Gottheimer were peppered with questions by the press about the protests and riots unfolding in Los Angeles. When asked how she would handle the ongoing situation in Los Angeles differently from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sherrill touted her military and law enforcement background and told Fox News Digital she would stand up \"strongly in favor of keeping people here in the state safe,\" return safety to the streets and continue \"speaking out against a president who is trying to create violence in the country.\" Sherrill is a Navy veteran and served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey as an outreach and re-entry coordinator, which she described as prosecuting federal cases and advising law enforcement on investigations. \"Governor Newsom surged law enforcement in, and what Trump seems to be doing is trying to add fuel to the fire and really make the situation violent and bad,\" Sherrill told reporters after casting her ballot in Montclair on Tuesday morning. \"That's completely unacceptable.\" Gottheimer said it was \"outrageous\" for Trump to send the National Guard to California without Newsom's request. \"The fact that the president, for the first time since 1965, sent troops in from the National Guard without a request from the governor is outrageous. It's just more chaos that we're used to having in this administration. It's not how I would approach this,\" Gottheimer told Fox News Digital after voting in Tenafly. Democrat candidates threw their support behind Baraka last month after he was arrested for trespassing at an ICE facility in Newark. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called it a \"beyond bizarre political stunt,\" but Baraka has maintained that he did nothing wrong. Last week, Baraka filed a lawsuit against Alina Habba, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, and DHS Agent Ricky Patel \"for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation.\" Trump outperformed in the Garden State in 2024, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. While former Vice President Kamala Harris won New Jersey in 2024 as expected, Trump saw a nearly five-point improvement from his 2020 vote share, and Harris' support dropped by about five points. He gained across New Jersey, with his largest swings in the northeast corner of the state; Hudson and Passaic counties led the pack.

Many investors, including us, are thinking hard about how we should diversify that exposure. Australia is right up there in terms of attractive investment destinations, alongside parts of Europe and Japan.”\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by ASIC chair Joe Longo, who said recent discussions in Washington DC and Doha revealed Australia was seen as a safe harbour.\n\n“Australia is seen as a sophisticated market, with strong rule of law and institutions. I’m certain that Australia has a real opportunity here, if we play our cards right,” Mr Longo said.\n\nThe increased capital interest could drive further momentum in Australia’s already buoyant equity market, which hit near-record highs this week despite volatility in global equities triggered by US President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs.\n\nBut it’s not just equities that may benefit. Panel participants noted that private investment markets are also experiencing rapid growth — particularly in private credit, where both demand for yield and investor appetite for uncorrelated returns are driving activity.\n\nAustralia’s largest super funds, such as AustralianSuper and Australian Retirement Trust, now invest around 30 per cent of their portfolios into unlisted assets encompassing infrastructure, private equity, property, and private credit. The Future Fund, which does not publish returns in the same way, also maintains substantial allocations to private markets.\n\nJason Collins, Australian head of investment giant BlackRock, which manages $US11.6 trillion ($17.7 trillion) globally, said his firm had $280 billion in Australian public and private assets. Over the past five years, BlackRock had significantly expanded its private markets operations, deploying $30 billion across 50 local investments — a move Mr Collins said was driven by structural changes in the global economy.\n\n“Governments around the world have high debt to GDP levels — above 90 per cent globally,” Mr Collins said.\n\n“The US is under 125 per cent, Japan over 200 per cent. Governments also have reducing tax bases. In 22 of the 27 EU member states, the working age population is declining. In Australia, one in 10 people will retire in the next 10 years.\n\n“So with high debt to GDP and a lower taxation base in the future, there’s a real need for private capital to meet some pretty critical needs in the global economy, especially in infrastructure. That’s the thinking behind our private markets expansion.”\n\nGlobal investor appetite has followed, and Australia is increasingly attractive, with 80 per cent of the capital flowing to Australia via BlackRock from international investors.\n\n“Earlier in my career I was selling BlackRock to Australians. Now I sell Australia to BlackRock,” he said.\n\nASIC has welcomed the interest in Australian assets but is also keen to understand the extent to which they are reshaping Australians’ investment opportunities. While listed equities remain dominant at $3 trillion, private capital has surged 161 per cent over the past decade to $148 billion.\n\nWith initial public offerings at a 20-year low in 2023, ASIC this week announced new regulations to fast-track the listing process. Even so, the panel noted, private markets are increasingly appealing as equity markets become more concentrated.\n\nThat trend is partly driven by the rise of large superannuation funds, which are so closely benchmarked under the government’s MySuper performance tests that they predominantly track the ASX index, investing heavily in top companies.\n\nMatthew Michelini, head of Asia Pacific for private equity firm Apollo Global, which manages $US785 billion, described the Australian market as a concentrated bet on a few miners and four major banks.\n\nHe said that global monetary policy over the past two decades had channelled excess liquidity into financial markets, distorting public equities.\n\n“Most of that surplus went into financial markets. There are very few places that can absorb that. So public markets, by and large, became indexed, correlated, concentrated, driven by passive money,” Mr Michelini said.\n\nAs a result, traditional portfolio construction of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent bonds no longer offers the same diversification. Investors are turning to private markets in search of uncorrelated returns.\n\n“Public markets aren’t particularly good places to fund a growth company that has to reinvest in its own business or acquire businesses to turn around,” Dr Arndt said. “That’s how you create a lot of value as an investor, and that’s why we would expect higher returns in private markets.”\n\nHowever, ASIC has raised concerns about transparency in private investment, especially in private credit markets.\n\nCommissioner Simone Constant said several submissions to ASIC’s inquiry warned about the lack of visibility.\n\n“What did surprise me, actually, was the number of submissions that said this is something you should be worried about,” she said. “It may not be a problem now, but you need to understand the size of this wall of money in case it becomes one.”\n\nMs Constant also noted the sheer size of private enterprise in Australia.\n\n“One of the numbers that stood out to me was that 96 per cent of Australian companies earning over $100 million a year are private. That’s really significant when you look at the employment numbers; it’s about 85 per cent of people employed in the private (sector)”.\n\nWith one in ten Australians set to retire over the next decade, demand for higher-yielding private investments is likely to grow. Global giants like BlackRock and Apollo are looking to expand access, but the lack of data and investor understanding remains a risk.\n\nPeter Warne, a non-executive director at UniSuper and chair of Virgin Australia, said improving valuation standards for unlisted assets was crucial to building trust.\n\n“One of the big triggers for the GFC was the poor mortgage lending market in the US. That was all done at the state level, and no one was collecting the data,” Mr Warne said. “The Federal Reserve didn’t actually know how big this thing was until it blew up.

While many were peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds.\n\nActivists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with “No Kings” events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump’s planned military parade through Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration said it would continue its program of raids and deportations despite the protests. “ICE will continue to enforce the law,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media.\n\nA look at some protests across the country:\n\nFour Austin police officers were injured and authorities used chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators Monday night that moved between the state Capitol and a federal building that houses an ICE office. State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour early in anticipation of the protest.\n\nAustin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint. The demonstrators then started throwing rocks, bottles and other objects at a police barricade, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said. Three officers were injured by “very large” rocks and another was injured while making an arrest, she said.\n\nAustin police arrested eight people, and state police arrested five more. Davis said her department is prepared for Saturday’s planned protest downtown.\n\n“We support peaceful protest,” Davis said. “When that protest turns violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles ... that will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made.”\n\nA protest that drew hundreds to a rally on a city bridge lasted for several hours Monday night before Dallas police declared it an “unlawful assembly” and warned people to leave or face possible arrest.\n\nDallas police initially posted on social media that officers would not interfere with a “lawful and peaceful assembly of individuals or groups expressing their First Amendment rights.” But officers later moved in and media reported seeing some in the crowd throw objects as officers used pepper spray and smoke to clear the area. At least one person was arrested.\n\n“Peaceful protesting is legal,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, posted on X. “But once you cross the line, you will be arrested.” \n\n San Francisco \n\nAbout 200 protesters gathered outside the San Francisco Immigration Court on Tuesday after activists said several arrests were made there. \n\nThat gathering came after protests on Sunday and Monday swelled to several thousand demonstrators and saw more than 150 arrests with outbreaks of violence that included vandalized buildings, and damaged cars, police vehicles and buses. Police said two officers suffered non-life threatening injuries. \n\nMost of the arrests were Sunday night. \n\n“Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco, but violence, especially against SFPD officers, will never be tolerated,” San Francisco police posted on social media.\n\nPolice described Monday's march as “overwhelmingly peaceful,” but said “two small groups broke off and committed vandalism and other criminal acts.” Several people were detained or arrested, police said.\n\nAbout 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said, “Free Them All; Abolish ICE” and “No to Deportations.” The protest was initially peaceful but protesters began putting scooters in front of building entryways before police arrived.\n\nMathieu Chabaud, with Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Washington, said they were there in solidarity with the Los Angeles protesters, “and to show that we’re opposed to ICE in our community.”\n\nLegal advocates who normally attend the immigration court hearings as observers and to provide support to immigrants were not allowed inside the building. Security guards also turned away the media. The hearings are normally open to the public. \n\n New York City \n\nA mass of people rallied in lower Manhattan on Tuesday evening to protest deportations and federal immigration policy.\n\nDemonstrators gathered outside two federal buildings that house immigration courts and began marching amid a heavy police presence. \n\nSome protesters held signs reading “ICE out of New York” and others chanted, “Why are you in riot gear? I don’t see no riot here.” \n\nNew York City police said multiple people were taken into custody. There were no immediate charges.\n\nIn Chicago, a small crowd gathered Tuesday outside immigration court in downtown and called for an end to Trump administration immigration sweeps and military presence in California.\n\n“With the militarization of Los Angeles it’s time to get out and let Trump know this is unacceptable,” said retiree Gary Snyderman. “All of this is so unconstitutional.”\n\nThe group then marched through downtown streets drumming and chanting, “No more deportations!”\n\nThe demonstration had grown to at least a thousand protesters by late Tuesday, remaining relatively peaceful with limited engagement between the group and police officers.\n\n Santa Ana \n\nIn Santa Ana near Los Angeles, armored vehicles blocked the road Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Center, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices. \n\nWorkers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass from Monday's protests. Tiny shards of red, black and purple glass littered the pavement. Nearby buildings and the sidewalk were tagged with profane graffiti slogans against ICE and had Trump’s name crossed out. A worker rolled paint over graffiti on a wall to block it out. \n\nNational Guard officers wearing fatigues and carrying rifles prevented people from entering the area unless they worked there.\n\nWhile a small group kept up their demonstration Tuesday, several counter-protesters showed up. One man wore a red T-shirt and Make America Great Again cap as he exchanged words with the crowd opposing the raids. \n\nHundreds of people gathered in Boston’s City Hall Plaza on Monday to protest the detainment of union leader David Huerta Friday during immigration raids in Los Angeles.\n\nProtesters held signs reading “Massachusetts stands with our neighbors in Los Angeles” and “Protect our immigrant neighbors,” and shouted, “Come for one, come for all” and “Free David, free them all.\" \n\nHuerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, was released from federal custody later Monday on $50,000 bond.\n\n“An immigrant doesn’t stand between an American worker and a good job, a billionaire does,” said Chrissy Lynch, President of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO.\n\n Washington, D.C. \n\nSeveral unions gathered Monday in Washington to protest the raids and rally for Huerta’s release, and marched past the Department of Justice building.\n\nAmong the demonstrators was U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state.\n\n“Enough of these mass ICE raids that are sweeping up innocent people,\" Jayapal said. “As we see people exercising the constitutional rights to peacefully use their voices to speak out against this injustice, they are being met with tear gas and rubber bullets.” ___\n\nAssociated Press writers Martha Bellisle in Seattle, Sophia Tareen in Chicago, Leah Willingham in Boston, Michael Hill in New York and Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed.","summary":"Protests that sprang up in Los Angeles over immigration enforcement raids are beginning to spread across the country","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-los-angeles-chicago-seattle-austin-b2767669.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/11/01/Immigration_Protests_13220.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:32:19","author":"Jim Vertuno","authors":["Jim Vertuno"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.295},{"id":330127814,"title":"Penny Wong spruiks PM’s gift of the gab ahead of high stakes Trump meet","text":"Foreign Minister Penny Wong has praised Anthony Albanese’s gift of the gab ahead of the Prime Minister’s first face-to-face with Donald Trump.\n\nNewsWire understands the two leaders are set to meet on the sidelines of the G7 in Canada starting later this week but a time has not been confirmed.\n\nWith a tariff carve out and defence spending straining relations between Canberra and Washington, Mr Albanese has no shortage of uncomfortable talking points for the US President.\n\nBut Senator Wong said on Wednesday Mr Albanese was “pretty good at handling meetings”.\n\n“He’s had a lot of experience, not just as prime minister but as a senior minister for a very long time,” she told Nine.\n\n“Look, we don’t agree with the President Trump’s administration on tariffs.\n\n“We’ve made that clear.

Phil Murphy by three points - one of the closest margins in years. \n\nHe is widely seen as the most viable GOP candidate to take back the governor's mansion since Chris Christie won reelection in 2013. And Trump has taken notice. \n\nThe 78-year-old president has paid special interest to the race and endorsed the Republican in early May, saying the 63-year-old candidate is 'all-in' on MAGA.\n\nTrump's no stranger to the state and famously loves to spent time at his 'Summer White House' in Bedminster, where he has a resort and sprawling golf greens. Trump's said Ciattarelli is the only man who can end the state's 'blue horror show.'\n\n'He is strongly supported by the most highly respected leaders in New Jersey and, as your next Governor, Jack Ciattarelli will work closely with me and the Trump Administration to advance our America First Agenda,' the president wrote on Truth Social.\n\nCiattarelli beat out four other GOP candidates, including radio host Bill Spadea, state senator Jon Bramnick, former Englewood Cliffs mayor Mario Kranjac and Justin Barbera.\n\nFormer Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli won the New Jersey Republican gubernatorial primary\n\nJack Ciattarelli and President Donald Trump in New Jersey weeks ago \n\nDoubling-down on the New Jersey Republican, last week the president held a tele-rally for Ciattarelli to boost his momentum.\n\nPumping up his choice candidate further, Trump noted then how the state election is 'a big deal' on social media. \n\n'It’s being watched, actually, all over the world, because New Jersey is ready to pop out of that blue horror show.'\n\nAddressing the tele-rally last week the president told voters the former New Jersey Assemblyman would help with the economy and crime. \n\nCiattarelli has noted his top priority is to overturn the state's sanctuary city policies - something he has vowed to do first thing if he's elected. \n\nThe message stands in stark contrast to that of the Democratic candidates, one of which was recently arrested for storming an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, \n\nRas Baraka, the mayor of Newark, has said he was 'targeted' in the scuffle alongside several members of Congress. \n\nDemocratic New Jersey Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer are also running for the gubernatorial nomination; as are Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller and former state senator Steve Sweeney. \n\nThe Republican lost to termed-out Gov.

Photos posted on Tuesday by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) show National Guard troops standing guard around officers as they made arrests.

ICE said in a statement that the troops were \"providing perimeter and personnel protection for our facilities and officers who are out on daily enforcement operations.\" The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised. US officials said earlier on Tuesday that the Guard members were authorised to provide protection and secure streets and perimeters around areas where enforcement actions are taking place. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, said the Guard members are not participating in any of the enforcement actions, but were providing security in missions in the Los Angeles area.

California Governor Gavin Newsom earlier on Tuesday asked a federal court to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles, saying it would only heighten tensions. Newsom filed the emergency request after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment to LA of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines following protests of the president's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws. The demonstrations in the city of 4 million people have largely been centred downtown. Marines were not seen on the streets yet while National guard troops so far have had limited engagement with protesters. The federal government said Newsom was seeking an unprecedented and dangerous order that would interfere with its ability to carry out enforcement operations. A judge set a hearing for Thursday. The governor's request said it was in response to a change in orders for the Guard members, who were originally deployed to protect federal buildings. The court documents said sending troops on immigration raids would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest. The Marines and another 2,000 National Guard troops were sent to LA on Monday, adding to a military presence that local officials and Newsom do not want and that the police chief says makes it harder to handle the protests safely. Marine Corps Gen Eric Smith said on Tuesday that the Marines deployed to the area had not yet been called to respond to the protests and were there only to protect federal officials and property. The Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority, Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill. Trump says he's open to using Insurrection Act Trump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorises the president to deploy military forces inside the US to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a US president. \"If there's an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We'll see,\" he said from the Oval Office. Later the president called protesters \"animals\" and \"a foreign enemy\" in a speech at Fort Bragg ostensibly to recognise the 250th anniversary of the US Army. Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. The protests began on Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. The demonstrations have been far less raucous since. Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention centre where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids. Los Angeles police said they made over 100 arrests on Monday evening, mostly for failing to disperse downtown. One person was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, and two police offers were injured, the department said. Several businesses were broken into, though authorities did not say if the looting was tied to the protests. Nejdeh Avedian, general manager at St Vincent Jewelry Centre in the Los Angeles Jewelry District said the protesters had already left, and \"these guys were just opportunists,\" though St Vincent's had armed guards and was left alone. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Tuesday that protesters have hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at law enforcement, set vehicles on fire, defaced buildings and public property and set fire to American flags. On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters gathered peacefully in front of the federal complex, which was quickly declared an unlawful assembly. Police issued a dispersal order and corralled the protesters, telling members of the media to stay out to avoid getting hurt. Officers with zip ties then started making arrests. Obscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement remained scrawled across several buildings. At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away graffiti Tuesday. In nearby Santa Ana, armored Guard vehicles blocked a road leading to federal immigration and government offices. Sending in the military is the latest step in the administration's immigration crackdown as Trump pursues the mass deportations he promised last year during the presidential campaign. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested on Tuesday that the use of troops inside the US will continue to expand. \"I think we're entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and Reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,\" he said on Capitol Hill. Los Angeles officials say police don't need help The mayor and the governor say Trump is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said he was confident in the police department's ability to handle the demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with police would present a \"significant logistical and operational challenge.\" Demonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas. LA response takes stage on Capitol Hill The Pentagon said deploying the National Guard and Marines costs USD 134 million. The defence secretary said the troops are needed to protect federal agents. Meanwhile, Democratic members of California's congressional delegation on Tuesday accused the president of creating a \"manufactured crisis.\" On Monday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops, seeking to halt the deployment. Trump said the city would have been \"completely obliterated\" if he had not deployed the Guard. The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.

The activist vowed that they 'would not stop' trying to help and promised that 'this is not the end.'\n\nThunberg told journalists shortly after landing in Paris: 'What is certain is that we will not stop. \n\n'We are going to continue try to do everything we can because that is the promise that we have given to to Palestinians.\n\n'We are going to try every single day in every way that we can and keep trying to demand an end to the atrocities.'\n\nShe accused Israel of 'kidnapping' her in international waters, a claim she made previously in a dramatic pre-recorded SOS message released shortly after her detention.\n\nBut a picture of her smiling as a soldier offered her sandwich after her boat was intercepted quickly went viral. \n\nThunberg accused Israel of orchestrating a PR stunt following the action.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, she doubled down: 'People were not being treated well. I was not able to to say goodbye to people and I don't know what's happening. And there were many, many issues'.\n\nPressed for details on her treatment, she described the experience as 'very dehumanising,' though she insisted: 'But of course, I have to stress nothing compared to what Palestinians are going through. I would prefer not to go into detail'. \n\nShe added: 'I do know that there were major issues with people actually getting to talk to lawyers. \n\n'When you look at the state of the world, everything feels meaningless. But unless you try to do everything you can, we lose our hope.' \n\nThe activist, who has long eschewed air travel for environment reasons, was photographed on board an aircraft en route to France earlier on Tuesday - a moment that Israel's Foreign Ministry was quick to publicise, posting the image on social media platform X.\n\nPrior to her deportation, Defence Minister Israel Katz said he'd instructed IDF officials to show the activists the full, unedited footage of the October 7 attacks as recorded by Hamas terrorist body cameras.\n\n'It is appropriate that the anti-Semitic Greta and her fellow Hamas supporters see exactly who the Hamas terrorist organization they came to support and for whom they work is, what atrocities they committed against women, the elderly, and children, and against whom Israel is fighting to defend itself,' he said. \n\nLate on Monday night, he told reporters: 'Greta and her flotilla companions were taken into a room upon their arrival to the screening of the horror film of the October 7 massacre... when they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching. \n\n'The anti-Semitic flotilla members are turning a blind eye to the truth and have proven once again that they prefer the murderers to the murdered and continue to ignore the atrocities committed by Hamas against Jewish and Israeli women, adults, and children.'\n\nKatz and other Israeli officials have come under fire for branding Thunberg and her fellow activists 'anti-Semitic' for wanting to deliver aid to starving Gazans.\n\nBut Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said: 'This wasn't humanitarian aid. It's Instagram activism...\n\n'Who's really feeding Gaza and who's really feeding their own ego? Greta was not bringing aid, she was bringing herself.'\n\nMeanwhile, the French government revealed that five of the six French citizens detained alongside Thunberg had refused to sign deportation orders, meaning they will now face judicial proceedings.\n\nUS President Donald Trump did not miss the opportunity to wade in on the controversy.\n\n'I think Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg. She's a young, angry person... I think she has to go to an anger management class,' he said.\n\nThunberg responded to his comments, saying: 'I think the world needs a lot of more young, angry women, to be honest, especially with everything going on right now'.\n\nAfter a brief stop in France, Thunberg landed back home at Stockholm's Arlanda airport just after 10:30pm Tuesday. \n\nShe was greeted by around 30 cheering supporters waving Palestinian flags amid a large media presence at the airport.\n\nAsked in Stockholm if she was scared when the security forces boarded the Madleen sailboat, Thunberg replied: 'What I'm afraid of is that people are silent during an ongoing genocide'.\n\n'What I feel most is concern for the continued violations of international law and war crimes that Israel is guilty of,' Thunberg told reporters.\n\nShe accused Israel of carrying out a 'systematic genocide' and 'systematic starvation of over two million people' in Gaza.\n\nSeveral rights groups including Amnesty International have accused Israel of genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza but Israel vehemently rejects the term.\n\n'We must act, we must demand that our government acts, and we must act ourselves when our complicit governments do not step up,' Thunberg said.\n\nShe rose to fame as a schoolgirl activist against climate change and seeks to avoid flying because of its environmental impact, going so far as to cross the Atlantic by sailboat twice.\n\nShe appeared confused about reporters' questions about how it felt to travel by plane, replying, 'Why are you asking about that?'\n\nOf the 12 people on board the Madleen carrying food and supplies for Gaza, eight were taken into custody after they refused to leave Israel voluntarily.\n\nFour others, including Thunberg, were deported.\n\nAll of them have been banned from Israel for 100 years, according to the rights group that legally represents some of them.","summary":"The 22-year-old activist spoke to reporters in Paris just hours after being forcibly removed from Israel alongside a group of 11 other international activists who had been on board the 'freedom flotilla'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14800105/Greta-Thunberg-touches-Sweden-deported-Israel-vows-RETURN-failed-freedom-flotilla-mission.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/11/00/99241429-0-image-a-34_1749599871604.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/09/8317958296941674213/1024x576_MP4_8317958296941674213.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:16:11","author":"Editor,Taryn Pedler","authors":["Editor","Taryn Pedler"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.291},{"id":330130718,"title":"National Guard troops are now protecting ICE agents as they make arrests in LA (World)","text":"National Guard troops began protecting immigration agents as they made arrests in Los Angeles on Tuesday, an expansion of their duties that had been limited to protecting federal property.\n\nPhotos posted Tuesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement show National Guard troops standing guard around officers as they made arrests.\n\nICE said in a statement that the troops were “providing perimeter and personnel protection for our facilities and officers who are out on daily enforcement operations.” The change moves troops closer to engaging in law enforcement actions like deportations as Trump has promised.\n\nU.S. officials said earlier Tuesday that the Guard members were authorized to provide protection and secure streets and perimeters around areas where enforcement actions are taking place. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, said the Guard members are not participating in any of the enforcement actions, but were providing security in missions in the Los Angeles area.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier Tuesday asked a federal court to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles, saying it would only heighten tensions.\n\nNewsom filed the emergency request after President Donald Trump ordered the deployment to LA of roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines following protests of the president’s stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws. The demonstrations in the city of 4 million people have largely been centered downtown.\n\nMarines were not seen on the streets yet while National guard troops so far have had limited engagement with protesters.\n\nThe federal government said Newsom was seeking an unprecedented and dangerous order that would interfere with its ability to carry out enforcement operations. A judge set a hearing for Thursday.\n\nThe governor's request said it was in response to a change in orders for the Guard members, who were originally deployed to protect federal buildings. The court documents said sending troops on immigration raids would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.\n\nThe Marines and another 2,000 National Guard troops were sent to LA on Monday, adding to a military presence that local officials and Newsom do not want and that the police chief says makes it harder to handle the protests safely.\n\nMarine Corps Gen. Eric Smith said Tuesday that the Marines deployed to the area had not yet been called to respond to the protests and were there only to protect federal officials and property.\n\nThe Marines were trained for crowd control but have no arrest authority, Smith told a budget hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump says he's open to using Insurrection Act\n\nTrump left open the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the U.S. to suppress rebellion or domestic violence or to enforce the law in certain situations. It's one of the most extreme emergency powers available to a U.S. president.\n\n“If there’s an insurrection, I would certainly invoke it. We’ll see,” he said from the Oval Office.\n\nLater the president called protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy” in a speech at Fort Bragg ostensibly to recognize the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.\n\nTrump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.\n\nThe protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.\n\nThe demonstrations have been far less raucous since. Thousands of people have peacefully rallied outside City Hall and hundreds more protested outside a federal complex that includes a detention center where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids.\n\nLos Angeles police said they made over 100 arrests Monday evening, mostly for failing to disperse downtown. One person was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, and two police offers were injured, the department said.\n\nSeveral businesses were broken into, though authorities didn't say if the looting was tied to the protests. Nejdeh Avedian, general manager at St. Vincent Jewelry Center in the Los Angeles Jewelry District said the protesters had already left, and “these guys were just opportunists,\" though St. Vincent's had armed guards and was left alone.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Tuesday that protesters have hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at law enforcement, set vehicles on fire, defaced buildings and public property and set fire to American flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, a few dozen protesters gathered peacefully in front of the federal complex, which was quickly declared an unlawful assembly. Police issued a dispersal order and corralled the protesters, telling members of the media to stay out to avoid getting hurt. Officers with zip ties then started making arrests.\n\nObscene slogans directed at Trump and federal law enforcement remained scrawled across several buildings. At the Walt Disney Concert Hall, workers were busy washing away graffiti Tuesday.\n\nIn nearby Santa Ana, armored Guard vehicles blocked a road leading to federal immigration and government offices.\n\nSending in the military is the latest step in the administration’s immigration crackdown as Trump pursues the mass deportations he promised last year during the presidential campaign.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested Tuesday that the use of troops inside the U.S. will continue to expand.\n\n“I think we’re entering another phase, especially under President Trump with his focus on the homeland, where the National Guard and Reserves become a critical component of how we secure that homeland,” he said on Capitol Hill.\n\nLos Angeles officials say police don't need help\n\nThe mayor and the governor say Trump is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don’t need the help.\n\nLos Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said he was confident in the police department’s ability to handle the demonstrations and that the Marines’ arrival without coordinating with police would present a “significant logistical and operational challenge.”\n\nDemonstrations have spread to other cities nationwide, including San Francisco, as well as Dallas and Austin, Texas.\n\nLA response takes stage on Capitol Hill\n\nThe Pentagon said deploying the National Guard and Marines costs $134 million. The defense secretary said the troops are needed to protect federal agents.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic members of California’s congressional delegation on Tuesday accused the president of creating a “manufactured crisis.\"\n\nOn Monday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of National Guard troops, seeking to halt the deployment.\n\nTrump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” if he had not deployed the Guard.\n\nThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration’s mass deportation efforts.","summary":"National Guard troops began protecting immigration agents as they made arrests in Los Angeles on Tuesday, an expansion of their duties that had been limited to protecting federal property.

But it arrived with no immediate signs of the chaos that unfolded at airports across the U.S. during Trump’s first travel ban in 2017.\n\nVincenta Aguilar said she was anxious yesterday [Macau time] as she and her husband, both Guatemalan citizens, were subjected to three different interviews by U.S. officials after arriving at Miami International Airport and showing tourist visas the couple received last week.\n\n“They asked us where we work, how many children we have, if we have had any problems with the law, how we are going to afford the cost of this travel, how many days we will stay here,” said Aguilar, who along with her husband was visiting their son for the first time since he left Guatemala 22 years ago.\n\nShe said they were released about an hour after their flight landed, greeting their waiting family members in Florida with tears of relief. Guatemala is not among the countries included in the new ban or flagged for extra travel restrictions.\n\nThe new proclamation that Trump signed last week applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don’t hold a valid visa.\n\nThe new ban does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list, according to guidance issued Friday to all U.S. diplomatic missions. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday. Travelers with previously issued visas should still be able to enter the U.S. even after the ban takes effect.\n\nNarayana Lamy, a Haitian citizen who works for his home country’s government, said he was told to wait after showing his passport and tourist visa Monday at the Miami airport while a U.S. official confirmed by phone that he was allowed into the country to visit family members.\n\nLuis Hernandez, a Cuban citizen and green card holder who has lived in the U.S. for three years, said he had no problems returning Monday to Miami after a weekend visiting family in Cuba.\n\n“They did not ask me anything,” Hernandez said. “I only showed my residency card.”\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, a hastily written executive order ordering the denial of entry to citizens of mainly Muslim countries created chaos at numerous airports and other ports of entry, prompting successful legal challenges and major revisions to the policy.\n\nMany immigration experts say the new ban is more carefully crafted and appears designed to beat court challenges that hampered the first by focusing on the visa application process.\n\nTrump said this time that some countries had “deficient” screening for passports and other public documents or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. He relied extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of people who remain in the U.S. after their visas expired.\n\nTrump also tied the new ban to a terrorist attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. U.S. officials say the man charged in the attack overstayed a tourist visa. He is from Egypt, which isn’t on Trump’s restricted list.\n\nThe ban was quickly denounced by groups that provide aid and resettlement help to refugees.\n\n“This policy is not about national security — it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,” said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America, a nonprofit international relief organization.\n\nHaiti’s transitional presidential council said in a statement that the ban “is likely to indiscriminately affect all Haitians” and that it hopes to persuade the U.S. to drop Haiti from the list of banned countries.\n\nIn Venezuela, some visa holders changed U.S. travel plans last week to get ahead of Trump’s restrictions. For those without visas, the new restrictions may not matter much. Since Venezuela and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 2019, Venezuelans have had to travel to neighboring South American countries to obtain U.S. visas.\n\nJosé Luis Vegas, a tech worker in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, said his uncle gave up on renewing an expired U.S. visa because it was already difficult before the restrictions.\n\n“Paying for hotels and tickets was very expensive, and appointments took up to a year,” Vegas said.

Two competing realities","text":"Depending on your politics, you could see this as either a wannabe dictator illegally trying to quash civil liberties, or local and state-level politicians trying to stymie the policy agenda of a legitimately elected president.\n\nIn some ways, what we've been seeing in downtown Los Angeles feels like an almost inevitable outcome of the re-election of Donald Trump.\n\nOne of his leading campaign promises was the largest deportation of undocumented migrants in the country's history.\n\nDuring the campaign, he continuously blasted the Biden administration for allowing an \"invasion\" to take place on its watch, and promised to use the full force of the presidency to both end illegal migration and send back those already in the country.\n\nBut in an immigration-friendly city where a third of people were born abroad, Trump is facing fierce resistance from both members of the public and elected officials.\n\nLA Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom have become two of the most high-profile Democratic opponents of Trump's migrant crackdown, accusing the president of overstepping his powers — particularly in sending in the military.\n\nThere's history at play here too. Trump has long enjoyed ridiculing them both, even derisively nicknaming the governor \"Newscum\".\n\nTrump has further ratcheted up the political conflict by appearing to give tacit support to the idea that the governor could be arrested for opposing the raids.\n\nAs is often the case, it's difficult to know if he's being serious or not — but even the suggestion that a sitting governor could be targeted for arrest by the federal government is highly concerning for those who think the US is at risk of a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThere are two competing narratives at work right now. Supporters of Trump say his administration has lawfully deployed federal resources — particularly members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — to raid locations and apprehend illegal migrants.\n\nThey accuse people of unlawfully trying to interfere with the work of the government, in part through acts of violence and intimidation. So the federal government has now deployed large numbers of National Guard members and even US Marines to help protect them.\n\nTrump says there are professional agitators involved and that he's not \"messing around\".\n\nIn the Democratic version of events, concerned citizens in Los Angeles were exercising their constitutional right to protest against unwarranted and cruel raids that were stoking fear within the migrant community.\n\nThe governor, who is also seen as a frontrunner to be the Democratic candidate in the next presidential election, accuses Trump of concocting a crisis by deploying federal resources to raise tensions.\n\nHe claims that local and state authorities had the mostly peaceful situation under control and there was no need to throw fuel on the fire — except to make a political point and elicit a rise from the protesters.\n\nWhile the mayor says the violence, looting and vandalism are unacceptable, she denies there is widespread chaos in Los Angeles and says it's mostly isolated to a few blocks.\n\nShe also blames Trump for the situation and says calm will return when the raids stop.\n\nThe immigration fault line\n\nPolls suggest the majority of Americans support Trump's increasing efforts to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut opinions differ about where it's appropriate to do it — and exactly who should be deported.\n\nAccording to polling by the Pew Research Center in February and March, 66 per cent believe it's appropriate to arrest undocumented migrants at protests, and 54 per cent believe it's OK to do it at their workplaces. Only 33 per cent think ICE agents should do it at places of worship.\n\nAnd while a clear majority believe violent criminals should be deported, it's less clear-cut when it comes to those who've been in America for an extended period or have family in the country.\n\nViews also differ widely across the country.\n\nWhile immigration clearly falls under the remit of the federal government, the states command powerful resources — including police — which can either be used to help or hinder the federal government in its immigration policies.\n\nCalifornia is a sanctuary state, meaning it doesn't allow its employees to help enforce immigration activities. Republicans claim sanctuary cities and states hamper their ability to enforce migration laws.\n\nYou now have a situation in Los Angeles where some 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 marines, under the control of the federal government, are being deployed against the wishes of local and state governments.\n\nIt's a dangerous situation, and there seems little space for compromise between the opposing sides.","summary":"Depending on your politics, you could see this as either a wannabe dictator illegally trying to quash civil liberties, or local and state-level politicians trying to stymie the policy agenda of a legitimately elected president.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-11/competing-narratives-in-donald-trumps-america/105401712","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/de24716051664ec3b24ac47d30a00452?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:11:20","author":"Carrington Clarke","authors":["Carrington Clarke"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":330121840,"title":"Protesters throw rocks, jump on moving ICE vehicle after Omaha workplace raid","text":"After a workplace ICE raid that resulted in the arrests of about 70 alleged illegal aliens at a meatpacking plant in Omaha, several protesters threw rocks and jumped on federal vehicles carrying out the operation. The AP reported that federal immigration authorities made the arrests at Glenn Valley Foods Tuesday morning. Fox News Digital reached out to ICE to confirm the raid but did not immediately hear back. ICE officials told the AP the raid was \"based on an ongoing criminal investigation into the large-scale employment of aliens without authorization to work in the United States\" and that it was likely the largest \"worksite enforcement operation\" in Nebraska since President Donald Trump took office. PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS FOR JAIL TIME FOR LA FLAG BURNERS, SLAMS RIOTERS CARRYING OTHER COUNTRIES' FLAGS The Flatwater Free Press reported that the situation grew tense after protesters began gathering as a caravan of federal vehicles was leaving the plant. The outlet reported that several protesters jumped on moving law enforcement vehicles and \"threw rocks and debris at the cars, shattering one window.\" Video posted by the outlet shows what appears to be a line of federal vehicles surrounded by protesters on either side throwing objects, kicking the cars and yelling profanity and slogans like \"f--- you, pig.\" At one point during the video, a window can be heard smashing. In another video posted by the outlet, two protesters jumped on the hood of a vehicle as it attempts to travel off. Violence erupted in Omaha with Los Angeles still battling violent anti-ICE riots and the rest of the country facing widespread protests against the Trump administration ramping up of ICE arrests and deportations. 'VERY BIG FORCE' WILL ADDRESS PROTESTORS AT SATURDAY'S MILITARY PARADE, TRUMP SAYS Protests over the raids in Los Angeles devolved into violence over the weekend as rioters targeted federal law enforcement officials by throwing rocks, and videos showed people looting stores, setting cars on fire and taking over a freeway. Trump announced Saturday he was deploying 2,000 National Guard members to help quell the violence, bypassing the governor, who typically activates the National Guard. The administration has also deployed several hundred active-duty Marines to respond to the riots. The move prompted Newsom to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration over efforts to allegedly \"federalize the California National Guard,\" while Democrats across the nation have attempted to pin blame for the violence on Trump's activation of the National Guard while characterizing the anti-ICE riots as \"peaceful\" demonstrations. IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES HIGHLIGHT CRIMINAL HISTORY OF MULTIPLE MIGRANTS ARRESTED IN LOS ANGELES CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office Tuesday, Trump said Americans can expect additional immigration raids across the country similar to those in California, warning that any potential riots that break out in response to the raids will be met with \"equal or greater force\" compared to the government's handling of recent Los Angeles violence.","summary":"After a workplace ICE raid that resulted in the arrests of about 70 illegal alien at an Omaha meatpacking plant, several protesters threw rocks and jumped on law enforcement vehicles.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/protesters-throw-rocks-jump-moving-ice-vehicle-after-omaha-workplace-raid","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/protester-and-ice.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:07:35","author":"Peter Pinedo","authors":["Peter Pinedo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":330122530,"title":"Exclusive Look Inside Omaha’s Biggest ICE Operation: A NewsNation Report","text":"OMAHA, Neb.

The WHMU is part of the White House military office and staffed by military doctors who care for the president, vice president and their families.\n\nAdditionally, Jackson alleged that O'Connor 'would ask people, people that he had just met, for their cell phone. They would give him their cell phone. He would stick it in his pants, in his crotch, and then give it back to them.'\n\n'[O'Connor] thought that was just hilarious,' said Jackson. 'Most people thought it was weird and inappropriate and immature, but he thought it was funny.'\n\nThe Daily Mail reached out to O'Connor via his lawyers, as well as the offices of former Presidents Biden and Obama, for comment and has not yet received a response.\n\nHowever, another former White House physician, Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, who served as President Obama's doctor during the time the incidents are claimed to have occurred and oversaw both Jackson and O'Connor, told the Daily Mail that he never heard such allegations.\n\n'I am adamantly telling you: I left in July 2013 and I wasn't aware of that, no one mentioned that,' he said.\n\nKuhlman suggested that Jackson's claim may be motivated by personal animus and claimed that the two men were rivals.\n\n'I knew they didn't get along,' he added, 'I had Kevin [O'Connor] covering [Vice President Biden], and Ronny [Jackson] helping me covering the Obama family.'\n\nJackson himself has faced allegations of misconduct. \n\nA 2021 inspector general's report from the Pentagon described how he made sexual comments to subordinates and drank alcohol during his time at the White House Medical Unit. Jackson has denied the allegations, but the Navy demoted him from Admiral to Captain in July 2022, citing the IG's findings.\n\nAnd, according to Kuhlman, Jackson suspects that O'Connor was behind that report.\n\n'I would point out the obvious: the inspector general of the Navy did a report into Ronny Jackson. Jackson's opinion is that Kevin O'Connor was the source of that,' he said.\n\nThose accusations, too, were not witnessed by Kuhlman.\n\n'For the record, from 2006-13 no one ever told me Ronny Jackson was behaving inappropriately. So I wasn't protecting anyone. He and Kevin were both ambitious people, sometimes you get blinded by ambition,' said Kuhlman.\n\nNow, the spotlight turns to O'Connor who has been subpoenaed by the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee to testify later this month about an alleged White House cover-up of President Biden's health in office.\n\nQuestions about Biden's cognitive state have been raised after the publication of the new book 'Original Sin,' and last month the ex-president announced that he had been diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer.\n\nO'Connor reportedly never subjected Biden to a formal cognitive battery during his presidential physicals. And while he would release a letter describing his findings on Biden's health, he never answered questions from the media on the matter.\n\nHis findings on Biden's health declared him 'fit' to be president.\n\nFour months before the disastrous presidential debate between Trump and Biden - which resulted in Biden stepping down as the Democratic presidential nominee, O'Connor signed off on Biden's health, writing he 'continues to be fit for duty.'\n\nDr Kuhlman, himself, has questioned O'Connor's treatment of Biden, saying the president should have been subjected to extensive annual neurocognitive exams and that the results should be made public.\n\n'My position is that a 78-year-old candidate, Trump at the time, an 82-year-old president [Biden], would both benefit from neurocognitive testing,' Kuhlman told The Washington Post, noting how age-related decline is inevitable.\n\n'Any politician over the age of 70 has normal age-related cognitive decline.'\n\nJackson alleged to the Daily Mail that O'Connor was very close to the Biden family and protected by them.\n\n'He was treated as a son by Joe and Jill Biden,' Jackson told the Daily Mail. Jackson claims that's why he didn't report O'Connor for inappropriate conduct.\n\n'He got away with it because of the people that he's surrounded with in the Biden inner circle, who were also cut from that same cloth,' he said.\n\n'I had actually considered several times relieving him of his duty and getting rid of him at the White House because of some of the inappropriate things he had said and done. But I knew that if I did that, it would be very short-lived, because he was essentially part of the Biden family,' he said.\n\nThat justification, though, doesn't fly with Kuhlman.\n\n'If it happened on [Jackson's] watch, his responsibility was to talk to the WH military office, deputy chief of staff. It's kind of repulsive that he would bring this up 10 years later,' he said.\n\nO'Connor is a retired U.S. Army colonel and began service as a physician in the White House in 2006 under the Bush administration. In 2009, O'Connor was named physician to then-Vice President Biden. He retired from the military in 2017 and was named Biden's physician when Biden became president.","summary":"Vicious accusations are flying among three former White House doctors, as President Joe Biden's personal physician is set to be hauled in front of Congress. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14798139/biden-doctor-kevin-oconnor-disgusting-congress.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/10/21/38455918-0-image-m-11_1749586290917.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/05/23/3801178405218697633/1024x576_MP4_3801178405218697633.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:05:16","author":"Editor,Emily Goodin,Harriet Alexander","authors":["Editor","Emily Goodin","Harriet Alexander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":330129266,"title":"Trump’s EPA Plans to Claim US Power Sector Emissions Are Insignificant. It’s absurd.","text":"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nDonald Trump’s administration is set to claim planet-heating pollution spewing from US power plants is so globally insignificant it should be spared any sort of climate regulation.\n\nBut, in fact, the volume of these emissions is stark—if the US power sector were a country, it would be the sixth largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.\n\nTrump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reportedly drafted a plan to delete all restrictions on greenhouse gases coming from coal and gas-fired power plants in the US because they “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” and are a tiny and shrinking share of the overall global emissions that are driving the climate crisis.\n\nHowever, a new analysis shows that the emissions from American fossil-fuel plants are prominent on a global scale, having contributed 5 percent of all planet-heating pollution since 1990. If it were a country, the US power sector would be the sixth largest emitter in the world, eclipsing the annual emissions from all sources in Japan, Brazil, the UK, and Canada, among other nations.\n\n“That seems rather significant to me,” said Jason Schwartz, co-author of the report from New York University’s Institute for Policy Integrity. “If this administration wants to argue only China has significant emissions they can try to do that, but a court will review that, and under any reasonable interpretation will find that US power plant emissions are significant too.”\n\nFossil fuel-derived electricity is responsible for the second largest source of emissions in the US, behind transportation. No country in history has caused more carbon pollution than the US, and while its power sector’s emissions have declined somewhat in recent years, largely through a market-based decline in heavily polluting coal, it remains a major driver of the climate crisis.\n\nThe cocktail of toxins emitted by power plants have a range of impacts, the NYU analysis points out. A single year of emissions in 2022 will cause 5,300 deaths in the US from air pollution over many decades, along with climate impacts that will result in global damages of $370 billion, including $225 billion in global health damages and $75 billion in lost labor productivity.\n\n“We were surprised when we ran the numbers just how quickly these deaths start tallying up,” said Schwartz. “All of these harms stack up on top of each other. Climate change will be the most important public health issue this century and we can’t just ignore the US power sector’s contribution to that public health crisis.”\n\nThe Trump administration, though, is looking to dismantle a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The move comes as part of a wider deregulatory blitz upon a wide range of rules aimed at protecting clean air and water; on Thursday, the EPA also confirmed a plan to delay the implementation of Clean Air Act protections against methane and other harmful pollutants from fossil fuel production.\n\nRemoving these protections will prove not only dangerous, but also costly, said Christopher Frey, who was a science advisor to Joe Biden and led a clean air EPA committee under Barack Obama.\n\n“A ‘do nothing’ policy to rollback greenhouse gas emission standards is not really a policy to do nothing,” said Frey, now an associate dean at North Carolina State University’s college of engineering. “It is a policy to force us to have to do more later to compensate for not taking preventive action sooner. It is a policy to knowingly cause more damage for folks in the not so distant future to contend with.”\n\nThe power plant plan has endured a tortuous history, having been first put forward by the Obama administration, only to be halted by the first Trump administration and also the Supreme Court. The Biden administration last year rolled out a more limited version of the plan aimed at satisfying the Supreme Court’s ruling.\n\nThis version is now targeted for repeal by the Trump administration, expected in the coming weeks ahead of a public comment period and further expected legal challenges. Despite pointing to declining power plant emissions in its justification, the Trump administration has simultaneously attempted to increase these emissions by demanding a revival of the coal industry, boosting oil and gas drilling and axing incentives for cleaner energy.\n\n“President Trump promised to kill the clean power plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now,” said Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA. “In reconsidering the Biden-Harris rule that ran afoul of Supreme Court case law, we are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy.”\n\nTrump has long claimed that the US should not engage in international climate talks because its emissions footprint is negligible, noted Judith Enck, who served as an EPA regional administrator under Obama. Meanwhile, his administration has cracked down on states’ ability to regulate emissions, she said.\n\n“Apparently there is no level of governance where we can have these regulations,” Enck said. “It’s a completely illogical argument: There’s not a lot of emissions so don’t worry, but yet we have to block every attempt to control them at the state, federal [and] international levels?”\n\nExperts have questioned whether pollution needs to be deemed “significant” in order to be subjected to the Clean Air Act, which has been used to regulate even proportionally small levels of environmental toxins.\n\n“There is absolutely no legal basis for them to propose a pollutant like CO2 has to meet some sort of significance, they are making this up, this is make-believe law,” said Joseph Goffman, who led theEPA’s office of air and radiation during Biden’s term. “This is a sort of cheat code to try to neutralize any tool they fear might be used to reduce greenhouse gases.”\n\nThe climate crisis is a global problem of the shared commons that experts say requires all countries, particularly the largest emitters, to remedy. Goffman said the Trump administration is attempting to reject this basic tenet. “They are trying to write one of the biggest historical emitters in the world a get-out-of-jail-free card,” he said.\n\nCorrection, June 10: This post has been updated to credit its original publisher.","summary":"This story was originally published by the Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The department said presidents can cancel monument designations if protections aren't warranted.\n\nThe finding comes as the Interior Department under Trump has been weighing changes to monuments across the nation as part of the administration's push to expand U.S. energy production.\n\nThe Republican in his first term reduced the size of two Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments in Utah, calling them a “massive land grab.\" He also lifted fishing restrictions within a sprawling marine monument off the New England Coast.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden reversed the moves and restored the monuments. noting that Bears Ears was the first national monument to be established at the request of federally recognized tribes.\n\nThe two monuments singled out in the new Justice Department opinion were designated by Biden in his final days in office: Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California.\n\nThe Democrat's declarations for the monuments barred oil and natural gas drilling and mining on the 624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site, and the roughly 225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) Sáttítla Highlands site near the California-Oregon border. \n\nChuckwalla has natural wonders including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and it is home to rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard. The Sáttítla Highlands include the ancestral homelands of and are sacred to the Pit River Tribe and Modoc Peoples.\n\nAll but three presidents have used the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources, and about half the national parks in the U.S. were first designated as monuments. \n\nBut critics of monument designations under Biden and Obama say the protective boundaries were stretched too far, hindering mining for critical minerals.\n\nDeputy Assistant Attorney General Lanora Pettit wrote in the Trump administration opinion that Biden's protections of Chuckwalla and the Sattítla Highlands were part of the Democrat's attempts to create for himself an environmental legacy that includes more places to hike, bike, camp or hunt. \n\n\"Such activities are entirely expected in a park, but they are wholly unrelated to (if not outright incompatible with) the protection of scientific or historical monuments,\" Pettit wrote.\n\nTrump in April lifted commercial fishing prohibitions within an expansive marine monument in the Pacific Ocean created under former President Barack Obama.\n\nEnvironmental groups have anticipated more actions against monuments by Trump since his first days in office. They said Tuesday's Justice Department opinion doesn't give him the authority to shrink monuments at will.\n\n“Americans overwhelmingly support our public lands and oppose seeing them dismantled or destroyed,” said Axie Navas with The Wilderness Society.\n\nSince 1912, presidents have issued more than a dozen proclamations that diminished monuments but did not outright revoke them, according to a National Park Service database.\n\nDwight Eisenhower was most active in undoing the proclamations of his predecessors as he diminished six monuments, including Arches in Utah, Great Sand Dunes in Colorado and Glacier Bay in Alaska, which have all since become national parks.\n\nTrump's moves to shrink the Utah monuments in his first term were challenged by environmental groups that said protections for the sites safeguard water supplies and wildlife while preserving cultural sites.\n\nThe reductions were reversed by Biden before the case was resolved, and it remains pending. \n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.","summary":"Lawyers for President Donald Trump’s administration say he has the authority to abolish national monuments meant to protect historical and archaeological sites","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-joe-biden-republican-justice-department-dwight-eisenhower-b2767662.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/11/01/Trump_National_Monuments_13161.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:03:07","author":"Matthew Brown","authors":["Matthew Brown"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.11},{"id":330125738,"title":"New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver indicted on federal charges from skirmish at Newark immigration center","text":"U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted Tuesday on federal charges alleging she impeded and interfered with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center while Newark’s mayor was being arrested after he tried to join a congressional oversight visit at the facility.\n\nActing U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X.\n\n“While people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve,” Habba said.\n\nMcIver, a Democrat, had been charged in a complaint by Habba last month with two assault charges stemming from the May 9 visit to Newark’s Delaney Hall — a 1,000-bed, privately owned facility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses as a detention center.\n\nMcIver disputed the allegations as baseless and defended her presence at the facility as part of her authorized role as a member of Congress.\n\nHer lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said in a statement that they would challenge the allegations “head-on” in court.\n\n“The legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is — political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,” Fishman said.\n\nHabba said two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. A third has a maximum sentence of one year. She characterized the charges as “forcibly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement officers.”\n\nThe indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen President Donald Trump’s administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey’s largest city to court, tapping into the president’s immigration crackdown and Democrats’ efforts to respond. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption.\n\nAt the same visit that resulted in McIver’s charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution.\n\nA nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence, where other people had been protesting. She and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point, her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police” on it.\n\nIt isn’t clear from police bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene.\n\nThe complaint says she “slammed” her forearm into an agent then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.\n\nNew Jersey Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez had joined McIver at the detention center that day. They and Democrats have criticized the arrest and disputed the charges as well.\n\nBy law, members of Congress are authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority.\n\nMcIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District.\n\nShe was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city’s public schools before that.","summary":"Acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/10/us-news/us-rep-lamonica-mciver-indicted-on-federal-charges-from-skirmish-at-new-jersey-immigration-center/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/newspress-collage-dnxjke7x1-1749599745481.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1749585361&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/31pwnsB5-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:01:16","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.37},{"id":330124064,"title":"Pakistan, US to resume tariff talks within days","text":"WASHINGTON: A senior trade delegation from Pakistan is due in Washington this week for talks with US officials on the recently imposed American tariffs and related economic issues, diplomatic sources told Dawn.\n\nThe three-day visit will be the latest in a series of high-level exchanges between Islamabad and Washington amid a fragile regional security climate following last month’s military standoff between India and Pakistan.\n\nLed by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, the delegation includes senior Federal Board of Revenue officials and representatives of the energy and information technology sectors.

Clashes between both sides have led to rubber bullets and flash grenades being used.\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a lawsuit against the deployment, calling it unconstitutional, while LA Mayor Karen Bass said the city was being “used for an experiment” in asserting federal authority.\nIn Japan, where the protests have been widely covered in the press and dissected on social media, reactions have been swift and polarising, mirroring the division among Americans about the unrest.\n“The protests started mostly peaceful, as far as I could tell from the news coverage, but have become a series of riots now,” said Ken Kato, a Tokyo-based small business owner, who describes himself as deeply conservative in his outlook.\n“I’ve seen footage of people throwing bricks and stones at police cars, and that is completely unacceptable to a Japanese person,” he said.\nHe told This Week in Asia that the level of force used by the US security personnel was appropriate. “This sort of behaviour [by the protesters] is not acceptable,” he added.\n\nKato also referred to the immigration situation in Japan, particularly the large presence of Kurdish people in the country.\nMany Kurds are based in the Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, where there have been reports of friction between them and residents, their supposed refusal to abide by Japanese laws and customs, and a rise in crime in the area.\n“I am concerned that what we are seeing in the US could happen here soon. Foreign people who want to live in Japan have to follow the law or they cannot stay here,” Kato said.\nOnline users commenting on news websites agreed on the need for foreigners living in Japan to integrate themselves well into Japanese society.\n“What is happening in Los Angeles should be something that concerns Japan as well,” a user said on a BBC news site. “If the same thing happened in Saitama or Kawasaki, where immigration is now a hot topic, it would be very serious.”\nAnother user said: “I fear things will get even more heated from now on.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy GETHIN HICKS \n Published:00:52 BST, 11 June 2025 |Updated:00:54 BST, 11 June 2025 \n\nSam Thompson is set for an awkward encounter with Louis Tomlinson at Soccer Aid this Sunday - three months after the One Direction singer started dating Sam's ex Zara McDermott. \nThe men will be on the same England team for Unicef - the same charity Sam completed a 260-mile five-day long marathon for on Friday. \nAnd while Sam has insisted there are 'no hard feelings', the encounter is bound to sting a little. \nSam, 32, and former Love Islander Zara, 28, confirmed they had ended their relationship in January after more than five years together. \nZara moved on pretty quickly with singer Louis, 33, with the smitten couple appearing inseparable since their romance was made public in March. \n\nSam Thompson and Louis Tomlinson are set for an awkward encounter THIS Sunday at Soccer Aid three months after One Direction star began dating his ex Zara McDermott \n\nLouis, 33, and Zara, 28, made their romance public in March - three months after she split from her Made In Chelsea ex (Pictured in April)\nThey have enjoyed a loved-up getaway to Costa Rica together after Louis flew his new flame out to the island first-class. \nMeanwhile I'm A Celeb winner Sam has moved on with Love Island beauty Samie Eilshi, 25. \nAfter their blossoming romance was confirmed when they shared a steamy kiss in Mayfair last month, speculation of a split grew after Samie was noticeably absent from Sam's highly-publicised challenge for Soccer Aid last week. \nSuch rumours have since been squashed however, with their romance reportedly going from strength to strength as they 'love spending time together on their days off', a source close to the couple told MailOnline. \nDuring an episode of their podcast Staying Relevant's last month, Pete Wicks, 37, teased Sam about the prospect of the potentially awkward encounter between him and Louis.\nThe TOWIE star asked his co-host: 'You're really going through it with the whole f****** body and dieting and training loads. Is that for Soccer Aid?'\nSam laughed and assured he's 'loving it' but 'no, it's not' for the game, to which Pete continued: 'Are you sure it's not for Soccer Aid? How are you feeling? You're playing again. Must be really exciting.' \nHe added: 'How do you feel about the line up? Do you think you've got a strong team?'\nAwkwardly laughing, Sam replied: 'Got a really strong team'.\n\nSam and Zara confirmed their split in January after more than five years together (Pictured October 2022)\n\nThe Made In Chelsea star has since moved on with Samie Eilishi (Pictured last week), 25, after the couple were snapped sharing a steamy kiss last month\nBut, not dropping the subject, Pete then asked: 'Any kind of people in there who you're looking forward to playing with?'\n'Loads,' Sam laughed: 'Tom Grennan. I'm really looking forward to playing alongside Wayne Rooney, Tyson Fury's the manager. I can't wait'.\nPete joked: 'I mean that's gonna be f****** amazing. Make sure you get him on side though because you may need him in your corner in case you fall out with anyone. Not that you will but just in case there's any rivalries or anything.\n'You know, you have to train together and it's a lot, you know when you're kind of in close quarters with someone like that. All sorts gets brought up. Anyway...'\nSam and Louis will join the likes of Tyson Fury, Jill Scott, Grennan and Paddy McGuinness in the star-studded squad, while Wayne Rooney will step out of retirement as one of the managers.\nHowever, whilst he is assured to be in attendance, Sam's ability to take part in the match itself is doubtful after he suffered an agonising ankle injury during his journey from London to Manchester on bike and foot last week. \nThe former I'm A Celeb winner suffered the injury on the marathon's first day, but managed to power through five further days before reaching the finish line on Friday. \nHaving raised more than £1.5million for Unicef and battled through a torn calf, the 32-year-old couldn't hide his emotions after completing his mission as he collapsed to the floor in tears. \n\nPete Wicks teased Sam Thompson about Soccer Aid 'rivalries' during a recent episode of their podcast\n\nIn a clip posted to Staying Relevant's TikTok account on Thursday, Pete asked Sam: 'You're really going through it with the whole f****** body and dieting and training loads. Is that for Soccer Aid?'\n\nPete Wicks hilariously parodied Sam's ex Zara McDermott's famous 'you can!' moment from Made In Chelsea as he supported him on his mammoth challenge last week\n\nSpeaking after the challenge, Sam said: 'My legs have completely gone but I feel good. I'm so grateful for everyone being here, I didn't think anyone would turn up.\n'To everyone who has donated, I've said it before but I'll say it a million times, you are so heroic. The money will help so many children, I'm so grateful.'\nSam may now have more time to pursue his romance with Samie, who recently opened up about their relationship for the first time. \nSam first met Samie, who appeared on Love Island in 2023 and returned to the All Stars series this year, through his presenting role on Aftersun. \nSamie spoke about the blossoming relationship for the first time during an appearance on the Chloe Mediumship podcast.\nThe show is hosted by a psychic medium and in the episode, the beauty revealed how she's previously had negative gut feelings in past relationships.\nShe explained: 'I've had gut feelings with guys before. I've had a couple of relationships where I've known it was never it. Like this is gonna come to an end, I'll have something telling me every day it's coming to an end, this isn't for you.\n'You put it to the back of your mind and then you start noticing the chaos increase. It's like the universe saying I'm gonna blow you both up if you just do not separate. Then I'm like if I only I listened all those months ago when I got that first message.'\n\nSam couldn't hide his emotions after he battled through a calf injury last week to complete his mission for Unicef and Soccer Aid\n\nThe reality TV star travelled more than 260 miles from London to Manchester over a five day period, raising £1.5million for Unicef in the process\n\nBREAKING NEWS Sam Thompson breaks down in tears as he FINALLY completes his gruelling Soccer Aid challenge \nThen, host Chloe asked: 'Obviously, you don't have to talk about it too much but the guy you're currently speaking to, do you have that gut feeling? Like do you think it's gonna be really good?'\nKeeping her cards close to her chest, the former Love Islander replied: 'There’s been no bad stuff at the minute so yeah I suppose it is all positive right now. It’s early days.'\nZara and Louis sparked relationship speculation at the start of this year before going public in March, three months after MailOnline revealed Zara and ex-boyfriend Sam had parted ways.\nDespite his heartache over Zara moving on so quickly, sources close to Sam exclusively told MailOnline at the time he holds no grudges against Louis over the new romance. \nA source close to the star said: 'Sam has no hard feelings towards Louis, that's for sure.\n'As far as he's concerned, Louis is Zara's new man and he's just got to accept it.\n'He's a positive guy and will just move on from this, throwing himself into work and getting stuck into the exciting projects he's got coming up.\n'Obviously he was sad when their relationship broke up and, like anyone, when your ex moves so quickly it's tough. And if he was both angry and devastated, that would be understandable.\n'But he's not sitting around wallowing in self pity, far from it.'\nZara and Sam were together for five years before they split at the end of 2024 shortly after the Made In Chelsea favourite worked in Australia for I'm A Celeb spinoff show Unpacked.\nThis year's Soccer Aid for Unicef match airs on the evening of Sunday 15 June on ITV1 and ITVX from Old Trafford, Manchester. \nOne DirectionPete WicksUNICEFSam Thompson\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nSam Thompson and Louis Tomlinson set for awkward encounter THIS weekend at Soccer Aid - three months after it was revealed One Direction star was dating his ex Zara McDermott\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Here’s a look at how the events unfolded:\n\nMorning: Department of Homeland Security agents detained several people outside a Home Depot just west of downtown Los Angeles. A little later, another raid took place at the Ambiance Apparel clothing store in L.A.’s Fashion District. During that operation, people gathered to photograph and take video of the agents. A few protesters also arrived. At least 44 people were arrested.\n\nAfternoon: Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Los Angeles Federal Building, calling for an end to immigration raids in the city.\n\n3 p.m.: Dozens gathered in the Fashion District after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared at an apparel manufacturer there.\n\n6:30 p.m.: More than 100 people gathered at the immigration services building and detention center in downtown Los Angeles to protest the raids. DHS officers fired pepper balls at the protesters before the Los Angeles Police Department dispersed the crowd.\n\n9 a.m.: Border Patrol agents gathered in a gated industrial office park in Paramount, a Latino suburb south of downtown Los Angeles. Separate clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement officers in Paramount amid rumors that immigration agents planned to raid a Home Depot in the area. Protesters kicked and threw objects at law enforcement vehicles, while officers deployed tear gas.\n\nLater that day: Tensions escalated and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department ordered protesters to disperse and warned they would face arrest or use of force if they did not. Officers shot tear gas canisters into the crowd as protesters retreated.\n\n4 p.m.: Social media posts showed police and sheriff’s deputies declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly and using loudspeakers to tell protesters that anyone who remained would be arrested.\n\n6 p.m.: President Donald Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard members to deploy in Los Angeles to protect federal officers conducting immigration operations over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.\n\nNightfall: Protesters and the LA County Sheriff’s Department continued to clash in Compton, across the Los Angeles River from the Home Depot in Paramount. Officers shot flash-bang grenades and rubber bullets at the protesters, who threw rocks, glass bottles and fireworks at the officers.\n\nEvening: Protesters gathered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. The Los Angeles Police Department created a barrier outside the building and declared an unlawful assembly, ordering demonstrators to disperse.\n\nEarly morning: Roughly 20 California National Guard troops arrived at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Nearly 300 members of the California National Guard took positions at three different sites around the city. More than a dozen DHS officers in riot gear joined the National Guard troops at the detention center. By early afternoon, hundreds of protesters had gathered there.\n\n1 p.m.: California National Guard, DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers formed a line and attempted to clear protesters away from the Metropolitan Detention Center. Officers deployed tear gas, pepper balls and other crowd-control munitions.\n\nMidafternoon: Protesters spilled onto nearby 101 Freeway, blocking traffic in at least one direction before being cleared by the authorities.\n\n6 p.m.: Protesters in the area had mostly dispersed, and law enforcement officers returned to their positions near the Federal Building complex. A few dozen protesters remained nearby, blocking Alameda Street.\n\n• Thousands of protesters gathered on the west side of the Los Angeles Federal Building on North Los Angeles Street.\n\n• Civil rights leaders held a rally at Gloria Molina Grand Park to demand the release from federal detention of L.A. union leader David Huerta, who was arrested Friday during an immigration protest. Huerta was released Monday on a $50,000 bond.\n\n• The Department of Defense mobilized a battalion of 700 U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to respond to protests against immigration raids.\n\n• By end of day, about 100 arrests had been made.\n\n• Downtown Los Angeles was quiet during the day as crews cleaned up damage left by vandals. Businesses hit by looters worked to reopen.\n\n• National Guard units remained on the scene at the Orange County Civic Center, but the scene was quiet.\n\n• Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and a senior defense official told lawmakers that deploying National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles will cost at least $134 million and last at least the next 60 days.\n\nSources: The New York Times, USA Today, CNN, NBC Channel 4, Google Earth, Southern California News Group","summary":"Here’s a look at how events unfolded from Friday, June 6, through Tuesday, June 10.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/10/a-timeline-of-immigration-raid-protests-in-los-angeles/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LDN-L-PROTESTS-TIMELINE-Map.png?w=1024&h=606","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 23:44:01","author":"Southern California News Group","authors":["Southern California News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":330117994,"title":"Democrats join faith leaders to denounce Trump's budget bill","text":"June 10 (UPI) -- Democratic senators joined hundreds of faith leaders on the Capitol steps Tuesday in Washington, D.C., to denounce SNAP and Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump's massive budget proposal.\n\nThe event -- called the \"Moral Budget Vigil\" and organized by the Georgetown University Center on Faith and Justice, Sojourners, Skinner Leadership Institute and the National African American Clergy Network -- included prayers, song and scripture. A meeting with Democratic senators followed.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who is also a reverend at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, criticized the budget for \"giving wealthy people a tax cut.\"\n\n\"Show me your budget and I'll show you who you think matters and who does not -- who you think is dispensable,\" Warnock said. \"My mind and my imagination and my heart had been arrested by the heartbeat of children who should not lose their food and who should not lose healthcare in order to give wealthy people a tax cut.\"\n\nThe budget, which the White House calls the \"Big, Beautiful Bill,\" cleared the U.S. House in May by a narrow margin. It would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and could add trillions to the national debt, according to analysts.\n\nFaith leaders claim the bill would also cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program -- or SNAP -- and Medicaid coverage for millions of low-income children, families and people with disabilities.\n\nTrump has said he only wants to eliminate \"waste, fraud and abuse\" from the Medicaid program and would not make direct cuts to benefits.

Acting US Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba announced the grand jury indictment in a post on X. Also Read | Sweet Launch for Shubhanshu Shukla! From Halwa to Aamras, Know What Food Indian Astronaut Is Carrying to ISS for Axiom-4 Mission. \"While people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve,\" Habba said. McIver, a Democrat, had been charged in a complaint by Habba last month with two assault charges stemming from the May 9 visit to Newark's Delaney Hall — a 1,000-bed, privately owned facility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses as a detention centre.

McIver disputed the allegations as baseless and defended her presence at the facility as part of her authorised role as a member of Congress. Her lawyer, former US Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said in a statement that they would challenge the allegations \"head-on\" in court. \"The legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is -- political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,\" Fishman said. Habba said two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. A third has a maximum sentence of one year. She characterised the charges as \"forcibly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement officers.\" The indictment is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen President Donald Trump's administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey's largest city to court, tapping into the president's immigration crackdown and Democrats' efforts to respond. The prosecution of McIver is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. At the same visit that resulted in McIver's charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka is suing Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution. A nearly two-minute clip released by the Homeland Security Department shows McIver on the facility side of a chain-link fence just before the arrest of the mayor on the street side of the fence, where other people had been protesting. She and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point, her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word \"Police\" on it. It is not clear from police bodycam video whether that contact was intentional, incidental or a result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The complaint says she \"slammed\" her forearm into an agent then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him. New Jersey Reps Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez had joined McIver at the detention centre that day. They and Democrats have criticised the arrest and disputed the charges as well. By law, members of Congress are authorised to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority. McIver, 38, first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep Donald Payne Jr left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November. A Newark native, she served as the president of the Newark City Council from 2022 to 2024 and worked in the city's public schools before that.

Defendant made up the story out of whole cloth, and by using the word 'reportedly,' attempts to distance himself from what is a maliciously false and defamatory statement.'\n\nThey also claim that Figliuzzi made up the rumor because he has a 'clear animus' toward Patel, slamming his credentials for the job in a column previously, The New York Post reports. \n\nUltimately, the plaintiff alleges that 'as a partisan commentator, (Figliuzzi) was motivated to sensationalize, and in this case, fabricate a story to self-promotingly advance his own name recognition, at the expense of Director Patel.' \n\nThe network declined comment on the matter when reached by DailyMail.com Tuesday afternoon. \n\nFigliuzzi made the allegation in early May, just months into Patel's tenure as FBI Director, appointed by Donald Trump.\n\n'Reportedly, he's been visible at nightclubs far more than he has been on the seventh floor of the Hoover building,' Figliuzzi said on Morning Joe. \n\nLiberal journalist and co-host Jonathan Lemire introduced the mea culpa the following Monday, mentioning that Figliuzzi had been on the show before explaining that he had no proof about the nightclub comment.\n\n'At the end of that segment, Figliuzzi said that FBI Director Kash Patel has been more visible at nightclubs than the FBI headquarters. This was a misstatement. We have not verified that claim,' Lemire said.\n\nLemire then tossed to commercial break without any apology. \n\nThe FBI has declined comment on the matter. DailyMail.com has reached out to both the White House and MSNBC for comment. \n\nFigliuzzi told Lemire Friday that Patel frequents nightclubs more than he does the seventh floor of the Hoover building, where the FBI offices are located. \n\n'And there are reports that daily briefings to him have been changed from every day to maybe twice weekly,' he added. \n\nFigliuzzi explained that Patel's absence is a 'blessing and a curse,' due to his lack of experience in the field. \n\n'If he's really trying to run things without his experience, without any experience level, things could be bad. If he's not plugged in, things could be bad. But he's allowing agents to run things so we don't know where this is going,' Figliuzzi confessed. \n\nThe former FBI assistant director claimed Patel frequently splits his time between the office in Washington, DC, and his home in Las Vegas, citing reports from the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. \n\nFigliuzzi added that he's heard Patel decreased briefings from a daily schedule to only twice a week. \n\nHe concluded that the one word he keeps hearing in his circles is 'chaos' and revealed that employees don't know what's happening. \n\nPatel was an unlikely pick for the position, having no experience as an FBI agent. He began his career as a public defender and served in the Department of Justice as a national security prosecutor. \n\nHe was also an advisor on national security and senior counsel for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \n\nPatel founded The Kash Foundation and served as deputy director of National Intelligence before he was confirmed as the ninth Director of the FBI. \n\nHe's had a rocky journey thus far, coming under fire last week for announcing the arrest of Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan.\n\n'Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on charges of obstruction — after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,' Patel wrote on his official X account. \n\n'We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject — an illegal alien — to evade arrest.'\n\nThe post was then mysteriously deleted before it was reposted two hours later without explanation. \n\nJudge Dugan was arrested and charged with two felony counts of obstruction and concealing an individual for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant from getting arrested after he appeared in her courtroom. \n\nPatel also came under fire from Senate Democrats who recently launched an inquiry into his personal travel on a government aircraft, CBS News reported. \n\nRumors swirled that Patel used the FBI's private fleet of jets to visit his girlfriend and attend sporting events, including a UFC fight and a hockey game, where he was pictured sitting next to Wayne Gretzky.","summary":"Frank Figliuzzi, ex-assistant director at the FBI after serving as a special agent for 25 years, said on Morning Joe last month that Patel spends much of his time out clubbing.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14799745/kash-patel-fbi-director-sues-reporter-nightclub-smear-frank-figliuzzi.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/10/22/99238021-0-image-a-8_1749591244138.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 23:36:04","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

I love riding my mountain bike in the Shell Ridge Open Space. However, with my bike out of commission, I borrowed my brother’s old touring bike and enjoyed getting reacquainted with the many dedicated bike trails. This infrastructure for biking was not available when I was a kid. What a gift to have this trail system for so many user groups.\n\nI am, however, dismayed by all the kids riding electric bikes on relatively flat trails. Kids are in their physical prime, but instead of enjoying the exhilaration of using their own strength, they are simply pulling back on a throttle with no effort expended or skills developed.

From Seattle to Austin and Washington, D.C., marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices. While many were peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds. Also Read | Sweet Launch for Shubhanshu Shukla! From Halwa to Aamras, Know What Food Indian Astronaut Is Carrying to ISS for Axiom-4 Mission. Activists are planning more and even larger demonstrations in the coming days, with \"No Kings\" events across the country on Saturday to coincide with Trump's planned military parade through Washington. The Trump administration said it would continue its programme of raids and deportations despite the protests. \"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) will continue to enforce the law,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted Tuesday on social media.

A look at some protests across the country: Austin Four Austin police officers were injured and authorities used chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators on Monday night that moved between the state Capitol and a federal building that houses an ICE office. State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour early in anticipation of the protest. Austin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint. The demonstrators then started throwing rocks, bottles and other objects at a police barricade, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said. Three officers were injured by \"very large\" rocks and another was injured while making an arrest, she said. Austin police arrested eight people, and state police arrested five more. Davis said her department is prepared for Saturday's planned protest downtown. \"We support peaceful protest,\" Davis said. \"When that protest turns violent, when it turns to throwing rocks and bottles ... that will not be tolerated. Arrests will be made.\" Dallas A protest that drew hundreds to a rally on a city bridge lasted for several hours on Monday night before Dallas police declared it an \"unlawful assembly\" and warned people to leave or face possible arrest. Dallas police initially posted on social media that officers would not interfere with a \"lawful and peaceful assembly of individuals or groups expressing their First Amendment rights.\" But officers later moved in and media reported seeing some in the crowd throw objects as officers used pepper spray and smoke to clear the area. At least one person was arrested. \"Peaceful protesting is legal,\" Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, posted on X. \"But once you cross the line, you will be arrested.\" San Francisco About 200 protesters gathered outside the San Francisco Immigration Court on Tuesday after activists said several arrests were made there. That gathering came after protests on Sunday and Monday swelled to several thousand demonstrators and saw more than 150 arrests with outbreaks of violence that included vandalised buildings, and damaged cars, police vehicles and buses. Police said two officers suffered non-life threatening injuries. Most of the arrests were Sunday night. \"Individuals are always free to exercise their First Amendment rights in San Francisco, but violence, especially against SFPD officers, will never be tolerated,\" San Francisco police posted on social media. Police described Monday's march as \"overwhelmingly peaceful,\" but said \"two small groups broke off and committed vandalism and other criminal acts.\" Several people were detained or arrested, police said. Seattle About 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said, \"Free Them All; Abolish ICE\" and \"No to Deportations.\" The protest was initially peaceful but protesters began putting scooters in front of building entryways before police arrived. Mathieu Chabaud, with Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Washington, said they were there in solidarity with the Los Angeles protesters, \"and to show that we're opposed to ICE in our community.\" Legal advocates who normally attend the immigration court hearings as observers and to provide support to immigrants were not allowed inside the building. Security guards also turned away the media. The hearings are normally open to the public. Chicago In Chicago, a small crowd gathered on Tuesday outside immigration court in downtown and called for an end to Trump administration immigration sweeps and military presence in California. \"With the militarisation of Los Angeles it's time to get out and let Trump know this is unacceptable,\" said retiree Gary Snyderman. \"All of this is so unconstitutional.\" The group then marched through downtown streets drumming and chanting, \"No more deportations!\" Santa Ana In Santa Ana near Los Angeles, armoured vehicles blocked the road on Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Centre, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices. Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass from Monday's protests. Tiny shards of red, black and purple glass littered the pavement. Nearby buildings and the sidewalk were tagged with profane graffiti slogans against ICE and had Trump's name crossed out. A worker rolled paint over graffiti on a wall to block it out. National Guard officers wearing fatigues and carrying rifles prevented people from entering the area unless they worked there. While a small group kept up their demonstration on Tuesday, several counter-protesters showed up. One man wore a red T-shirt and Make America Great Again cap as he exchanged words with the crowd opposing the raids. Boston Hundreds of people gathered in Boston's City Hall Plaza on Monday to protest the detainment of union leader David Huerta Friday during immigration raids in Los Angeles. Protesters held signs reading \"Massachusetts stands with our neighbours in Los Angeles\" and \"Protect our immigrant neighbours,\" and shouted, \"Come for one, come for all\" and \"Free David, free them all.\" Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, was released from federal custody later Monday on USD 50,000 bond. \"An immigrant does not stand between an American worker and a good job, a billionaire does,\" said Chrissy Lynch, President of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO. Washington, D.C. Several unions gathered on Monday in Washington to protest the raids and rally for Huerta's release, and marched past the Department of Justice building. Among the demonstrators was US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state. \"Enough of these mass ICE raids that are sweeping up innocent people,\" Jayapal said. \"As we see people exercising the constitutional rights to peacefully use their voices to speak out against this injustice, they are being met with tear gas and rubber bullets.\" (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)","summary":"Get latest articles and stories on World at LatestLY.

So I think ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] is our second-largest partner after the mainland the mutual attraction is already there – strengthen it,” the city’s leader told SCMP on Sunday.\n\nSCMP Managing Editor Yonden Lhatoo took the analogy further, suggesting that girls’ families may be focused on preventing such relationships, in an apparent reference to US trade turmoil.\n\n“But there are a lot of girls,” Lee said, adding there are many options such as the Middle East. “We’ve already decided to not just singly focus on the US market.”\n\nThe dating analogy has been employed by senior officials repeatedly over the past year. Last June, Lee said that attracting large-scale events to the city was akin to “chasing good women.” This March, talent matching efforts were compared to dating by the labour chief. Weeks later, the justice chief said national security education was an ongoing process, comparable to how one treats their spouse beyond Valentine’s Day.\n\n‘That is Hong Kong’\n\nLee said that there were no plans to enter a tit-for-tat trade war with the US following the imposition of tariffs by US President Donald Trump. Instead, the city would remain a free port, he said.\n\nHong Kong had to primarily focus on national development, but will also foster international connectivity through the One Country, Two Systems framework. “We continue to be bilingual – and, hopefully multilingual – we continue to maintain our way of life, we continue to maintain zero customs, our own law and also openness.”\n\n“There is no control on capital, no control on people, no control on data – that is Hong Kong.”\n\nIt comes weeks after it emerged that multiple independent media outlets were facing simultaneous tax audits.\n\nHong Kong has been seeking to reboot its economy after registering annual deficits in three of the past four years. Its economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent last year.\n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps\n\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team","summary":"Chief Executive John Lee has compared Hong Kong&#8217;s economic outreach efforts to attracting women.
