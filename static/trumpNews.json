I said no such thing.’\n\nThen Kudrow scoffs as the interviewer began reading back what she had just said about Ukraine, before doubling down and interjecting, ‘There’s no such place as Ukraine.’\n\n‘Yes, there is,’ he replies in shock, but the spokeswoman shoots back, ‘I choose to believe there is not.’\n\nSeveral viewers in the replies saw in Kudrow a shocking resemblance to Leavitt, both physically and in her defensive tone, though Leavitt wasn’t working as the White House Press Secretary until the second Trump administration, years after the Netflix special was released.\n\n‘This is GREAT! Kudrow perfectly captured the Karoline Leavitt person — right down to the long bond hair and vapid smile,’ wrote one user who felt there was a strong similarity.\n\nOne viewer praised the clip as ‘freaking awesome’ and said that Kudrow’s performance as a fake PR specialist was ‘probably the best thing I’ve seen since Tina Fey did Sarah Palin’ on Saturday Night Live. \n\nOther posters praised the clip as ‘brilliant,’ ‘on point’ and ‘perfect.’\n\nOne user complained that Americans were forced to ‘literally listen to this everyday.’\n\n‘MAGA believe and stake their lives on memes, but call any reporting or data into question and often see document records as a compelling reason to believe the opposite of what they indicate,’ they added.\n\nAnother viewers said they had ‘given up’ on trying to reason with Trump’s most vocal fans, which they seemed to think the clip effectively illustrated.\n\n‘I don’t know what is up in their heads, but it is not brains or the gift of reason,’ they seethed. ‘I am beginning to believe that they are not just stupid and ignorant, but they just do not take in any information that is going to challenge their current mindset.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLisa Kudrow had fans in stitches after her appearance in 2020 political&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Lisa Kudrow of Friends Fame Gains Viral Attention for Spot-On MAGA Spokesperson Impersonation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/lisa-kudrow-of-friends-fame-gains-viral-attention-for-spot-on-maga-spokesperson-impersonation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Friends-star-Lisa-Kudrow-goes-viral-over-MAGA-spokesperson-impression.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 01:17:55","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.04},{"id":350547406,"title":"'Ties With India, Pakistan Remain Unchanged': US State Department Says Committed To Both","text":"Washington’s relationship with India and Pakistan remains unchanged, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said during a media address on Wednesday, adding that the diplomats are committed to both nations.\nHer remark came while she was questioned about Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir’s recent visit to the United States and his nuclear threats against India.\nSpeaking at the State Department briefing, Bruce stated that “We had an experience with Pakistan and India.

During Tuesday afternoon's briefing, a journalist asked the White House press secretary : \"The president said - I'm quoting him - yesterday, twice, that he planned to go to Russia. Was that a verbal slip-up, or does he actually plan to go to Russia?\" Leavitt replied in a deliberate tone : \"Perhaps there are plans in the future to travel to Russia. And on Friday, the president will be meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska, as you know.\" Footage of that exchange spread across X, sparking furious MAGA critics to hurl dementia accusations at the president. \"The reality is Trump's having bouts of dementia,\" one commented beneath a post containing the press conference clip. \"Dementia Don,\" another branded Trump. \"A follow up, DOES TRUMP have dementia?\" one insisted. The Irish Star reports anoter wrote: \"Trump clearly has dementia.\" The White House has repeatedly dismissed speculation that Trump experiences cognitive deterioration or displays dementia symptoms, referencing an April medical assessment from the president's yearly check-up. The president's healthcare professionals declared his mental faculties sound, whilst Trump himself has maintained that he has undertaken cognitive evaluations, which he claimed he completed with outstanding results. Leavitt lambasted for not acknowledging Trump's blunder. Several X users criticised Leavitt for her refusal to acknowledge that Trump had made a mistake, with some even suggesting that her job could be in jeopardy if she were to make such admissions. \"LOL. She literally can't say that Trump made any errors. Nobody can in the administration. If they do, they will ultimately be fired,\" one speculated. \"If Leavitt is speaking, she is lying,\" another boldly asserted. \"What a bulls--- response,\" a third user exclaimed. Trump asserts he's meeting Putin in Alaska. Trump was labelled as \"embarrassing\" after seemingly mistakenly stating that he was going to meet Putin in Russia on Friday. The meeting is actually scheduled to occur in Alaska. The gaffe occurred during a press conference in the Oval Office where Trump was discussing his promised clampdown on crime in Washington. \"It's embarrassing for me to be up here. You know, I'm going to see Putin,\" he said. \"I'm going to see Russia on Friday. I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was.\" The clip was shared on X, where users berated the president for the misstatement. \"Wait, did he give Alaska back to Putin already?\" one commented. \"He already handed alaska over to russia,\" another penned. \"Wait, so Alaska is now Russia? ? ?\" one quote retweeted. Another commenter chimed in: \"Wait a second; has the Trump-Putin summit location been rearranged or has the Trump administration just announced they've ceded Alaska to Russia?\" An additional user penned, \"You're embarrassing our country.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"During a press briefing Monday afternoon, Donald Trump claimed that he would be travelling to Russia to meet Putin","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/us-news/karoline-leavitt-scrambles-fix-donald-35720506","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35720505.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/1_Trump-25224618303093.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 00:51:57","author":"Alexandra Snow,Jeremiah Hassel","authors":["Alexandra Snow","Jeremiah Hassel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.116},{"id":350545036,"title":"Kathy Griffin's new facelift REVEALED: Star shows off youthful look in Malibu after undergoing third procedure","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Clarkson bombshell as Brandon Blackstock obituary reveals he was in a relationship with her 'assistant'\n\nNow Rachel Reeves plots inheritance tax raid on Middle England to plug huge gap in public finances as Tories blast Labour's 'politics of envy'\n\nPrince Andrew 'barks foul-mouthed question at builders' as speed humps are installed near his palatial home\n\nMy night of misery in A&E for a broken ankle left me in tears.

(Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Paramount+)\nGetty Images for Paramount+\n\nIt’s still unclear if South Park Season 27, Episode 3 will be on Comedy Central and Paramount+ this week.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone’s new season featuring Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny kicked off on July 23 with a controversial South Park-style skewering of President Donald Trump, then went on hiatus the following week.\n\nForbesJames Gunn’s ‘Superman’ New On Streaming This Week, Director SaysBy Tim Lammers\n\nOn Aug. 6, the show returned with its comedic crosshairs aimed once again at Trump, as well as Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\n\nThanks to the Parker and Stone’s blockbuster deal with Paramount Global worth $1.5 billion to produce 50 new episodes of the series over the next five years, South Park’s new episodes are generally set to air on Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET/PT on Comedy Central on cable and stream exclusively on Paramount+ the next day.\n\nAs of Tuesday, however, the South Park X account is still being silent about when Season 27, Episode 3 is coming out. Various press outlets have different answers about when the episode will air. Newsweek reported that Episode 3 won’t air on Comedy Central until Wednesday, Aug. 20, while Esquire said it would air on Wednesday, Aug. 13. IMDb went with a completely different date, noting that Episode 3 will be airing on Friday, Aug. 15.\n\nForbesWhy Does Wendy From ‘Alien: Earth’ Look So Familiar?By Tim Lammers\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPrior to the show going on hiatus for a week after the airing of Episode 1 on July 23, fans were treated to promo on X that indicated the show was returning on Aug. 6. On Aug. 5 the South Park account teased Episode 2, titled Got a Nut, along with photos of Noem and Mr. Mackay at an ICE raid and Cartman on his laptop in his bedroom.\n\nAt some point — hopefully on Tuesday night or Wednesday during the day — Comedy Central and Paramount+ will confirm when Season 27, Episode 3 will air. Given that there’s been no teasers for the new episode released yet, it seems likely that South Park is taking yet another one-week hiatus and return on Aug. 20 on Comedy Central and Aug. 21 on Paramount+.\n\nOne more indication that a new episode isn’t coming is that a teaser video on Comedy Central touting “South Park Day” on Aug. 13 doesn’t mention a new episode.\nForbesWhat Time Does ‘Alien: Earth’ Begin Streaming? How To WatchBy Tim Lammers\n\nInstead, the promotion notes that Comedy Central will be airing South Park episodes all day long, as well interview clips from the show’s attendees at San Diego Comic Con last month. The teaser video notes that the South Park marathon is leading up to a re-airing of South Park’s first episode.\n\nIn additon, Paramount+ has not been forthcoming with its release schedule for South Park Season 27, as an email to the show’s PR team about its release schedule after the premiere episode went unanswered.\n\n‘South Park’ Posted The End Credits Scene For ‘Got A Nut’ On Monday\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem was the prime target of the mockery on the Aug. 6 episode, as Parker and Stone continuously poked fun at Noem by showing her face melting and shooting puppies — a reference to an admission in her book in 2024 about shooting her “extremely dangerous” family dog.\n\nThe most recent post on the South Park’s X account happened on Monday, when the end credits sequence that wasn’t ready for Comedy Central viewers — but made the cut on Paramount+ — was posted. The scene continues the episode’s running gag about Noem shooting puppies.\nForbes‘Wednesday’ Season 2 Animator Details Show’s Haunting Stop-Motion SceneBy Tim Lammers\n\nIn the episode, the South Park version of Noem guided raids by masked agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Among the new agents recruited by ICE was South Park Elementary School councilor Mr. Mackay. The face-melting jokes particularly rankled Noem, who called the show’s portrayal of her “lazy” and “petty.”\n\nOn the other hand, Vice President JD Vance took his mockery in stride, responding to a South Park post on X by saying, “Well, I’ve finally made it.”\nForbes‘Wednesday’ Season 2 Draws Massive Viewership Numbers In First WeekBy Tim Lammers\n\nIn the episode, Vance was part of a Fantasy Island scenario where President Donald Trump, wearing a white suit a la Mr. Rourke (Ricardo Montalban), greeted visitors at his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. Vance played Trump’s diminutive assistant, reminiscent of Rourke’s diminutive assistant, Tattoo (Hervé Villechaize).\n\nLook for reports on South Park Season 27, Episode 3 when the information is formally released by Comedy Central and Paramount+.\nForbesWhy Does Isadora From ‘Wednesday’ Season 2 Look So Familiar?By Tim Lammers\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"It’s still unclear if \"South Park\" Season 27, Episode 3 will be on Comedy Central and Paramount+ this week.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2025/08/12/when-will-south-park-season-27-return-with-episode-3/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/688418242a7c66f9de7d09d1/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 00:32:07","author":"Contributor,Tim Lammers","authors":["Contributor","Tim Lammers"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":350545030,"title":"Why Brooklyn Beckham and wife Nicola Peltz didn't invite his brothers Romeo and Cruz to their lavish second wedding amid his family feud","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Aug 13th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly Clarkson bombshell as Brandon Blackstock obituary reveals he was in a relationship with her 'assistant'\n\nNow Rachel Reeves plots inheritance tax raid on Middle England to plug huge gap in public finances as Tories blast Labour's 'politics of envy'\n\nPrince Andrew 'barks foul-mouthed question at builders' as speed humps are installed near his palatial home\n\nMy night of misery in A&E for a broken ankle left me in tears.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy BETHAN EDWARDS, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:17 BST, 13 August 2025 |Updated:01:30 BST, 13 August 2025 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham and wife Nicola Peltz recently had a lavish 'second' wedding, however his parents David and Victoria were noticeably absent from the guest list.\nPosh and Becks weren't the only family members of Brooklyn's missing from the 200 people guest list, as his brothers Romeo, 22, and Cruz, 20, were also not invited. \nThe brothers absence was reportedly down to a series of online 'trolling' from the duo, according to those close to Brooklyn and Nicola. \nA friend told The Mirror: 'Brooklyn's brothers have been fanning the flames..they've openly made fun of and trolled Brooklyn in comments on social media.' \nEarlier this year, Cruz seemed to issue yet another swipe at elder brother Brooklyn after declaring the 'truth would unfold' amid the family's bitter fallout.\nShortly after posting the pointed lyrics from The Beatles 1969 song, he took to social media once again to upload a video of himself playing the guitar.\n\nBrooklyn Beckham and wife Nicola Peltz recently had a lavish 'second' wedding, however his parents David and Victoria were noticeably absent from the guest list\n\nHowever Posh and Becks weren't the only family members of Brooklyn's missing from the 200 people guest list, as his brothers Romeo, 22, and Cruz, 20, were also not invited\nWhile the post quickly garnered more than 15,000 likes on TikTok, it also attracted a series of comments from trolls - with Cruz quick to hit back.\nOne commented: 'Are you going to stick with this job or going to become a race car driver next or something?'\nTo which Cruz - seemingly throwing shade at his brother Brooklyn's many career paths - responded: 'Wrong brother mate'.\nOver the years, Brooklyn has tried his hand at several different careers from modelling, to photography to becoming a chef and most recently training as a Formula E driver.\nIt is unknown why the simple social media comments would have bothered Brooklyn to that extent.\nThe actress has previously been accused of 'isolating' Brooklyn from not only his family, but his friends too.\nAs well as Posh, Becks and his brothers, Brooklyn's sister Harper, his grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles were also absent and only found out about the wedding vow renewal by reading it online.\nThe Peltz's friend was responding to questions as to why it was necessary to ban the whole Beckham family from the wedding celebration on August 2. \n\nThe brothers absence was reportedly down to a series of online 'trolling' from the duo, according to those close to Brooklyn and Nicola; pictured 2023\n\nCruz seemed to issue yet another swipe at elder brother Brooklyn earlier this year after declaring the 'truth would unfold' amid the family's bitter fallout\n\nCruz was asked: 'Are you going to stick with this job or going to become a race car driver next or something?' To which Cruz - seemingly throwing shade at his brother Brooklyn's many career paths - responded: 'Wrong brother mate'\n\nOver the years, Brooklyn has tried his hand at several different careers from modelling, to photography to becoming a chef and most recently training as a Formula E driver\n\nEXCLUSIVE KATIE HIND: Beckham friends' verdict on wife Nicola and who's really pulling the strings \nAs one insider said: 'They are trying to make the best decisions for them in what are very unfortunate circumstances. Navigating family stuff is hard and it's ugly.'\nAstonishingly, they still claim to hope for a reconciliation, the pal added: 'The door is open. No one wants to see this kind of pain exist. There is always hope. At the end of the day. Blood is thicker than water.'\nDaily Mail has contacted Brooklyn, Nicola and the Beckhams' representatives for comment. \nBrooklyn and wife Nicola, who first wed in 2022, said 'I do' for a second time in Westchester County in front of her family who had key roles in the day, with the Beckham clan nowhere in sight. \nNicola wore her 70-year-old mother's vintage 1985 bridal gown for the big day, while her father Nelson, 83, was given the key role of officiating. \nBrooklyn become increasingly estranged from his family since he snubbed his father's 50th birthday, and now, the family fear it's a final kick in the teeth.\nA source told The Sun: 'This was the final kick in the teeth for David and Victoria. Seeing Nelson having such a pivotal role at the ceremony was heartbreaking for David especially. Not one member of the 30-plus extended family knew about the wedding, or were invited.\n'His grandparents are devastated too as Brooklyn has always been so close to them.'\nThe source added: 'It feels cruel and spiteful. This is no longer a game. It has gone beyond all that. This is a family who feel they have lost their precious boy - and see no way back. \n'Honestly, they are now questioning why he even wants to keep the ‘Beckham’ surname - will he revert to Peltz? August 2nd 2025 - is this the day Brooklyn formally declared himself no longer a part of the Beckham family? It certainly feels like it.'.\n\nA friend close to the Peltz's said: 'Why punish the whole family for what is essentially a fall-out with just the mum and dad. They are trying to make the best decisions for them in what are very unfortunate circumstances'\n\nAs well as Posh, Becks and his brothers, Brooklyn's sister Harper, his grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles were also absent and only found out about the wedding vow renewal by reading it online (family seen before feud) \n\nBrooklyn and wife Nicola , who first wed in 2022, said 'I do' for a second time on August 2 in Westchester County in front of her family who had key roles in the day, with the Beckham clan nowhere in sight (their engagement post pictured)\nDaily Mail has contacted Brooklyn, Nicola and the Beckhams' representatives for comment. \nBrooklyn and Nicola first tied the knot in a lavish £3million ceremony in 2022, when relations first began to sour with his parents in the run-up to the big day. \nAfter shunning a dress made by her fashion designer Victoria mother-in-law in favour of a Valentino gown in 2022 - a choice which wasn’t well received - Nicola once again snubbed the Spice Girl and wore her mother Claudia's vintage wedding gown.\n\n Romeo Beckham seen on budget Jet2 flight after brother Brooklyn's gratuitous show of wealth \nIt is a poignant message to Posh and Becks', whom he and Nicola have grown increasingly estranged over recent months.\nAll the while the Beckhams were said to be upset by the Peltz's in 2022 who they felt were taking over the wedding. \nAnd ever since their first big nuptials in April 2022, the two families have not reunited and Nicola has rarely been pictured with the Beckhams.\nThe couple shared the images on Instagram on Monday, alongside the words 'only love.'\nNicola wore the same original $1.8mill ring set adding a glinting filter onto the dazzling jewels.\nBrooklyn described the vow renewal as a 'really beautiful experience' while admitting he is still head-over-heels for his wife. \nSpeaking for the first time about the day, the 26-year-old admitted he'd happily do it 'every single day' if he could.\nBrooklyn said the moment was all about creating a 'really cute memory' they'd treasure forever.\nVictoria BeckhamCruz BeckhamDavid Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nWhy Brooklyn Beckham and wife Nicola Peltz didn't invite his brothers Romeo and Cruz to their lavish second wedding amid his family feud\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CIARA FARMER, ASSISTANT SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:01:19 BST, 13 August 2025 |Updated:01:29 BST, 13 August 2025 \n\nBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola's Peltz's vow renewal was a glamorous affair packed with family, fashion and friends earlier this month. \nYet as more pictures of both the big day and the after-party come to light, it is becoming increasingly more apparent that the festivities were fairly one-sided - with most of the guestlist comprising Brooklyn's post-Nicola peers and pals. \nThe most glaring absence came from Brooklyn's family - mum Victoria, 51, dad David, 50, brothers Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20 and his sister Harper, 14 - due to the ongoing feud rumbling among the group, who were not informed of the vow renewal. \nWhile his family are holidaying in St Tropez, Brooklyn partied the night away at his wife's family's estate in Westchester County on August 2, with Nicola's family, members of her glam squad, her acting coach and fellow actors. \nAbsent were former members of Brooklyn's entourage - including fellow nepobabies Rocco Richie and Gordon Ramsay's brood, his brother Romeo's girlfriend Kim Turnbull and yet more superstar offspring in Anais Gallagher. \n\nAs ever the couple made no secret of their love with PDA \n\nMany of the guests were affiliated with Nicola - a far cry from their first wedding, where both families took front and centre\n\nThe most glaring absence came from Brooklyn's family - mum Victoria, 51, dad David, 50, brothers Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20 and his sister Harper, 14 - due to the ongoing feud rumbling among the group, who were not informed of the vow renewal\n\nAnother nepo baby Brooklyn mixed with back in the day was Noel Gallagher and Meg Mathews' daughter Anais (pictured in 2017)\n\nA pal Brooklyn made through his family links was Jack Ramsay, who is the son of celebrity chef Gordon and his wife Tana (pictured in 2019)\nThe lack of Brooklyn's side sparked widespread chat on social media, including comments from fans who likened their relationship to that of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle - after the royal turned his back on his family and moved to the US.\nWhen Brooklyn and Nicola first tied the knot in 2022, they hosted a three-day Palm Beach extravaganza, which saw 500 guests party in no-expense-spared marquees in front of the ocean - where both families stood front and centre. \nFast-forward three years and the change is remarkable, with no sign of the Beckham parents or the siblings Brooklyn held so close to his heart. \nIn their place is the entirety of the Peltz clan - with Nicola's mother Claudia, 70, and her father Nelson, 83, holding all-star roles on the day. \nAt the 2022 festivities, during the Hora - also known as the Jewish wedding chair dance - where the bride and groom are lifted on chairs while guests dance around them in a circle, David was also lifted up on a seat. \nBrooklyn's brothers acted as his Dior-clad groomsmen at the event although their positions have officially been occupied by the in-laws. \nNicola has six brothers, all of whom Brooklyn is fond however he is very close to her brother Diesel, who introduced him to his bride.\nAs well as swapping siblings, it has also been revealed that Brooklyn has shunned some of his old friends - as illustrated by his wedding pictures. \n\nIn yet another show kinship among the Peltz clan, both Brookyln and Nicola posted a picture showing them posing with her ice hockey player brother Brad Peltz \n\nNicola has grown up surrounded by the support of her six brothers, and previously revealed that it was actually her sibling Diesel who introduced her to Brooklyn (the couple are pictured with Nicola's brother Will in 2022)\n\n Romeo Beckham seen on budget Jet2 flight after brother Brooklyn's gratuitous show of wealth \nSources close to the Beckhams previously stated that they have concern that Nicola holds disproportionate sway in her marriage to their son.\nThey said: 'They think Nicola is a bit of a horror but she isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Nicola loves having Brooklyn at her side and she loves him very much. But he is also very useful.\n'The wider Beckham family and Brooklyn's friends – many of whom he no longer sees – take the view that he does what Nicola wants. From Beckhams' point of view, it's not nice to watch.'\nOne group shot from the wedding featured a host of guests seemingly known only to Brooklyn via his wife, thanks to their presence in the acting and beauty worlds. \nOne playful shot gave a glimpse into the guestlist, including real estate agent Anthony Barillo, creative branding agency owner Dominic J West, make-up artist Georgi Sandev, 'colourist to the stars' Daniel Moon and Benny Buckley. \n\nNicola and Brooklyn renewed their vows from a distant \n\nDavid and Victoria have been languishing abroad while their son celebrates elsewhere \n\nCreative director and photographer Hunter Moreno, designer Eran Shapov and Ariel Shapov were also in the picture.\nNicola has grown up surrounded by the support of her six brothers, and she previously revealed that it was actually her sibling Diesel who introduced her to Brooklyn.\n'I actually met Brooklyn like six years ago at Coachella, through one of my brothers; his name is Diesel,' the actress revealed in an interview with Wonderland Magazine in 2022.\nShe recalled how the now-married couple were both with other partners at the time, admitting: 'We really didn't get along. He had a girlfriend and I had a boyfriend, and we just didn't click at all.'\n'Diesel was like, \"Oh my friend Brooklyn wants to crash at our house\", because all my brothers rented a house for Coachella. We barely interacted. We look back at pictures, like group pictures, and I'm with my boyfriend and Brooklyn's in the corner.' \nBrooklyn Beckham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBrooklyn Beckham's NEW inner circle unveiled at vow renewal... as he turns his back on family and friends in favour of wife Nicola Peltz's brothers, glam squad and acting pals\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Security Council meeting where Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country’s ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n\nPanama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is “minimal cyber security, maximum exposure.”\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China.\n\nThe U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nChina’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that “Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade.”\n\n“China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation,” he said.\n\nActing U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its “outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations.”\n\nAlluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, “China’s expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce.” She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them.\n\n“China’s influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security,” Shea said.\n\nThe Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc.\n\n“The United States’ fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal,” Ambassador Fu said.

to a mixed martial arts bout on July 4 next year, the day the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its founding, UFC boss Dana White said Tuesday.President Donald Trump has been a regular guest at the often-bloody contests, where fighters punch, kick and grapple with their opponent in a no-holds-barred battle to submission or knockout.Bringing the brutal combat sport to the center of US political power will mark a historic first.\"It is definitely going to happen,\" White, a high-profile supporter of the US president, told CBS television.\"I talked to him last night -- 'him' being the president -- and I'm flying out there at the end of this month, and I'm going to sit down and walk him through all the plans and the renderings, and we're going to start deciding what he wants and doesn't want.\"Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is the largest and most successful organization in the burgeoning world of MMA, a blend of martial arts disciplines like jiu-jitsu, kickboxing, boxing and wrestling.Bouts take place in an eight-sided ring -- dubbed \"The Octagon\" -- bounded by a chainlink fence.With few exceptions -- like eye-gouging -- male and female fighters are allowed to employ almost any technique to attack their opponent.Fights often end with a prone fighter being pummeled in the face as they lie on the bloodied floor, before the referee steps in to stop the action.The shaven-headed White, who has regularly spoken warmly of Trump as both a friend and a political leader, said the president's daughter would be involved in organizing the Independence Day spectacle at the White House.\"When (Trump) called me and asked me to do it, he said: 'I want Ivanka in the middle of this,'\" White told CBS, whose parent company Paramount has just signed a $7.7 billion streaming deal with UFC.White took over the UFC in 2001 when it was a small, loss-making organization, shepherding it into one of the fastest-growing sports promotion companies in the world.The sport's popularity with young men -- a key demographic in the 2024 US election -- and Trump's long association with the UFC, have made the president a regular fixture at some of its more high-profile events, where he is greeted like a rock star.Its brutal nature and high injury rate mean the sport is controversial, with doctors decrying the potential for brain damage amongst fighters who are repeatedly hit in the head, though it has gained increasing mainstream acceptance in recent years.","summary":"The White House is to play host to a mixed martial arts bout on July 4 next year,

15-minute walk from the White House, Tony and Mike stood on the sidewalk near the spot where a man was killed on Monday, the 100th murder of the year in Washington.The shooting broke out just a few hours after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the US capital, which Trump described as overrun by crime -- though official data shows that violence has recently decreased.\"It's sickening,\" Tony told AFP early Tuesday. \"It's not safe anymore.\"\"You do need change, you do need help,\" Mike said.But Mike added that the city does not need the help Trump is sending in -- \"not National Guards.\"The day after Trump's press conference, residents of the area near the city center told stories of drug sales on the street, but were skeptical that federal intervention would make a difference.Tony has always lived in the area and, like the other residents interviewed, did not want to give his last name.He described a local street corner as an \"open air market\" with \"all the drugs that you want.\"Anne, who was holding pruning shears as she weeded, said needles are often discovered in the flowerbed of the church on the corner.It was near this spot that Tymark Wells, 33, was shot around 7:00 pm Monday before later dying in hospital, according to a police report that did not mention a motive or suspect.The area is the \"wild wild West and it's always been like that,\" said Lauren, who lives in a building nearby.\"We're so desensitized,\" the 42-year-old added.When Trump announced his DC plan, he said it was \"becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness.\"However the Department of Justice said in January that violent crime in Washington recently hit its lowest level in 30 years.Because of easy access to guns in the United States, the crime number still \"may look differently in America than it does in other parts of the world,\" Brianne Nadeau, a member of DC's overwhelmingly Democratic city council, told AFP.\"But we have made substantial strides here,\" she said, calling Trump's federal takeover a \"political stunt.\"The annual number of homicides in the city peaked at 274 in 2023, before falling to 187 last year. That is still one of the highest per capita homicide rates in the country.Trump also justified the takeover by citing the number of homeless people in the city.Ace, a 16-year-old walking her dog, said the presence of the homeless contributed to the feeling of insecurity.Sometimes unhoused people would get on top of her parents' car, she said. \"You don't know if they are going to break in.\"While waiting for the National Guard, around 850 federal agents were deployed to Washington on Monday, making 23 arrests, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\"This is only the beginning,\" she said.Terry Cole, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration tasked with leading the federal takeover of the city's police, said patrolling would be ramped up.Federal agents and police will work \"hand in hand\" during these patrols, Cole added.The city's Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has been forced to accommodate the takeover, said this approach is \"the wrong way to do it.\"Federal agents do not go out on patrol, she said. \"That's not what they're trained to do.\"Tom, who lives near the scene of Monday's shooting, told AFP there were not enough police patrols in the area.But he also criticized Trump's \"draconian approach,\" saying it was unlikely to \"yield any good results.\"Across the street, a small memorial stood in tribute to a different shooting victim.A picture of a young Black man has been wrapped around a tree, with flowers arrayed at its base.Turell Delonte, 30, was shot dead by police at the spot in 2023, after he was suspected of drug trafficking.","summary":"A 15-minute walk from the White House, Tony and Mike stood on the sidewalk near the spot where a man was killed on Monday, the 100th murder of the year in Washington.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/washingtonians-tired-crime-skeptical-trump-takeover-3780754","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4615777/federal-agents-patrol-streets-us-capital-washington-after-president-donald-trump-announced.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=1f664acd154c3a2b38936784c559e390","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 00:15:14","author":"Ulysse Bellier","authors":["Ulysse Bellier"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.383},{"id":350543610,"title":"Trump's DC public safety sweep results in 23 arrests including murder suspect on opening day","text":"On the first day of President Donald Trump’s crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., federal and local authorities arrested 23 people, including suspects wanted for murder, gun offenses and other crimes. FBI Director Kash Patel, who endorsed Trump’s plans to take over the Metropolitan Police Department and tackle crime in the nation's capital, provided an update on the efforts in a post on X Tuesday evening. \"On the first big push of FBI supporting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump initiative to make DC safe again, FBI reported 10 arrests with partners,\" the director wrote. He said the 10 arrests included one for a search warrant on a prior murder charge. I SUPPORT TRUMP TAKING CONTROL OF DC POLICE — THE CONSTITUTION IS ON HIS SIDE The other arrests involved unlawful possession of firearms, outstanding warrants for driving under the influence, and one arrest for violating a restraining order. \"These are just a few examples — we are just getting started. Federal partners joined local police and arrested 23 in total,\" Patel wrote. \"When you let good cops be cops they can clean up our streets and do it fast. More to come. Your nation’s Capital WILL be safe again.\" On Monday, Trump said he would federalize the police department and place it under the authority of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in an effort to address crime. He also said he was activating approximately 800 National Guard troops to \"reestablish law, order and public safety\" in the capital. FBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL BACKS TRUMP'S DC POLICE TAKEOVER: 'WHEN YOU LET GOOD COPS BE COPS, THEY DELIVER' Democrats and local officials criticized the Trump administration for taking over law enforcement efforts in DC, saying the move is part of a power grab. Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser called the move \"unsettling and unprecedented.\" The District of Columbia Home Rule Act allows Trump to place the city's police department under federal control for up to 30 days. Bowser noted that granting D.C. statehood, an issue local officials have repeatedly advocated for, could have prevented the takeover. \"If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when the Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,\" she said. \"So, there are things that, when a city is not a state, and not fully autonomous, and doesn’t have senators, that the federal government can do.\" TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT Still, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro told reporters during a press conference on Tuesday afternoon that she wanted to get a sense of what was happening in D.C. and asked for the number of teens who have been shot and killed by gunfire. She shared a poster with several victims who were shot in 2024, all under the age of 20, noting that 29 individuals were shot and killed in the district, some as young as 3-years-old. Pirro also showed a poster of those under the age of 20 who were shot and killed in 2025, which totaled 16 victims. \"What this makes clear to me is that there is a whole community that is suffering because of the violent crime in this district, and anyone who wants to tell me that crime is down and that we don’t need an emergency focus on crimes of violence, all they need to do is take a look at this and talk to the loved ones and the family members of these individuals who were shot and killed under the age of 20,\" Pirro said.

Multiple sources familiar with the security breach have revealed that the compromised systems house extremely sensitive material, including details of confidential informants and individuals facing national security charges. The precise perpetrator behind the cyber attack remains uncertain, with questions over whether a division of Russian intelligence services was responsible, or if any other nations played a role. Intelligence sources indicate the infiltration formed part of a prolonged campaign to penetrate the network. The security breach emerges as President Donald Trump prepares to conduct a peace summit in Alaska this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin . Amongst the queries executed during the cyber intrusion were mid-level criminal proceedings in the New York City region and various other districts, with several cases concerning individuals bearing Russian and Eastern European names, The New York Times reported. An internal departmental memorandum examined by The Times revealed that court officials had notified numerous Justice Department personnel, clerks, and chief judges across federal courts that \"persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.\" The officials also recommended these authorities swiftly extract the most classified documents from the network. \"This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action,\" officials penned, referencing guidance that the Justice Department had issued in early 2021 after the system was initially compromised, reports the Express US . Documents thought to have been targeted encompass cases related to criminal activity with international connections across at least eight district courts. Last month, chief judges of district courts nationwide were discreetly advised to transfer cases of this nature away from the standard document-management systems, according to officials privy to the request. Initially, they were instructed not to discuss the matter with other judges in their district, as reported by the Times. Peter Kaplan, a spokesperson for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which assists in managing the system, declined to comment when approached by the Times. The Justice Department has yet to respond to a request for comment on the issue. Federal officials are now hastily working to identify the patterns of the breach, evaluate the damages, and rectify the flaws in the colossal system, long known to possess significant vulnerabilities susceptible to exploitation by foreign adversaries. Trump announced on Monday that he anticipated determining within moments of his meeting with Putin this week whether it would be feasible to negotiate a deal to cease the war in Ukraine . During a press briefing at the White House, Trump said: \"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made.\" He described Friday's encounter with Putin in Alaska as what he anticipated would be \"really a feel-out meeting.\" Trump went on to say that \"it'll be good, but it might be bad\" and forecast he might declare, \"lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.\" Putin seeks to secure Russia's territorial advances since launching the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, whilst Trump pushes for a ceasefire that has remained elusive. Trump's keenness to broker an agreement has sparked concerns in Ukraine and across Europe about such a deal favouring Russia, without adequate Ukrainian involvement. Trump has alternately delivered scathing criticism of both leaders after pledging - and thus far failing - to rapidly conclude the conflict. On Monday, Trump avoided repeated opportunities to confirm he would insist on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy participating in his talks with Putin, and was particularly dismissive of Zelenskyy and his role in peace efforts. He remarked that the Ukrainian president had attended \"a lot of meetings\" without succeeding in stopping a war that Russia initiated. Trump also highlighted that Zelenskyy had remained in office throughout the entire conflict and claimed \"nothing happened\" during that period. He drew a comparison with Putin, who has maintained his grip on power in Russia for decades. Trump stated that following his rendezvous with Putin, \"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin\" but it could also potentially be a tripartite meeting involving \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\" For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters .","summary":"US intelligence officials are scrambling on Tuesday, after investigators have uncovered evidence suggesting that Russia was at least partially responsible for a hack of a computer system that manages federal court documents","url":"https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/russia-tied-huge-hack-federal-35720487","image":"https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/article35720486.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_TOPSHOT-RUSSIA-POLITICS.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 00:08:38","author":"Alexandra Snow,Anthony Orrico","authors":["Alexandra Snow","Anthony Orrico"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":350544292,"title":"‘Modernise’ or pay up: US pressures South Korea to step up militarily","text":"The United States has urged South Korea to “modernise” their bilateral military alliance and ensure a timely response to threats from Pyongyang and beyond the peninsula, in comments seen as pressuring Seoul to shoulder a greater security burden.\nUS Forces Korea (USFK) Commander General Xavier Brunson, in his first press conference with local reporters since taking command in December, said modernising the bilateral military alliance was essential to keep it “ready, relevant and able” to respond to evolving regional threats, such as from China and Russia.\n“What’s being asked of Korea is to be stronger against the DPRK, that we might have the flexibility as we modernise our alliance so that we could go do other things,” Brunson told journalists on Friday last week, referring to North Korea by the abbreviated form of its official name.\nHe highlighted the “strategic flexibility” of US troops, citing the rare relocation of a Patriot missile battery from South Korea to the Middle East in April to support operations against Yemen’s Houthi rebels.\n“That is strategic flexibility – the ability to be able to place your forces in space and time and need. That is what we seek to always be able to do,” he said.\n\nBrunson’s comments come ahead of the first summit between South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and his US counterpart Donald Trump, set for August 25 in Washington.\nThe meeting is expected to address Washington’s push for Seoul to bolster its defence capabilities against North Korea while redefining the role of the 28,500 US troops in South Korea to focus more on countering China.\nAnalysts say Brunson’s remarks signal a tougher US stance on burden-sharing.\n“Brunson was acting like a mouthpiece for Washington before the summit to help pile pressure on Seoul over the alliance’s modernisation,” Doo Jin-ho, a senior researcher at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, told This Week in Asia.\nChang Yong-seok, a senior researcher at Seoul National University’s Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, said Brunson was pressing Seoul “in an undiplomatic manner” to accept the strategic flexibility of US forces and alliance modernisation.\n“Even though Seoul can’t reject such calls, it will push for close consultations case by case to avoid getting entangled in US-China conflicts,” he said.\n\nAlliance modernisation is expected to be top of the agenda at the summit, alongside US demands for increased South Korean defence spending and burden-sharing.\nDoo said a joint statement could stress the need to expand the alliance’s role in the Indo-Pacific “beyond the Korean peninsula in the face of comprehensive threats”.\nFor Seoul, a key question would be whether the statement reaffirmed the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) for extended nuclear deterrence, including deploying US strategic assets, he said.\n“Not only North Korea, but China and Russia aren’t happy about the NCG and extended nuclear deterrence,” Doo said.\n“The NCG, which was established during the Biden administration, is considered a money pit. We cannot rule out the possibility that President Trump will try to neutralise it altogether.”\nJo Bi-yeon, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, predicted that the statement might simply commit to both partners’ continuing “to strengthen extended deterrence”, noting that Washington preferred rotational deployments or sea-launched nuclear weapons over forward-deploying them to South Korea.\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that the US was considering requiring Seoul to openly support flexible USFK operations during last month’s tariff talks.\nHowever, the prospect of expanding the USFK’s mission beyond deterring North Korea has raised fears in Seoul that its focus could be diluted and complicate its delicate balance between Washington and Beijing.\nBrunson, in his remarks, acknowledged that North Korea remained “the closest alligator to the boat” but said other threats were emerging.\n“We have a nuclear-armed adversary who’s north of the border, an increasing involvement of Russia along with the DPRK, and also the Chinese and the threat they pose to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said.\nWe have a nuclear-armed adversary who’s north of the border, an increasing involvement of Russia … and also the Chinese and the threat they pose\nGeneral Xavier Brunson, USFK commander\nBrunson also warned about Korean sovereignty being “impugned” by the actions of other nations, citing joint Russian and Chinese naval manoeuvres around the peninsula.\n“The Russian fleet came out and came south through the East Sea [Sea of Japan]. And what did the Chinese fleet do? They came around Korea, south of Jeju, sailed around to link up to go to Vladivostok. That’s dangerous. That’s dangerous that those two nations would come together,” he said.\nBrunson emphasised that the 1953 Korea-US Mutual Defence Treaty named no specific adversaries, noting: “The governments are going to make decisions based on their own national interests – always. And so I don’t think it should be considered a foregone conclusion that we’re saying, ‘Hey, if we go to Taiwan, you’re going to Taiwan too.’ That’s not the case.”\n\nElbridge Colby, the US under secretary of defence for policy, had earlier described South Korea as a “role model” for taking “more of the lead” in defending against the North and in its defence spending.\n“We will work closely with Seoul to ensure a strategically sustainable Alliance that is ready to defend against shared threats,” Colby wrote in a social media post on Thursday last week.\nIn an editorial on Sunday, the conservative Dong-A Ilbo newspaper said Brunson’s comments “signal a major shift” in the USFK’s mission, and their timing – two weeks before the summit – suggested the issue would be a key agenda item.\nThe paper said the realignment was part of Washington’s global strategy to prioritise containing China and shift more of the security burden to allies.\n“Realistically, it is difficult for South Korea alone to demand an exemption. However, Seoul cannot allow itself to be drawn into a US-China military conflict simply because of a unilateral US decision,” it wrote.","summary":"The United States has urged South Korea to “modernise” their bilateral military alliance and ensure a timely response to threats from Pyongyang and beyond the peninsula, in comments seen as pressuring Seoul to shoulder a greater security burden.\nUS Forces Korea (USFK) Commander General Xavier Brunson, in his first press conference with local reporters since taking command in December, said modernising the bilateral military alliance was essential to keep it “ready, relevant and able” to respond...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3321635/us-pressures-south-korea-redefine-alliance-pivot-away-north-korea","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/13/593c4cda-6417-40b0-9704-a85f42a7f239_447710f2.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-13 00:00:12","author":"Park Chan-kyong","authors":["Park Chan-kyong"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":350539940,"title":"Veterans are really getting screwed by Trump","text":"The inspector general for the Department of Veterans Affairs released a report on Tuesday revealing staffing shortages across the veterans’ health care system, which will be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s decision to slash staffing.\n\nThe audit determined that all 139 of the medical center campuses within the VA system reported that they lack workers and that reports of severe shortages for certain positions are up 50% from the previous fiscal year.

Veterans deserve and have earned better.”\n\nRelated | Veterans face dire new health care crisis thanks to Trump\n\nRecently released data has shown that doctors are choosing not to work in the VA system because of this ongoing crisis. Between January and March of President Donald Trump’s second term, approximately 2,000 doctors were offered jobs in the VA system, with nearly 40% turning down their offers. This caused the turndown rate to skyrocket to a 400% increase from President Joe Biden’s term.\n\nTrump started the process of cutting VA services early in his second term, pairing the attack on resources needed by veterans with a bigoted policy to drum out transgender service members.\n\nWhile he’s repeatedly claimed to support the troops, Trump’s actions prove otherwise—first by referring to deceased veterans as “suckers” and “losers,” and now by stripping living veterans of their health care.","summary":"The inspector general for the Department of Veterans Affairs released a report on Tuesday revealing staffing shortages across the veterans’ health care system, which will be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s decision to slash staffing.\n\n\n\nThe audit determined that all 139 of the medical center campuses within the VA system reported that they lack workers and that reports of severe shortages for certain positions are up 50% from the previous fiscal year. It also indicated that 94% of VA facilities report severe staffing shortages for medical officers, while 79% reported a shortage of nurses.\n\n\n\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins\n\n\nAstonishingly, this only includes data collected through April, meaning that the Trump administration’s cuts are not fully reflected in the assessment.

During the latest episode of the podcast \"Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky,\" Oliver — a U.K. native — mentioned that the stress he felt as an immigrant before getting his citizenship in 2019 has come back as Trump has increased deportations of illegal immigrants during his second term. \"And I have to remind myself now, with all these stories going on… it brings something out of you,\" he said, mentioning Trump’s crackdown. \"Like it's there – that anxiety that I thought I'd moved past that day that I got my citizenship. I thought it would be gone then.\" MIGRANT SEX CRIME SURGE IN MAJOR US CITY TIED TO BIDEN’S OPEN BORDER, MEXICO ‘SAFE HAVEN’: FORMER JUDGE \"I didn't feel that, like the relief didn't feel enough,\" he added.

He said being in that state generated real tension within him. \"And it was incredibly tense,\" he said. \"That immigration experience is tough even if you have the best version of it.

But I realized I thought about it every day. Somewhere in the back of my head was my immigration status. At no point was it not somewhere in my mind.\" Lewinsky mentioned she could empathize in a small way with those being \"hunted\" by immigration authorities thanks to her experience as a woman who was hounded by the press following her affair with former President Bill Clinton. \"I've had a sense of understanding a tiny, tiny bit that I empathize with the immigrants who are going through the crisis right now.

The high-stakes summit will take place behind closed doors and will be limited to representatives from the US and Russia, raising significant concerns over Ukraine’s exclusion from direct participation.\nAddressing criticism surrounding Kyiv’s absence from the in-person discussions, the White House officials confirmed on Tuesday that President Trump will hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prior to the summit, ABC News reported. The session is expected to take place on Wednesday.\nSources familiar with the development said President Trump and Vice President JD Vance will join the virtual meeting, which will also include key European allies. The purpose of the dialogue is to address Ukraine’s growing concerns about being sidelined in negotiations that could shape the outcome of the war and affect its territorial sovereignty.\nRecently, President Zelenskyy has issued repeated warnings that “talks about us, without us, will not work.” He has also rejected any possibility of agreeing to territorial concessions, especially the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the contested Donbas region in the east.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Kyiv on Tuesday, he reaffirmed Ukraine’s stance, stating, “Donbas for the Russians is a springboard for a future new offensive. We will not leave Donbas. We cannot do this. Everyone forgets the first part—our territories are illegally occupied.”\nThe Donbas region, comprising Luhansk and Donetsk, has been a focal point of the war since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Moscow has since claimed both regions as part of its territory.\nZelenskyy also expressed frustration with the Alaska summit, calling the direct Trump-Putin meeting a “personal victory” for the Russian leader. Although the White House has framed the summit as a “listening exercise” for President Trump, Ukrainian officials fear their interests may be compromised in backchannel talks.\nStill, Zelenskyy struck a hopeful tone, revealing that during a recent call with US envoy Steve Witkoff, he received a subtle indication that Russia may be open to negotiating a ceasefire. “This was the first signal from them,” he noted.","summary":"The purpose of the dialogue is to address Ukraine’s growing concerns about being side-lined in negotiations.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-vance-to-meet-zelenskyy-virtually-before-alaska-summit-with-putin-report-ws-l-9501949.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/02/Ukraine-President-Zelenskyy-Donald-Trump-REUTERS-2025-02-4d1bd5a30f3799c5f2b42d20e961736f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 23:57:09","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":350533998,"title":"Russia, US Top Diplomats Discuss Preparations for Upcoming Putin-Trump Meeting","text":"Moscow, August 12 (QNA) Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a phone call on Tuesday with his US counterpart Marco Rubio, during which they discussed preparations for the upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US counterpart Donald Trump, scheduled to take place in Alaska next Friday.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, both ministers reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the success of the meeting between the two presidents.\n\nThe Kremlin and the White House had previously announced that the Russian and US presidents would meet in Alaska on August 15.

He has no interest in posing for loved-up pics.'\nDaily Mail has approached Andy and Lou's representatives for comment.\nThe couple's last public outing was at an Oasis gig at the end of July, where they packed on the PDA, proving they were still together.\nThe date night came after the ex footballer was interrogated about the arguments with his make-up artist lover in a restaurant and at their hotel on the Greek party island, The Sun on Sunday reports.\nSpeaking about the first incident, a worker at the Nikolus Tavern told the newspaper: 'He seemed very drunk and furious with his partner.\n'He was using very bad words. It was improper behaviour. The woman looked very upset.'\nAccording to the restaurant worker, police arrived and took the ex-Liverpool, Newcastle United and England striker aside for a chat, before he was later allowed back to girlfriend Lou.\n\nA source said: 'Andy got sick of Lou's demands and her influencer lifestyle.

He was allowed to return, and the couple left after paying for their meal. Andy was very calm when the police arrived — he stood up and spoke to them outside the restaurant', the restaurant worker added.\nJust hours later, cops were called again by hotel staff following reports of damage in their room.\nDaily Mail understands that the former England forward - once Britain's most expensive Premier League footballer when bought by Liverpool from Newcastle for £35million - was taken to the police station for questioning, but he was not arrested and no further action was taken.\nThe incident was confirmed by a hotel employee, who claimed Carroll broke the door. That night, Lou left the hotel and spent the night at Soho Roc House.\nA joint statement from the couple given to The Sun said: 'Whilst having a private dinner in a restaurant on a quiet holiday in Mykonos, we had a heated discussion of the sort that most couples have had on occasion. It quickly became apparent to the police that there was no reason for them to be there.\n'We went outside the restaurant with them together as they insisted they wanted to 'look after' us.\n'As far as we are concerned, the situation has been blown out of all proportion by an interested member of the public. No one was arrested and no one was charged with anything. We are very happy, in love and looking forward to our future together and we are disappointed that a private disagreement has become a public matter.'\nThe pair began dating last year after he separated from his TOWIE star wife Billi Mucklow last September.\n\nThe couple's last public outing was at an Oasis gig at the end of July, where they packed on the PDA, proving they were still together\n\nThe pair began dating last year after he separated from his TOWIE star wife Billi Mucklow last September (Billi and Andy pictured on their wedding day)\n\n Andy Carroll LICKS girlfriend Lou Teasdale in holiday snaps after 'police were called to bust-up' \nCarroll and Mucklow called it quits divorce after two years of turbulent marriage, the footballer confirmed last year.\nIn 2022, their wedding was almost called off when Carroll was pictured drunkenly passed out in bed with two women in Dubai on his stag do.\nMucklow forgave him after one of the women insisted nothing sexual happened.\nLess than two years after their nuptials, the couple's marriage was over - with Carroll confirming they had started divorce proceedings after 'a hard few months for our family'.\nCarroll said in a statement at the time: 'Billi and I have privately separated earlier this year and we are under way with our divorce proceedings'.\n'It has been a hard few months for our family and we continue to move forward amicably for our children.'\nCarroll and Mucklow have three children together Arlo, Wolf, and Marvel Mae and she also raises his two children Emilie Rose, 15, and Lucas, 14 from his past relationship.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nAndy Carroll 'DUMPS' Lou Teasdale after police questioned him over boozy rows in Greece as he unfollows her and tells pals he's 'sick' of her demands\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 29\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

White House Locks Down THIS Location In Alaska","text":"In a dramatic race against time, American officials have finalized the venue for the high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15, the first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders in over four years. The meeting is now set to take place this Friday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, according to a CNN report. The choice comes after a week of scrambling to find a suitable location amid tight timelines, security concerns, and limited infrastructure due to Alaska’s peak tourist season. The Locations That Never Were Before settling on Anchorage, US officials explored a variety of options across the state, placing urgent calls to venues in Juneau, Fairbanks, and Anchorage itself. However, the intense summer tourism rush in Alaska left few spaces available, let alone ones that met the stringent security, logistical, and diplomatic requirements for hosting a world summit. Some prominent Alaskans even reached out to Trump allies to offer their private homes as possible venues, though it's unclear if those suggestions ever made it to White House decision-makers. Ultimately, only Anchorage had a feasible option, with the military base emerging as the sole viable location, despite initial reluctance from the administration to host a Russian delegation on US military grounds due to optics. Why Not Europe or the Middle East? Traditionally, US-Russia summits have taken place in neutral European cities like Geneva or Vienna, which offer high security and diplomatic neutrality. But this time, those were quickly ruled out. The International Criminal Court's 2023 war crimes warrant against Putin made travel to many European nations legally risky for the Russian president. Putin reportedly suggested the United Arab Emirates as a location, calling it \"entirely suitable.\" However, Trump advisers were reluctant to arrange another long-haul summit in the Middle East following the president’s recent trip there in May. In the end, the decision reportedly came down to two finalists: Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán maintains warm ties with both leaders, and the United States. The Kremlin surprisingly agreed to a US location, specifically, Alaska, a former Russian territory, marking a rare summit on American soil between leaders of the two nuclear powers. According to White House officials, the summit will serve primarily as a \"listening session\", not a formal negotiation. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov have been coordinating the meeting’s logistics, but Trump has said he plans to \"feel out\" Putin in person and assess his intentions directly. “The president feels like, ‘I’ve got to look at this guy across the table,’” Rubio said in a radio interview. “I need to hear him one-on-one.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Friday at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.

This comes as the federal government’s gross national debt creeps up to the $37 trillion mark.\n\nEven as Trump talks about America becoming rich because of his import tax hikes, federal spending keeps outpacing the revenues collected by the government. That financial picture might change as companies exhaust their pre-tariff inventories, forcing them to import more goods and generate even more in tax revenues that could whittle away at the deficit without meaningfully reducing it as promised.\n\nIf tariffs fail to deliver on Trump's pledge to improve the government's balance sheet, the American public could be faced with fewer job options, more inflationary pressures and higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. The budget deficit is the annual gap between what the U.S. government raises in taxes and what it spends, over time feeding into the overall national debt.\n\nWhile organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say that tariff income can be a stream of meaningful revenue — estimated to generate about $1.3 trillion over the course of President Trump’s four-year term in office; some economists like Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model say tariffs are likely to result “ in only modest reductions in federal debt.”\n\nIn June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall. But revenue estimates are also difficult to predict as the president has changed his tariff rates repeatedly and the taxes declared as part of an economic emergency are currently under appeal in a U.S. court.\n\nA Treasury official did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on when the U.S. could begin to see tariff revenue start to put a dent in the deficit.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month on Fox Business Network's “Mornings with Maria” that the administration is “laser-focused on bringing this deficit down.” The Trump administration expects to make more trade deals with other nations, including China and other major economies.\n\nFor instance, on Monday, Trump extended a trade truce with China for another 90 days, which preserves the 30% tariffs he had imposed as a condition for negotiations. The previous deadline was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nTrump posted on his Truth Social platform that he signed the executive order for the extension, and that “all other elements of the Agreement will remain the same.” Beijing, at the same time, also announced the extension of the tariff pause, according to the Ministry of Commerce.","summary":"The U.S. budget deficit in July climbed 20% this fiscal year compared to the last despite the U.S. taking in record income from President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to Treasury Department data released Tuesday.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders and U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon toured two Arkansas schools Tuesday as part of McMahon’s “Returning Education to the States” tour.\n\nThey were joined by Arkansas junior U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and state Education Secretary Jacob Oliva on tours of Little Rock’s Don R. Roberts Elementary School and Saline County Career and Technical Campus in Benton.\n\n“I wanted to be in places where I could actually see some of the things that I talked about at work,” McMahon said in Saline County. “Not necessarily everybody has to go to a four-year school. There are places like this that would be sponsored from the tech field, where students can earn dual credits, go right into community college, go right to work in the field. … This is the secret sauce.”\n\nMcMahon and Cotton both alluded to the need to rid schools of red tape and bureaucracy. President Donald Trump has said he plans on shuttering the U.S. Department of Education to give states more power over education and wants McMahon to put herself out of her own job — a plan McMahon has supported.\n\nSanders also touted the expansion of the state’s Educational Freedom Account program to around 50,000 students in Arkansas this year. The program, which is open to all Arkansas students for the first time this fall, provides state funding for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition.\n\nWhile Sanders and McMahon focused on the positive during their two stops, a handful of protestors outside Roberts Elementary held signs criticizing the state’s LEARNS Act and McMahon. The wide-ranging 2023 law made several changes to the state’s K-12 education system, including creating the school voucher program and raising the state’s minimum teacher salary to $50,000\n\n“The parents of [Roberts Elementary] were incredibly upset when the letter was sent home yesterday … that she would be here,” said Courtney Jackson, a mother of two. She said she didn’t want her children to find out she just stood by while public education was under attack.\n\n“The parents of this school do not want her here,” Jackson said.\n\nAlison Metzler, another protesting parent, said she kept her kids home from school Tuesday because she didn’t want them to be used as “political pawns” by Sanders and McMahon.\n\n“Sarah Huckabee and McMahon are actively trying to dismantle public education, and they do not care about public education. This is all for show, and it’s, it’s just disgusting,” Metzler said. “If Sarah Huckabee really stood with public education, her kids would go to public schools. Instead, they go to the private school a mile down the road, and she’s defunding these exact schools.”\n\nMetzler also criticized Sanders and McMahon for visiting the “whitest affluent school in the Little Rock School District, a top school in the state.” She said she loved the school as a parent with a child who attended, but that if Sanders was really committed to public education, she would be visiting struggling schools in other parts of Little Rock.\n\n“[Roberts Elementary] is not a representation of what the whole district is as a whole,” she said.\n\nArkansas Advocate is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

The examination will look at all public-facing content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals,” according to the letter.\n\n“This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter said.\n\nThe Smithsonian said it remained committed to “scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history.\"\n\n“We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,” it said in a statement.\n\nThe review, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is the latest attempt by the president to bring the country's cultural institutions in line with his vision. In March, Trump signed an executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which accused the Smithsonian of coming under the influence of a “divisive, race-centered ideology” and called upon it to “remove improper ideology” from the institution's museums.\n\nIn February, Trump removed the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees, replaced them with his supporters and named himself chairman. He vowed to end events featuring performers in drag, indicating he would take on a larger role in dictating the institution's programming schedule.\n\nThe review of the Smithsonian will initially focus on eight museums — the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\n\nThe letter said additional museums would be reviewed in subsequent phases.\n\nCivil rights leaders have criticized the administration's particular focus on the National Museum of African American History and Culture as efforts to minimize Black Americans' contributions to the country and to recast the obstacles they faced throughout history.\n\nThe Smithsonian has repeatedly denied allegations that it has changed or removed exhibit details in response to pressure from the administration.

He said there was still a lot of confusion about what the crackdown may bring.\nTheir best advice, he said, was: \"Go to shelter if you can, if you can stand it. If you have anybody you can stay with, get off the street, and seek safety and let us know what we can do for you.\"\nTrump said on social media that he wanted the homeless out of Washington even before he announced the extraordinary step of temporarily taking over the District of Columbia's police department and deploying 800 National Guard troops as part of a crackdown on crime there - an effort that also includes another 500 federal law enforcement agents.\nA billionaire real estate developer, Trump described the homeless as one of several groups who have \"overtaken\" Washington that include \"violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs.\" He likened his intended crackdown to his administration's actions to secure the US border with Mexico.\nHomelessness reached a record high nationwide in 2024\nUS communities have long experienced seemingly intractable problems with homelessness, which reached an all-time national high of over 771,000 men, women and children on a single night in 2024, according to the department of housing and urban development's latest homelessness report to Congress.\nThe HUD report estimated Washington's homeless population at 5,616, a 14.1% increase from the year before.

Thune said the appropriations process would allow individual programs to be reviewed by members of Congress and potentially saved from cuts if “appropriators believe that they’re getting a good return for the American taxpayer.”\n\n“I think that it’s in everybody’s best interests if the Appropriations Committee is able to do its work and then Congress, the House and Senate, pass appropriations bills and put them on the president’s desk for him to sign into law,” Thune said.\n\nThune also addressed Trump’s imposition of higher tariffs. Before last year’s presidential election, Thune criticized tariff proposals like Trump’s as “a recipe for increased inflation.” Tuesday, he offered a different take, referencing trade deals that have resulted from tariff negotiations.\n\n“I do think that the ways in which they are using them, in my view, at least right now is yielding some results,” Thune said of the White House’s strategy.\n\nAfterward, Thune took questions from reporters on topics including immigration.\n\nLack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law last month provides $170 billion for immigration- and border-enforcement activities. Thune said the spending helps pay for “everything we need to keep the border secure and ensure we have an orderly way of processing people who are coming into the country, whether it’s for refugee status or otherwise.”\n\nThe next step, Thune said, should be to address workforce shortages with legal immigration policies. Thune said “it’d be nice” if Congress passed legislation so polices don’t change “from one administration to the next.”\n\nSouth Dakota relies on immigrants, especially in agriculture and tourism. Growing workforce needs will force the immigration issue “to be front and center,” he added.\n\n“It’s an economic issue because of the impact that it has,” Thune said. “If you can’t find workers in our economy, that’s a big problem.”\n\nThe chamber’s Inside Washington luncheons are annual events inviting South Dakota congressional delegates to speak about issues affecting the state and businesses.

Additional museums, the letter said, will be announced in a second phase.\n\nThe Smithsonian said it was “reviewing” the letter, telling CNN in a statement it planned to work “constructively” with the White House.\n\n“The Smithsonian’s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,” the statement said.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution is the world’s largest museum complex, including 21 museums and the National Zoo. Nearly 17 million people visited Smithsonian properties last year, according to the museum’s website. Admission at nearly all the museums is free. The Smithsonian began a review of its own in June, and has repeatedly stressed its commitment to being nonpartisan. The institution told CNN in July that it was committed to an “unbiased presentation of facts and history” and that it would “make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.”\n\nThe letter calls on each museum to designate a point of contact to provide details on plans for programming to highlight the country’s 250th anniversary. It also asks for a full catalog of all current and ongoing exhibitions and budgets, a list of all traveling exhibitions and plans for the next three years, and all internal guidelines, including staff manuals, job descriptions, and organizational charts, along with internal communications about exhibition artwork selection and approval. That material is due within 30 days, with “on-site observational visits” and walkthroughs expected.\n\nWithin 75 days, Trump administration officials will schedule and conduct “voluntary interviews with curators and senior staff.”\n\nAnd within 120 days, museums “should begin implementing content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions across placards, wall didactics, digital displays, and other public-facing materials.”\n\nLast month, the National Museum of American History removed a temporary placard referencing Trump’s two impeachments from an exhibit related to the presidency, prompting public outcry against the museum and claims it was capitulating to Trump. In follow-up statements, the museum system insisted the placard’s removal was temporary and denied it had been pressured by any government official to make changes to its exhibits. It was reinstalled days ago, with some changes.\n\nThe exhibit now is set up in a way that places information about Trump’s two impeachments in a lower spot, with some changes to the placard’s text.\n\nThis developing story has been updated.\n\nMichael Williams contributed to this report. \n\nwindow.addEventListener(‘load’, function() { (function(c, id, p, d, w){ var i = d.createElement(‘iframe’); i.height = ‘0’; i.width = ‘0’; i.style = { display: ‘none’, position: ‘absolute’, visibility: ‘hidden’ }; i.src = “https://newsource-embed-prd.ns.cnn.com/articles/cnnvan-stats.html?article_id=”+id+”&category=”+c+”&publisher=”+p+”&url=” + encodeURI(w.location); d.body.appendChild(i); })(“US%20Politics”, “L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZTkwb3I0ZjAwM3kyNnA2Z2Z1MWJvNWI%3D”, “21905”, document, window)})\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That has included vehemently opposing any US military intervention on Mexican soil.\n\nStill, US media reported last week that Trump has secretly signed an order directing the military to take action against drug-smuggling cartels and other criminal groups from Latin America, which could presage the deployment of US forces both domestically and abroad.\n\nThe move on Tuesday was the second time in recent months that Mexico has expelled alleged criminal gang members wanted by the US.\n\nIn February, Mexico extradited 29 alleged cartel figures, including Rafael Caro Quintero, who is accused of killing a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent in 1985.\n\nThat deal came as Trump threatened to impose blanket 25-percent tariffs on Mexican imports, but the scope of that tariff threat was later pared down.\n\nCurrently, the US imposes a 25-percent tariff on Mexican-made cars and products not covered under a pre-existing free trade accord, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The Bush decision touched off an era of aggressive legal and regulatory action by states, led by Massachusetts, California and Connecticut, which shaped the U.S. legal framework on climate change for two decades.\n\nCould the same thing happen again, after the Trump administration finalizes its plan to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gases?\n\nTrump’s EPA is aiming to head off that risk, including language in its proposal asserting that state regulation or lawsuits on greenhouse gas emissions would be “preempted”—or, in plain language, prohibited. But legal experts expect that a repeal will nevertheless touch off years of new state-vs.-federal government battles over climate action, with a familiar roster of states in the forefront of the action.\n\n“EPA’s disregard for the dangers of greenhouse gases defies science, law, and common sense,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in an emailed statement to Inside Climate News. “More than two decades ago, Massachusetts led the charge to force EPA to do its job to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and we’re not going to stop holding EPA accountable now.”\n\nA Patchwork of Differing State Approaches?\n\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has maintained that repeal of the 2009 endangerment finding would create a clearer legal and regulatory landscape. “The Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” he said in a written statement when unveiling the proposal July 29. He said that the Obama and Biden administrations had “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science” to put the endangerment finding in place.\n\nEnvironmentalists and scientists immediately pushed back on Zeldin’s assertions. But there has also been some concern in the business community that without the federal government taking the lead on climate action, it could be open season for states to write their own regulations or file lawsuits against companies over greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nIt has happened before. \n\nMassachusetts led the litigation that in 2007 prompted the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that defined greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. \n\nCalifornia developed regulations that transformed tailpipe emissions—changing the key measure from miles per gallon to carbon dioxide per mile. Automakers were embroiled in litigation over California’s authority until President Barack Obama brokered a deal soon after taking office in 2009 that essentially put California rules in place nationwide. \n\nConnecticut, meanwhile, raised the specter of public nuisance lawsuits against utilities and other greenhouse gas polluters, an effort that was decisively cut off by the Supreme Court in a unanimous 2011 decision. The high court cited the endangerment finding in its decision that such lawsuits were preempted.\n\nGiven the importance of the endangerment finding in cutting off the Connecticut case, it’s not surprising that Edison Electric Institute, the trade group representing all of the nation’s investor-owned electric companies, has consistently maintained that its members support EPA having authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. \n\n“Otherwise, we would face a patchwork of state regulations and lawsuits from plaintiffs that could raise costs to customers and impact grid reliability,” Alex Bond, EEI’s executive director of legal and clean energy policy, said in an email to Inside Climate News in March.\n\nThe Trump administration indicated it recognized these concerns. “We are … aware that regulated parties may have reliance interests in national uniformity,” the EPA said in its proposal. But the agency said that although it determined that regulating greenhouse gas emissions “based on global climate change concerns” exceeds the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act, the EPA retained its authority to regulate those emissions in the future. \n\nTherefore, in the EPA’s view, states would continue to be preempted, or barred, from taking their own regulatory actions or filing federal common law claims over greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBut Richard Revesz, dean emeritus of New York University School of Law, who served as a top regulatory official in the Biden White House, said some of the assertions that the EPA makes challenging the science of climate change undercut its argument that it is maintaining authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“EPA is trying to thread an impossibly small needle,” Revesz said. “They don’t want to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. And they also don’t want California to be able to have its own vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards, and they don’t want [federal common law actions] to come back to life. They want to have it both ways, and their ability to succeed is questionable.”\n\nBrittany Pemberton, a partner at Bracewell, a law firm that represents a wide variety of energy industry clients, points to language in the Supreme Court’s 2011 ruling that would make the particular kind of case that Connecticut filed against American Electric Power and other utilities—a federal common law case—dubious today even if the EPA backs away from carbon dioxide emissions altogether. \n\n“EPA is trying to thread an impossibly small needle.”\n— Richard Revesz, New York University School of Law\n\nBut Pemberton said there are plenty of legal questions ahead. “The extent to which state law (common law made by courts or legislation) can be used to try to limit future emissions or obtain damages for past emissions is much less clear,” she said in an email. “Multiple courts are wrestling with this right now and reaching different conclusions. Repealing the Endangerment Finding is likely to add another layer of complexity and confusion in that area.”\n\nThe EPA is continuing to take public comments on the endangerment finding repeal proposal through mid-September, with public hearings scheduled on Aug. 19 and 20. \n\nMassachusetts and California led a coalition of states last week in calling on the Trump administration to extend the comment period. \n\n“Given the breadth and complexity of this proposal, including its impact on the economy, human health, and the environment, a 45-day comment period is wholly inadequate,” they wrote.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s administration is not the first to declare it has no legal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

While speaking with Schwalb, CNN host Kasie Hunt asked the city’s attorney general if he believes laws allowing people “up to the age of 24 years old” to potentially receive “more lenient sentences from judges” are working after listing headlines of brutal attacks.\n\n“OK, these headlines are different from when I first came to the city. Thirteen-year-old girl, 13, sentenced to seven years for 2023, beating death of a D.C. man, teen sentenced and killing of [a] Lyft driver who came to [the] U.S. seeking safety. This was a guy who was a U.S. military interpreter who was shot and killed in an attempted carjacking, again by a 16-year-old,” Hunt said. “The law allows people up to the age of 24 years old to potentially have more lenient sentences from judges. Is that working for people in D.C.?”\n\n“My office, since I’ve been the attorney general, is prosecuting juvenile cases and holding young people who hurt other people accountable every day at higher rates and higher numbers than long before the pandemic,” Schwalb said. “So much so that our mayor had to issue an executive order expanding the capacity of our juvenile detention facilities to hold people that we are prosecuting.”\n\nDuring a press conference Monday, Trump said he had officially invoked Section 40 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying the National Guard. (RELATED: Man Shot And Killed Just Blocks From DC Protest Against Trump Crime Crackdown)\n\nThe order from the president comes as a slew of high-profile violent crime cases swept through the city, prompting Trump on Wednesday to float the idea of bringing in the National Guard.\n\nHunt went on to ask the city’s attorney general if he believes some juveniles found guilty in certain cases should be prosecuted as adults, to which he advocated for Washington’s current system.\n\n“All of these young people that are prosecuted under the law can in certain circumstances be prosecuted as adults under our existing laws and can be prosecuted as juveniles under other circumstances. And our laws are working. Our prosecution is working,” Schwalb said.\n\n“And you’re exactly right,” Schwalb said. “The U.S. attorney’s office in our city has jurisdiction over adults. The vast majority of crime that occurs in our city is committed by adults, not juveniles. The jurisdiction to prosecute juveniles in our family court sits under our laws with my office, the office of attorney general.”\n\nDuring an interview with Fox’s Sean Hannity on Monday, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro of the District of Columbia told the host that criminals in the city have been “emboldened for a variety of reasons.” Pirro said there are “crews” of teens between the ages of 14 and 17 who commit crimes because they are “below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape one, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree.”\n\nIn a fact sheet released Monday, the White House said that “the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has gone up each year since 2020 — many of whom have had prior arrests for violent crimes.”\n\nThe announcement of the National Guard comes on the heels of former Department of Government Efficiency staff member Edward Coristine, also known online as “Big Balls,” being severely beaten after intervening in an attempted unarmed carjacking near Dupont Circle. According to the MPD report obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation, officials estimated that approximately 10 suspects fled the scene before officers arrived, but they later arrested two 15-year-olds.\n\nIn addition to the attack on Coristine, a GOP intern was shot and killed June 30, and two Israeli Embassy staff members were gunned down near the Capital Jewish Museum in May.\n\nDespite Democrats and legacy media pundits attempting to downplay the city’s crime rate by pointing to how it dropped 35% in 2024, their reliance on local police data excludes crimes such as felony and aggravated assault.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

How is it different from Israel's Iron Dome?","text":"AgenciesGolden Dome USA\n\nThe Trump administration's flagship Golden Dome missile defense system will include four layers -- one satellite-based and three on land -- with 11 short-range batteries located across the continental U.S., Alaska and Hawaii, according to a U.S. government slide presentation on the project first reported by Reuters. The slides, tagged “Go Fast, Think Big!” were presented to 3,000 defense contractors in Huntsville, Alabama, last week and reveal the unprecedented complexity of the system, which faces an ambitious 2028 deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump.Golden Dome for America Cost, BudgetFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 4By CA Himanshu JainArtificial IntelligenceAI For Business Professionals Batch 2By Ansh MehraFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 3By CA Himanshu JainArtificial Intelligence AI For Business ProfessionalsBy Vaibhav SisinityFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 2By CA Himanshu JainFinanceValue and Valuation Masterclass Batch-1By CA Himanshu JainThe system is estimated to cost $175 billion, but the slides show uncertainties still loom over the basic architecture of the project because the number of launchers, interceptors, ground stations, and missile sites needed for the system has yet to be determined.\"They have a lot of money, but they don't have a target of what it costs yet,\" said one U.S. official. So far Congress has appropriated $25 billion for Golden Dome in Trump’s tax-and-spend bill passed in July. Another $45.3 billion is earmarked for Golden Dome in his 2026 presidential budget request.Israel's Iron Dome vs USA Golden DomeIntended as a multi-layered missile defense shield for the United States, Golden Dome draws inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome, but is significantly bigger due to the geography it will need to protect and the complexity due to the varied threats it will face.Live EventsAccording to the slides, the system architecture consists of four integrated layers: a space-based sensing and targeting layer for missile warning and tracking as well as \"missile defense\" and three land-based layers consisting of missile interceptors, radar arrays, and potentially lasers.One surprise was a new large missile field - seemingly in the Midwest according to a map contained in the presentation - for Next Generation Interceptors (NGI) which are made by Lockheed Martin and would be a part of the \"upper layer\" alongside Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Aegis systems which are also made by Lockheed.NGI is the modernized missile for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) network of radars, interceptors and other equipment - currently the primary missile defense shield to protect the United States from intercontinental ballistic missiles from rogue states.The U.S. operates GMD launch sites in southern California and Alaska. This plan would add a third site in the Midwest to counter additional threats.Other technical hurdles the slides identified included communication latency across the \"kill chain\" of systems. Contractors such as Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Boeing have a variety of missile defense systems.Notably, the slides did not mention Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which was part of a bid for Golden Dome contracts alongside software maker Palantir and defense systems manufacturer Anduril.The Pentagon said it is gathering information \"from industry, academia, national labs, and other government agencies for support to Golden Dome\" but it would be \"imprudent\" to release more information on a program in these early stages.Golden Dome FeaturesOne key goal for Golden Dome is to shoot targets down during their “boost phase,” the slow and predictable climb through the Earth's atmosphere of a missile. Rather, it seeks to field space-based interceptors that can more quickly intercept incoming missiles.The presentation highlighted that the United States \"has built both interceptors and re-entry vehicles\" but has never built a vehicle that can handle the heat of reentry while targeting an enemy missile. The last lines of defense dubbed the \"under layer\" and \"Limited Area Defense\" will include new radars and current systems like the Patriot missile defense system and a new \"common\" launcher that will launch current and future interceptors against all threat types. These modular and relocatable systems would be designed to minimize reliance on prepared sites, allowing for rapid deployment across multiple theaters. Space Force General Michael Guetlein, confirmed last month to lead the Golden Dome project, has 30 days from his July 17 confirmation to build a team, another 60 days to deliver an initial system design, and 120 days to present a full implementation plan, including satellite and ground station details, people briefed on a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have told Reuters.FAQsQ1.

Rick Perry has become an unexpected advocate for the illegal psychedelic drug ibogaine.\n\nThe New York Times on Tuesday went on a trip with Perry, who twice ran for the White House and served as President Donald Trump's Secretary of Energy during the Republican's first term. \n\nPerry recalled traveling to Tijuana, Mexico in September 2023 and spending 12 hours hallucinating that he was flying through space, seeing hieroglyphics and escaping the devil. \n\n'I woke up very clearheaded, with this very warm feeling in my body,' Perry told the paper. 'I was as calm and as happy as I'd been in memory.' \n\nDuring his time serving as Texas governor, Perry knew that many veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were in trouble, but he first heard about ibogaine through a Navy SEAL he had hired in 2017 during his time running the Energy Department. \n\nThe SEAL, Morgan Luttrell, told Perry he was taking time off to travel to Mexico to be treated with ibogaine after continuing to suffer from psychiatric issues post-deployment. \n\nPerry, a staunch conservative, told Luttrell - now a Republican U.S. congressman from Texas - to be careful. \n\nCut to 2025 and Perry is convinced of its efficacy. \n\n'It has literally given people their lives back,' he told The Times. \n\nIn Perry's own case, after suffering from three severe concussions during his youth - and struggling with anxiety during his political career - the former Texas governor took an MRI before and after his ibogaine experience. \n\nBeforehand, his 73-year-old brain showed evidence of atrophy, not uncommon for someone of his age. \n\nSix months after his trip, in March 2024, the MRI showed the atrophy had vanished. \n\n'You have the brain of a 40-year-old,' Dr. Charles Gordon, a Texas neurosurgeon and psychedelic skeptic, told Perry, The Times said. \n\nSince then, Perry has co-founded the nonprofit American for Ibogaine, as the drug remains a Schedule 1 drug in the United States under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act. \n\nHe has called widening its use 'my life's mission,' he told the paper. \n\nHe's found a sort-of across-the-aisle bedfellow in former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat turned independent, who left Congress earlier this year. \n\nSinema told The Times that Perry was 'one of the few very conservative individuals in this space, with high credibility among what I'd call a nontraditional audience for psychedelic medicine.' \n\nEarlier this year, Perry successfully got Texas to put dollars into research on how ibogaine could help veterans. \n\nSinema's Arizona became the second state to make that move. \n\nBut at the national level, Perry still faces several hurdles. \n\nThe Republican-led Congress already voted down Luttrell's amendment that would have allocated $10 million to the Pentagon to conduct clinical trials on ibogaine. \n\nTraditional conservatives also aren't on board. \n\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins told The Times that while he hadn't done enough research to speak on ibogaine specifically, his conservative Christian organization has 'expressed opposition to the use of psychedelics because of longstanding spiritual, theological and ethical concerns about mind-altering drugs that open individuals up to mystical or transcendent experiences that are not in line with orthodox teaching of scripture.' \n\nAnd Perry still finds himself in the doghouse with Trump - as the president made clear recently when he brought up his former energy secretary's role in his first impeachment. \n\nPerry had set up the call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - a call that House Democrats and a handful of Republicans said amounted to a solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election - with Trump asking Zelensky for dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter. \n\n'I get indicted for making a phone call,' Trump complained at a meeting with faith leaders last month.

Another man said he watched a detainee have a seizure for 30 minutes before medical help arrived.\n\nKaplan ordered ICE to improve detainees’ access to personal hygiene products and medical care, as well as free, unmonitored and confidential calls with lawyers within 24 hours after they are detained.\n\nCells must also be cleaned three times a day, according to the order.\n\nThe order also prohibits people from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person, which shrinks the capacity of the largest hold room to roughly a dozen or so people.\n\nTuesday’s order “sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” according to Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, among groups that sued the administration over conditions at the facility.\n\nThe Independent has requested comment from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn court filings, Hugo Elias Sanchez Trillos described spending nearly three weeks inside that facility, with a three-day break in between when he was transferred to Nassau County jail.\n\n“I was in the same clothes for 19 days, without ever having an opportunity to bathe,” he wrote.\n\nThe room “smelled terrible because no one had bathed,” according to Joselyn Chipantiza Sisalema. “There was no bathroom paper, and the guards would throw only a few paper napkins into our room,” she wrote.\n\nDetainees were served food only twice a day, around 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., and “we got water only when the guards felt like it,” Sanchez Trillos wrote.\n\n“The food was processed and awful; it was difficult to eat. It came inside plastic bags that were usually cold,” he said. “The guards would eat their own food in front of us, things like pizza and hamburgers. … We were so hungry and it felt [like] they were jeering at us.”\n\nVideos from inside the facility show roughly two dozen people crammed in, lying on a cement floor with nothing but emergency blankets and thin sheets, steps away from a toilet separated only by a waist-high partition.\n\n“Look how they have us like dogs in here,” the person filming the videos can be heard saying in Spanish.\n\nFootage obtained by the New York Immigration Coalition provides outsiders with a first glimpse of the room, which federal officials have prevented members of Congress from observing.\n\nIn the clips, the men inside are seated on benches that line the walls or are lying on aluminum emergency blankets on the bare floor. Two toilets in the room, one of which appears to be covered by tinfoil, are blocked off by a small partition. No doors separate the toilets from the rest of the room.\n\nFollowing Tuesday’s order, the “shadow 10th floor detention center must be shut down permanently,” coalition president Murad Awawdeh said in a statement.\n\nImmigrants’ rights groups, lawyers and lawmakers have warned for weeks about deteriorating conditions inside the building, which also houses immigration courts. Federal law enforcement officers have been stationed in the building’s hallways since at least May 20 to make arrests moments after immigrants appear in court.\n\nThe “hold room” is not intended to hold people for longer than 12 hours, according to ICE’s internal guidance. In May and June, when arrests at immigration check-ins and courthouses began to skyrocket, immigrants were being held inside the room for 29 hours on average, according to a review from New York City news outlet The City. Within those two months, 81 people were detained there for four days or more at a time.\n\nDetentions peaked on June 5, when 186 people were held there overnight, The City found.\n\nThousands of people across the country have faced arrest after showing up for court-ordered ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.\n\nUnlike federal district court judges, immigration court judges operate under the direction of the attorney general’s office.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review has issued guidance to judges to grant motions from government lawyers to immediately dismiss immigrants’ cases, making them easy targets for arrest and removal.","summary":"Detainees say they were forced to sleep with ‘horrific stench’ of sweat, urine and feces in cells with open toilets","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ice-federal-plaza-new-york-lawsuit-b2806497.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/12/21/40/federal-plaza-detention.png?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/83r3Fwkw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-12 23:18:10","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.603},{"id":350533956,"title":"‘His Personal Victory’ – Zelensky Sours On Trump-Putin Alaska Talks","text":"President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said that Kremlin strongman Vladimir Putin scored a “personal victory” by getting invited to talks with American president Donald Trump in the US, and went on to promise that the Ukrainian Armed Forces will not retreat from the Russian-occupied Donbas region, as Trump suggested.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Kyiv, Zelensky said “First, [Putin] will meet on US territory, which I consider his personal victory. Second, he is coming out of isolation because he is meeting on US territory. Third, with this meeting, he has somehow postponed sanctions,” Zelensky said.\n\nThe United States has imposed heavy sanctions on Russian individuals and entities but it is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court’s Rome statute, meaning American authorities are not obligated to arrest Putin on US soil for his outstanding warrants for war crimes. (By contrast, Mongolia is party to the statute, but authorities there failed to handcuff him when the Russian autocrat visited last September.)\n\nIn recent days, Trump has alluded to “land-swapping” in order to build a truce, though Ukraine has little Russian territory to “swap” in exchange for its own land.\n\nOn Monday, the US president insisted that Ukraine must accept the redrawing of its borders to achieve peace, but claimed that he would try to get “some very prime territory” back for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said such an action would pave the way for “a third war” and a future offensive on the Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions, as well as the city of Kharkiv.\n\n“We will not leave Donbas,” Zelensky said. “We cannot do that. Everyone forgets the first part — our territories are illegally occupied. For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive. If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will start a third war.\n\n“Why? Crimea was definitely a springboard for an offensive against the south of our country. Donbas was definitely a springboard for not sparing Ukrainian citizens, not using our own, not mobilizing (sorry to say this, but that’s how it is), and turning the separatists into the Russian army,” Zelensky emphasized.\n\nThe summit, which will take place in the Alaskan city of Anchorage on Friday, will be the first between a sitting US and Russian president since 2021, when then US President Joe Biden met with Putin in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe agenda at the time focused on nuclear arms control and human rights. While Russia had already illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, its full-scale invasion of Ukraine did not start until February of 2022.\n\nZelensky said he had received a “signal” from US envoy to Kyiv Steve Witkoff that Russia might agree to a ceasefire in Anchorage.\n\n“This was the first [such] signal from [the Kremlin],” Zelensky said.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, confirmed on Monday that the meeting came about after Putin requested it.\n\nWhitehouse spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the aim was “for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war”.","summary":"Uninvited to the summit and unwilling to cede Donbas, Ukraine’s leader worries that Putin has “postponed sanctions” with the US visit and could be coming back into Trump’s good graces.","url":"https://www.kyivpost.com/post/58017","image":"https://static.kyivpost.com/storage/2025/08/08/64780a6ced2a19873d785e9ee9ef47de.jpg?w=1200&q=90&f=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 23:16:18","author":"Kyiv Post","authors":["Kyiv Post"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ua","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":350532488,"title":"Trump’s pick to head Bureau of Labor Statistics walks back his earlier plan to scrap monthly jobs reports","text":"President Donald Trump’s pick to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics, who previously proposed scrapping monthly jobs reports, is now backing off that idea, according to a report.\n\nTrump tapped EJ Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, for the role after firing the agency’s last commissioner following her release of a poor July jobs report.\n\nAntoni proposed suspending the release of the monthly jobs reports in an August 4 Fox Business interview, one week before he was nominated to be the next BLS commissioner. \n\nHe has since walked back on that proposal, CNN reported. Antoni will continue to issue monthly jobs numbers if confirmed, Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore told CNN Tuesday. \n\nIt’s not immediately clear what may have changed his mind. The Independent has reached out to the Heritage Foundation for more information.\n\nMoore called Antoni’s proposal a “bad idea” and added the pair discussed the matter. “He’s backed off that,” Moore said. “We’re going to continue to do monthly numbers.”\n\nIn his Fox Business interview, Antoni slammed the agency for having unreliable data.\n\n“How on earth are businesses supposed to plan – or how is the Fed supposed to conduct monetary policy – when they don’t know how many jobs are being added or lost in our economy? It’s a serious problem that needs to be fixed immediately,\" he said. \n\nAntoni then suggested releasing data quarterly rather than monthly.\n\n\"Until it is corrected, the BLS should suspend issuing the monthly job reports but keep publishing the more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data,\" he continued.\n\nAntoni appeared on Fox News days after Trump fired former agency commissioner Erika McEntarfer and criticized the jobs report as inaccurate, which showed the economy added only 73,000 jobs in July. The agency also revised down the reports for May and June, revealing a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported.\n\nThe president fumed about the latest figures, even claiming on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” last week that “the numbers were rigged.”\n\nWhen announcing the nomination on Monday, Trump said in a Truth Social post that he believes Antoni “will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.”\n\nAsked on Tuesday if the Bureau of Labor Statistics will continue to issue monthly reports, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “I believe that is the plan, and that’s the hope, and that these monthly reports will be data that the American people can trust.”","summary":"EJ Antoni first made the suggestion before Trump tapped him to lead the BLS","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-labor-statistics-monthly-jobs-reports-b2806499.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/12/22/17/EJ-Antoni-Trumps-pick-to-lead-the-Bureau-of-Labor-Statistics-backed-off-from-his-suggestion-to-suspe.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TxDIRmtu-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-12 23:13:58","author":"Kelly Rissman","authors":["Kelly Rissman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":350547856,"title":"National Guard rehearsed show of force against immigration raid protesters, general testifies","text":"By OLGA R.
