That same month, the network announced the Late Show will shutter next year.\n\nExecutives described the decision to cancel Colbert as a purely financial one, though critics argued the network was bending the knee to appease the Trump administration, which held sway over a then-pending merger between Paramount and Skydance, a media company led by David Ellison, the son of Oracle founder and Trump backer Larry Ellison.\n\nThe merger was approved in August, and CBS News is now led by Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer and founder of the centrist publication The Free Press, a new media outlet that frequently criticizes so-called “woke” topics. \n\nAt CBS, long-time journalists have reportedly expressed skepticism towards Weiss, whose tenure has been marked by immediate layoffs.\n\nWeiss has reportedly used her connections and general acceptability to the right to serve as the network’s “chief booker,” helping secure interviews with Trump allies including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who played an important behind-the-scenes role in negotiations around the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.\n\nWeiss has also reportedly sought to court high-profile on-air talent to jump to the network such as Fox News’ Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper.","summary":"Trump’s feud with CBS lasted for months and set the stage for a controversial merger that sees the network under control of a top ally’s son","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-60-minutes-cbs-lawsuit-b2856483.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/16/02/South-Korea-Trump-Asia-66zfeotw.jpeg?crop=6000,4000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xgaaYRH8-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 01:16:57","author":"Josh Marcus","authors":["Josh Marcus"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.174},{"id":374614320,"title":"Trump vows to ‘fund SNAP as soon as possible’ if court allows, blasts Democrats over shutdown delay","text":"President Donald Trump said Friday his administration has asked federal courts to clarify whether it can legally release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments as the government shutdown continues.

Trump was interviewed by CBS' Norah O'Donnell Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air this Sunday. The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison. CBS News offered few details Friday on how the interview came together, or whether there were any ground rules put in place. O'Donnell, the former “CBS Evening News” anchor, is not one of the show's regular correspondents. Trump walked out of a “60 Minutes” interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl shortly before the 2020 election, complaining of bias, and his team released an unedited transcript of the conversation. Despite invitations, he did not agree to a “60 Minutes” interview during the 2024 election campaign. But he complained that the newsmagazine's interview with Harris, his Democratic opponent, was edited deceptively in order to make her look good. CBS News strongly denied any wrongdoing, but Trump filed a lawsuit against the company. Paramount decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle the case this summer, shortly before the Federal Communications Commission approved Paramount's merger with Ellison's Skydance Media. In the wake of the Trump lawsuit, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned this past spring, saying that it was becoming clear that he could no longer run the program independently. Since taking over at Paramount, Ellison has sent signals of a closer relationship with Trump. He hired Kenneth Weinstein , the former head of a conservative think tank and a donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, to serve in a role investigating complaints that the network had shown bias in its reporting. Paramount also purchased the Free Press website in October and named its founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss reportedly had a role in booking the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and aide Steve Witkoff for a “60 Minutes” interview two weeks ago, talking about the peace deal in Gaza. Flying back from the Middle East on Oct. 12, Trump told reporters that “Larry Ellison is great, and his son David is great. They're friends of mine. They're big supporters of mine, and they'll do the right thing.”","summary":"The president has an uneasy history with television's most popular newsmagazine.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/trump-returns-to-60-minutes-after-lawsuit-settlement-1914041","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/01/1973425-aa-5854143.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:57:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":374611674,"title":"The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, October 31","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\n Your Preview Pass expires in 00:00 Don't have a TV subscription?\n\nFull Episode October 31, 2025 1:36:10 \n FULL EPISODE\n\n EXP 7 DAYS\n The Story w/ Martha MacCallum - Friday, October 31 \n Donald Trump, White House, Economy \n Tags MOST RECENT EPISODES | VIDEOSTHE STORY WITH MARTHA MACCALLUM | FULL EPISODES","summary":"Donald Trump, White House, Economy","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6384376659112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/990505083001/1e03bf6b-d860-4207-8bec-ea511a6acb82/956f0d65-7a88-4c7c-8e04-5a3e43fae47a/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?pubId=694940094001?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:55:41","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":374613692,"title":"APEC summit to close in South Korea after Trump, Xi agreed on trade truce","text":"APBanners for APEC 2025 Korea are displayed during the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit at Gyeongju station in Gyeongju, South Korea, Friday, Oct. 31, 2025. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nLeaders of 21 Asian and Pacific Rim nations are to set to wrap up their annual economic forum on Saturday after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed on a temporary truce on their trade war, generating relief around the world. This year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the South Korean city of Gyeongju was heavily overshadowed by Thursday's Trump-Xi meeting that ended with the two leaders dialing back their earlier trade steps and de-escalating their trade tensions. The high-stakes meeting was arranged on the sidelines of APEC. Trump, known for his dismissal of multilateralism, quickly left South Korea after reaching deals with Xi, allowing the Chinese president to steal the limelight at the summit. During the APEC summit's opening session Friday, Xi said China would support global free trade and supply chain stability in an apparent effort to position his country as an alternative to Trump's protectionist policies. In written remarks sent to a CEO summit held in conjunction with APEC, Xi said that \"Investing in China is investing in the future.\" Xi met his Japanese, Canadian and Thai counterparts bilaterally on the sidelines of APEC on Friday. He's to meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Saturday for talks that Seoul officials said would touch on efforts to achieve denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula. Live Events That agenda at the Xi-Lee meeting angered North Korea, a non-APEC member. North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho on Saturday slammed South Korea for talking about \"its daydream\" of realizing North Korea's denuclearization, saying North Korea will show how such a push is \"a pipedream\" that can never be realized. Park's statement was seen as applying pressure on both South Korea and China ahead of their bilateral summit. Trump earlier repeatedly expressed his desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong U n during his visit to South Korea, but North Korea hasn't responded. Trump and Kim met three times in 2018-19, but their nuclear diplomacy eventually collapsed. North Korea has since vowed not to place its advancing nuclear program on a negotiating table, but experts say the North would aim for winning extensive sanctions relief in return for a partial surrender of its advancing nuclear program. Friday's APEC meeting focused on ways to boost trade and investment, and Saturday's meeting is expected to center on artificial intelligence, demographic challenges and new growth strategies. As the host nation, South Korea has been prodding members to adopt a joint declaration at the end of APEC's second and final day session on Saturday. In a 2018 APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, members failed to come up with a joint declaration due to U.S.-China discord over trade. South Korean officials earlier said that issuing a joint statement strongly endorsing free trade would be unlikely because of differing positions among APEC members Established in 1989, APEC champions free and open trade and investment to accelerate regional economic integration. But the APEC region now faces challenges like strategic rivalry between the U.S. and China, supply chain disruptions, aging populations and the impact of AI on jobs. The U.S. strategy has been shifted to economic competitions with China rather than cooperation, with Trump's tariff hikes and \"America first\" agenda shaking markets and threatening decades of globalization and multinationalism.

In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case brought by cities and non-profit organisations that the programme must be funded using at least the contingency funds and asked for a progress update by Monday. He also ordered that all existing waivers of SNAP work requirements, which the USDA had terminated for older adults, veterans and others, continue to be honoured. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued a written opinion calling the USDA’s suspension of benefits “unlawful” and directed the federal govt to inform the court by Monday whether it would use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the programme using both contingency funds and additional resources. “Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP programme.” The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.","summary":"President Trump has directed lawyers to seek court clarification on legally funding SNAP benefits amid a government shutdown.

Trump told reporters that the leaders discussed semiconductors without addressing Nvidia's most advanced artificial intelligence technology. He added that Chinese officials would talk to Nvidia about \"taking chips,\" with the United States playing \"referee.\" The remarks created confusion because Trump had suggested before the meeting that he would discuss Nvidia's most powerful AI semiconductors with Xi, fueling speculation that the United States might ease restrictions limiting access to the technology. \"I don't have any new insight from the meeting,\" Huang said at a news conference on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit Friday. \"I hope that we will have new policies that allow Nvidia to go back into China, for China to welcome Nvidia back.\" Amid skyrocketing demand for technology infrastructure to power AI systems, access to Nvidia's chips has become a national security issue. Nvidia has been thrust into the middle of the economic feud between China and the United States.Live Events Before Trump came into office, the U.S. government had already imposed rules to limit the sales of Nvidia's most powerful chips in China. The Trump administration initially banned exports of Nvidia's H20 chip, a downgraded version of the company's Hopper chips, which were made particularly for China. It reversed that decision in July, when Trump said the H20 chip could be sold and that the federal government would take a 15% cut of that revenue. But before Nvidia could move forward, China closed off the company's access to its market. In July, China's internet regulator summoned Nvidia to explain security risks associated with one of its chips. Beijing also discouraged Chinese companies from using the H20 chip, pushing them to try domestic alternatives. Huang said Nvidia's business in China is now at \"zero,\" after once holding almost total market share.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onJensen HuangAI technologyTrump Xi MeetingsemiconductorsH20 chipNvidiaChina US trade relationsChina market access\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.\n\nStaffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.\n\nBut Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.\n\n▶ Read more about the shutdown and U.S. aviation\n\n Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients \n\nInstacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments.\n\nthe company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300.\n\nThe San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.\n\nInstacart is one of several big companies reacting to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown.\n\n▶ Read more about companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients\n\n Trump back on ’60 Minutes’ for the first time after settling lawsuit \n\nThe president is returning to the weekly newsmagazine this weekend for the first time since the suit, which centered on its interview with Kamala Harris, was settled in the summer.\n\nTrump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday.\n\nThe president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.\n\n Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity \n\nThe president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first.\n\n“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday.\n\n“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”\n\nHe sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns \n\nThe policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP.\n\nIf military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.\n\nIt is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.\n\nThe new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them.\n\n▶ Read more about the policy\n\n Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps \n\nAn appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.\n\nThe court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.\n\nEllis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order, before going further and freezing it Friday.\n\nAlso Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.\n\n Senate Democrats urge top Trump national security officials to brief lawmakers on Venezuela strikes \n\nThe renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.\n\n“We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSignatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.\n\nThe letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.”\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months.\n\n Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians \n\nThe president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.\n\nThe designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that.\n\n“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’”\n\nNigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians. Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.\n\nTrump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.\n\n Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’ \n\nThe president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues.\n\nNick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable.\n\nDaniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work.\n\n“The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement.\n\n Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship \n\nAttorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBut Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.\n\nRaskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration.\n\n“What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter.\n\nRepublicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative.\n\n Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive \n\nThe federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.\n\nThe ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections.\n\n“Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion.\n\nKollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.\n\n Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes \n\nThe Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast.\n\nThe senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.\n\nThe requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes.\n\n Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling \n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”\n\nThe district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said.\n\nIf the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.”\n\n Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday \n\nA federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday.\n\nA Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling.\n\nThat process often takes one to two weeks.\n\nThe rulings are likely to face appeals.\n\n Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster \n\nTrump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!”\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.\n\nThe leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.\n\nA spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.”\n\n“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”\n\n Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judge rules \n\nTwo federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.\n\nThe rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.\n\nThe program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.\n\nThe program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.\n\n Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom \n\nThe president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House.\n\n“It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\n White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction \n\nThe White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom.\n\nThe East Wing was once part of tour routes, but has been demolished as part of the project.\n\nThe White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.”\n\nTo mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor.\n\nCongressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction.\n\n Heritage Foundation head defends Tucker Carlson for hosting white nationalist with antisemitic views \n\nThe president of the Heritage Foundation, a prominent Republican-aligned think tank, defended conservative media personality Tucker Carlson after he offered a platform to a far-right activist known for pushing white nationalist and antisemitic views.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts posted a video to social media Thursday in which he denied that the group was “distancing itself” from the former Fox News host after Carlson’s podcast hosted Nick Fuentes, whose followers see themselves as trying to preserve America’s white, Christian identity.\n\nRoberts’ video drew sharp rebukes from some prominent Jewish leaders from both parties.\n\nCarlson, one of the most powerful voices on the right, has been critical of the U.S.’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views, including the white-supremacist theory that says whites are being “replaced” by people of color.\n\n▶ Read more about Carlson and the Heritage Foundation\n\n Trump won’t clarify if the US will conduct tests of its nuclear weapons \n\nThe president was asked if his social media post this week about nuclear tests meant that the U.S. would resume testing its nuclear weapons in underground detonation tests, which it has not done since 1992. He replied: “You’ll find out very soon,” without elaborating.\n\nTrump said, “We’re going to do some testing” and “Other countries do it. If they’re going to do it, we’re going to.” But he then refused to offer more details.\n\nTrump’s comments on nuclear testing have drawn confusion inside and outside the government when the president seemed to suggest on social media that the U.S. would resume nuclear warhead tests for the first time in three decades on an “equal basis” with Russia and China, whose last known tests were in the 1990s.","summary":"Federal judges have ruled that the Trump administration must continue funding SNAP during the government shutdown","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-snap-federal-aviation-administration-tucker-carlson-senate-b2856485.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/01/00/Trump_16556.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:41:49","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":374611246,"title":"Democrats are screaming about the impact of THEIR government shutdown","text":"As Democrats drag the government shutdown on, they’re suddenly caterwauling about one thing they knew for sure their recalcitrance would cause: 40 million Americans on SNAP — food stamps — facing a benefits cliff.\n\nThey’ve even repurposed the “starving babies” meme, from Gaza to this standoff. “Donald Trump . . . thinks starving people help him politically!” shrieks Rep.

It is to prevent what happened to Katie from happening to anyone else. This will be only a small part of Katie’s legacy, but I’m proud to honor the beauty of her through this mission.”\n\nBut Katie’s mother, Denise Lorence, disagrees with Joe and has spoken out against “Operation Midway Blitz,” and feels Katie would not support such a policy.\n\nAs to Katie’s father, Denise just says, “He’s going through a lot of grief.”\n\nJoe Abraham’s daughter, Katie Abraham, was killed in a car crash in January in Urbana, Illinois, which is about two hours south of Chicago. Police arrested illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol, a native of Guatemala, and charged him with drunk driving and running from the scene of the accident. Cucul-Bol will serve 30-years in prison for the crime after he reached a plea deal.\n\nKatie’s dad has been a stalwart supporter of the president’s immigration policies and to show his continued support, Joe penned an op ed published by the Chicago Tribune on Friday.\n\n“My late daughter, Katie Abraham, touched many lives, each in their own way,” the grieving father wrote. “She had friends from every walk of life. She was kind, empathetic and endlessly curious. She made people feel seen and valued. Then her life was stolen by a criminal immigrant in the country illegally.”\n\n“That’s why I have supported and continue to support the Donald Trump administration’s ‘Operation Midway Blitz,’ the mission launched in her honor,” he continued. “Contrary to some of the criticism about it, this mission is not political. It is moral. It is to prevent what happened to Katie from happening to anyone else. This will be only a small part of Katie’s legacy, but I’m proud to honor the beauty of her through this mission.”\n\nHe continued, writing, “Katie’s death was preventable. She was killed by a man, Julio Cucul Bol, who entered and remained in our country illegally. He was using multiple aliases, exploiting gaps in an overwhelmed and disorganized immigration system. Illinois’ sanctuary law allowed this monster to roam free. He should have been removed long before he could take my daughter’s life.”\n\nAbraham also spoke to the inherent unfairness of allowing millions of illegals to flood our country.\n\n“It would be unjust and unreasonable to separate my family’s loss from the policies that failed us,” he said. “We did everything right. We worked hard, obeyed the law, paid our taxes, and trusted that government would protect us in return. That trust was broken. Our leaders — from the governor’s office on down — have treated immigration as a numbers game, not as a matter of public safety or national security. Governor Pritzker is filling Illinois’ census rolls with unvetted illegal aliens simply to preserve congressional seats and get more federal funding. Katie paid for his scheme with her life.”\n\n“Operation Midway Blitz, at its heart, is about restoring that balance. It seeks an immigration system that is both humane and secure. That’s what Katie would have wanted: a country that keeps its promises, a state that safeguards its citizens, and leaders who put their people first,” he wrote.\n\n“Her death cannot be in vain. Her legacy belongs to all who loved her — and to a nation that still has the power to learn from its mistakes,” Abraham concluded.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in September in honor of Katie.\n\nThe Abraham family is torn on the policy, however. Katie’s mother, Denise Lorence, has spoken out against “Operation Midway Blitz,” and insists that Katie herself would not support such a policy. She added that Katie’s name is being used to support “Operation Midway Blitz” even though she is not here to give her consent to the use of her name and image.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: Facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston, or at X/Twitter @WTHuston","summary":"Joe Abraham, whose daughter, Katie, was killed by an alleged drunk-driving illegal alien in Illinois, is solidly backing ICE's \"Operation Midway Blitz\" enforcement operation, shortly after the victim's mother, Denise Lorence, publicly denounced the Chicago-based sweep of illegal migrants launched in honor of their daughter.\n\n\nThe post Parents of Daughter Killed by Illegal Alien Divided on ICE&#8217;s &#8216;Operation Midway Blitz&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/10/31/parents-of-daughter-killed-by-illegal-alien-divided-on-ices-operation-midway-blitz/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/GettyImages2242424521-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:23:54","author":"Illegal Divided,Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Illegal Divided","Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.493},{"id":374611590,"title":"World News | Two US Judges Order Trump Administration to Use Emergency Funds for Food Aid During Shutdown","text":"Washington [US], November 1 (ANI): Two US federal judges ordered the Donald Trump administration to use billions of dollars in emergency funds to partially cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November, amid a prolonged government shutdown that has disrupted federal programs, CNN reported.\nThe rulings by judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island rejected a claim by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) that it could not access a contingency fund, which currently holds about USD 5.3 billion, to sustain the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

I mean, they don't have to do anything -- all they have to do is say the government is open,\" he said.\nThe SNAP program, a key component of America's food security network, has never failed to distribute benefits during a government shutdown in its decades-long history, though it came under strain during the 2018-2019 deadlock.\nThe Boston lawsuit was filed by a coalition of Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states and Washington, DC, while the Rhode Island case was brought by a group of cities, non-profits, unions, and small businesses.\nAs the shutdown nears its one-month mark, courts across the country are increasingly being drawn into disputes over its impact. Earlier this week, a federal judge in California blocked the administration from laying off thousands of federal workers, ruling that the government could not use the shutdown as justification.\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins told CNN the department was \"looking at all the options\" in response to the court orders, while the administration considers possible appeals.

According to a memo released Friday by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and Communications Director Steven Cheung, reporters will now need an appointment to visit the offices of senior communications aides. The White House cited “recent structural changes” as the official reason, noting that communications staff are now working more closely with the National Security Council and routinely handle “sensitive material.” However, the move also follows growing tensions between the Trump administration and the press. Cheung claimed on X (formerly Twitter) that “some reporters have been caught secretly recording video and audio of our offices, along with pictures of sensitive info, without permission.” He added that journalists had wandered into restricted areas, eavesdropped on private meetings, and even ambushed Cabinet secretaries as they entered or exited offices near the Oval Office. “Press still has access to the lower press area where our team can answer all inquiries,” Cheung wrote. “Reporters can make appointments to see us in our offices.” The new rules come amid a broader pattern of media restrictions under President Donald Trump’s administration. Certain outlets have been excluded from closed-door briefings, and new Pentagon access rules have forced many reporters to cover the military from outside its headquarters. Trump has also suggested moving the White House press corps “across the street” from the main building. The White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) strongly condemned the latest policy. “The new restrictions hinder the press corps’ ability to question officials, ensure transparency, and hold the government accountable,” WHCA President Weijia Jiang said in a statement. “Limiting access to areas long open for newsgathering serves only to the detriment of the American public.” Get Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from US News and around the World.","summary":"The White House has restricted reporters’ access to West Wing communications offices, citing security concerns after some were allegedly caught secretly recording videos and audio.

The exchange is seen as a tentative step forward in the fragile Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, particularly after militants previously returned the remains of two hostages.\n\nHowever, this incremental progress comes despite Israeli strikes on Gaza this week, which killed over 100 people following the death of an Israeli soldier.\n\nThe bodies were also transferred with the Red Cross serving as intermediary. The return of the Palestinian remains was confirmed by a doctor at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, where medical workers were striving to identify them.\n\nPhotos showed the remains, in white body bags, arranged in rows inside the grounds of Nasser Hospital. Health officials have struggled to identify bodies without access to DNA kits.\n\nThe handover brings the number of Palestinian bodies returned by Israel to 225, only 75 of which have been identified by families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It is unclear if those returned were killed in Israel during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, died in Israeli custody as detainees or were recovered from Gaza by troops during the war.\n\nThe bodies returned had been \"torn apart and exhumed,\" Munir al-Bursh, director general of Gaza's Health Ministry, said in a post on X.\n\n\"Their flesh had melted, their faces erased by fire, leaving behind only bones and teeth,\" he said.\n\nThe Israeli military has previously told The Associated Press that all bodies returned so far are those of combatants, a claim the AP was unable to verify. The military has said it operates in accordance with international law.\n\nAl-Bursh said recently that many of the bodies handed over appear to be fighters or others killed during the 2023 attack. Several relatives who have identified the bodies of family members said they weren't fighters.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late Thursday that the remains returned by Palestinian militants had been confirmed as those of Sahar Baruch and Amiram Cooper, both taken hostage during the 2023 attack.\n\nHamas has now returned the remains of 17 hostages since the start of the ceasefire, with 11 others still in Gaza and set to be turned over under the terms of the agreement.\n\nOn Friday a small crowd of Israelis gathered in the plaza known as Hostages Square, praying together for the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza.\n\n\"We cannot give up until everybody, all the bodies, will be here,\" said Rimona Velner, a Tel Aviv resident who joined the gathering. \"It's very important to the families and for us ... to close this circle.\"\n\nA senior U.S. official and a second source familiar with negotiations said that in messages passed to Hamas by mediators on Wednesday, Israel warned the militant group that its fighters had 24 hours to leave the yellow zone or face strikes.\n\nThat deadline passed Thursday evening, after which the senior U.S. official said \"Israel will enforce the ceasefire and engage Hamas targets behind the yellow line.\" Hamas did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Friday, Shifa hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said that one person had been killed by Israeli gunfire in northern Gaza. Israel's military said its troops had fired after the person approached troops in a way that posed a threat.\n\nIn a new assessment released Friday, the United Nations said satellite photos taken in early October show that 81% of all buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or otherwise damaged in the conflict.\n\nGovernment officials from eight Arab and Muslim nations will gather in Istanbul on Monday to discuss the next steps for Gaza, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Friday.\n\nThe talks follow a meeting between the countries' leaders and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations Security Council, preceding the ceasefire agreement. They mark the latest effort to create an International Stabilization Force in Gaza, outlined in a 20-point U.S. plan.\n\nThe ceasefire, which began Oct. 10, is aimed at winding down a war that is by far the deadliest and most destructive of those ever fought between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn the October 2023 attack on Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others hostage.\n\nIn the two years since, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 68,600 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and is staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.\n\nIsrael, which some international critics have accused of committing genocide in Gaza, has disputed the figures without providing its own tally.\n\nIn the central West Bank town of Silwad on Friday, mourners thronged the streets for the funeral of Yamen Hamed, 15, who Palestinian health officials say was shot by an Israeli soldier overnight. Samed Yousef Hamed kissed his son goodbye.\n\nSamed said his son left home Thursday to hang out with friends. Soon after, he learned the teen had been injured and Israel's army was preventing an ambulance from reaching him. Ahed Smirat, the ambulance driver who tried to reach Hamed following the shooting, told the AP that troops held him up multiple times. By the time they let him through, troops told him the teen had died, he said.\n\nIsrael's military called the teen a \"terrorist\" and said troops had fired believing that he was holding an explosive, but did not provide any evidence to support that characterization. Hamed's funeral was Friday.\n\nThe shooting is the latest in a surge of military killings of Palestinian children in the West Bank that has accompanied a general upswing in violence in the territory since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Some were killed during Israeli military raids in dense neighborhoods, others by sniper fire in peaceful areas.\n\nThe killings have risen as the Israeli military has stepped up operations in the occupied West Bank since the war's onset in what it calls a crackdown on militants.","summary":"The official stated that the remains were initially handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas in Gaza","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/red-cross-israel-remains-hostages-b2856475.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/31/10/Israel_Palestinians_Gaza_52055.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/onywMEY4-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:05:18","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":374610372,"title":"US strikes on alleged drug boats 'unacceptable', says UN human rights chief","text":"The UN human rights chief has called for an immediate end to US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that are allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk deemed the strikes \"unacceptable\" and called for an investigation into them, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organisation.\n\nRavina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk's office, relayed his message at a UN briefing on Friday: \"These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable.

earths. Some fear a ‘dig and dump’ redux","text":"Beneath hills draped in ancient rainforests, where rivers sustain millions and biodiversity flourishes, Southeast Asia hides a treasure coveted by global superpowers: rare earth elements.\nThese minerals – neodymium, dysprosium and yttrium, to name just a few – form the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to MRI scanners and missile guidance systems.\nAs much as one-fifth of the world’s untapped rare earth deposits are thought to nestle within the region, promising untold billions to whoever can extract and process them for a market hungry for the resources fuelling artificial intelligence, defence manufacturing and the world’s energy transition.\nChina, long the dominant player in rare earth extraction and processing, has increasingly turned to neighbouring Laos and Myanmar in search of additional deposits. Earlier this year, Beijing sent shock waves through global supply chains by imposing export controls on its own supplies – curbs it recently expanded, before announcing it would suspend some for a year from Friday following talks with the United States and South Korea.\n\nNow, Washington is also racing to stake its claim. Donald Trump was all smiles when he arrived at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit last weekend, but behind the scenes the US president wielded the threat of tariffs to pressure export-driven Asean economies into aligning with Washington’s agenda.\nHe departed with a clutch of trade agreements as well as the optics of a “peace deal” extending a ceasefire along a border that Cambodia and Thailand have bickered over for decades.\nMore consequentially, he secured two memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Thailand and Malaysia granting US companies preferential access to any newly discovered rare earth deposits, with both nations agreeing to offer American firms the first opportunity to invest, extract or purchase these resources at market rates.\nWe no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past\nTengku Zafrul Aziz, Malaysia’s trade minister\nIn Malaysia’s case, an additional clause explicitly prohibits export restrictions or quotas, raising eyebrows among environmentalists and trade analysts in a country that only last year imposed a ban on raw rare earth exports to promote domestic refining and value-added industries.\nBoth agreements include a vague provision to “review and deter certain critical minerals and rare earths asset sales on national security grounds” – with Beijing, Washington’s strategic rival, the presumed target.\nDenials and unease\nThe White House says neither agreement is legally binding and may be revoked by mutual consent, but scepticism abounds that Trump’s America would ever willingly relinquish any leverage.\nAs unease rippled through Thailand and Malaysia over the hastily signed pacts – and the uncertain value of the resources in play – both governments moved to allay fears of a sell-off of strategic national assets.\n\n“We no longer want to be a country that only digs and ships out cheap raw materials like in the past,” Malaysian Trade Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told parliament this week, reaffirming the export ban and outlining a policy to attract foreign investment and technology for domestic extraction and processing.\n“Our policy is not to prevent trade forever,” he said. “Our policy is to prevent the export of cheap unprocessed raw materials so that value is added to Malaysia.”\nMalaysia is simultaneously negotiating with China on rare earth processing, according to a recent Reuters report, with its sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional said to be in talks with Chinese firms about building a refinery.\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, under fire for his apparent capitulation to Washington’s demands, insisted there was no provision in the memorandum “that cancels or prohibits” sharing rare earths with other countries.\n\nThai officials have also been on the defensive. “This is not a binding treaty,” Thailand’s Industry Minister Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana said on Thursday.\n“Should any investment take place in Thailand, investors will be required to comply with Thai laws”, he added, citing environmental and public health assessments.\nThailand’s government has said it sees the US agreement as a long-term opportunity to build expertise in rare earths and expand its presence in the global supply chain, while having little impact on ties with China, its biggest trading partner.\nStill, fundamental questions remain. Who truly stands to benefit from this new resource rush? How can extraction be managed safely, given the toxic processes involved? And, if necessary, how can Malaysia and Thailand extricate themselves from agreements with the world’s pre-eminent superpower?\n“These are the nation’s resources, not bargaining chips for hidden political or economic deals,” said Phattarapong Leelaphat, an opposition lawmaker from Chiang Mai, adding that terminating the deal with a country “that holds multiple leverage points over us is no simple matter”.\n\nEcological costs\nChina controls an estimated 60-70 per cent of global rare earth deposits, but Southeast Asia holds up to 20 per cent of known reserves, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\nMost of these are in Vietnam, with about 3.5 million tonnes, and Myanmar, whose rare earth exports to China were valued at more than US$4.2 billion between 2017 and 2024, according to figures from the US Geological Survey and Washington-based Stimson Centre think tank.\nEnvironmentalists warn that Myanmar’s experience stands as a cautionary tale. Mining operations, particularly those in Kachin and Shan states, have left deep scars in the landscape, with toxins seeping into soils and rivers across borders. Pollution from 19 militia-controlled sites in Shan state turned the Kok River orange earlier this year, with arsenic levels soaring in the Mekong tributary that flows through northern Thailand.\nSatellite imagery revealed sprawling “leaching pools” filled with chemicals designed to flush rare earths from rock. Other solvents are used to separate minerals embedded in the same ore, sometimes with devastating ecological consequences.\n\nIn Thailand, government surveys indicate rare earth deposits run from Chiang Mai in the north through Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi down to Ranong and Surat Thani in the south. Yet even as US miners eye these resources, the pollution in the north of the country has made clear the risks posed by unregulated, or hastily regulated, extraction.\n“Thailand cannot realistically invest in rare earth mining in the US, because extraction there is far more expensive,” Phattarapong, the opposition MP, said in an open letter earlier this week.\n“The government must not approve any domestic rare earth mining operations or allow the US to use this MOU to pressure Thailand into opening up its own mines,” he added, urging the government to conduct comprehensive research and establish strong legal frameworks were in place to prevent environmental disaster.\nWith billions at stake, Southeast Asian governments are racing to tighten oversight of their rare earth sectors. In Indonesia, authorities created a dedicated ministry this year to regulate the industry, after unchecked nickel mining for electric vehicle batteries damaged coral reefs and excluded indigenous communities from the benefits of their land’s resources.\nMeanwhile in Laos, calls for stricter controls are intensifying after satellite images exposed dozens of illegal rare earth mines, mostly run by Chinese operators, clustered along rivers and tributaries.\n\nForests in peril\nMalaysia, with an estimated 16 million tonnes of rare earth deposits, has sought to harness its strategic assets for national gain.\nSoutheast Asia’s only rare earth processing plant is located in the Malaysian state of Pahang. But the 140-hectare (347-acre) site, operated by Lynas Rare Earths, currently only refines ores mined in Australia.\nAnwar’s government has vowed not to export raw rare earths, but the language of the US deal has cast doubt on this commitment.\nConservationists warn that a rare earth rush could further deplete Malaysia’s remaining rainforests, with deposits hidden away beneath the rich ecosystems of Terengganu, Kelantan, Perak, Pahang and Kedah.\n\n“Our critical minerals are primarily in high-carbon-stock areas, essentially our forests,” said climate policy analyst Aidil Iman. “This decision will only drive more deforestation.”\nMining is technically prohibited in so-called Permanent Forest Reserves under Malaysia’s National Forestry Act, but Aidil warned that surging demand might tempt state governments to strip protected lands of that status.\nMalaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030, designed to propel advanced manufacturing and green industries, envisions the rare earth sector drawing investments of up to 100 billion ringgit (US$24 billion) and creating about 4,000 jobs.\nAbout 144,000 hectares (356,000 acres) outside forest reserves had been identified for potential mining, acting natural resources minister Johari Abdul Ghani recently told parliament – though he said all projects would require environmental assessments and monitoring by the Forest Research Institute Malaysia.\n\nHe added that one pilot site in Gerik, Perak, was already using “in situ leaching technology” from China – a method that uses chemicals to flush rare earths from the soil rather than excavating them.\nConcerns persist that existing laws are too weak, or too easily flouted, to safeguard against environmental abuse. In Kedah and Perak, illegal rare earth mining in 2022 left behind toxic waste and stripped riverbanks of their biodiversity.\nThe Environmental Quality Act of 1974 remains Malaysia’s main environmental statute, but critics contend its penalties and enforcement are inadequate to address the scale and complexity of modern rare earth mining.\nAdam Farhan, co-founder of ecological watchdog RimbaWatch, called the law “outdated and too business-friendly to prevent extractive damage”.\nIt’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals\nAdam Farhan, environmentalist\n“It’s extremely concerning that Malaysia is signing away its sovereign right to regulate minerals,” he said.\nRenard Siew, a climate adviser at the Centre for Governance and Political Studies in Kuala Lumpur, said that the memorandum with Washington “shouldn’t be treated as a green light to expand mining unchecked”.\n“Responsible extraction must include proper environmental and social impact assessments, free and informed community consent, rehabilitation of mined areas and cleaner technologies,” he said.\nThe government insists that the “dig and dump” era of Malaysia’s extractive industries is long past, but experts warn the country risks too much by courting Trump’s White House.\n“While Malaysia may be rich in these rare earth resources vital for the global clean energy transition, we should not be pressured by external demands or swayed by short-term economic gains at the cost of environmental damage,” Randolph Jeremiah, vice-president of the Environmental Protection Society Malaysia, told This Week in Asia.\n“We need to retain full control over these resources, ensuring their exploitation is sustainable and that benefits are equitably secured for the nation in the long term.”","summary":"Beneath hills draped in ancient rainforests, where rivers sustain millions and biodiversity flourishes, Southeast Asia hides a treasure coveted by global superpowers: rare earth elements.\nThese minerals – neodymium, dysprosium and yttrium, to name just a few – form the backbone of modern technology, powering everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to MRI scanners and missile guidance systems.\nAs much as one-fifth of the world’s untapped rare earth deposits are thought to nestle within...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3331108/us-wants-southeast-asias-rare-earths-some-fear-dig-and-dump-redux","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/10/31/dd4bf30f-762d-4e7f-a361-13b517c939da_32734114.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-01 00:00:12","author":"Aidan Jones,Iman Muttaqin Yusof","authors":["Aidan Jones","Iman Muttaqin Yusof"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.011},{"id":374611882,"title":"Trump Outlines Plan Amid USDA Funding Ruling and Approaching SNAP Deadline","text":"President Donald Trump has revealed the measures he has implemented to prevent Americans from losing their SNAP benefits, as the deadline approaches amid the Democrats’ refusal to end the government shutdown.\n\nOn Friday, Trump took to X to address two separate federal court decisions concerning the conclusion of the food benefits program, set to expire on November 1.\n\nAccording to Susie Moore of RedState, both judges have mandated that Trump utilize emergency reserve funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to continue funding the benefits, due to the funding gap created by the Democrats.\n\nDive Deeper: A Democrat Breaks Silence on Schumer’s Shutdown Tactics and Party Strategies\nFurther Reading: Judicial Decisions in Two Cases Mandate Trump Administration to Deploy SNAP Reserve Funds\n\n“Our government attorneys argue that we lack the legal authority to disburse SNAP benefits using certain funds we have,” Trump stated. “Now, two courts have issued conflicting rulings regarding our capabilities. I am committed to ensuring Americans do not suffer from hunger simply because the Radical Democrats refuse to act responsibly and reopen the government.”\n\nMORE: Imperial Judiciary: Judges in 2 Separate Cases Order Trump Admin. to Use SNAP Contingency Funds\n\n“Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do,” Trump wrote. “I do not want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and reopen the government.”\n\n“Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” he added. “It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date, and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.”\n\n“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will be my honor to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.

One involved a judge in Rhode Island, District Court Judge John McConnell, who issued his ruling Friday, which basically directed that Trump use emergency reserves because Democrats are playing games with the American people.\n\nThe decision read:\n\nIn Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds, and he asked for an update on progress by Monday. Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. The USDA during the shutdown has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.\n\nIn Massachusetts, District Court Judge Indira Talwan held a hearing on Thursday morning for the state’s motion to force the use of the emergency funds.\n\nRedState’s Susie Moore wrote:\n\nMassachusetts, asserting, “on information and belief,” that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) “has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits.” The states essentially asked the court to rule that the USDA can’t suspend SNAP benefits despite the lapse in appropriations and order the USDA to pay benefits out of its contingency reserve.\n\nTalwan issued an order on Friday that “compels the Trump administration to jump through certain hoops,” Moore noted.\n\nNo later than Monday, November 3, 2025, Defendants shall advise the court whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November and, if so, their timeline for determining whether to authorize only reduced SNAP benefits using the Contingency Funds or to authorize full SNAP benefits using both the Contingency Funds and additional available funds.\n\nThis is a developing story.

(AFP pic)\nBOSTON: President Donald Trump's administration cannot suspend food aid for millions of Americans during the ongoing government shutdown, two federal judges ruled today, saying the government must use contingency funds to pay for the benefits.\nThe dual rulings by judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island came in a pair of lawsuits seeking to block the US department of agriculture's (USDA) suspension on Saturday of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, known as SNAP or food stamps.\nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress have been trading blame for the prolonged shutdown, which has put SNAP benefits in jeopardy.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the rulings mean that benefits will be paid on Nov 1.\nBoth judges ordered the administration to report back to them on Monday on how it will comply with their decisions.\nTrump said on social media that the federal government likely does not have legal authority to pay SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, and that his lawyers are asking courts \"to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible\".\n\"If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,\" Trump wrote.\nSNAP benefits are available to Americans whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or US$1,632 a month for a one-person household and US$2,215 for a two-person household in many areas.\nStates are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the benefits, which are paid out monthly.\nJudges say emergency funding can be used\nThe USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits to 42 million low-income Americans, as they cost US$8.5 billion to US$9 billion per month.\nThe administration said the agency lacked authority to pay them until Congress passes a spending bill ending a government shutdown that began October 1.\nHowever, US district judge John McConnell in Providence, at the end of a hearing in a lawsuit brought by cities, nonprofit organizations and a union, said the administration's decision not to tap US$5.25 billion in contingency funds to fund November benefits was arbitrary.\n\"There is no doubt and it is beyond argument that irreparable harm will begin to occur if it hasn't already occurred in the terror it has caused some people about the availability of funding for food, for their family,\" McConnell said.\nHe said the agency must distribute the emergency money \"as soon as possible,\" and if the money is insufficient, the agency should determine if money from a separate fund with around US$23 billion could be used.\nMinutes earlier, US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston ruled that the administration was wrong in saying it was legally barred from using the contingency funds to pay for SNAP benefits during the shutdown.\nThe Boston ruling came in a lawsuit brought by 25 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia.\nThe judge, who like McConnell was appointed by Democratic president Barack Obama, said the \"suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the contingency funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.\"\nAgriculture secretary disputed Democrats on funding\nThe USDA's shutdown plan, released last month, had said contingency funds were available to keep funding SNAP benefits if Congress did not enact spending legislation to avert the lapse in funding that began Oct 1.\nHowever, the department last week updated its website to say that no benefits would be issued on Nov 1 and that \"the well has run dry,\" prompting the filing of the lawsuits.\nAgriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said on Friday morning that the argument by Democrats in Congress and Democratic-led states - that the USDA has money to spend on November SNAP benefits - was a \"lie\".\n\"It is a contingency fund that can only flow if the underlying appropriation is approved,\" Rollins told reporters, speaking on Capitol Hill alongside House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson.\nDuring a Thursday hearing, justice department attorney Jason Altabet warned that partial payments, unprecedented in the program's history, could be difficult, saying that officials were \"legitimately scared\" about whether the antiquated systems some states use could handle their distribution.\n\"The agency thinks it would be catastrophic,\" he said.\nBoth McConnell and Talwani indicated, however, that the administration had the ability to fund SNAP benefits in full if it used its discretion to tap other funding to cover the shortfall.","summary":"Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been trading blame for the prolonged shutdown, which has put food aid programme benefits in jeopardy.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/11/01/trump-administration-cannot-suspend-food-aid-benefits-us-judges-rule","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/32d0b4dc-13458454_cropped_1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 23:46:54","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.607},{"id":374614758,"title":"Texas Congressman Chip Roy Discusses the Filibuster","text":"Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, is weighing in on President Donald Trump’s call for doing away with the Senate filibuster in an effort to end the government shutdown that began a month ago on Oct. 1.\n\n“[T]hat’s up to the Senate. Of course, it’s their rules. As someone who worked in the Senate and has a pretty good amount of expertise in the Senate, I have always been predisposed to enjoying the ‘cooling saucer’ and the higher threshold to move legislation through the Senate,” Roy told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe term “cooling saucer” is a metaphor for the Senate serving as a moderating force for legislation passed as “hot tea” by the House of Representatives. \n\nRoy, who has represented Texas’s 21st District in Congress since 2019, continued: “That being said, I said a couple of weeks ago that we need to take a long, hard look at a 51-vote threshold, because Democrats are clearly playing games.”\n\nThe Texas congressman has extensive experience in the Senate, having previously served as chief of staff for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and as a staffer for Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\n\nRoy explained, “It’s more about reclaiming the games that Democrats are playing with the 60-vote threshold for simple common-sense things. We’re not talking about a big, complicated, new piece of legislation that really ought to have a ‘cooling saucer’ approach. We’re talking about a freaking [continuing resolution].”\n\n“Like that’s how bad the Democratic Party has become, that they’re willing to play games, hold the government hostage, all while they’ve been holding the American people hostage to a broken health care system,” the Texas lawmaker continued.\n\nRoy commended the president for his outspokenness on the issue.\n\n“So, I think President Trump was right yesterday to rattle about a 50-plus-one voting option. And look, I’m happy to have that conversation,” he said, adding, “I can also tell you that I’m having strong conversations with my friends in the House about whether we should move either legislation or a constitutional amendment to force this question, because I’m tired of Democrats being the ones that play the games and go, ‘Oh, well, we’ll decide whether we’re going to break 60.’”\n\nRoy said that the Senate could, in theory, lower the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster so that it was still more than a simple majority, but less than 60 votes. That could potentially enable the GOP to end the government shutdown and pass more of their priorities without opening themselves up to the possibility that radical left-wing legislation gets passed if Democrats control the majority in the future. Republicans have been able to muster support from a few Democrat senators leading to 54- or 55-vote majorities to pay essential federal workers or pass the continuing resolution.Roy said that he thought the Democrats would abolish the filibuster the next time they controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress and expressed support for senators being required to actually have to speak in order to block legislation through a filibuster.\n\n“If you’re willing to be on the floor debating that, I’m on board, like, keep it up, but if you just got to throw an arbitrary 60 out there, then we better cement that for everybody, because otherwise, I don’t want to unilaterally disarm all my country. It’s getting decimated by liberals every time they get in office and they back-door, through reconciliation, things like Obamacare, and we’re all left holding the bag,” he said.","summary":"Rep.

The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winer of an election.\nUnder the Constitution, State governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with Federal laws that protect Americans’ voting rights and guard against dilution by illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance and error. Yet the United States has not adequately enforced Federal election requirements that, for example, prohibit States from counting ballots received after Election Day or prohibit non-citizens from registering to vote.\n\nThe order continues to note that “within 30 days of the date” of the executive order, the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) “shall take appropriate action to require, in its national mail voter registration form issued under 52 U.S.C. 20508” proof of U.S. Citizenship.\n\nKollar-Kotelly’s decision comes after she “agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs” in April, according to CBS News.\n\nIn her block in April, Kollar-Kotelly prevented the Trump administration from moving forward with enacting “two provisions of the executive order,” according to the outlet.","summary":"A federal judge blocked President Donald Trump's efforts to protect election integrity by requiring proof of United States citizenship on voter registration forms, finding that Trump \"lacks the authority to direct such changes.\"\n\n\nThe post Judge Blocks Trump from Requiring Proof of Citizenship on Voter Registration Forms appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/31/judge-blocks-trump-from-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-on-voter-registration-forms/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/Checking-a-Voters-Credentials-640x335.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 23:42:59","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":374602700,"title":"FBI Stops Possible Terror Threat in Michigan","text":"In a significant development, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on Friday that several individuals have been apprehended in Michigan for allegedly plotting a “potential terrorist attack” during the Halloween weekend.

Among Democrats, Mamdani has 54 percent support and Cuomo, who previously governed the state of New York as a Democrat, has 26 percent.\n\nThe poll found New Yorkers expect a wide array of the city's problems to get worse under a 'Mayor Mamdani,' including crime, antisemitism and the economy.\n\nIt found 47 percent believe levels of crime and violence will get worse, with only 32 percent saying the city would be safer under Mamdani. \n\nOn the issue of crime there was a stark split among New Yorkers based on age.\n\nFor voters under 30, 49 percent said they believed safety would improve under Mamdani, with 32 percent saying it would not.\n\nBut among over-65s only 26 percent thought the city would be safer under Mamdani and 50 percent said it would not.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll found 43 percent of New Yorkers expect the number of businesses in the city to decrease under Mamdani, with stores going under and potential entrepreneurs forced to head elsewhere.\n\nOnly 23 percent thought the number of businesses would rise under the democratic socialist.\n\nThe poll showed 39 percent expected the risk of terrorism to increase under Mamdani, with only 18 percent thinking it will lessen. \n\nAnd 45 percent thought the problem of antisemitic views in the city would get worse, with only 21 percent thinking it would improve.\n\nEven Democrats thought Mamdani would have a negative impact on antisemitism, with 29 percent saying he would make it better and 32 percent worse. \n\nEarlier this month, Mamdani faced a backlash after posting a picture of himself on social media with Imam Siraj Wahhaj, a Brooklyn-based Muslim cleric.\n\nWahhaj was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted potential co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a precursor to the 9/11 attacks. He was never charged with any crimes and denied involvement in the attack.\n\nThe poll revealed only one issue where New Yorkers thought Mamdani would improve the current situation.\n\nIt showed that 39 percent think housing would become more affordable under Mamdani, with 32 percent believing it would be less so.\n\nDemocrats backed him to reduce housing costs by 52 percent to 19 percent.\n\nThe poll also revealed a stark split among Democrat voters in New York, with many opposed to Mamdani.\n\nIt showed 33 percent of Democrats believe crime will rise, 29 percent think there will be less businesses, and 25 percent said the risk of terrorism will increase.\n\nThe poll was conducted between October 23 and 26 among 500 registered voters and had a margin of error of 4.4 percent.\n\nSliwa has resisted pressure to drop out to help Cuomo, suggesting if anyone was to stand down it should be Cuomo instead.\n\nCuomo is deeply unpopular with Republicans so Sliwa withdrawing may not greatly assist him.\n\nEarlier this month, Sliwa vowed he would only leave the race if 'a Mack truck hits me and I get turned into a speed bump, and they can’t recover me in the I.C.U. That’s the only way.' \n\nMamdani, who is running to be New York's first Muslim mayor, was born in Uganda and moved to New York aged seven. \n\nHis father is an academic and his mother a filmmaker. As a child he went to a private school in Manhattan where fees are now $66,000 a year.\n\nDespite his ultra-privileged upbringing Mamdani is successfully appealing to working-class voters and young adults who find New York increasingly unaffordable to live in, with promises that he will bring their costs down.\n\nHis platform of policies includes a freeze on rent hikes, free bus services, fully-funded day care for under-5s, city-owned grocery stores, and turbocharging the minimum wage ultimately to $30 an hour.\n\nHe wants to fund those policies, which will cost billions of dollars, by raising taxes on the rich and companies.\n\nThere would be a 2 percent increase on New Yorkers earning over $1 million a year, and the top corporate tax rate would rise from 7.25 percent to 11.5 percent.\n\nCritics say that will lead to a surge of firms and high-earning individuals leaving New York, which will in turn decimate the city's tax revenue and Mamdani unable to pay for his policies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has branded Mamdani a 'communist' and threatened to cut off federal funding to the city if he is elected.\n\nBut the president is reportedly resigned to Mamdani winning, with it seemingly tooo late for Cuomo or Sliwa to catch up.","summary":"The socialist spent Friday at a senior center on the Lower East Side joining in on a dance class before participating in a tai chi lesson.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15247495/Zohran-Mamdani-dances-nyc-mayor-election.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/31/22/103497097-0-image-m-15_1761950535322.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/21/5945008853971812270/1024x576_MP4_5945008853971812270.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-31 23:34:56","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Therefore, opening I-580 to trucks is only a temporary solution to I-880 congestion, but the negative health effects would be permanent.\n\n‘No Kings’ could launch\nnew era of activism\n\nThe “No Kings” protest offers everyone an opportunity to have their voice heard and is showing a younger generation that they have the ability to change the political standing of this country.\n\nI think that many of the younger people of this country have succumbed to the idea that they have no real power in the political game of America due to a lack of real activism taking place, but the recent “No Kings” protests were not only displaying that real activism is possible but also building bridges toward a more united and free America. Every major city and many minor ones have seen large protests geared toward a single goal: a more democratic, fair and free America.\n\nThis is a real opportunity to deliver change to the nation, and if done right, could be used as an example for future generations.\n\nLogan Perkins\n\nNewsom shouldn’t\ncritique Trump ballroom\n\nI find it laughable that Gavin Newsom is so critical of the addition of a ballroom to the White House, an addition that will not be paid for by any California taxpayers.\n\nApparently, our governor has forgotten that there is currently an addition being constructed at our state Capitol building at a projected cost of $1.1 billion of California taxpayers’ money. I’m guessing that not a lot of Californians are even aware of this project. And let’s not even get started on the significant cost overruns on the state’s high-speed rail project.\n\n“Those who live in glass houses.”\n\nMark Blanchard\nSan Lorenzo\n\nWe need a Prop. 13\nfor local zoning fees\n\nRe: “Horse lovers buck new idea” (Page A1, Oct. 29).\n\nHow can local governments justify such high permit fees ($10,000)? Does government provide some kind of service for this fee? Apparently not.\n\nThis appears to be anti-business and does not serve the public in any meaningful way. It’s just a way to fund the government, which is completely undeserved. And zoning appears to be driving businesses out of business. It’s just more bureaucratic stupidity.\n\nLet’s roll back the fees, Proposition-13 style, and stop zoning from destroying businesses.\n\nGordon Brown\n\nNBA is taking part\nin a TV shakedown\n\nFrom the web: “To watch every Warriors game, you’ll need a combination of services: NBA League Pass for out-of-market games, and a live TV streaming service like Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, or FuboTV for nationally broadcast games on channels like NBC, ESPN and ABC. For local fans, a Peacock subscription with the NBC Sports Bay Area add-on can stream locally televised games.”\n\nIs this necessary? It certainly is annoying. The greed is breathtaking.\n\nRichard Kruger\n\nTrump’s designs to stay\nin office inspire fear\n\nAnyone who doesn’t think that Donald Trump and the Republican Party have no plans to stay in power for the foreseeable future has a lot of unused space between their ears.\n\nEven though the Supreme Court has granted Trump immunity for any actions he takes while in office, it doesn’t apply to anyone else. How many laws have been broken and violated the Constitution? I believe most will go to jail with a new administration if they lose power. Trump has hinted several times that he wants another term. Even though the Constitution forbids it, that will not stop the Republican Party from trying.\n\nRight now, I am very afraid for America.\n\nJohnny Strawther\n\nLet’s rid White House\nof worst tenant ever\n\nWe, the People, after 46 responsible tenants, trusted this tenant, who vetted so well but turned out to be our worst nightmare.\n\nHe doesn’t pay the rent, he’s alienated all the neighbors, can’t control his attack dogs, even though the rental agreement says no pets, cut down the trees on our property, and tore down half our house to build himself a master suite.\n\nWhen you tell him he’s violated the rental agreement and you’re evicting him, he sues you for $230 million, and you can’t get him and his criminal pals out of your house.

That also brings uncertainty about how things will unfold and will delay payments for many beneficiaries whose cards would normally be recharged early in the month.The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. It costs about $8 billion per month nationally.U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said Friday's rulings from judges nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama confirm what Democrats have been saying: \"The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”Trump posted on social media Friday, blasting congressional Democrats for the shutdown and suggesting the government would comply with the rulings but also that it needed more clarity first: “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.\"Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states and the District of Columbia challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials said not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds. He asked for an update on progress by Monday.Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. The USDA during the shutdown has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.There were similar elements in the Boston case, where U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA has to pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the federal government to advise the court by Monday as to whether they will use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program “using both contingency funds and additional available funds.“Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program.”No matter how the rulings came down, the benefits for millions of people will be delayed in November because the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.The administration did not immediately say whether it would appeal the rulings.States, food banks and SNAP recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries. Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.Most states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.Across the U.S., advocates who had been sounding the alarm for weeks about the pending SNAP benefits cut off let out a small sigh of relief as the rulings came down Friday, while acknowledging the win is temporary and possibly not complete.\"Thousands of nonprofit food banks, pantries and other organizations across the country can avoid the impossible burden that would have resulted if SNAP benefits had been halted,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case.Cynthia Kirkhart, CEO of Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington, West Virginia, said her organization and the pantries it serves in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia will keep their extra hours this weekend, knowing that the people whose benefits usually arrive at the start of the month won’t see them.“What we know, unless the administration is magical, is nothing is going to happen tomorrow,” she said.Kristle Johnson, a full-time nursing student and mother of three in Florida, is concerned about the possibility of reduced benefits.Despite buying meat in bulk, careful meal planning and not buying junk food, she said, her $994 a month benefit doesn’t buy a full month’s groceries.“Now I have to deal with someone who wants to get rid of everything I have to keep my family afloat until I can better myself,” Johnson said of Trump.At a Washington news conference earlier Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs SNAP, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of the program for long. Speaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of health care funds.A push this week to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses can’t exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $31,000 per year. Last year, SNAP provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children.“The court’s ruling protects millions of families, seniors, and veterans from being used as leverage in a political fight and upholds the principle that no one in America should go hungry,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said of the Rhode Island decision.","summary":"Federal judges rule Trump administration must use emergency funds to continue SNAP payments during shutdown, affecting 1 in 8 Americans who rely on food aid.","url":"https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/federal-judges-order-trump-administration-to-use-emergency-funds-for-food-aid","image":"https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/federal-judges-order-trump-administration-to-use-emergency-funds-for-food-aid-1761953233979-16_9.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 23:27:20","author":"Associated Press Television News","authors":["Associated Press Television News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":374604418,"title":"Trump touts Lincoln Bathroom overhaul featuring marble, gold fixtures","text":"Accessibility statementSkip to main content\n\nDemocracy Dies in Darkness\nSave and subscribeSign in\n\nDemocracy Dies in Darkness\n\nPoliticsDonald TrumpThe FixThe BriefsPollingDemocracy in AmericaElections\n\nPoliticsDonald TrumpThe FixThe BriefsPollingDemocracy in AmericaElections\n\nTrump touts Lincoln Bathroom overhaul featuring marble, gold fixtures\nThe president unveiled the renovation project on his way to spend the weekend at his club in Mar-a-Lago as pressure mounts to reopen the government.\n\nOctober 31, 2025 at 7:27 p.m. EDT24 minutes ago\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a ballroom fundraising dinner Oct. 15 in the East Room of the White House.

(AFP pic)\nNEW YORK: The UN Security Council (UNSC) voted yesterday in favour of a resolution brought forward by the US backing Morocco's autonomy plan for Western Sahara as the \"most feasible\" solution for the disputed territory, angering Algeria.\nThe Western Sahara is a vast mineral-rich former Spanish colony that is largely controlled by Morocco but has been claimed for decades by the pro-independence Polisario Front, which is supported by Algeria.\nThe security council had previously urged Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria and Mauritania to resume talks to reach a broad agreement.\nHowever, at the initiative of Donald Trump's administration, the council shifted to support a plan, initially presented by Rabat in 2007, in which Western Sahara would enjoy autonomy under Morocco's sole sovereignty.\nThe resolution, adopted by 11 votes with none against and three abstentions - with Algeria refusing to participate - said autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty may be the basis for future negotiations to resolve the 50-year-old conflict.\n\"Genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty could constitute a most feasible solution,\" the UNSC resolution said.\nMorocco's King Mohammed VI lauded the vote as \"historic,\" saying \"we are opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara\".\nTrump, during his first term in office, in 2020 recognised Morocco's claim to Western Sahara after Morocco normalised relations with Israel - achieving top diplomatic objectives for both Rabat and Washington.\nSpain, France, Britain and Germany have since expressed support for Morocco's sovereignty over the territory.\nUS-led resolution \nTrump, who has set his sights on receiving a Nobel Peace Prize, often boasts about his ability to help end conflicts around the world, claiming key roles in Gaza, Kashmir and several other hotspots in recent months.\nThe UN envoy on Western Sahara, Staffan de Mistura, has welcomed US efforts to solve the issue but raised concerns about lack of detail in Morocco's plan.\nAlgerian Ambassador Amar Bendjama said the text \"does not faithfully or sufficiently reflect the UN doctrine on decolonisation.\"\nIt \"fell short of the expectations and legitimate aspirations of the people of Western Sahara, represented by the Polisario Front (who) have been resisting for over 50 years to have, as the sole party, a say in their own destiny,\" he added.\nThe resolution adopted Friday calls on UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and de Mistura to conduct negotiations on the basis of the plan to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.\nIt also extends the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara for another year.","summary":"The Western Sahara is a vast mineral-rich former Spanish colony that is largely controlled by Morocco.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2025/11/01/un-security-council-backs-morocco-plan-for-western-sahara-autonomy","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/df5be367-afp__20230920__33vu7u8__v2__midres__moroccoroyal_cropped_1.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-31 23:21:52","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":0.031},{"id":374610324,"title":"White House Restricts Reporters' Access To Part Of Press Office","text":"US President Donald Trump's administration on Friday barred reporters from accessing part of the White House press office without an appointment, citing the need to protect \"sensitive material.\"Journalists are now barred if they do not have prior approval to access the area known as Upper Press -- which is where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt's office is located and is near the Oval Office.Reporters have until now been able to freely visit the area, often wandering up to try to speak to Leavitt or senior press officers to seek information or confirm stories.Media are still allowed to access the area known as \"Lower Press,\" next to the famed White House briefing room, where more junior press officers have their desks, the memo said.The policy comes amid wider restrictions on journalists by the Trump administration, including new rules at the Pentagon that major outlets including AFP refused to sign earlier this month.The change at the White House was announced by the National Security Council in a memorandum titled \"protecting sensitive material from unauthorized disclosure in Upper Press.\"\"This memorandum directs the prohibition of press passholders from accessing...

That process will begin immediately.\"\n\nOn Friday, onboard Air Force One, when asked about his plan to resume nuclear tests, Trump told reporters \"You'll find out very soon, but we're going to do some testing, yeah. Other countries do it. If they're going to do it, we're going to do it.\"\n\nExperts say it's unclear what type of testing Trump is referring to.\n\n\"He may be thinking of missile testing, which the U.S. already does regularly. If he is referring to explosive nuclear testing, that is much more alarming,\" Tara Drozdenko, director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ABC News.\n\nDrozdenko said resuming nuclear testing would be a \"political statement, with major consequences.\" She said it could motivate other nuclear powers like Russia and China to restart their own nuclear testing programs. Currently, North Korea is the only nation that is not observing a freeze on nuclear testing. \n\nIf the U.S. resumes nuclear tests, it's unclear what form they would take.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, the U.S. conducted more than 1,000 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, when President George H.W. Bush announced a unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons testing. Those tests took place in various environments, including the atmosphere, underground and underwater.\n\nNorman Kleiman, an associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University, said nuclear testing can range from nonradioactive, known as subcritical, to incredibly radioactive. He said concerns about how explosive nuclear testing can impact health and the environment played at least some role in ending it.\n\n\"I hope to God, and don't think he's talking about above-ground testing. That would be crazy,\" said Keliman. \"I think probably the more realistic approach, if in fact this is real, would be some non-explosive or non-fissionable testing.\"\n\nWhen a nuclear explosion occurs, particles containing radioactive material can spread over a wide area, potentially for miles. These radioactive particles can then come into contact with people, animals and the environment.\n\nDepending on the test, the impacts can be confined to a small area or have broader regional effects, Kleiman said.\n\nIf people are exposed to radioactive byproducts of a nuclear test, they are at risk of severe illness in the short term and an increased likelihood of cancer down the line. Kleiman says that radiation damages human DNA and causes mutations that are associated with cancer development.\n\n\"So the biggest risk for radiation is to the unborn child in terms of orders of magnitude, the risk to an unborn child is far greater than any other risk, because you have so many cells that are developing and dividing, and things can go wrong very quickly,\" explained Kleiman. \n\nThere is also the potential for long-term environmental impact. According to a 2014 study, nuclear testing in the second part of the 20th century had \"serious ecological and social consequences.\"\n\nThe paper's author found evidence of long-lasting radioactive contamination of the land, air and water across the planet, with hotspots of contamination at major test sites.\n\nWhile it's unlikely that the U.S. would resume atmospheric testing, previous tests have been responsible for the spreading of radioactive fallout. According to the EPA, \"Detonating nuclear weapons above ground sends radioactive materials as high as 50 miles into the atmosphere. Large particles fall to the ground near the explosion site, but lighter particles and gases travel into the upper atmosphere.\"\n\nThe agency says that radioactive particles can be swept into the atmosphere and fall back to Earth as fallout. \"The highest particles can circulate around the world for years until they gradually fall to Earth or are brought back to the surface by precipitation,\" according to the EPA.\n\nThe United Nations says atmospheric testing was responsible for a radiological disaster in the Marshall Islands in 1954. After testing a hydrogen bomb at Bikini Atoll, radioactive particles reached inhabited islands, a fishing boat and the members of the U.S. military. Some of the Marshall Islands remain radioactive to this day. \n\nUnderwater testing is when the explosion takes place in water. In this type of test, the blast can disperse radioactive water and steam, contaminating marine life and nearby ships. \n\n\"Let's start with the worst-case scenarios. He does do underground testing. What would happen if you exploded a nuclear bomb in one of these underground tunnels? You would have radioactive decay products, which could contaminate the environment,\" said Kleiman.\n\nUnderground testing involves an explosion occurring under the surface of the Earth.

Zohran Mamdani has described capitalism as 'theft' and the police as 'evil' - and now he's set to be mayor of New York: TOM LEONARD","text":"The best disaster movies usually have a scene where terrified New Yorkers scramble desperately to get out of the city to escape approaching doom. \n\nOr else disaster has already struck, civilisation has collapsed and tumbleweed drifts up Fifth Avenue towards the escaped lions roaming Central Park.\n\nMany citizens of the Big Apple believe there could be just such a calamity approaching early next week in the form of a fresh-faced, 34-year-old politician whose run for New York City mayor could prove just as disastrous for the city and possibly America, too, as any invading aliens or killer virus.\n\nZohran Mamdani, who loves cricket and Arsenal football club but is rather less keen on Israel and billionaires, is well ahead in the polls after conducting a masterful campaign of viral TikTok videos and intensive campaigning by 90,000 volunteers that has left younger voters swooning.\n\nFemale supporters such as supermodel Emily Ratajkowski donning 'Hot Girls For Zohran' T-shirts can't have hurt either.\n\nComing from nowhere to become the official Democrat candidate, he's widely expected to win Tuesday's election over New York's former Democrat governor Andrew Cuomo (who is running as an Independent) and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.\n\nHis Millennial and Gen Z groupies hail the idealistic, charismatic, self-confident but painfully inexperienced Mamdani – who won the 'biggest smile' prize at middle school – as a populist saviour who can reinvigorate a party that's lost its way. \n\nInevitably, he's being breathlessly compared to Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, the prospect of victory for his radical, unashamedly socialist agenda of squeezing the rich to pay for sweeping handouts – Mamdani's battle cry is 'affordability' – as well as controversial initiatives such as replacing police with social workers, freezing rents for millions, setting up government-run grocery shops, not to mention his vitriolic attacks on Israel, have horrified many New Yorkers. \n\nA man who has described capitalism as 'theft' and the city's police department as 'evil', could soon be dictating the fortunes of its 8.5million residents.\n\nCorporate business leaders are threatening to flee the home of Wall Street for lower tax alternatives such as Florida and Texas. \n\nThe Lone Star state already boasts more bankers than New York.\n\nThe real estate industry, which has put many projects on hold, has forecast meltdown in New York with cash-strapped landlords leaving swathes of buildings empty amid soaring costs. \n\nEstate agents in affluent suburbs outside New York already report a significant rise in wealthy people leaving the city. \n\nFlorida estate agents have reported a similar increase in interest from well-heeled New Yorkers.\n\nA poll last week claimed 26 per cent of New Yorkers would consider leaving if he won. \n\nThey are likely to include many Jews – 12 per cent of the city's population – who've said they fear that Mamdani's history of anti-Israel activism will make them less safe amid rising anti-Semitism.\n\nBut almost nobody's more dismayed by the prospect of a Mayor Mamdani than moderate Democrats. \n\nNot only are they convinced that he's making ridiculously unaffordable promises that will backfire on them when they inevitably aren't delivered, they also fear his victory would lead to a takeover of the rudderless party by the hard Left, destroying any hope of vanquishing Donald Trump and his MAGA cohorts.\n\nGiven the weight of evidence indicating Democrats handed the 2024 election on a plate to Trump because they came across as an out-of-touch and obsessively woke party, they're right to be worried.\n\nAmericans who don't live in New York are usually at pains to point out how unrepresentative it is of the rest of the US, but this particular Big Apple squabble has implications that go well beyond the city limits.\n\nMamdani (who's benefited considerably from facing unappealing rivals) has called the election a 'battle for the soul of the Democratic Party' while his main rival, Andrew Cuomo – who resigned as New York governor in disgrace after a string of sexual harassment allegations (that he denies) in 2021 – this week admitted that Mamdani's rise has sparked a 'quiet civil war' within the party.\n\nNow, nobody would deny the Democrats desperately need to perk themselves up, just as few would disagree that New York – where I've lived for 20 years – could usefully do the same. \n\nIts public services are generally dismal while the disparity between its rich and poor neighbourhoods is so stark you can feel you're in South Africa or Brazil not the United States.\n\nAnd yet, plead older and more experienced voices, Zohran Mamdani and his wackadoodle ideas are not the answer.\n\n'[Mamdani] really could lose us the House [of Representatives], perhaps even the White House,' a well-placed Democrat insider told me. \n\n'If he wins in New York, people will assume he's the future and many more progressives will run for office. But his ideas will horrify voters in the Midwest and South.'\n\nOr as Hank Sheinkopf, a former adviser to President Clinton, puts it: 'Every time Zohran opens his mouth, he creates another suburban Republican.'\n\nMamdani sceptics have another lurking fear – that he will spark a bloody confrontation with Trump that would only hurt New York.\n\nThe President, who's called him a '100 per cent communist lunatic' and 'total nut-job', is clearly relishing a fight if Mamdani wins. \n\nHe's threatened to withhold federal funding from the city and send in National Guard troops to patrol the streets.\n\nSo how has America's biggest and most important city likely fallen into the hands of a politician who's never run anything and until only a year ago was an obscure member of the New York State Assembly?\n\nPreviously notable only for being the son of a celebrated filmmaker, his Oscar-nominated mother Mira Nair, the well-connected Mamdani first made headlines in 2019 when, as a wannabe rapper, he persuaded India-born TV cook and actress Madhur Jaffrey – a family friend, naturally – to appear in his music video.\n\nHe was born in Uganda to parents of Muslim Indian descent. \n\nThey came to New York when he was seven and his father, a prominent Left-wing academic, got a job at Columbia University.\n\nAt high school, the teenage Mamdani ran for student vice-president on a pledge to give everyone free 'locally-sourced' fruit juice every day. \n\nOf course, they never got it. 'I promised things that were simply impossible,' he admitted years later. If only he'd learnt his lesson, wail his detractors.\n\nAfter failing to make it in the music business, he turned to politics. \n\nMamdani polled close to zero per cent when he launched his mayoral bid last year but his popularity soared on the back of an adept social media campaign in which he showed himself to be a skilled communicator. \n\nStunts helped, such as jumping fully-clothed into a frigid sea in a video titled: 'I'm freezing... your rent.'\n\nEarlier this year, he married Rama Duwaji, a Syrian-born illustrator he met on a dating app and who shares his trenchant views on Palestine.\n\nCritics have pounced on disquieting past remarks that they insist reveal the real Mamdani. \n\nIn a widely criticised 2020 tweet, he wrote that 'Nature is healing' after someone posted they 'saw a cop crying in his car'. \n\nAnd in 2021, he gave a speech to the youth branch of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) in which he said that the 'end goal' was – and he quoted Karl Marx – 'seizing the means of production'. \n\nThe same year, the DSA – of which he remains a member – issued a list of its policies that included nationalising vast tracts of the US economy; abolishing the police, prisons and border enforcement; and providing government funding for 'gender-affirming surgeries' for minors without parental consent.\n\nHow much of this political shopping list he supports he refuses to say, although his cheerleaders insist he has moderated his views.\n\nAnd yet, as far as a growing number of young Americans are concerned, he probably doesn't need to bother. \n\nA recent survey by the Cato Institute and YouGov revealed that 62 per cent of Americans aged 18-29 say they hold a 'favourable view' of socialism.\n\nEven his opponents agree that, given the high cost of living in New York, he was astute to campaign on affordability. \n\nIt's his pie-in-the-sky solutions they take issue with.\n\nLarry Summers, US Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, has accused Mamdani of promoting 'Trotskyite economic policies'.\n\nHe wants to freeze the rent for more than two million occupants of apartments where rent increases are already tightly regulated. \n\nBut pundits warn landlords will respond by keeping properties vacant, reducing the rental market housing stock, or could struggle to afford repairs.\n\nMamdani also wants to create 200,000 union-built, '100 per cent affordable' homes, which would cost $100billion (£76billion) over ten years. \n\nHe wants buses to be free for all, which will cost up to $800million (£609million) a year.\n\nMamdani intends to spend $60million (£45.7million) a year subsidising food in at least five grocery stores that will sell at wholesale prices. \n\nHe also wants to almost double the minimum wage to $30 (£22.80) an hour. \n\nIn both cases, say opponents, he'll end up putting hundreds of businesses such as corner shops and restaurants out of business.\n\nCrime is an issue that particularly worries New Yorkers but Mamdani, who has called violence an 'artificial construction', has minimised the importance of policing. \n\nUntil recently, a vociferous supporter of 'defunding' the police, he has now apologised for previously calling the NYPD racist and 'wicked and corrupt'. \n\nHowever, he still wants to shift $1billion (£760million) from policing to a new 'department of community safety' that focuses on 'restorative justice' and 'violence interrupters'. \n\nThe latter are social workers who'll be sent out rather than police to deal with mental health emergencies. \n\nMamdani, whose professor father argues that hate crime is a legacy of colonialism, has promised to increase funding of hate crime prevention by 800 per cent.\n\nThe strident pro-Palestine activist has also tried to move on from what he's said in the past about Israel and the Gaza war. \n\nHe's denied claims he's anti-Semitic and says he's now the victim of Islamophobia – but the fact remains he has questioned Israel's right to exist and refused to condemn the phrase 'globalise the intifada' even though many Jews regard it as an exhortation to extinguish their race.\n\nAnd what of his expensive policies – how is he going to pay for everything? \n\nNaturally, for a man who's said billionaires shouldn't exist, the answer is to tax the rich and businesses. \n\nHe wants to raise income tax for anyone earning more than $1million (£760,000) by two per cent and corporation tax from just over seven per cent to 11.5 per cent.\n\nIn fact, he actually cannot raise taxes or fulfil many of his other pledges without the support of New York governor, Kathy Hochul, and state politicians. \n\nHochul is a centrist Democrat who doesn't have much time for Mamdani, but she belatedly endorsed him and will feel under pressure to defer to his electoral mandate if he wins.\n\nShe knows, even if Mamdani supporters apparently do not, that politicians can't get much done if they erode the tax base that pays for it.\n\nIn New York, about one per cent of taxpayers pay 40 per cent of the city's income taxes but rich people – just like companies – can simply move to another state, a movement that's already started.\n\nA prominent Manhattan hedge fund manager has predicted that if just 100 of his industry's highest taxpayers chose to live most of each year outside New York, it could reduce state and city taxes by some $10billion (£7.6billion).\n\nMamdani wasn't around to remember it but New York very nearly went bankrupt in 1975 thanks to chronic overspending, an economic downturn and investors losing confidence in the city.\n\nExperts have warned it could easily happen again – and that was even before the city that never sleeps faced the daunting prospect of having Mamdani at the helm.","summary":"The best disaster movies usually have a scene where terrified New Yorkers scramble desperately to get out of the city to escape approaching

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled on Friday.\n\n\"The president directed the Election Assistance Commission to 'take appropriate action' to alter the national mail voter registration form to require documentary proof of United States citizenship,\" Kollar-Kotelly said in her 81-page ruling.\n\nBecause Trump does not have the authority to order the EAC to alter federal election procedures, Kollar-Kotelly permanently enjoined the EAC and others from enforcing the president's directive.\n\nThe ruling arises from challenges to Executive Order 14,248 -- Preserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections, which Trump signed on March 25.\n\nIn it, the president orders the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship on the national mail voter registration form to ensure foreign nationals are not submitting votes via mail-in ballots.\n\nState or local officials in turn would record the type of document used to show proof of citizenship.\n\nThe executive order also requires mail-in ballots to be received on or before election day for them to count. \n\nThe Democratic National Committee, League of United Latin American Citizens and League of Women Voters Education Fund filed the federal lawsuit against the president and the Republican National Committee to stop enforcement of the executive order. \n\n\"While the

said Marcia Johnson, who is chief counsel for the League of Women Voters, in a prepared statement.\n\nAlthough Kollar-Kotelly blocked the enforcement of Trump's executive order, other parts of the lawsuit are yet to be decided.","summary":"A federal judge in Washington permanently blocked President Donald Trump's executive order requiring proof of citizenship for those who cast mail-in

NASA just ran its first test flight for it","text":"NASA’s supersonic jet X-59 soared through California’s skies this week, in its first successful test flight, potentially marking another step toward faster commercial air travel.\n\nNASA, alongside defense and aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin, led X-59’s first test flight. X-59 took off from Lockheed Martin Skunk Works’ facility in Palmdale, California, before safely landing about 30 miles away near NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, according to a statement from Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe “quiet supersonic aircraft” performed “exactly as planned,” according to the statement.\n\nOnly one crew member was on board for this week’s test flight, Reuters reports. But X-59 could pave the way for “a new generation of supersonic aircraft that can efficiently and sustainably transport passengers and cargo twice as fast as aircraft today,” the company said.\n\nRestrictions due to noise concerns are a big barrier to supersonic commercial travel, according to Lockheed Martin. But X-59 could overcome this, with its ability to fly at supersonic speeds while reducing the “sonic boom to a gentle thump,” the company said.\n\nThese tests are set to continue in the coming months, and will include X-59’s first supersonic flights, during which the jet will “achieve the optimal speed and altitude for a quiet boom,” the statement said.\n\nTransportation Secretary and acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called the jet a “symbol of American ingenuity.”\n\n“The American spirit knows no bounds,” Duffy said in a statement. “It's part of our DNA – the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before. This work sustains America's place as the leader in aviation and has the potential to change the way the public flies.”\n\nThis week’s test flight comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June, which requires the Federal Aviation Administration to end the long-standing ban on supersonic flights over the U.S. Officials initially banned supersonic flight over concerns about the disruptive noise.\n\nX-59 will be used to collect “community response data” on the acceptability of the aircraft’s sonic boom, according to Lockheed Martin’s website. This data will then “help NASA provide regulators with the information needed to establish an acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard to lift the ban on commercial supersonic travel over land,” the website says.\n\nJets have been able to fly at supersonic speeds since the 1940s.

NASA just ran its first test flight for it","text":"NASA’s supersonic jet X-59 soared through California’s skies this week, in its first successful test flight, potentially marking another step toward faster commercial air travel.\n\nNASA, alongside defense and aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin, led X-59’s first test flight. X-59 took off from Lockheed Martin Skunk Works’ facility in Palmdale, California, before safely landing about 30 miles away near NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, according to a statement from Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe “quiet supersonic aircraft” performed “exactly as planned,” according to the statement.\n\nOnly one crew member was on board for this week’s test flight, Reuters reports. But X-59 could pave the way for “a new generation of supersonic aircraft that can efficiently and sustainably transport passengers and cargo twice as fast as aircraft today,” the company said.\n\nRestrictions due to noise concerns are a big barrier to supersonic commercial travel, according to Lockheed Martin. But X-59 could overcome this, with its ability to fly at supersonic speeds while reducing the “sonic boom to a gentle thump,” the company said. \n\nThese tests are set to continue in the coming months, and will include X-59’s first supersonic flights, during which the jet will “achieve the optimal speed and altitude for a quiet boom,” the statement said. \n\nTransportation Secretary and acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called the jet a “symbol of American ingenuity.”\n\n“The American spirit knows no bounds,” Duffy said in a statement. “It's part of our DNA – the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before. This work sustains America's place as the leader in aviation and has the potential to change the way the public flies.”\n\nThis week’s test flight comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in June, which requires the Federal Aviation Administration to end the long-standing ban on supersonic flights over the U.S. Officials initially banned supersonic flight over concerns about the disruptive noise.\n\nX-59 will be used to collect “community response data” on the acceptability of the aircraft’s sonic boom, according to Lockheed Martin’s website. This data will then “help NASA provide regulators with the information needed to establish an acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard to lift the ban on commercial supersonic travel over land,” the website says. \n\nJets have been able to fly at supersonic speeds since the 1940s.
