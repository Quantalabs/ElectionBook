That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,\" a three-judge panel said in the decision.\n\nThe Trump administration minutes later filed a notice of appeal and questioned the authority of the court. The decisions of the Manhattan-based Court of International Trade, which hears disputes involving international trade and customs laws, can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump has made charging U.S. importers tariffs on goods from foreign countries the central policy of his ongoing trade wars, which have severely disrupted global trade flows and roiled financial markets.\n\nCompanies of all sizes have been whipsawed by Trump's swift imposition of tariffs and sudden reversals as they seek to manage supply chains, production, staffing and prices.\n\nA White House spokesperson on Wednesday said U.S. trade deficits with other countries constituted \"a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base – facts that the court did not dispute.\"\n\n\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" Kush Desai, the spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nFinancial markets cheered the ruling. The U.S. dollar rallied following the court's order, surging against currencies such as the euro, yen and the Swiss franc in particular. Wall Street futures rose and equities across Asia also rose.\n\nThe ruling, if it stands, blows a giant hole through Trump's strategy to use steep tariffs to wring concessions from trading partners, draw manufacturing jobs back to U.S. shores and shrink a $1.2 trillion U.S. goods trade deficit, which were among his key campaign promises.\n\nWithout the instant leverage provided by the tariffs of 10% to 54% that Trump declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) -- which is meant to address \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats during a national emergency -- the Trump administration would have to take a slower approach of lengthier trade investigations under other trade laws to back its tariff threats.\n\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits, one filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small U.S. businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties and the other by 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe companies, which range from a New York wine and spirits importer to a Virginia-based maker of educational kits and musical instruments, have said the tariffs will hurt their ability to do business.\n\n\"There is no question here of narrowly tailored relief; if the challenged Tariff Orders are unlawful as to Plaintiffs they are unlawful as to all,\" the trade court wrote in its decision.\n\nAt least five other legal challenges to the tariffs are pending.\n\nOregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat whose office is leading the states' lawsuit, called Trump's tariffs unlawful, reckless and economically devastating.\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,\" Rayfield said in a statement.\n\nTrump has claimed broad authority to set tariffs under IEEPA. The law has historically been used to impose sanctions on enemies of the U.S. or freeze their assets. Trump is the first U.S. president to use it to impose tariffs.\n\nThe Justice Department has said the lawsuits should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have not been harmed by tariffs that they have not yet paid, and because only Congress, not private businesses, can challenge a national emergency declared by the president under IEEPA.\n\nIn imposing the tariffs in early April, Trump called the trade deficit a national emergency that justified his 10% across-the-board tariff on all imports, with higher rates for countries with which the United States has the largest trade deficits, particularly China.\n\nMany of those country-specific tariffs were paused a week later. The Trump administration on May 12 said it was also temporarily reducing the steepest tariffs on China while working on a longer-term trade deal. Both countries agreed to cut tariffs on each other for at least 90 days.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"A U.S. trade court on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's tariffs from going into effect in a sweeping ruling that the president overstepped his authority by imposing across-the-board…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/us-court-blocks-trump%27s-tariffs-says-president-exceeded-his-authority","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/d9/8b/9ca4a062b181c98e01e9a528d5104f31fa14/tag:reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 01:12:23","author":"Dietrich Knauth,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Dietrich Knauth","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":325943648,"title":"Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration after criticizing president's 'big beautiful bill'","text":"Elon Musk is leaving his government role as a top adviser to President Donald Trump after spearheading efforts to reduce and overhaul the federal bureaucracy.The billionaire entrepreneur posted Wednesday about his decision on X, his social media website.“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”A White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed that Musk was leaving.Musk's departure comes one day after he criticized the centerpiece of Trump’s legislative agenda, saying he was “disappointed” by what the president calls his “big beautiful bill.”The legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”His CBS interview came out Tuesday night.

Ron Johnson.Speaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was “pretty confident” there was enough opposition “to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious” about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.Speaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.On Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE’s findings.”The White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE’s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.Musk’s criticism come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because “I think I’ve done enough.”At times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”Musk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.“The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,” Musk said in February. “Frankly, I love him.”Trump repaid the favor, describing Musk as “a truly great American.” When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.It's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate.

Or it won’t pass.”Only two Republicans — Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.Davidson took note of Musk’s comments on social media.“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,” he wrote. “Don’t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.”The Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.House Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MIKLOS BOLZA FOR AAP \n Published:01:18 BST, 29 May 2025 |Updated:02:02 BST, 29 May 2025 \n\nA chicken shop owner has denied threatening to kill a federal election candidate, as questions are raised about why the man is allowed to stay in Australia.\nOver a decade ago, Musher Saleh had his permanent residency revoked after immigration officials uncovered false marriage claims.\nThe 43-year-old is now accused of sending death threats to Australian Migrants candidate Jamal Daoud at his Liverpool office in Sydney's southwest on May 1 and 2.\nThe Merrylands man appeared before Parramatta Local Court on Wednesday where he pleaded not guilty to one count of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend.\n'I didn't,' he told reporters outside court when asked whether he had made death threats.\n'I never do that.'\nMr Daoud told AAP that his office had been called repeatedly by someone speaking in Arabic in the final days of the election.\nThe migration agent claimed Saleh told him something like 'I know where you are, I will come and get you and I will show you what I can do to you'.\n'In Arabic, 'I will get you' in this way - it is a death threat,' Mr Daoud told AAP.\n\nMusher Saleh has denied making death threats to a federal election candidate\nHe said he would send a letter to Immigration Minister Tony Burke demanding answers as to why Saleh has been allowed to stay in Australia despite his past.\nEntering Australia on a business visa in 2001, Saleh was granted permanent residency in May 2013, according to a 2018 decision from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\nThe Palestinian man had his permanent residency revoked in August 2017 after immigration officials learned he had supplied false details about his claimed ongoing marriage to an Australian citizen.\nTwo months later, he purchased a fried chicken shop in Auburn in Sydney's west and was promoting it on social media until 2024.\nSaleh failed to notify immigration that his marriage had broken down before being granted residency and that he had formed a new relationship with a Norwegian national instead, the tribunal found.\nIn upholding the decision to revoke his permanent residency, the tribunal found Saleh had 'consistently been untruthful' and made 'deliberate falsehoods' to gain Australian citizenship.\n'The applicant's interactions with the department have been dictated by what he desired to gain and not by what his obligations required him to do,' tribunal senior member Kira Raif wrote.\n'The applicant appears to have very little remorse about his actions.'\nMs Raif agreed that the Merrylands man would experience hardship if his visa was revoked and he returned to Gaza, but noted that he could apply to live in Norway as his partner had citizenship there.\nOn Wednesday, Mr Burke did not respond to AAP's questions about why Saleh still resided in Australia.\nMr Daoud ran as an independent in the Sydney seat of Werriwa at the 2025 federal election after standing for Clive Palmer's United Australia Party at the 2022 election.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nChicken shop owner denies threatening to kill politician -

President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desaii said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nThe judges' decision was based on two cases brought by a group of small businesses and 12 Democratic state attorneys general.\n\nThe judges were appointed by three presidents: Gary Katzmann by Barack Obama, Timothy Reif by Donald Trump and Jane Restani by Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"The President's assertion of tariff-making authority in the instant case, unbounded as it is by any limitation in duration or scope, exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA,\" the judge wrote. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory tariffs are thus ultra vires and contrary to law.\"\n\nAlso, separate tariffs against China, Canada and Mexico tariffs \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found. These went into affect on March 4.\n\nTrump imposed a 25% tariff against Canadian and Mexican goods except for items compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada, and 10% for energy and potash from the U.S. northern neighbor. China was hit with a 30% tariff/\n\nThe 10% duties went into effect on April 5.\n\nThe president has the right to impose tariffs, based in 1970s on a court decision involving the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, which preceded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nThe judges said the president's tariffs do not meet the limited condition of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" that would allow him to act alone with approval by Congress.\n\n\"Because of the Constitution's express allocation of the tariff power to Congress, we do not read IEEPA to delegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President,\" they wrote. \"We instead read IEEPA's provisions to impose meaningful limits on any such authority it confers,\" the ruling said.\"\n\nEarlier this month, T. Kent Wetherell II, a district judge in Florida nominated by Trump, said the president has the authority on his own to impose tariffs, but opted to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed since Trump announced the tariffs on April 2 as \"Declaration Day.\"\n\nTrump also announced on April 2 plans for harsher tariffs against the worst offenders but one week later he paused them for 90 days until July. They include ones against America's greatest allies: 26% against India, 25% against South Korea, 24% against Japan and 20% against the 27 members of the European Union.\n\nTrump also had announced a 125% tariff on top of 30% against China but he suspended that. He also excluded tariffs on electronic products in China but last week threatened a 25% one on Apple products not made in the United States.\n\nLast week Trump suggested 50% tariffs on the EU by June but paused them until July 9 on Sunday.\n\nThe tariffs have rattled U.S. stocks.","summary":"A three-judge panel on Wednesday struck down President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs, including 10% imposed on most U.S. trading partners, calling them \"contrary to law.\"","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/28/NY-judges-block-Trumps-unilateral-deficits/5571748477467/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5571748477467/2025/upi/d873ea28bdd6e0ff1045e4d3da585137/v1.2/Judges-block-Trumps-unilateral-tariffs-on-most-trading-partners.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 01:02:28","author":"Allen Cone","authors":["Allen Cone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":325940312,"title":"Rubio says U.S. to &quot;aggressively&quot; revoke visas of Chinese students","text":"The United States will \"aggressively\" revoke visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in sensitive fields, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Rubio also said, \"We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"\n\nIt is widely known that many children of high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party have studied at prominent U.S. universities.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that the Kremlin is prepared to engage in further negotiations with Kyiv in Istanbul on 2 June.The Russian top diplomat also stated that Moscow has come up with a list of issues it deems integral to the war. Lavrov says that Russia has come up with ways to overcome what he called “root causes of the crisis” in a corresponding memorandum.“The Russian side, as agreed, promptly developed a corresponding memorandum, which sets out our position on all aspects of reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis (with Ukraine),” said Lavrov.“Our delegation, headed by (Russian presidential aide) Vladimir Medinsky, is ready to present this memorandum to the Ukrainian delegation and provide the necessary explanations during the second round of resumed direct negotiations in Istanbul next Monday, June 2,” he added.The announcement comes after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan held meetings with Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin on a two-day visit to Moscow, to explore ways his country can further advance the peace process.Lavrov expressed his gratitude to Fidan and Turkey, thanking them for providing a platform for the negotiations.“I would like to once again express my gratitude to our Turkish partners for providing a hospitable Turkish platform.”Lavrov also took the opportunity to snap back at the countries who’ve been accusing Russia of not being serious about peace.“We hope that all those who are sincerely, and not just in words, interested in the success of the peace process will support holding a new round of direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul,” he added.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump is sending mixed signals on the ongoing peace efforts.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russian President Vladmir Putin's decision to escalate attacks on Ukraine as the two sides are negotiating an end to the war.\"I can say this that I'm very disappointed at what happened a couple of nights now where people were killed in the middle of what you would call a negotiation. I'm disappointed by that, very, very disappointed,\" Trump said.He however noted that he’s holding off on new sanctions on Russia because he doesn’t want to interfere with his attempts to negotiate peace.“If I think I’m close to getting a deal, I don’t want to screw it up by doing that,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “Let me tell you, I'm a lot tougher than the people you're talking about. But you have to know when to use that. If I think it's going to hurt a deal.”The US president also added that in around two weeks, it’ll become clear to him whether or not Russia is “tapping” him along. Trump warned that if he believes Russia are not sincere in their desire to end the war, a shift in Washinton’s approach to Moscow is imminent.","summary":"US President Donald Trump says it will be

his \"scheduled time\" has come \"to an end.\"Why It MattersSince his January inauguration, Trump has enacted sweeping cuts across the federal bureaucracy, mainly through executive orders and creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).The task force has been spearheaded by Musk, during which time the Tesla and SpaceX CEO pushed for DOGE to gain access to the most sensitive and confidential information about American taxpayers, leading to a slew of lawsuits that accused Musk and the Trump administration of violating the law.Musk has also faced fierce backlash amid his drastic cuts to the budget, including thousands of federal jobs, and the dismantling of entire agencies.Amid the uproar, Tesla cars and property have been targeted and torched across the United States as protesters demonstrated against Musk's appointment as an unelected official.Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the attacks are \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\"What To KnowIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Musk praised the president saying, \"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.\"Musk continued, \"The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"The billionaire CEO had previously announced that he was preparing to step down from his role in government by the end of May, noting to Fox News' Bret Baier that his goal was to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget during his stint as a government employee.This is a developing story that will be updated with additional information.","summary":"Musk spearheaded DOGE for Trump and faced fierce backlash over his

the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer — but it casts a sharp blow on Mr Trump's policy.\n\nAt least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centrepiece of Mr Trump's trade policy.\n\nTariffs must typically be approved by Congress, but Mr Trump says he has the power to act because the country's trade deficits amount to a national emergency.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorise the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\".\n\nThe US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.\n\nMr Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits.\n\nHe earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and synthetic opioids across the US border.\n\nHis administration argues that courts approved then-president Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \"political\" question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.\n\nMr Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for US economic growth.\n\nSo far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.\n\nA dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon.\n\n\"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,\" Attorney-General Dan Rayfield said.","summary":"A US trade court has blocked the president from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-29/donald-trump-trade-tariffs-block-us-court/105351386","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/13df700abe80808cb06a46b166360911?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=260&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:49:02","author":"ABC News","authors":["ABC News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":325943596,"title":"World News | US to Revoke Visas of Chinese Students: Marco Rubio","text":"Washington DC [US], May 29 (ANI): US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said that the US will begin revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\nIn a social media post on X, Rubio wrote, \"The U.S. will begin revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\" Also Read | UK: Moulton Man Sentenced to 26 Months in Prison, Placed on Sex Offenders’ Register After Indecent Photos of Children and Animals Found on His Phone.\nhttps://x.com/SecRubio/status/1927859105282015532\nThis development comes as an another step in Donald Trump administration push to tighten control over foreign enrolments in higher education.

We don't want to see the kind of riots that you had,\" he added.\nStating that Harvard University admits almost 31 percent of foreign students which some are from \"areas of the world that are very radicalised\", Trump said, \"Why would 31 percent?

Officials with the Illinois Department of Corrections have previously said they would push for Hoover to finish his state sentence in federal prison due to security concerns.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Hoover was listed in online state prison records as an inmate at Dixon Correctional Center in western Illinois, though it was unclear if he’d already made it there. The records show a parole date of October 2062.\n\nIn a statement to the Tribune, Hoover’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, called Trump’s decision “a historic development” after years of fighting in federal court.\n\n“The courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover’s rehabilitation,” Bonjean wrote. “Sometimes the courts do not do the right thing. But thanks to the work of so many advocates and supporters keeping Mr. Hoover’s voice alive and ultimately the president taking action to deliver justice, we are thrilled to see Mr. Hoover released. Now it’s time for the IDOC to do the right thing.”\n\nAn IDOC spokesperson could not immediately be reached.\n\nOnce one of the nation’s largest street gangs, the Gangster Disciples became a major criminal force under Hoover’s leadership, with operations that spread to dozens of U.S. cities and were as sophisticated as many legitimate corporations, including a strict code of conduct for members and a franchise-style system for drug sales.\n\n“They had armies of lawyers and accountants. They had their own clothing line, music promotion company, political action committee. They had a structure that helped them insulate the leaders from the drugs and the guns,” Ron Safer, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Hoover in the 1990s, told the Tribune in 2012.\n\nFor years, Hoover has been housed in solitary confinement at the supermax prison in Colorado, which counts a number of high-profile and notorious detainees, including Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, Sept. 11 terrorist attack plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, and Jeff Fort, the Chicago gang leader who founded the El Rukns.\n\nThe Illinois Prisoner Review Board last year heard arguments for Hoover’s release, but ultimately denied the request, records show. The review board won’t hear his case for another four years, records show.\n\nAddressing board members last year, Hoover said he is a 73-year-old man who views the world much differently than when he went into prison, records show. A summary of his statements to the board said, “He regrets the wrong choices that he has made and the harm he has caused.”\n\n“He argues that he is not a threat to the community, and that he will not do what he once did,” the summary of Hoover’s statement continued. “He would not make the same mistakes, and he admits today that he did make those choices in the past.”\n\nTrump’s order was first reported by the news site NOTUS.\n\nReached by phone Wednesday afternoon, Hoover’s sister, Diane Cooper, said, “I’m just happy. (Trump) did a very good thing.”\n\n“They can say what they want,” Cooper, 70, said. “I’m behind him 100%. He needs to be home. Right is right and wrong is wrong.”\n\nCooper said she didn’t know “anything” about a state sentence that might keep her brother behind bars. Representatives of Gov. JB Pritzker’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoover’s son, Larry Hoover Jr., posted a photo to his Instagram account Wednesday afternoon of someone holding up Trump’s signed order with the words “Almost home!!” and two praying-hands emojis.\n\nFederal prosecutors have vehemently opposed any breaks for Hoover, now 74, arguing he did untold damage to communities across Chicago during his reign on the streets. They argued he has continued to hold sway over the gang’s hierarchy while imprisoned, even promoting an underling he’d secretly communicated with through coded messages hidden in a dictionary.\n\nHoover’s attorneys, meanwhile, have claimed that decades behind bars have left him a changed man and that prosecutors have unfairly painted him as a puppet master to try to keep him locked up.\n\nAt a hearing last year, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey asked Hoover’s defense attorney point-blank: “How many other murders is he responsible for?”\n\n“I don’t know what the methodology is for determining that,” attorney Bonjean replied, somewhat taken aback by the unusually blunt query.\n\n“So many we can’t count?” Blakey shot back.\n\nAfter Bonjean said she couldn’t “put a number on it,” Blakey went a step further and asked if Hoover himself would like to weigh in.\n\n“He probably has the most knowledge of all,” the judge said.\n\nAt that hearing, which Hoover attended via a live link from prison, he told the judge he’s “had a chance to reflect on my life and the trouble that my existence has caused in the community.”\n\n“Here in (the supermax) you’re locked up at least 21 hours a day. You go away in your cell and reflect on every aspect of your life, and you see things differently,” Hoover said. “You see things you’re proud of and you see things that maybe you’re not so proud of, and you realize that life is too short.”\n\nIf he were released, Hoover said, he would counsel others how to avoid gangs, not join them.\n\n“I just want to say that I would be a credible risk if you were to allow me to go back to the world,” Hoover said.\n\nBlakey had not yet ruled on Hoover’s motion.\n\nHoover was convicted in state court in 1973 of the murder of William Young, one of Hoover’s gang underlings who was shot to death that same year after he and others had stolen from gang stash houses. He was sentenced to 200 years in prison.\n\nIn the early 1990s, before Hoover was charged in federal court, former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer lobbied the IDOC parole board on his behalf, arguing that Hoover could help stem Chicago’s street violence if he were allowed to return home, the Tribune reported at the time.\n\nHoover was indicted in federal court in 1995 on charges he continued to oversee the murderous drug gang’s reign of terror from prison. He was convicted on 40 criminal counts in 1997, and then-U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced him to the mandatory term of life.\n\n“I don’t always agree with the guidelines,” Leinenweber told Hoover during that hearing. “Sometimes I think they are too draconian. But in this case, I agree with them 100%.”\n\nBefore last year’s hearing, prosecutors alleged that during a prison visit with his common-law wife in August, Hoover asked her if his lawyers wanted him to bring a copy of the “Blueprint” to Thursday’s hearing, which the U.S. Bureau of Prisons considers “a blueprint for how to organize a prison gang,” including governing principles, methods of discipline and a membership application.\n\nThe motion also revealed that an email message was sent Aug. 26 by a known Gangster Disciples member to 123 fellow gang members in federal prison referring to Hoover as “Dad” and using “coded terminology, in the form of a basketball analogy, to instruct all incarcerated GDs to stay out of trouble and temporarily suspend gang activity” until Hoover gets a ruling in his case.\n\n“IN SUPPORT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, THERE WILL BE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY INCIDENTS ON THE COURT,” the all-caps message read, according to the prosecution filing.\n\n“This communication is deeply concerning,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz wrote at the time. “It demonstrates the continued power high-ranking GD leaders, and specifically Larry Hoover, hold over the GDs (and) underscores the extremely high risk of recidivism and the danger to the community if Hoover is released.”\n\nSchwartz also said that Hoover’s life sentence was appropriate, given his place as one of the most dangerous criminals ever prosecuted in Chicago’s federal court.\n\nBut Hoover’s lawyers argued it’s the government that has proselytized the myth of Hoover as some arch-criminal who can still command the masses — because it suits their endgame of keeping him locked up.\n\n“It is not in dispute that many people from all walks of life, including politicians, celebrities, community activists and people who self-identify as GDs, support Hoover,” Bonjean wrote in a 2022 court filing. “Indeed, the fact that Mr. Hoover is supported by individuals who are not gang members is what frightens the government the most. The government does not want to see a rehabilitated Hoover. It wants to hold on to its narrative of Hoover as the most notorious dangerous, and violent man on the planet.”\n\nBonjean argued in the September hearing that Hoover should be looked at as a human being, not a monster. He entered prison illiterate and has since earned his GED and taken classes on robotics, art history and the life of Abraham Lincoln, she said. A voracious reader, Hoover “would have a PhD by now if that type of programming was available to him,” according to Bonjean.\n\nShe also said it’s “rubbish” to think Hoover is still commanding gang members, some of whom weren’t even born when he entered prison. “If Mr. Hoover is held responsible for every criminal act by those who self-identify as a GD, well then I guess he’s toast,” she said.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com\n\nckubzansky@chicagotribune.com\n\nscharles@chicagotribune.com","summary":"President Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/05/28/trump-commutes-federal-sentence-larry-hoover/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-l-larry-hoover-e1748465244582.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:48:15","author":"Caroline Kubzansky,Jason Meisner,Sam Charles","authors":["Caroline Kubzansky","Jason Meisner","Sam Charles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.068},{"id":325941554,"title":"Trump commutes federal life sentence of founding Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover","text":"President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, abruptly ending Hoover’s yearslong quest to win early release under the First Step Act passed during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe two-page order said Hoover’s sentence was considered served “with no further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions,” and directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him “immediately,” according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover’s legal team.\n\nThe controversial move — part of a slew of clemency actions announced by the White House this week — appeared to have already sparked Hoover’s transfer out of the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he’d called home for the past two decades.\n\nBut Hoover isn’t going free — he’s still serving a 200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder.

They argued he has continued to hold sway over the gang’s hierarchy while imprisoned, even promoting an underling he’d secretly communicated with through coded messages hidden in a dictionary.\n\nHoover’s attorneys, meanwhile, have claimed that decades behind bars have left him a changed man and that prosecutors have unfairly painted him as a puppet master to try to keep him locked up.\n\nAt a hearing last year, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey asked Hoover’s defense attorney point-blank: “How many other murders is he responsible for?”\n\n“I don’t know what the methodology is for determining that,” attorney Bonjean replied, somewhat taken aback by the unusually blunt query.\n\n“So many we can’t count?” Blakey shot back.\n\nAfter Bonjean said she couldn’t “put a number on it,” Blakey went a step further and asked if Hoover himself would like to weigh in.\n\n“He probably has the most knowledge of all,” the judge said.\n\nAt that hearing, which Hoover attended via a live link from prison, he told the judge he’s “had a chance to reflect on my life and the trouble that my existence has caused in the community.”\n\n“Here in (the supermax) you’re locked up at least 21 hours a day. You go away in your cell and reflect on every aspect of your life, and you see things differently,” Hoover said. “You see things you’re proud of and you see things that maybe you’re not so proud of, and you realize that life is too short.”\n\nIf he were released, Hoover said, he would counsel others how to avoid gangs, not join them.\n\n“I just want to say that I would be a credible risk if you were to allow me to go back to the world,” Hoover said.\n\nBlakey had not yet ruled on Hoover’s motion.\n\nHoover was convicted in state court in 1973 of the murder of William Young, one of Hoover’s gang underlings who was shot to death that same year after he and others had stolen from gang stash houses. He was sentenced to 200 years in prison.\n\nIn the early 1990s, before Hoover was charged in federal court, former Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer lobbied the IDOC parole board on his behalf, arguing that Hoover could help stem Chicago’s street violence if he were allowed to return home, the Tribune reported at the time.\n\nHoover was indicted in federal court in 1995 on charges he continued to oversee the murderous drug gang’s reign of terror from prison. He was convicted on 40 criminal counts in 1997, and then-U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber sentenced him to the mandatory term of life.\n\n“I don’t always agree with the guidelines,” Leinenweber told Hoover during that hearing. “Sometimes I think they are too draconian. But in this case, I agree with them 100%.”\n\nBefore last year’s hearing, prosecutors alleged that during a prison visit with his common-law wife in August, Hoover asked her if his lawyers wanted him to bring a copy of the “Blueprint” to Thursday’s hearing, which the U.S. Bureau of Prisons considers “a blueprint for how to organize a prison gang,” including governing principles, methods of discipline and a membership application.\n\nThe motion also revealed that an email message was sent Aug. 26 by a known Gangster Disciples member to 123 fellow gang members in federal prison referring to Hoover as “Dad” and using “coded terminology, in the form of a basketball analogy, to instruct all incarcerated GDs to stay out of trouble and temporarily suspend gang activity” until Hoover gets a ruling in his case.\n\n“IN SUPPORT OF THESE CHALLENGING TIMES, THERE WILL BE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ANY INCIDENTS ON THE COURT,” the all-caps message read, according to the prosecution filing.\n\n“This communication is deeply concerning,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz wrote at the time. “It demonstrates the continued power high-ranking GD leaders, and specifically Larry Hoover, hold over the GDs (and) underscores the extremely high risk of recidivism and the danger to the community if Hoover is released.”\n\nSchwartz also said that Hoover’s life sentence was appropriate, given his place as one of the most dangerous criminals ever prosecuted in Chicago’s federal court.\n\nBut Hoover’s lawyers argued it’s the government that has proselytized the myth of Hoover as some arch-criminal who can still command the masses — because it suits their endgame of keeping him locked up.\n\n“It is not in dispute that many people from all walks of life, including politicians, celebrities, community activists and people who self-identify as GDs, support Hoover,” Bonjean wrote in a 2022 court filing. “Indeed, the fact that Mr. Hoover is supported by individuals who are not gang members is what frightens the government the most. The government does not want to see a rehabilitated Hoover. It wants to hold on to its narrative of Hoover as the most notorious dangerous, and violent man on the planet.”\n\nBonjean argued in the September hearing that Hoover should be looked at as a human being, not a monster. He entered prison illiterate and has since earned his GED and taken classes on robotics, art history and the life of Abraham Lincoln, she said. A voracious reader, Hoover “would have a PhD by now if that type of programming was available to him,” according to Bonjean.\n\nShe also said it’s “rubbish” to think Hoover is still commanding gang members, some of whom weren’t even born when he entered prison. “If Mr. Hoover is held responsible for every criminal act by those who self-identify as a GD, well then I guess he’s toast,” she said.\n\njmeisner@chicagotribune.com\n\nckubzansky@chicagotribune.com\n\nscharles@chicagotribune.com","summary":"President Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/28/trump-commutes-federal-sentence-larry-hoover/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ctc-l-larry-hoover-e1748465244582.jpg?w=1024&h=577","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:48:15","author":"Caroline Kubzansky,Jason Meisner,Sam Charles","authors":["Caroline Kubzansky","Jason Meisner","Sam Charles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.068},{"id":325941496,"title":"Trump commutes federal life sentence of founding Gangster Disciples kingpin Larry Hoover","text":"President Donald Trump has commuted the federal life sentence for infamous Chicago-born Gangster Disciples founder Larry Hoover, abruptly ending Hoover’s yearslong quest to win early release under the First Step Act passed during Trump’s first term.\n\nThe two-page order said Hoover’s sentence was considered served “with no further fines, restitution, probation or other conditions,” and directed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to release him “immediately,” according to a copy of the document provided by Hoover’s legal team.\n\nThe controversial move — part of a slew of clemency actions announced by the White House this week — appeared to have already sparked Hoover’s transfer out of the supermax prison compound in Florence, Colorado, that he’d called home for the past two decades.\n\nBut Hoover isn’t going free — he’s still serving a 200-year sentence for his state court conviction for murder. Officials with the Illinois Department of Corrections have previously said they would push for Hoover to finish his state sentence in federal prison due to security concerns.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Hoover was listed in online state prison records as an inmate at Dixon Correctional Center in western Illinois, though it was unclear if he’d already made it there. The records show a parole date of October 2062.\n\nIn a statement to the Tribune, Hoover’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, called Trump’s decision “a historic development” after years of fighting in federal court.\n\n“The courts have demonstrated a complete unwillingness to consider Mr. Hoover’s rehabilitation,” Bonjean wrote. “Sometimes the courts do not do the right thing. But thanks to the work of so many advocates and supporters keeping Mr. Hoover’s voice alive and ultimately the president taking action to deliver justice, we are thrilled to see Mr. Hoover released. Now it’s time for the IDOC to do the right thing.”\n\nAn IDOC spokesperson could not immediately be reached.\n\nOnce one of the nation’s largest street gangs, the Gangster Disciples became a major criminal force under Hoover’s leadership, with operations that spread to dozens of U.S. cities and were as sophisticated as many legitimate corporations, including a strict code of conduct for members and a franchise-style system for drug sales.\n\n“They had armies of lawyers and accountants. They had their own clothing line, music promotion company, political action committee. They had a structure that helped them insulate the leaders from the drugs and the guns,” Ron Safer, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Hoover in the 1990s, told the Tribune in 2012.\n\nFor years, Hoover has been housed in solitary confinement at the supermax prison in Colorado, which counts a number of high-profile and notorious detainees, including Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, Sept. 11 terrorist attack plotter Zacarias Moussaoui, and Jeff Fort, the Chicago gang leader who founded the El Rukns.\n\nThe Illinois Prisoner Review Board last year heard arguments for Hoover’s release, but ultimately denied the request, records show. The review board won’t hear his case for another four years, records show.\n\nAddressing board members last year, Hoover said he is a 73-year-old man who views the world much differently than when he went into prison, records show. A summary of his statements to the board said, “He regrets the wrong choices that he has made and the harm he has caused.”\n\n“He argues that he is not a threat to the community, and that he will not do what he once did,” the summary of Hoover’s statement continued. “He would not make the same mistakes, and he admits today that he did make those choices in the past.”\n\nTrump’s order was first reported by the news site NOTUS.\n\nReached by phone Wednesday afternoon, Hoover’s sister, Diane Cooper, said, “I’m just happy. (Trump) did a very good thing.”\n\n“They can say what they want,” Cooper, 70, said. “I’m behind him 100%. He needs to be home. Right is right and wrong is wrong.”\n\nCooper said she didn’t know “anything” about a state sentence that might keep her brother behind bars. Representatives of Gov.

He used the tariffs as a negotiating cudgel in hopes of forcing other nations to negotiate agreements that favored the U.S., suggesting he would simply set the rates himself if the terms were unsatisfactory.White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that trade deficits are a national emergency “that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base — facts that the court did not dispute.”The administration, he said, remains “committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.”But for now, Trump might not have the threat of import taxes to exact his will on the world economy as he had intended, since doing so would require congressional approval. What remains unclear is whether the White House will respond to the ruling by pausing all of its emergency power tariffs in the interim.RELATED STORY | Trump says he'll delay a threatened 50% tariff on the European Union until JulyThe ruling amounted to a categorical rejection of the legal underpinnings of some of Trump’s signature and most controversial actions of his four-month-old second term. The ruling faces certain appeal — and the Supreme Court will almost certainly be called upon to lend a final answer — but it casts a sharp blow.“The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,” the court wrote, referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The case was heard by three judges: Timothy Reif, who was appointed by Trump, Jane Restani, named to the bench by President Ronald Reagan and Gary Katzman, an appointee of President Barack Obama.It was filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that deals specifically with civil lawsuits involving international trade law.While tariffs must typically be approved by Congress, Trump has said he has the power to act to address the trade deficits he calls a national emergency.He is facing at least seven lawsuits challenging the levies. The plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorize the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit is not an emergency because the U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America’s massive and long-standing trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.His administration argues that courts approved then-President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the “political” question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world’s largest economy.The lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, V.O.S. Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive.A dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon. “This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim,” Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the tariffs had \"jacked up prices on groceries and cars, threatened shortages of essential goods and wrecked supply chains for American businesses large and small.\"","summary":"A federal court on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law, throwing into doubt Trump’s signature set of economic policies.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/economy/federal-court-blocks-trump-from-imposing-sweeping-tariffs-under-emergency-powers-law","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55a775e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4290x2252+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fdc%2F15fa68cc4f09942bc2202bb8cb8c%2Ftrumptariff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:48:06","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.031},{"id":325941604,"title":"US trade court blocks Donald Trump from imposing sweeping global tariffs -

While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n\n“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”\n\nHis CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n“I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,” he said.\n\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n\n“We’re going to see what happens,” he said. “It’s got a way to go.”\n\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.\n\nMusk’s concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. “I sympathize with Elon being discouraged,” said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was “pretty confident” there was enough opposition “to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious” about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE’s findings.”\n\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE’s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\n\nMusk’s criticism come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He’s also said he’ll reduce his political spending, because “I think I’ve done enough.”\n\nAt times, he’s seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he’s fallen far short of that target.\n\n“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”\n\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n\n“The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,” Musk said in February. “Frankly, I love him.”\n\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as “a truly great American.” When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.\n\nIt’s unclear what, if any, impact that Musk’s comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\n\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk’s interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was “still time to fix it.”\n\n“The Senate version will be more aggressive,” Lee said. “It can, it must, and it will be.

University, threatening to revoke its non-profit status for failing to protect Jewish students and halting its intake of international students.\n\n\"When we looked at different aspects of what

Administration After Criticising President's 'big Beautiful Bill'","text":"Washington, May 29 (AP) Elon Musk is leaving his government role as a top advisor to US President Donald Trump after spearheading efforts to reduce and overhaul the federal bureaucracy. The billionaire entrepreneur posted Wednesday about his decision on X, his social media website. Also Read | UK: Moulton Man Sentenced to 26 Months in Prison, Placed on Sex Offenders’ Register After Indecent Photos of Children and Animals Found on His Phone. “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.” Also Read | Pakistan: Married Hindu Woman Kidnapped, Forcibly Converted and Married off to Muslim Man in Pak Town, Claims Family. A White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed that Musk was leaving. Musk's departure comes one day after he criticised the centrepiece of Trump's legislative agenda, saying he was “disappointed” by what the president calls his “big beautiful bill\". The legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. “I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful. But I don't know if it could be both,” Musk said. His CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation. “I'm not happy about certain aspects of it, but I'm thrilled by other aspects of it,” he said. Trump also suggested that more changes could be made. “We're going to see what happens. It's got a way to go,\" he said. Republicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate. Musk's concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. “I sympathise with Elon being discouraged,” said Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. Speaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was “pretty confident” there was enough opposition “to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious” about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position. Speaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly-divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill. On Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE's findings\". The White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorised spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE's cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include USD 1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and USD 8.3 billion in foreign assistance. Musk's criticism come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He also said he'll reduce his political spending, because “I think I've done enough\". At times, he seemed chastened by his experience of working in the government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate USD 1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target. “The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.” Musk had previously been energised by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump. “The more I've gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy. Frankly, I love him,\" Musk said in February. Trump repaid the favour, describing Musk as “a truly great American\". When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support. It's unclear what, if any, impact Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate.

The decision was handed down on Wednesday by a three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade in Manhattan.The court’s ruling invalidated Trump’s April 2 executive orders, which introduced a 10 percent baseline tariff on most imports and steeper duties on countries with large trade surpluses with the U.S., including China and the European Union. The panel found that Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify the levies violated the U.S. Constitution.“An unlimited delegation of tariff authority would constitute an improper abdication of legislative power to another branch of government,” the judges wrote in an unsigned opinion.Court rebukes overreach of emergency powersThe court emphasised that Congress holds the exclusive right to regulate commerce with foreign nations. The ruling rejected the argument that the president can impose tariffs under IEEPA unless there is a genuine and extraordinary emergency threat to national security.“The court does not pass upon the wisdom or likely effectiveness of the President's use of tariffs as leverage. That use is impermissible not because it is unwise or ineffective, but because [federal law] does not allow it,” the judges stated.They added that Trump’s “Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President . . . to regulate importation by means of tariffs.”Lawsuits from states and small businessesThe decision came in response to two lawsuits — one from the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center representing five small U.S. businesses, and another from a group of 13 U.S. states led by Oregon. The businesses, including a wine importer from New York and an educational kit maker from Virginia, argued that the tariffs threatened their survival.Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, whose office spearheaded the states’ legal challenge, welcomed the court’s decision.“This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can't be made on the president's whim,” Rayfield said.Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer representing the businesses, accused Trump of an “unprecedented and unlawful expansion of executive authority” during the hearing.White House pushes backIn response, the Trump administration filed an immediate notice of appeal. A White House spokesperson dismissed the ruling, arguing that courts should not interfere with executive actions during national emergencies.“It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,” the spokesperson said. “President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness.”Stephen Miller, then White House deputy chief of staff, added on social media, “The judicial coup is out of control.”Shaky legal ground, market shocksTrump had cited the IEEPA to declare the U.S. trade deficit a national emergency. He also pointed to foreign practices such as non-reciprocal trade terms and wage suppression, linking them to national security threats. But the law, traditionally used to impose sanctions on hostile nations, had never been used in this way before.At a hearing in Oregon, Justice Department lawyer Brett Shumate warned that blocking the tariffs “would completely kneecap the president.” But Judge Jane Restani responded, “The court cannot for political reasons allow the president to do something he’s not allowed to do by statute.”Markets had reacted sharply to Trump’s tariff announcements. Financial turmoil followed the initial orders, with partial relief only coming after Trump delayed several of the steepest levies. A 90-day tariff reduction agreement was reached with China, and a delay was granted to the EU following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.“We had a very nice call . . . and I agreed to move [the date],” Trump told reporters at the time.Despite those pauses, the tariffs had a ripple effect on U.S. businesses and trading relationships. Critics say the legal uncertainty surrounding the emergency justification only adds to the economic harm.Constitutional guardrailsThe ruling underscores that the president cannot act alone when it comes to trade. While IEEPA does permit emergency action, the court firmly ruled that this does not amount to an unchecked power to restructure the nation’s trade relationships through tariffs.“Any interpretation of the IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional,” the judges concluded.Though the administration insists the trade deficit represents a national emergency, the court found that the law must still be followed, and that constitutional limits on presidential power remain in force — even during economic crises.(With inputs from agencies)","summary":"A U.S. federal court has blocked Donald Trump’s attempt to impose sweeping tariffs under emergency powers, ruling that the president exceeded his constitutional authority.

Trump commuted her life sentence in 2018 at the urging of celebrity Kim Kardashian West, allowing for Johnson's early release.\n\nJohnson then served as the featured speaker on the final night of the 2020 Republican National Convention, and Trump subsequently pardoned her before more recently naming her as his point person for pardons.\n\nAmong those receiving the latest round of Trump pardons was Louisiana rap artist NBA YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden and whose stage moniker stands for “Never Broke Again.”\n\nIn 2024, he was sentenced to just under two years in prison on gun-related charges after he acknowledged having possessed weapons despite being a convicted felon. Gaulden also pleaded guilty to his role in a prescription drug fraud ring in Utah.\n\nGaulden's and the other pardons were confirmed Wednesday evening by two White House officials who spoke only on background to detail actions that had not yet been formally made public.\n\nIn a statement posted online, Gaulden said, “I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep building — as a man, as a father, and as an artist.”\n\nHe said this “opens the door to a future I’ve worked hard for and I am fully prepared to step into this,” and thanked Johnson.\n\nTrump has spent the week issuing high-profile pardons. Video released by a White House aide showed Johnson in the Oval Office on Tuesday, as Trump called their daughter to say he was pardoning TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley of the reality show “ Chrisley Knows Best.”\n\nTheir show spotlighted the family’s extravagant lifestyle, but the couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than $30 million in loans by submitting false documents Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, addressed the Republican convention last summer and had long said her parents were treated unfairly.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, a former Chicago gang leader serving a life sentence. Hoover was first imprisoned in connection with a murder in 1973, and was convicted of running a criminal enterprise in 1998, but later renounced his criminal past and petitioned for a reduced sentence.\n\nAnd the president pardoned James Callahan, a New York union leader who pleaded guilty to failing to report $315,000 in gifts from an advertising firm and was about to be sentenced.\n\nThe president also pardoned former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, a Republican who served from 1995 to 2004 and was sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for charges related to concealing his involvement in two federal election campaigns.\n\nHe further pardoned Michael Grimm, a New York Republican who resigned from Congress after being convicted of tax fraud. Grimm won reelection in 2014 despite being under indictment for underreporting wages and revenue at a restaurant that he ran.\n\nGrimm eventually resigned after pleading guilty and serving eight months in prison. Last year, Grimm was paralyzed from the chest down when he was thrown off a horse during a polo tournament.\n\nYet another Trump pardon was issued for Army Lt. Mark Bradshaw, who was convicted in 2022 of reporting to work without undergoing a COVID-19 test.","summary":"President Donald Trump issued a series of pardons on Wednesday, awarding them to a former New York congressman, a Connecticut governor, a rapper known as 'NBA YoungBoy,' a labor union leader and a onetime Army officer who flaunted safety measures during the Coronavirus pandemic.

It also provided an upbeat view of its current second quarter despite restrictions on what it can sell to China. Revenue in its fiscal 2026 first quarter increased 69% year over year to $44.06 billion, beating the $43.31 billion the Street was looking for, according to estimates compiled by data provider LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share increased 57% year over year to 96 cents in the three-month period ended April 27, exceeding the consensus of 93 cents, LSEG data showed. Both EPS and the quarterly estimate excluded charges related to the H20 chip ban in China. Why we own it Nvidia's high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs) are the key driver behind the AI revolution, powering the accelerated data centers being rapidly built around the world. But Nvidia is more than just a hardware story. Through its Nvidia AI Enterprise service, Nvidia is building out its software business. Competitors : Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Most recent buy : Aug 31, 2022 Initiation : March 2019 Bottom line Nvidia's results are proof that there has been no slowdown in the buildout of AI. During the post-earnings conference call, CEO Jensen Huang pointed out four positive surprises since the company's annual GTC event in March that have driven a surge in demand. The first surprise was advancements in reasoning AI, which is included in popular large language models like ChatGPT. According to Huang, reasoning models are creating a step function surge in inference demand, which in turn increases the demand for chips because they are extremely compute-intensive. Another positive surprise was the rescinding of the so-called AI diffusion rules, which ended right at the same time that countries woke up to the importance of AI as an infrastructure, according to Huang. A third positive surprise was the development of enterprise AI agents, which he called \"game-changing.\" The fourth and last surprise is related to industrial AI, and all the on-shoring manufacturing and the building of plants around the world, creating demand for the Nvidia Omniverse. These are important callouts, as they underscore the rapid pace of advancements in artificial intelligence, which continues to drive strong demand for Nvidia's chips. The growing integration of AI into everyday life further reinforces this trend. This is clear evidence that the AI story is still in its early innings. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD Accordingly, we're raising our price target to $170 from $165. But given Nvidia's rapid 55% stock rise from its 52-week low on April 4 through Wednesday's close of $134, we are keeping our hold-equivalent 2 rating. In after-hours trading, shares added another 5%. Commentary Heading into earnings , some of our key questions centered on the Blackwell ramp, Sovereign AI, hyperscaler demand, and developments in China. 1. Blackwell : After some early supply chain issues, the ramp of the new Blackwell superchip called GB200 has gone well. Despite the vast complexities of building it, Nvidia saw a significant improvement in manufacturing yields and an increase in rack shipments to customers. Blackwell contributed 70% of the $34.16 billion of data center compute revenue in the quarter. Overall, data center revenues, which also included networking sales, increased 73% year over year to $39.1 billion, slightly missing estimates of $39.36 billion, according to FactSet. Nvidia is always innovating its chipsets, making them more powerful and efficient with every new iteration, but also backwards compatible. The next product on its roadmap is the Blackwell Ultra or GB300. The company said samplings of these systems began earlier this month at the major cloud service providers, and it expects production shipments to start later this quarter. Nvidia is anticipating a smooth ramp of the Blackwell Ultra based on what it learned from Blackwell. 2. Sovereign AI: During the call, Huang called sovereign AI \"a new growth engine\" for the company as countries around the world build out national AI factories. \"Countries are racing to build national AI platforms to elevate their digital capabilities,\" the CEO said. Later, he likened the need for countries to invest in AI infrastructure to their past investments in electricity and the internet. Rules on how countries are purchasing AI chips from Nvidia have been dynamic lately, with President Donald Trump ending the AI diffusion rules in favor of a new policy to promote AI tech with trusted partners. One way is through trade agreements, like what we saw out of the Middle East a few weeks ago. Next up could be Europe. Huang will be traveling through the continent next week and said that \"just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure and there are umpteen AI factories being planned.\" 3. Hyperscalers : There's been no let-up or digestion in demand from the so-called hyperscalers, which is another term for large data center and cloud service providers like Alphabet and Oracle as well as Club names Amazon , Microsoft , and Meta Platforms . They all signaled alongside, their latest earnings reports, their intentions to keep spending aggressively on AI. Nvidia said Wednesday that on average, major hyperscalers are each deploying nearly 1,000 NVL72 racks or 72,000 Blackwell GPUs per week and are on track to further increase output this quarter. One example that CFO Colette Kress gave was that Microsoft has already deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs, but that's expected to increase to the hundreds of thousands. 4. China : As for its business in China, Nvidia shipped out $4.6 billion worth of H20s prior to the new export licensing requirement. It was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the quarter. The export license changes, which went into effect in mid-April, caused the company to disclose it will record a $5.5 billion charge in the quarter tied to H20 inventory, purchase commitments, and \"related reserves.\" In a bit of good news, Nvidia said Wednesday it only had to record a $4.5 billion charge this quarter, less than originally anticipated, because it was able to reuse certain materials. Nvidia said it is still evaluating its options to supply chips to the region in compliance with the U.S. government's export control rules. Reuters reported over the weekend that Nvidia is planning mass production of a new AI chip for China that is compliant with restrictions. Huang said on the earnings call that Nvidia does not have anything right now to announce, but the company is \"considering it\" and \"thinking about it.\" Losing access to the China AI accelerator market would have a material adverse impact on Nvidia's business, Kress said on the earnings call, a market she thinks will grow to nearly $50 billion. Huang echoed that sentiment in an interview with Jim Cramer for Wednesday evening's \"Mad Money.\" Huang said that trade with China is important if the U.S. wants to be the global AI leader. \"There are so many developers there [in China], and because the world is going to adopt technology from one country or another — and we prefer it to be the American technology stack,\" the CEO told Jim. Guidance Looking at Nvidia's fiscal 2026 second quarter outlook, the company expects revenue to be approximately $45 billion, plus or minus 2%. This view was slightly below the consensus estimate of $45.9 billion, according to LSEG. However, it reflects a loss of approximately $8 billion in H20 revenue due to the export control limitations. Moving down the line, Nvidia expects fiscal Q2 adjusted gross margins of 72%, plus or minus 50 basis points. That's roughly inline with the 72.1% expected per FactSet. According to an earnings snapshot note from Truist, Nvidia's implied fiscal second quarter EPS guidance is 98 cents at the midpoint, one penny shy of the 99-cent consensus, according to LSEG. This is pretty solid considering the loss of sales of H20 chips in China. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long NVDA, AMZN, META, MSFT. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

They claimed Mr Trump has left the US trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos with his gung-ho tariffs.\n\nAnd the ruling from a three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade in New York City reads: \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"\n\nIt referred to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which - albeit used rarely - orders the president to regulate international commerce. It was signed into law by Jimmy Carter, early into the Democrat's tenure.\n\nOregon's Democratic attorney general, Dan Rayfield, welcomed the ruling and described Trump's tariffs as unlawful, reckless and economically devastating. He said: \"This ruling reaffirms that our laws matter, and that trade decisions can’t be made on the president’s whim.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is expected to appeal against the decision, which is a massive blow to the world leader's trade policy. The decision was reached after at lease seven lawsuits challenged Mr Trump's aggressive levies. A dozen states also filed suit, led by Oregon.\n\nTariffs must typically be approved by Congress, but Mr Trump says he has the power to act because the country’s trade deficits amount to a national emergency. He imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world at one point, sending markets reeling.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency powers law does not authorise the use of tariffs, and even if it did, the trade deficit does not meet the law’s requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The US has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years.\n\nMr Trump imposed tariffs on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America’s massive and long-standing trade deficits. He earlier plastered levies on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the US border.\n\nHis administration argues that courts approved then-President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in 1971, and that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \"political\" question of whether the president’s rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law.\n\nTrump’s Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world’s largest economy.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a group of small businesses, including a wine importer, VOS Selections, whose owner has said the tariffs are having a major impact and his company may not survive. \n\nThis is a breaking news story.

But federal immigration authorities failed to screen him for a credible fear assessment before deporting him back to the same country where he was raped and held for ransom.\n\nLast week, District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the administration to “facilitate” his return — echoing court orders in two other high-profile immigration cases involving “wrongfully” deported immigrants.\n\n“In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped,” Murphy wrote.\n\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for the Department of Justice said Homeland Security officials are preparing to return him to the United States — and potentially release him from custody for humanitarian reasons.\n\nA flight crew in Phoenix is working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s air division to put him on a charter flight, according to court filings.\n\nMurphy’s ruling marks at least the third time that the Trump administration has been ordered to return a wrongly deported immigrant.\n\nLast month, a Trump-appointed federal judge found that the government’s removal of a 20-year-old Venezuelan man named in court documents as “Cristian” violated a court settlement intended to protect young immigrants who have pending asylum claims.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also unanimously agreed that the Trump administration “illegally” deported Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a father and husband living in Maryland. Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador as a teenager in 2011. He has been imprisoned in his home country since March 15.\n\nMore than a month after the highest court’s decision, the Trump administration has yet to facilitate his return, and is engaged in a tense legal battle to avoid answering what steps, if any, it is taking to bring him back, and arguing that the administration does not need to answer to questions from a federal judge about its arrangement with El Salvador.\n\nThe administration has filed a motion to try to dismiss that case altogether.\n\nO.C.G.’s case is part of a wider class-action lawsuit targeting the administration’s so-called third-country removals, in which immigrants are deported to somewhere other than their home country. Murphy has blocked removing those immigrants without adequate notice — which he alleges the administration defied when authorities sent a group of immigrants to South Sudan.\n\nMurphy, who was appointed by Joe Biden, has faced a barrage of attacks from the White House, which labeled him a “far-left activist” who is trying to “protect the violent criminal illegal immigrants.” Trump called him “absolutely out of control” and accused him of “hurting our country.”\n\nThis week, the judge accused government attorneys of “manufacturing chaos” surrounding the case.\n\nImmigration officials initially claimed that O.C.G. had agreed to be sent to Mexico, but the administration later admitted in court documents that their claim was based on erroneous information. An immigration official wrote in a sworn statement that “ICE was unable to identify an officer or officers” who had even asked the man about his credible fear.\n\n“How was this mistake made?” Murphy asked government lawyers during a hearing last week.\n\n“This is a really big deal,” he said. “It is a big deal to lie to a court under oath. It is an extraordinarily big deal to do so when there are matters of national importance at stake. I take this extremely seriously.”\n\nHe suggested he could call Homeland Security officials into court to testify under oath.\n\n“While mistakes obviously happen, the events leading up to this decision are troubling,” Murphy wrote in his order on May 23. “The Court was given false information, upon which it relied twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm.”\n\nLawyers for the Guatemalan man are likely to “succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,” according to Murphy.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-administration-agrees-return-wrongfully-002812200.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/61713c04779b2bbe95e64012b016527e","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:28:12","author":"Alex Woodward","authors":["Alex Woodward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":325935406,"title":"‘Reexamining Iconic Interviews with Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, and the Kardashians in “Barbara Walters Tell Me Everything” Documentary’","text":"LOS ANGELES — From Taylor Swift to Donald Trump, the Kardashians, and the Menendez brothers, what do they share?

We love, support and thank you Mr. President! God Bless you and your entire family! Continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!\"\n\nAlex Little, an attorney for the Chrisleys, said last week that he did not know why Trump chose to pardon his clients this week.\n\nTodd Chrisley was sentenced to serve 12 years in prison and Julie Chrisley sentenced to seven. Both sentences came with three years' supervised release.\n\nThe couple, known as the \"Trumps of the South,\" gained fame through their Chrisley Knows Best reality show in which they flaunted their wealth. They were found guilty in 2022 of manipulating financial records to make it appear as if they were wealthier than they really were, when applying for more than $30 million in loans from 2007 to 2012.\n\nIn a video excerpt published on X by a White House aide of a phone call Tuesday between Trump and the jailed couple's adult children, the president is heard stating, \"Your parents are going to be free and clean, and I hope we can do that by tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I don't know them, but give them my regards and wish them a good life.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for bringing my parents back,\" Grayson Chrisley is heard responding.\n\n\"Yeah, well, they were given a pretty harsh treatment from what I'm hearing,\" Trump replied.\n\nMargo Martin, the White House aide who published the clip online, said in the caption that Trump will be granting them \"full pardons.\"\n\n\"Trump Knows Best!\" she added.\n\nThe Conservative Political Action Conference said in a statement that it \"appreciates\" Trump's pardoning of Todd and Julie Chrisley, the parents of its Nolan Center for Justice senior fellow, Savannah Chrisley, who was on the phone call Tuesday with Trump.\n\n\"The Chrisleys were targeted by weaponized prosecutors who abused the power granted to them by our criminal justice system,\" CPAC said in a statement.\n\n\"Thank you to President Trump for restoring order and integrity to the justice system.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the Chrisleys spent money they defrauded from banks to purchase luxury cars, real estate and travel, and then used new fraudulent loans to pay off the old loans.\n\nThey were also ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution.\n\nTodd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from $20 million in debt. On top of the conspiracy to defraud banks, they were found guilty of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Julie Chrisley also was found guilty of wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January, Trump has used his executive powers to punish political adversaries with executive orders and to seemingly reward convicted friends, supporters and donors with presidential pardons.\n\nOn Monday, Trump pardoned disgraced former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, who was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment after a federal court found he accepted tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to appoint local businessmen as auxiliary deputy sheriffs. The president described Jenkins as being a victim of a \"corrupt and weaponized Biden\" Department of Justice.\n\nLast month, Trump pardoned Paul Walczak, a former nursing home executive who was sentenced to 18 months in jail for tax crimes and whose mother had raised millions for the New York real estate mogul's campaigns.\n\nIn March, he also pardoned Devon Archer, a former business associate of Hunter Biden who was sentenced to a year and a day in prison in 2022 for a scheme to defraud a Native American community. However, he testified against the Biden family during the Republicans' failed investigation to try and impeach former President Joe Biden.","summary":"Reality star Todd Chrisley is out of prison and his wife, Julie, to be released after President Donald Trump pardoned the couple who were being found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and committing tax evasion","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/05/28/Trump-Pardon-Todd-Julie-Chrisley/6451748397915/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6451748397915/2025/upi/cafc7d3be245fd9f5d20a61b1f1d3818/v1.2/Trump-pardons-ex-reality-TV-stars-Todd-and-Julie-Chrisley.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:18:51","author":"Darryl Coote","authors":["Darryl Coote"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.295},{"id":325941492,"title":"Major car brand ‘looking to raise £5BILLION’ after axing 20K jobs & £4bn losses with ‘UK goverment to back loan’","text":"A MAJOR car brand is reportedly looking to raise £5billion including a loan guaranteed by the UK government after axing 20,000 jobs.\n\nCash-strapped Nissan, Japan's third-largest carmaker, is already facing £4billion in losses - its worst annual loss in a quarter century.\n\nBut now, the company are said to be considering raising more than 1 trillion yen - just over £5 billion - from debt and asset sales in a bid to prop up Nissan.\n\nThe struggling Japanese automaker plans to issue as much as 630 billion yen in convertible securities and bonds, including high-yielding US dollar and euro notes, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nThe move would also include a £1billion syndicated loan guaranteed by the British government, the documents show. \n\nSale-and-lease-back plans for its Yokohama headquarters, plus properties it owns in the United States, are also reportedly on the cards.\n\nThe aggressive fundraising plans underscore Nissan’s rapidly deteriorating financial and operational position, despite efforts by newly appointed chief executive Ivan Espinosa to turn the company around.\n\nIn addition, Nissan is reportedly seeking to sell part of the stakes it owns in Renault and battery maker AESC Group, as well as plants in South Africa and Mexico.\n\nBloomberg News cited sources as saying Nissan's board did not appear to have approved the funding proposal yet, leaving it unclear whether it would happen.\n\nThe proposal was also slated to include the rollover of some debt, the report said.\n\nA Nissan representative said the company does not comment on speculation.\n\nIt comes after Nissan said they could part ways with its global headquarters in Yokohama, Japan, to fund the company's urgent restructuring plan.\n\nAfter having moved to the 22-story high-rise in 2009, the car manufacturer is now facing mountains of debt and is on track to cut 20,000 jobs, shut several of its plants and slash billions in costs.\n\nWith a glitzy gallery, the flashy headquarters can showcase more than thirty motors and stands in stark contrast to their previous offices.\n\nThe company have said that part of their plan has called for reviewing assets that can be sold in a desperate bid to pay for the restructuring.\n\nWith its own headquarters in sight, thought to be worth approximately £500 million, Nissan would structure a deal so it could continue to use the site through a lease so its offices and operations remain in place.\n\nA company spokesperson said: \"Nissan is considering all possibilities to recover its business performance, but there are no specifics to share at this point of time.\"\n\nThe move is not unprecedented, however, with McLaren doing something similar with its HQ in Woking in recent years.\n\nNissan confirmed in April that it was anticipating losses of up to £4 billion, its worst annual loss in a quarter century.\n\nNissan is also planning to close seven factories by 2027, including two domestic sites which are thought to be the Oppama and Shonan plants, saving £2.6 billion in the process.\n\nThere have also been reports of downsizing or a partial sale of its Tochigi assembly plan and test centre facility north of Tokyo which was recently equipped with manufacturing technologies to assemble electric vehicles.\n\nTo underline the dire financial situation, the motor company is even halting the development of certain models to cut its expenses.\n\nWhile the car company has been hit hard by the effects of Donald Trump's tariff war, Nissan's new CEO, Ivan Espinosa, has admitted the company's financial trouble started a decade ago.\n\nHe said: \"This is not something that happened in the last couple of years.\n\n\"It's more of a fundamental problem that probably started back in 2015, when management thought this company could reach [annual global vehicle sales] of around eight million.\n\n\"There were heavy investments both in terms of planned capacity as well as in human resources, but the reality today is we are running at around half that volume.

Julie Chrisley was also expected to leave a facility in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n“We just want to get home. We want to be reunited,” the couple’s daughter, Savannah Chrisley, told reporters outside the Florida prison earlier as she awaited her father. She said her brother Grayson was meeting their mother in Kentucky.\n\n“My parents have not spoken to each other, heard each others’ voices or seen each other in the past 2 ½ years,” said Savannah Chrisley, who wore a bubble gum pink MAGA hat and matching “Women for Trump” jacket.\n\nThe Chrisleys’ TV show portrayed them as a tight-knit family with an extravagant lifestyle. Prosecutors at the couple’s 2022 trial said they spent lavishly on expensive cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel after taking out fraudulent bank loans worth millions of dollars and hiding their earnings from tax authorities.\n\nTrump announced his intention to pardon them on Tuesday, saying the celebrity couple had been “given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I’m hearing.” It was another example of the president, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.\n\nSavannah Chrisley has been a vocal Trump supporter and endorsed his candidacy in a speech at the Republican National Convention last summer. Though she has complained that the case against her parents was politically motivated, they were indicted in 2019 under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Byung J. “BJay” Pak.\n\nRegardless, Savannah Chrisley said officials in the Trump administration who reviewed her parents’ case had “seen the corruption.” She told reporters that the president delivered the news of the pardons himself, calling unexpectedly while she was at the grocery store.\n\n“I didn’t have to do anything other than stand firm in my beliefs and my convictions and fight for my parents,” she said.\n\nShe paused to take photos with fans and supporters gathered outside the prison before getting into a vehicle that took her past its security checkpoint.\n\nThe Chrisleys’ attorney, Alex Little, said Tuesday that the pardon “corrects a deep injustice” in which the couple were “targeted because of their conservative values and high profile.”\n\nBefore she was pardoned, Julie Chrisley, 52, had been scheduled for release in January 2028, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website, while Todd Chrisley, 56, was to remain behind bars until September 2032.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that the Chrisleys had not yet become TV stars when they and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks in the Atlanta area to obtain fraudulent loans. New loans were taken out to pay off the old ones, according to prosecutors, until Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans.\n\nThe defense argued that an IRS officer gave false testimony during the trial and that prosecutors lacked evidence to support convictions.\n\nA panel of judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Chrisleys’ convictions last year.\n\nWaiting to meet her father, Savannah Chrisley said her family was making plans to do a lot of catching up.\n\n“We’re going to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, Christmases, all the things,” she said, “because we’re going to make up for the lost time.”\n\nBynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.","summary":"It was another example of the president, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/28/trump-pardons-reality-tv-stars-sentenced-for-fraud-tax-evasion/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/sjm-ns-Chrisleys_229726964.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:17:56","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":325935392,"title":"The UK’s Advanced Warfare Operations to Be Consolidated in Defense Overhaul","text":"The UK military is set to consolidate its cyber and electronic operations under one command, according to an announcement by defence secretary John Healey. This change is part of a comprehensive reorganisation of modern warfare capabilities.\n\nThis initiative will serve as a key element in the government’s strategic defence review, which is anticipated to be released on Monday. The review will detail military spending plans and future priorities. \n\nMoreover, the Ministry of Defence intends to invest over £1bn in creating an artificial intelligence-based system designed to process and manage the vast volumes of data generated throughout the military. \n\nThis is part of a broader effort to digest the military lessons learned during the Ukraine conflict, which has seen Ukraine use technology to hold off a numerically superior enemy. \n\nOn a visit to the UK military’s cyber command at MOD Corsham in Wiltshire on Wednesday, Healey defended Britain’s spending commitments in the face of pressure from the US and other Nato allies to increase funding for the armed forces. \n\nFaced with an increasingly belligerent Russia, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged an extra £5bn this year to get defence spending to the threshold of 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 and 3 per cent by the next election. However, this may not be enough for Nato allies. \n\nOn Monday, Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte said he assumed Nato would agree a defence spending target of 5 per cent of GDP, 3.5 per cent on pure defence and 1.5 per cent on broader security related items, in line with demands from US President Donald Trump. \n\nAny disagreements are likely to come to a head later this month at Nato’s annual summit in The Hague.\n\n“We have always played our part in Nato,” Healey said, addressing Rutte’s comments. “And we go into the summit ready to plan to meet our capability commitments. We’ll make our commitments to Nato. But above all, Britain will become the leading European nation in Nato.” \n\nSpeaking at MOD Corsham, Healey said “we’re under daily attack” in the cyber domain. “And this is the nerve centre of the UK’s military that helps us defend against these attacks . . . the keyboard has become a weapon of war.\n\n“In future conflicts — and we learned this lesson from Ukraine — those that prevail will be those who are not just better equipped and better trained, but better connected.” \n\nThe new National Cyber and Electromagnetic Command will unite the UK’s cyber personnel, who straddle the signals intelligence agency GCHQ, the Ministry of Defence and other government units. \n\nThe National Cyber Force, which oversees “offensive” cyber operations, will stay independent under the plan. The new cyber command — similar but not identical to the Cyber Force created a decade and a half ago by the Pentagon — will unify a series of smaller units into a national command alongside NCF. \n\nExperts were sceptical of the reorganisation. “I’m of two minds,” said one serving reserve officer who asked that his name not be used. “Obviously, electronic warfare and cyber are critical. But I’m not sure the way to cut through bureaucracy is to create more organisations and layers.”\n\nThe new “digital targeting web” system, meanwhile, aims to knit together data gathered across a battlefield and translate it into better intelligence about what an adversary is doing, but on a larger scale than current software in use such as Maven, designed by US defence company Palantir. Defence officials insisted that no single system or company would provide the whole picture, which one described as a “system of systems”. \n\n“It is a serious level of investment and shows it’s a real priority,” said Will Blyth, chief executive and co-founder of Arondite, a UK defence software company.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nUnlock the Editor’s Digest for free The UK military is set to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The UK&#8217;s Advanced Warfare Operations to Be Consolidated in Defense Overhaul first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/the-uks-advanced-warfare-operations-to-be-consolidated-in-defense-overhaul/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/UKs-high-tech-warfare-operations-to-be-unified-in-defence-shake-up.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-29 00:15:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.367},{"id":325939626,"title":"Julie Chrisley Released From Prison After Trump Pardons Sentence","text":"Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley are no longer behind bars.\n\nThe Chrisley Knows Best couple, who spent the last two years incarcerated on fraud charges, have both officially been freed after President Donald Trump pardoned their prison sentences.\n\nNot long after Todd was released from prison in Florida on May 28, Julie also walked out of the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Ky., their attorney confirmed to E!

The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.

The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a programme that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics. The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight Covid-19 in record time.

Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has expressed deep skepticism regarding the safety of mRNA vaccines. The cancellation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults. “While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" the company said in a statement. H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the US last year, infecting hundreds in several states. At least 70 people in the US have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died. Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could allow it to become more virulent or spread more easily in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic. Moderna received USD 176 million in July 2024 and USD 590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.
