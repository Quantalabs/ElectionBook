The vice president's team had pushed for the microphones to be left on throughout the debate, contrary to moderators' plans to mute a candidate's microphone when it isn't their turn to speak. Trump's team had pushed back on Harris' request, arguing that the candidates already agreed to have the same rules as the June 27 debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.ABC said that a virtual coin toss was held on Tuesday to determine the candidates' podium placement and the order of closing statements. Trump won the toss and chose to offer the final closing statement, while Harris chose to stand at the podium positioned on the right side of viewers' screens.There will be no live audience at the event, which will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Both candidates will stand throughout the duration of the debate and no props or pre-written notes are allowed, per ABC.Each candidate will have two minutes to answer moderators' questions, and will be given a two-minute rebuttal to respond to their opponents' answers. There will be no opening statements, and closing statements will also be given a two-minute slot.The debate will air at 9 p.m. EST September 10 on ABC News' live 24/7 streaming network, as well as Disney+ and Hulu. ABC station WPVI will also show the event.This is a developing story and will be updated as further information becomes available.","summary":"The network released its guidelines for next week's debate between Harris and Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-abcs-presidential-debate-will-work-harris-campaign-accepts-rules-1949026","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2464183/trump-harris.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 00:20:05","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":255662566,"title":"What the papers say – September 5","text":"The outcome of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, in which 72 people died, dominates the front pages of Thursday’s newspapers.

On Sept. 1, several people on social media shared a video claiming to show the Hells Angels motorcycle club headed to Aurora to combat the Venezuelan gang. “When the hells angels biker gang meets the Venezuelans. Look out Colorado they are on the way!” one X post says. The post is accompanied by a video showing a large group of motorcyclists traveling down a highway. A now-deleted X post from Sept. 1 with the same text had more than a million views. Another Sept. 1 X post with the video says, written in Dutch and translated into English: “Hells Angels on their way to Aurora Colorado to help the citizens because law enforcement or their own government refused to help them, against Venezuelan gang violence. Unreal!” Google Trends data shows people have been asking if the Hells Angels are going to Aurora, Colorado. Does this viral video show Hells Angels members traveling to Aurora, Colorado? No, this viral video doesn’t show Hells Angels members traveling to Aurora, Colorado. It shows a caravan of riders participating in an Insanos Motorcycle Club event in Brazil back in July. Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter! The video posted online doesn’t show Hells Angels motorcycle club members traveling to Aurora, Colorado. The video shows a different motorcycle club in Brazil and predates news reports about the Venezuelan gang activity in Aurora, Colorado. The Hells Angels is a motorcycle club that originated in Fontana, California, in 1948 and has thousands of members worldwide. The Hells Angels are classified by the FBI as an outlaw motorcycle gang that “use their motorcycle clubs as conduits for criminal enterprises,” but there is no evidence that the Hells Angels are traveling to Aurora. In an email to VERIFY, a spokesperson with the city of Aurora said the “Aurora Police Department’s Intelligence Unit has been looking into social media posts from this weekend and do not believe the posts [about the Hells Angels] to be credible.” The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club’s Rocky Mountain Charter also denied the claims in an Instagram post. “The HAMC strongly denies the foundation and validity of these absolutely ridiculous and false claims. The HAMC does not involve itself in political issues outside of motorcycling and takes no stance on the issue of immigration or the presidential election,” the Hells Angels’ statement reads in part. “Social media rumors like this only serve to perpetuate a false and irresponsible narrative about the HAMC for the sole purpose of driving traffic and clicks. These rumors also have the potential of causing real harm to real people,” the group added. Using InVid, a video forensics tool, VERIFY analyzed the viral video and conducted a reverse image search. That led us to this TikTok video posted on July 7, 2024, that shows a caravan of riders from an Insanos Motorcycle Club (MC) event in Brazil. Insanos MC is the largest motorcycle club in Brazil, according to the club’s website. The original TikTok video also includes the hashtag #bondepelavida; ‘bonde pela vida’ translated into English from Portuguese means “Tram For Life.” The phrase “Tram for Life” was used in this July 7 Instagram post from the official account of the Insanos MC. The Insanos MC event included a “tram,” or caravan, of more than 10,000 motorcyclists who toured Brazilian cities, according to a person speaking in the video. While VERIFY was not able to confirm the exact location where the video was taken, there are three police vehicles escorting the riders at the start of the video. All three vehicles have the words “POLICIA” and the logo for the São Paulo State Highway Police marked on them. There are a number of other videos from the same week in July showing the Insanos MC caravan. Another indication that the viral video does not show members of Hells Angels is the bikes people are riding. Hells Angels riders only travel on Harley Davidson motorcycles and the bikes seen in the viral video vary in brand. VERIFY partner station KUSA began reporting about the Venezuelan gang activity in the Denver area in early August, a month after the video of the Brazilian bikers was posted to TikTok. According to KUSA, Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said the Venezuelan gang situation is being exaggerated. Coffman told KUSA that residents in some apartment buildings in the city are being intimidated by a Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua, but that Aurora Police are handling the situation and making arrests. The Aurora Police Department issued a statement on Aug. 28, saying the gang’s activity is “isolated.” VERIFY reached out to the Aurora Police Department about the Hells Angels claims and did not hear back at the time of publication.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNo evidence supports claims that Hells Angels are traveling to Aurora, Colorado&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Incorrect, popular video does not depict Hells Angels bikers traveling to Colorado to confront Venezuelan gangs first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/incorrect-popular-video-does-not-depict-hells-angels-bikers-traveling-to-colorado-to-confront-venezuelan-gangs/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-No-viral-video-doesnt-show-Hells-Angels.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 00:04:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":255662582,"title":"Trump Federal Election Case to Restart After Supreme Court Immunity Ruling","text":"Former President Donald Trump’s election interference case is expected to resume with a status conference on Sept. 5 after months of delay related to his appeal based on presidential immunity. Despite the Supreme Court issuing a landmark precedent in Trump v. United States in July, it’s likely the case will proceed with further debate about the scope of Trump’s immunity for acts taken roughly four years ago. A majority of the Supreme Court held that presidents enjoy certain levels of immunity for official acts. The status conference will help determine how the parties will continue pretrial proceedings, which started around the same time last year, and wrestle with how to proceed with special counsel Jack Smith’s superseding indictment, which he filed in August. The new indictment removed a portion of the original focused on Trump’s interactions with the Justice Department, something for which the Supreme Court majority in Trump v. United States said he was immune. For example, Smith left in place information about Trump’s interactions with former Vice President Mike Pence, ensuring further litigation over the new indictment and what Trump would face in an eventual trial. Trump has already indicated he won’t be present for the arraignment, filing a waiver that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan accepted on Sept. 3. Based on the joint status report, both sides could debate the DOJ’s application of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the financial reform law that has been applied to Jan. 6 defendants, including Trump. In Fischer v. United States, a Supreme Court majority held that the special counsel had to do more to adequately allege defendants violated a section related to obstructing official proceedings. The Aug. 30 report states that Trump may move to dismiss the case based on Fischer. The status report filed on Aug. 30 showed that the special counsel and Trump’s attorneys disagree over when to introduce evidence. Smith wasn’t specific on dates but asked that the court allow a briefing schedule for Trump’s various motions that would run parallel with a schedule for immunity briefings. “The Government does not see a reason to delay immunity determinations and other pretrial litigation to separately address the defense’s pending or proposed discovery motions,” the status report reads. Trump, meanwhile, argued that the case should end based on legal issues and proceed with evidentiary submissions if necessary. His proposed schedule wouldn’t see a potential trial start date until next spring. “Fully considering, researching, briefing, and resolving each of these potential motions will take considerable time and resources,” the status report reads.","summary":"The timeline is unclear, with both parties disputing how the pretrial process should continue.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-federal-election-case-to-restart-after-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-5718122","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/01/id5716719-GettyImages-2169366655-trump-SB-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 00:02:26","author":"Sam Dorman","authors":["Sam Dorman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":255662536,"title":"DirecTV Says Disney Is Trying to ‘Corner the Market for Themselves’ Amid Carriage Dispute","text":"The war of words between Disney and DirecTV continues as the two parties’ carriage dispute stretches into its fourth day. In a joint statement from Disney Entertainment co-chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro on Wednesday, the House of Mouse accused the satellite and pay TV giant of “misrepresenting the facts” around its ongoing negotiations. The media company maintains that it has proposed a variety of packages that would allow DirecTV to offer more flexibility, choice and control to its 11 million subscribers, such as a sports-centric bundle option featuring ESPN networks and ABC, an entertainment-based option featuring Disney’s entertainment networks and linear offerings paired with Disney’s direct-to-consumer subscription services like its deal with Charter Communications from last year. It also said that it has asked for rates that are in line with other distribution providers and that reflect the value of its content portfolio. “Our priority is to reach a marketplace deal that serves the needs of DirecTV and their customers while also recognizing the value of our top-quality content and the significant investment required to create and acquire it,” the executives said. “We believe there is a path to a fair and flexible agreement that strikes this critical balance and works for all sides, especially the consumer.” However, DirecTV chief content officer Rob Thun pushed back against Disney’s letter on Wednesday, calling the package proposal a “half truth” and that they are actually engaging in behavior focused on “cornering the market for themselves.” He pointed out that the two parties have agreed to rates, but remain apart on the flexibility and number of genre-based packages they’re trying to offer. “In the skinnier bundles, they were going to afford only themselves really any runway on the sports and broadcast package,” Thun told CNBC. “And they gave us a flavor of entertainment that is laced with these minimum penetration requirements, which ironically, is not what they gave to Charter, which they told us firsthand. And they’re not letting us participate in the kids and family package that we put on the table to them because they want to keep that for themselves.” DirecTV has also argued that Disney has asked them to waive all claims that its behavior is anticompetitive and move adjudication for any future lawsuits from New York to California. “I think where we agree is that there’s a vast market in between what’s available to customers today with a direct consumer subscription package construct and the fat pay TV construct that we live with today,” Thun added. “We think there’s a big market for us to participate in, but we need the rights and the rights to not be encumbered by these minimum penetration requirements, so that we can make this available to more customers than what Disney’s prescribing today. They just have to give us more flexibility in the rights they’ve given us, and they don’t reflect what they were planning to give themselves and that’s what we’re calling them out on.” The dispute comes amid a busy month for ABC and ESPN, which includes the U.S. Open, the start of the college football and NFL seasons and the telecasts of the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, as well as the 2024 Emmys. In addition to local ABC affiliates, Disney-owned networks normally available on DirecTV include ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN Deportes, ESPNU, ESPN News, SEC Network, ACC Network, FX, FX Movie Channel, FXX, Freeform, National Geographic, Nat Geo Wild, Nat Geo Mundo, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD and BabyTV. In the meantime, DirecTV’s more than 11 million subscribers impacted by the programming blackout can request a $20 credit. In addition to DirecTV, Disney’s networks are available on other satellite providers like Dish Network, cable providers like Charter Communication’s Spectrum or Comcast, or virtual MVPDs like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV.","summary":"The pay TV giant argues that the House of Mouse's package proposals are \"laced\" with minimum penetration requirements that limit the scope and reach of what it's looking to offer\n\n\nThe post DirecTV Says Disney Is Trying to &#8216;Corner the Market for Themselves&#8217; Amid Carriage Dispute appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/directv-disney-carriage-dispute-rob-thun-cnbc/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Directv.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 00:01:29","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.202},{"id":255662336,"title":"Disarray in Trump’s campaign as internal conflict among untrustworthy individuals jeopardizes his run for president","text":"Senior officials directing Donald Trump’s election campaign were brimming with confidence when incumbent Joe Biden announced his withdrawal as the Democratic nominee last month. But the former president’s camp are now quaking in their collective boots after realizing Kamala Harris is not quite the pushover they expected she would be, DailyMail.com can reveal. Chief target of the complaints are ‘grifters,’ ‘hucksters,’ ‘profiteers’ and ‘cranks’ – to use a few of the colorful terms dropped by GOP officials and operatives during interviews with DailyMail.com last week. They are accused of damaging his campaign with their incompetence and crude efforts to exploit their close ties to him, whether real or imaginary, for personal profit. Eight years ago, when Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, a lot of talented campaign professionals helped get him elected, one grizzled Republican campaign veteran told DailyMail.com. ‘He’s still got a lot of talented people around him in 2024,’ the operative said. ‘But their main talent is getting rich.’ Trump’s teams of political advisors and associates have always consisted of controversial characters, including Roger Stone, an unofficial advisor during his run against Clinton eight years ago who’s been known as a notorious black bag operator since he worked for President Richard Nixon’s reelection campaign in 1972. Stone only managed to avoid a 40-month prison stretch for witness tampering, making false statements, and otherwise impeding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russiagate investigation because Trump commuted his sentence days before he was scheduled to report to prison. Then there was Steve Bannon, the CEO of Trump’s 2016 campaign and first White House chief strategist, who is currently federal inmate number 05635-509 in FCI Danbury in Connecticut where he been since July. He is scheduled for release a week before election day. He is serving a four-month stretch behind bars for defying a subpoena issued by a Congressional committee that investigated the January 6, 2021 riots at the US Capitol. Bannon still faces charges for scheming to defraud donors to a private project to build a wall along the southern border. One well-connected Washington operator who had good connections to Trump’s administration during its early days said the former president inevitably attracted a disproportionate share of ‘oddballs’ into his orbit due to his own eccentric personality and unconventional style. ‘There were always a lot of people hanging around who would tell you they knew a guy who knew another guy who could get you a meeting with Trump,’ he recalled. ‘Some of them really had connections and could get you that meeting, but a lot of them were hustlers looking to make a buck.’ The biggest change from 2016, according to GOP insiders interviewed by DailyMail.com, is that back then the dodgier figures in Trump’s entourage were counterbalanced by a large contingent of experienced campaign professionals. Since then, the share of corner-cutting, scandal-prone, profit-hungry confederates in Trump’s camp steadily grew as many of his more conventional associates departed after growing disenchanted with him. The problem has been compounded by the former’s president’s deep loyalty to his closest associates, which is typically a positive quality in friendships but less often the case with political relationships. Several sources referred by way of example to Trump’s recent decision to bring his first 2016 campaign manager Corey Lewandowski back into the fold in as a top advisor as a sign of the urgency he’s feeling about the need to reverse Harris’s campaign momentum, and as the type of hires he makes that could make matters worse. While Lewandowski is known to be extremely dedicated to Trump and relentlessly hardworking, he’s equally notorious for driving away important staffers because he’s rude and overbearing, and for his long track record of public buffoonery. Trump has already fired Lewandowski twice, first as his campaign manager after he was accused of assaulting a female reporter. He was let go again in 2021 when he was directing a Super PAC raising money for the former president when he got drunk at a charity event for a group that combats alcohol and drug abuse, and crudely hit on the wife of a prominent donor who he bragged to about his penis size. Peter Navarro, a trade advisor during the Trump administration, was invited to address the Republican National Convention on July 17, the day he was released from a Miami prison after serving four months for refusing to cooperate with a congressional investigation into the riot at the US Capitol in 2021 and pledged eternal loyalty to the ex-president. When he worked at the White House, Navarro regularly put his foot in his mouth, which came as no surprise to his former political colleagues in California. In a 2020 story in Politico, Rob Stutzman, a former advisor to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, called him a prominent inhabitant of the ‘island of misfits that make up the Trump White House.’ Larry Remer, who ran two of Navarro’s five failed campaigns for public office in San Diego, labeled him ‘the biggest a**hole I’ve ever known.’ Sergio Gor, a conservative operative and Trump fundraiser, is widely known in campaign circles for his chronic efforts to monetize his connection to the former president and his family. A longtime aide to Republican Senator Rand Paul, Gor took a top job with a major Trump campaign fundraising outfit in 2020. Following Trump’s defeat in that year’s election, Gor and Donald Trump Jr. became partners in Winning Team Publishing, whose first release was ‘Our Journey Together,’ a coffee table book of photos of Trump Sr, in 2022. A special edition autographed by the former president went for $999 and came with the classic red ‘Make America Great Again’ cap and other MAGA memorabilia. Over the past four years, Republican political campaigns and committees have paid $1.5million to two companies controlled by Gor, The Daily Beast reported earlier this year. In January, Gor took the helm as CEO of a new Trump Super PAC called ‘Right for America,’ which multiple sources who spoke to DailyMail.com mocked as a crude money play. ‘Any time I see Sergio’s involved in a project, I assume there’s a good chance it’s a scam,’ said one, a Republican campaign veteran. Gor did not initially return requests for comment. After publication, he said the Daily Beast ‘attributed companies to me which I have no control or interest in’. ‘Our super PAC expenses are public. You’ll see I’ve not taken a salary. ‘Publicly available details will show I have taken zero cents. Trash magnate Anthony Lomangino and Conair Corporation heir Lee Rizzuto Jr., who are both close to Trump and regulars at Mar-a-Lago, sit on the Super PAC’s board. The pair provided a combined $4.25million to Right for America as of June 30, Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show. Right for America’s total receipts as of that day came to $38.6million. Of that amount, the Super PAC, which once pledged to spend ‘tens of millions of dollars’ to support Trump’s 2024 run, only dispensed $169,919. Much of that went to politically wired consulting firms. Roughly $15,000 went to cover travel by Gor and a similar amount was paid to Mar-a-Lago for use as an event space and catering services. How much money Right for America eventually raises this year and where it goes won’t be fully known until next year when it files its final disclosure report for 2024 to the FEC. ‘What is Right for America going to do that’s different or better or smarter than all the other Super PACs already raising money for Trump?’ asked an experienced Republican campaign consultant. ‘Benefiting the people who created and run it is its only discernible purpose.’ Another Trump-controlled PAC, Save America, raises money to pay legal defense bills for the former president and his close allies. It recently shelled out some $60million to the law firm of Russian-American Boris Epshteyn, who Bannon once labeled Trump’s ‘wartime consigliere’. Epshteyn is facing charges himself for allegedly helping orchestrate a scheme in Arizona as part of Trump’s broader effort to reverse his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election. Though ‘lacking any track record as a political strategist,’ Epshteyn ‘made more than $1.1million in the past two years for providing advice to the campaigns of Republican candidates, many of whom believed he could be a conduit to Mr. Trump,’ said a 2023 New York Times article. ‘Epshteyn is a crackpot, I can’t believe he’s still around,’ said a dyed-in-the-wool right-wing Republican operator who speaks regularly to top campaign officials. A main focus of complaints is Charlie Kirk, the 30-year-old director of the conservative youth group Turning Point USA, which has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to promote Trump, his political allies, and a variety of MAGA-friendly causes. This year Kirk – who has become immensely wealthy in the process and lives in an Arizona estate worth millions on the grounds of a private country club – announced his group was looking to raise the astronomic sum of $108million to run field campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives for Trump in swing states, despite having little to show for its past lavishly-funded efforts in those areas. ‘Turning Point spends a lot of money to host events and he travels around the country getting into fights at colleges, so he gets attention, but nothing he does is of long-term value.’ Kirk’s spokesman told DailyMail.com: ‘Charlie has busted his ass this election cycle to help win Arizona, Wisconsin and beyond and hasn’t been paid a penny for the extra effort. ‘All money raised has been immediately spent hiring hundreds of full-time ballot chasers. The operation is lean and frankly underfunded. We produce actual results. ‘Charlie’s personal money comes from his nationally syndicated radio show and top rated podcast.’ WinRed, a GOP fundraising platform launched in 2019 by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee (RNC), and the party’s Senate and House campaign committees, is also singled out as a particularly brazen example of political profiteering. Josh Kushner – the younger brother of Trump’s son-in-law and former presidential senior advisor Jared Kushner who reportedly was personally involved in the decision to establish WinRed – owns a stake in WinRed through his firm Thrive Capital. ‘WinRed prints money but that’s not because it’s a great fundraising platform,’ said the GOP consultant. ‘In fact, it’s a terrible platform that charges ridiculously high fees and the only reason anyone uses it is because they were ordered to by the Trump campaign, the RNC and its other founders.’ ‘During the Republican presidential primary debates this year, you couldn’t get on the stage unless you used WinRed,’ he added. With time running short between now and Election Day, and ideas about how to reverse Harris’s momentum in short supply, the detrimental collective impact caused by the growing flock of hangers-on and camp followers in Trump’s orbit has become much more evident, said the GOP campaign veteran. ‘Trump is a superstar and when things are going well, his side wins whether his teammates are playing well or not,’ he explained. ‘That’s hard to know because he’s so good, he hides their deficiencies,’ said the source. ‘You only find out if the people around him are talented when he gets hurt, which is the situation we’re in now, and what we’re finding out now is that most of them aren’t.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSenior officials directing Donald Trump&#8217;s election campaign were brimming with confidence when&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Disarray in Trump&#8217;s campaign as internal conflict among untrustworthy individuals jeopardizes his run for president first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/disarray-in-trumps-campaign-as-internal-conflict-among-untrustworthy-individuals-jeopardizes-his-run-for-president/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump039s-campaign-in-chaos-as-infighting-among.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-05 00:00:54","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.003},{"id":255662398,"title":"2024 Showdown: Anti-Trump Republican Liz Cheney says she's backing Kamala Harris","text":"Former Rep.

And she emphasized that \"as a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.\" TRUMP HEADS TO CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND STATE FOR FOX NEWS TOWN HALL MODERATED BY HANNITY Minutes after the Cheney news broke, the Trump campaign posted on social media an interview of Cheney on the Fox News Channel from four years ago taking aim at Harris. \"Her voting record in the Senate is to the left of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren,\" Cheney argued at the time. \"It's very clear, she is a radical liberal.\" HARRIS STOPS IN KEY SWING STATE THAT TRUMP CHARGES VP AND BIDEN ‘DISRESPECTED’ The Fox News interview took place soon after then-2020 Democratic presidential nominee Biden named then-Sen. Harris as his running mate. Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, was once a conservative star in the GOP who was rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership. MARGIN OF ERROR RACE BETWEEN HARRIS, TRUMP, AS CAMPAIGN ENTERS FINAL STRETCH But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly attack Jan. 6 on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election. The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position. Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to a candidate that was backed by Trump. Cheney — who has argued that the former president is a \"liar,\" a \"con man\" and a potential \"tyrant\" who, if elected again, would \"torch the Constitution\" — vowed after leaving Congress that \"I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.\" But despite outreach from the Biden campaign, which transformed into the Harris campaign in July after the vice president replaced her boss at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket, Cheney had remained silent until now. Cheney decided against joining other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans — such as former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov.

But Trump revealed Tuesday that he has not been invited on Rogan’s podcast and seemed less than enthused when asked if he would have a taped interview with him. Rogan has said he doesn’t plan to have Trump join his show because he doesn’t want to help the candidate and unintentionally influence people to vote for him. But the podcast host was forced to roll back what was widely seen as an endorsement of former Independent candidate RFK Jr. last month after massive MAGA blowback. Rogan had sparked anger from fired up Trump supporters, and Trump himself, after a clip from his show indicated that he was supporting RFK Jr. for president. Trump questioned Rogan’s apparent endorsement on social media. ‘It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???’ Trump asked in a post on Truth Social despite Rogan clarifying his position. When asked Tuesday about whether there was any inherent tension between Trump and Rogan, the former president said there was not. ‘I don’t think that there was any tension and I’ve always liked him. But I don’t know him,’ Trump told Lex Fridman on his podcast episode released on Tuesday. ‘I only see him when I walk into the arena with Dana [White] and I shake his hand,’ the 2024 Republican presidential nominee went on. ‘I see him there and I think he’s good at what he does but I don’t know about doing his podcast.’ ‘I mean, I guess I’d do it,’ he admitted. ‘But I haven’t been asked and I’m not asking them, you know? I’m not asking anybody.’ Fridman speculated that Trump was openly negotiating to go on the show. ‘No, it’s not really a negotiation,’ Trump replied. ‘And he’s sort of a liberal guy, I guess, from what I understand.’ Rogan has distanced himself from both major political parties in the past, but has shared on his podcast and through his stand up routines some controversial political opinions over the years. The podcaster posts his conversations to Youtube channel The Joe Rogan Experience, which has 17.3 million followers. His conversations regularly amass hundreds of thousands to millions of views and listens. Any presidential candidate who earns a spot on Rogan’s podcast would earn a far-reaching and diverse audience. An episode released on June 14, 2024 featured Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who just last month suspended his independent bid for the White House and endorsed Trump. On August 9, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: ‘It would be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA 2024.’ Fridman asked Trump about this post. ‘He likes Kennedy, this was before – I found this out before Kennedy came in with us. He’s going to be great. I like that he likes Kennedy. I do too,’ Trump said. ‘You know, he’s a different kind of guy. He’s got some great things going and I think he’s going to be – beyond politics – I think he could be quite influential in taking care of some situations.’ Asked to provide insight into the psychology behind his posts on social media, Trump admitted that he does sometimes regret what he puts out in the world. Fridman asked if Trump is being ‘intentionally provocative’ or just ‘speaking your mind.’ ‘Are there times when you regret some Truths?’ the podcast host posed. ‘Yeah, I do,’ he replied. ‘But not that often, honestly.’ ‘I do a lot of reposting. The ones you get in trouble with are the reposts… when you do your own words it’s sort of easier.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMany avid podcast listeners have longed for popular conversationalist, stand up comedian&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Donald Trump shares his true thoughts on Joe Rogan and if he will appear on his podcast first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/donald-trump-shares-his-true-thoughts-on-joe-rogan-and-if-he-will-appear-on-his-podcast/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Donald-Trump-reveals-how-he-really-feels.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:58:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.004},{"id":255662106,"title":"Evangelical leader pitches Trump to followers as divinely chosen to lead country","text":"Lance Wallnau, a firebrand leader of the nation's growing grassroots evangelical movement, says it initially took some convincing to persuade evangelical Christians to recognize former President Donald Trump as divinely chosen to navigate these chaotic times. \"I got a lot of pushback after he got elected,\" Wallnau said in a rare network television interview with CBS News, \"because there was searching around for how — how could the evangelicals justify voting for some barbaric character like Trump? I said, 'Listen, give the guy some time. He doesn't know who we are, but his values resonate with our community.'\"By the look of those assembled on a recent, rainy summer day in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Wallnau appears to have succeeded. Wallnau leads the so-called \"Courage Tour,\" a roving event that targets key battleground counties across the country with a blend of religious and political activism. The events encourage attendees not only to get out the vote, but to sign up to be election workers and poll watchers. His efforts fit into an idea he popularized that calls on Christians to achieve religious and political dominion. He calls it the \"Seven Mountain Mandate,\" referring to government, family, religion, arts and entertainment, media, education and business. Once a fringe belief, it's become a popular refrain that blends religious and political messages, says Matthew Taylor, an author and religious scholar.Wallnau is trying to recruit pro-Trump evangelicals willing to look beyond the former president's past conduct and instead focus on his views about abortion, gender issues and Israel.\"You are literally seeing two sets of values and worldviews on display,\" said Joshua Standifer, one of the speakers on the Courage Tour who runs Lion of Judah, a group that recruits evangelicals to become poll workers and watchers. \"And it just so happens, one naturally aligns more to what we believe right now at this moment.\"Hundreds attended the Wisconsin event led by Wallnau last month, with tens of thousands more watching the revival online — a religious road show that is unapologetically political. The goal is to motivate fellow independent charismatic Christians to proselytize for Trump ahead of the November election, and to sustain the effort beyond Election Day if that's what it takes for him to win the presidency. \"Charisma\" in Greek means \"gift,\" and charismatic Christians, many of whom are nondenominational, emphasize the gifts of the Holy Spirit, like miracles and speaking in tongues.In his interview with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Wallnau described the tour as a \"combination platter\" of spiritual revival and political activism. \"It's about spiritual activism,\" he said.\"You can't make America great again until you restore an awakening with God again,\" Wallnau told the Eau Claire audience, later adding, \"Unless you learn how to mobilize and how to move in at a local level, then you're letting the devil dominate your culture.\"\"We're going to flood election poll stations across the country with spirit-filled believers,\" Standifer told the crowd. \"We believe it's time to release the roar of Christian voters across America.\"One of the revival's attendees, Jacqui Brokaw, said she wants to elect Trump \"because he stands for something.\" She's hoping to galvanize others in the area and swing Wisconsin from blue to red. \"If we don't get our election this year, we're going to lose our whole country,\" attendee David Jansen warned. \"What we are seeing here today is the most targeted and tactical voter mobilization effort done by Christian nationalists ever,\" says Taylor. He believes the stakes are more than just political. \"If Trump wins, then that becomes a part of the impetus that Donald Trump can say, 'I don't just have a democratic mandate, I have a divine mandate to change the country in accordance with the biblical values that these folks claim to have,'\" says Taylor. Trump's relationship with the evangelical community goes back to his first race for the White House in 2015, when Paula White-Cain, a leading charismatic Christian figure, became one of his top religious advisers. That year, White-Cain organized a gathering to introduce Trump to other leading charismatic figures, including Wallnau. After their initial meeting, Wallnau wrote that Trump was chosen as \"God's trumpet,\" to be \"a wrecking ball to political correctness.\"\"I caught that idea in 2015, when I first met Trump, and I said, 'Oh my gosh, this guy is like the character Cyrus in the Bible,'\" Wallnau explained, referring to the Book of Isaiah, which describes Cyrus as an outsider chosen by God to liberate Jews from captivity. Wallnau was one of the first charismatic leaders to spread the idea to his vast social media following that Trump had been anointed by God as a Cyrus for these times. His Trump is a conquering hero, and Wallnau sees his own role as convincing his followers to help with God's work of electing Trump.\"If at the end of the day, we haven't activated you to either be a poll watcher, a poll worker, somebody involved with election integrity or somebody that can help someone else get out a vote, I'm not sure that we've done what we have to do,\" Wallnau told the crowd in Eau Claire.\"You won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you Christians,\" Trump said at the Turning Point Action Believers' Summit in July.After Trump lost the 2020 election, charismatic Christians backed Trump's claims that the election had been stolen from him in the weeks leading up to the insurrection on Jan. 6. Wallnau, too, supported him and was scheduled to speak at a rally at the Capitol that day before it was canceled. In the tent in Eau Claire, Wallnau justified the riots that took place at the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago. \"Jan. 6 was not an insurrection,\" he said. \"It was an election fraud intervention.\"\"Many of the people who were leaders in this movement also showed up on Jan. 6 because they really believed that the election was being stolen,\" Taylor said. \"They had a gut feeling that Donald Trump was right.\"Taylor says that that mindset extends to a \"demonic conspiracy\" that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. \"[They] believed that a conspiracy of demons manifesting through the Democratic Party, manifesting through disloyal Republicans, manifesting through Mike Pence, was preventing Trump from winning the election and from fulfilling the will of God\", Taylor said. For Wallnau, this presidential election is no less than a battle of good versus evil. \"I don't see how anyone with moral clarity sits out an election like this. I mean, the issues are so clear,\" Wallnau said. \"I tell Christians, I say, you know, what you — what would you say during the Civil War?\"Wallnau uses apocalyptic language at revivals, setting up a spiritual battle between pious believers and demons who speak through Democrats or liberals. In an address on FlashPoint Live, he told the audience, \"You see the Left is loaded with demons.\"Wallnau described what he sees as the multitude of forces arrayed against the former president. \"[Trump]'s like Samson. He's got his hands between two pillars,\" Wallnau explained. \"He's virtually up against academia, media, government, the intelligence communities, and to an extent, a whole lot of corporate businesses.\"But Wallnau is betting that he can channel the hyper-focused Christian political energy that he is fueling toward overcoming those obstacles.\"The tendency to just look at elections, pray about them, eat popcorn, watch the result, and then go to bed is over,\" said Wallnau. \"Christians as believers probably should be engaged in this process of shaping culture far more aggressively and intentionally from now on because it's being shaped without them.\"","summary":"Lance Wallnau's revival gatherings for Trump are \"the most targeted and tactical voter mobilization effort by Christian nationalists ever,\" one expert said.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-lance-wallnau-evangelical-voters/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/04/67ed6f33-dd0b-4029-9d1e-d931df84ecff/thumbnail/1200x630/34428e58b5ad8526b9bb5571144edc9f/img-5872.jpg?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3167484_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:57:50","author":"Arden Farhi,Chrissy Hallowell,Clare Hymes","authors":["Arden Farhi","Chrissy Hallowell","Clare Hymes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.247},{"id":255662030,"title":"Nate Silver's Election Model Shows Donald Trump Surging","text":"Former President Donald Trump's chances of victory in November are the highest they've been in over a month, according to Nate Silver's latest election forecast.Despite Vice President Kamala Harris' consistent string of polling victories since entering the 2024 race, Silver's forecast shows Trump having a higher chance of securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win his reelection bid, putting Trump's chances of victory at 58.2 percent as of Wednesday. Harris, in comparison, has a 41.6 percent chance of winning in November, according to the latest Silver Bulletin.Silver, an American statistician and founder of election analysis site FiveThirtyEight, said that his election forecast \"is still in toss-up range,\" but noted that many polls released earlier this week \"are coming in below our current polling averages\" for Harris. As of Wednesday, the Silver Bulletin polling average found Harris beating Trump by 3.4 percentage points across national polling. But as Silver wrote, \"stranger things have happened than a candidate who was behind in the polls winning.\"\"And in America's polarized political climate, most elections are close and a candidate is rarely out of the running,\" he added.Silver's model showed Harris having a better chance of winning the election between August 4 and August 27, although Trump's chances have been on the rise for a week. Last Wednesday, Harris and Trump's forecasts were relatively tied at 50.5 percent to 49.2 percent, respectively.This week's forecast gives Trump his greatest chance of winning reelection since Silver's model was launched on July 30, when he was given a 61.3 percent chance. At that time, Harris had a 38.1 percent chance of victory.Harris was given a higher probability of winning the popular vote in November, according to this week's forecast (58.9 percent chance compared to Trump's 41.1 percent chance). Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes in 2016 but beat then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by 74 electoral votes. The last Republican to win the popular vote in a presidential election was former President George W. Bush, who beat his Democratic opponent, John Kerry, by over 3 million votes.Silver's forecast shows Trump securing several key battleground states to reach the 270 electoral votes necessary to win in November, including Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and North Carolina. Michigan was left in a toss-up, with Trump given a 50.3 percent chance of winning compared to Harris' 49.7 percent chance. Wisconsin leaned slightly toward Harris, although the margins were tight (52.9 percent to 47.1 percent).Newsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment.Polling experts have warned that Harris' momentum may be a bit deceiving. Trump's chances were underestimated during polling in both 2016 and 2020, issues that one expert attributed to pollsters' issues with reaching the former president's voting base.\"One of the main issues is that Trump's base is harder to reach through traditional polling methods,\" Pew Research Center senior fellow Scott Keeter previously told Newsweek. \"Trump supporters tend to have lower levels of trust in institutions, including those conducting polls, which can skew results.\"Trump's former communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, said last month that he would caution Harris from being too confident in current polling numbers, noting that the former president tends to \"under poll.\"\"Now, she could have a breakout moment with more interviews. She could have a breakout moment in the September 10 debate,\" Scaramucci added during an appearance on Fox News. \"But if I'm her, if I'm on her campaign, I'm recommending she pushes very, very hard in [battleground states], because she could put him on the run.\"","summary":"Silver's latest election forecast shows Trump having a higher chance of securing the electoral college vote in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/nate-silver-election-model-shows-donald-trump-surging-1949000","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2464636/nate-silvers-election-model-trump-surges.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:57:44","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":255661876,"title":"Trump rakes in $130M for campaign in August ","text":"Former President Donald Trump raised $130 million last month, a haul built almost entirely by small-dollar donations, his campaign announced Wednesday. The August fundraising totals leave Trump, 78, with $295 million in cash on hand two months out from Election Day. “With Republicans united and a growing number of Independents and disaffected Democrats crossing partisan lines, the Trump-Vance campaign has momentum for the final stretch of the race,” Trump campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said in a statement. “These fundraising numbers from August are a reflection of that movement and will propel President Trump’s America First movement back to the White House so we can undo the terrible failures of Harris and Biden,” he added. The campaign noted that 98% of August donations were under $200, resulting in an average contribution of $56 “from everyday Americans.” Trump’s August haul was slightly less than the $138.7 million the campaign raised in July. The Republican nominee’s war chest is also smaller than the $327 million reported at the end of July, as campaigning has intensified in the final months of the 2024 race. The Trump campaign, as well as outside groups backing the former president, outspent Vice President Kamala Harris in four key swing states — Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina — between July 22 and Aug. 25, according to ad-tracking firm Ad Impact and NPR. The Harris campaign has not yet released its August fundraising numbers. Harris campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon announced last week that Harris had raised $540 million since she replaced President Biden, 81, at the top Democratic ticket in July, including $82 million earlier this month during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. “This is the most ever for any presidential campaign in this time span,” she said in a memo.

The data analyst and founder of FiveThirtyEight revealed Wednesday that his presidential race model now indicates that Trump has a 58.2% chance at winning the Electoral College in November compared to Harris’ 41.6% chance. “Trump’s chances of winning are his highest since July 30,” Silver wrote in his latest election forecast bulletin. “And the chance of an Electoral College-popular vote split working against Harris has risen to almost 18 percent.” Silver’s model predicts that Harris has a 58.9% chance at winning the national popular vote – which has no bearing on the winner of the race – but that Trump will rack up 274 Electoral College votes, topping the vice president’s 263 estimated Electoral College total. Two-hundred seventy Electoral College votes are needed to win the presidency. “There was a surge of enthusiasm for Harris post-Biden dropout, but that might have happened no matter what,” Silver noted on X. The pollster also argued that Harris tapping Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate over swing state Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shaprio, as well as keeping most of President Biden’s campaign team in place, may have been missteps. “Thought convention speech was good, but bypassing Shapiro beginning to look bad and they haven’t really found a 2nd gear after Hot Brat Summer,” he continued. In a separate tweet, Silver said, “I think I’d buy the bull case for Harris a bit more if she hadn’t rehired so many of the Biden people.” Overall Silver’s model still pegs the race as a “toss-up” between the two candidates. His analysis follows an ABC News/Ipsos poll released on Labor Day which showed Harris failed to get an anticipated bump in support following last month’s Democratic National Convention, leaving the 2024 horse race essentially unchanged.

Harris’s plan represents a departure from Biden’s budget proposal, which would raise the capital gains tax on individuals earning more than $1 million to 44.6 percent. The announcement was made days before Harris’s Sept. 10 debate with former President Donald Trump, who has cast his Democrat opponent’s economic plans as being bad for businesses. Currently, long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum of 20 percent, and high earners may be subject to an additional 3.8 percent net investment income tax, potentially raising the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains to 23.8 percent. “If you earn a million dollars a year or more, the tax rate on your long-term capital gains will be 28 percent under my plan,” Harris said, speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire. “We will tax capital gains at a rate that rewards investment in America’s innovators, founders, and small businesses.” It’s unclear whether the 28 percent figure that Harris has referenced constitutes the maximum tax rate, inclusive of other provisions, such as the net investment income tax. Under Biden’s budget proposal, a separate plan to increase the net investment income tax (NIIT) rate to 5 percent contributed to the overall 44.6 percent capital gains rate. If the same NIIT increase were applied to Harris’s proposal, the capital gains tax would jump to 33 percent. Harris’s remarks were delivered at Throwback Brewery in North Hampton, New Hampshire, where she also unveiled other economic policy proposals, including an increase in the tax deduction for startup costs from $5,000 to $50,000. Trump, has targeted the Democratic nominee’s economic policies as too left-wing. “The Harris–Walz tax plan calls for the largest tax hike in history, including a higher income tax, higher business taxes, higher investment taxes, an unrealized gains tax, and an expanded death tax—among others—all of which will hurt small businesses and their customers,” Trump’s campaign wrote in a statement to The Epoch Times. In the 2020 election, Trump promised to lower the top capital gains tax rate to 15 percent. In 2024, he has not announced any capital gains tax proposal. The Epoch Times has reached out to the campaign for further comment. Some tax watchdogs have criticized Harris’s capital gains tax proposals, saying they will reduce investments that small businesses rely upon to create jobs. “Under the Harris plan, the combined federal-state capital gains tax exceeds 50 percent in many states. California will face a combined federal-state rate of 57.8 percent, New Jersey 55.3 percent, Oregon at 54.5 percent, Minnesota at 54.4 percent, and New York state at 53.4 percent.” These types of changes also pose risks to capital markets, according to some experts. “U.S. benefits from having some of the most robust and deep capital markets in the world,” wrote Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at The Tax Foundation. “We need to be careful about unprecedented, untested policy changes that could compromise that or weaken that source of capital,” Watson noted, referring to Harris’s remarks and other proposals, such as the taxing of unrealized capital gains, advocated by Harris and Biden.","summary":"The suggested 28 percent rate is a reduction from the 44.6 percent proposed by Biden, although it still amounts to a tax increase for high income taxpayers.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-breaks-from-biden-in-plan-to-impose-lower-capital-gains-tax-hike-5718097","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/03/id5717310-GettyImages-2169371478-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:49:07","author":"Arjun Singh,Emel Akan","authors":["Arjun Singh","Emel Akan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":255662104,"title":"Why Trump is garnering support from the growing Christian nationalist movement","text":"Why Trump is garnering support from the growing Christian nationalist movement Lance Wallnau, a business consultant and a firebrand influencer in the growing Christian nationalist movement, gave a rare interview to CBS News about his efforts to promote former President Donald Trump among evangelicals.

And, in a strikingly similar turn of events, MyPillow is being accused of significant unpaid debts while its founder and CEO is accused of trying to skirt the subject. On Aug. 30, Extend, Inc. submitted an 11-page filing, inclusive of exhibits, with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs describe themselves as a “company that helps merchants offer customers shipping and product protection.” According to their lawsuit, MyPillow owes them $564,151.39. And the once-popular pillow company has allegedly been delinquent on those purported debts — in repeat fashion — for quite some time. “In November 2022, My Pillow and Extend entered into a contract under which Extend would provide My Pillow’s customers with certain shipping and product protection services in exchange for a percentage of revenues generated by the sale of those services,” the lawsuit reads. Well over a year passed, however, and certain debts owed to the San Francisco-based company remain unpaid, according to the lawsuit. “In March 2024, My Pillow was overdue on amounts it owed to Extend under the Agreement,” the original petition continues. “And so, on March 29, 2024, the parties entered into a Termination Agreement under which the Agreement was terminated.” At the time of the termination agreement, MyPillow allegedly agreed to pay down their debt in five separate increments and totals. This payback arrangement was supposed to have begun in April — with a $75,000 payment from MyPillow to Extend — and ended in June with a payment of some $53,000 plus “any additional amount due and owing under the Agreement related to the sale of Extend services during the month of March 2024,” according to the lawsuit. That nebulous “additional amount,” the lawsuit says, was later determined to equal upward of $110,000. And, the company claims, in early April they sent along a “spreadsheet detailing the transactions that account for the amounts shown on the invoice.” More time passed, the lawsuit says, and the efforts to collect went mostly nowhere — despite some alleged lip service from Lindell himself. The complaint details a series of debt collection efforts: In May 2024, after My Pillow failed to make any of the payments under the Termination Agreement, outside counsel for Extend sent a letter to My Pillow to demand payment.After repeated further inquiries, Mike Lindell, Chief Executive Officer of My Pillow, emailed on June 23, 2024 that he “[w]ill connect this week.” But Mr. Lindell did not connect, and never did.Further, My Pillow has ignored repeated inquiries and demand for payment since June 2024 and has not paid any of the amounts due under the Termination Agreement. Extend is suing MyPillow for breach of contract. Their lawsuit seeks compensatory damages, legal costs, and interest. On Tuesday, the court issued a summons to MyPillow and set a brief schedule: a statement on negotiations is due by Nov. 27, and an initial conference is currently slated for Dec. 4. In another long-running lawsuit, Lindell Management LLC has been repeatedly rebuked by the courts for its refusal to pay the winner of a “Prove Mike Wrong” challenge.

Despite severe doubts about his own abilities, Zeidman bested Lindell over false claims about election data. In March, a Minnesota county judge ruled against MyPillow in an eviction hearing — finding that the company owed over $200,000 in unpaid rent for a warehouse in Shakopee. In October 2023, Lindell himself confirmed that MyPillow had been “decimated” by the defamation lawsuits that Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic filed against several pro-Donald Trump figures who insisted the voting machine companies orchestrated a plot to hand the 2020 election to President Joe Biden. As a result of being one such voice, Lindell said, his company had “lost hundreds of millions of dollars.” Law&Crime reached out to Lindell for comment on the lawsuit filed in the Northern District of California, but no response was immediately forthcoming at the time of publication.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMike Lindell is seen showing his approval while walking by a gathering&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Lawsuit Filed Against MyPillow for More Than $560,000 by Shipping Company first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/lawsuit-filed-against-mypillow-for-more-than-560000-by-shipping-company/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MyPillow-sued-for-over-560K-by-product-shipping-company.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:46:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.806},{"id":255661632,"title":"Ex-GOP Rep.

The campaign launched \"Republicans for Harris\" last month, and several Republicans were featured at the Democratic National Convention. Cheney, who was first elected to Congress in 2016, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but she became one of his most vocal opponents after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. She was one of 10 Republicans to vote to impeach Trump in 2021 and was one of two Republican members who served on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. She referred to Trump’s actions on Jan. 6 as the “greatest betrayal” of a U.S. president. Her vocal opposition to Trump ultimately cost her a leadership role in the GOP conference. In 2022, she was ousted during her primary election by a Trump-backed opponent. Cheney is the latest high-profile Republican to publicly say she would vote for Harris. Last month's Democratic National Convention in Chicago featured a host of Republicans, including Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois who served alongside Cheney on the Jan. 6 committee, and Olivia Troye, a Trump administration official who broke with the former president over Jan. 6, saying they backed, in their words, country over party.","summary":"Cheney's remarks, which were shared by an attendee on social media, come as the Harris campaign is taking steps to court disenchanted Republican voters.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/04/nx-s1-5100968/liz-cheney-kamala-harris","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5768x3845+0+0/resize/5768x3845!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Fbf%2Fd30e82504790909830bff34ed2f2%2Fgettyimages-1853733964.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:44:29","author":"Barbara Sprunt","authors":["Barbara Sprunt"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.27},{"id":255661732,"title":"Tim Walz aims donut jibe at JD Vance on visit to Pennsylvania farmers’ market","text":"Tim Walz mocked rival JD Vance with a donut joke as he visited a farmers’ market in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.

On Wednesday, Walz visited Cherry Hill Orchards and Farm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in a state that will be crucial for Harris’s victory in November. “What am I looking at in a Whoopie Pie?” Walz asked the manager before getting in a crack at Vance. “I have no problem picking out doughnuts,” the Minnesota governor joked. Vance’s own donut experience has been used by Democrats to reinforce their “weird” characterization of the senator from Ohio. “I’m JD Vance, and I’m running for vice president,” the Republican candidate said to a member of staff after he walked into Holt’s Sweet Shop in Valdosta. “OK,” she responded uncomfortably before Vance’s team was asked to stop filming.

It turns out they are distant cousins. The photo shows eight smiling people wearing navy pro-Trump shirts, underneath a “Trump 2024 – Take America Back” sign. The photo was eventually reposted by former President Donald Trump, who wrote on his Truth Social platform: “It is a Great Honor to have your Endorsement. I look forward to meeting you soon!” The photo was first posted on X by Charles Herbster, a former candidate for governor in Nebraska who had Trump’s endorsement in the 2022 campaign. Herbster’s spokesperson, Rod Edwards, said the people in the photo are cousins to the Minnesota governor, who is now Kamala Harris’ running mate.

Herbster (@CWHerbster) September 4, 2024 “The family in the picture are the descendants of Francis Walz, who was brother to Tim Walz’s grandfather,” Edwards said. “They’re all Walzes and spouses.” The descendants of Francis Walz confirmed their relationship to Tim Walz in a text message to The Associated Press. “Shortly after Governor Tim Walz was named the Democrat Party Vice Presidential nominee, our family had a get-together. We had t-shirts made to show support for President Trump and J.D. Vance and took a group picture. That photo was shared with friends, and when we were asked for permission to post the picture, we agreed,” the statement said. “The picture is real. The shirts are real. We are the Nebraska Walz family and we are related to Gov. Tim Walz, our grandfathers were brothers. The message on the shirts speaks for itself, ‘Nebraska Walzs for Trump.’ ” Walz’s sister, Sandy Dietrich, of Alliance, Nebraska, said she suspected it might be people from that branch of the family. Dietrich and Walz’s father, James Walz, died of lung cancer in 1984 when the future congressman and Minnesota governor was just a teenager. His father had been the school superintendent in Valentine, Nebraska. “We weren’t close with them. We didn’t know them,” she said. Dietrich declined to comment on their distant cousins’ opposition to her brother and referred to herself and her family as “Democrats for Tim.” “I know who I’m voting for. That’s all I can control,” she said. But Tim Walz’s other surviving sibling is not behind his candidacy. In recent days, the New York Post has reported on Facebook comments from the governor’s older brother, Jeff Walz, of Freeport, Florida, in which he said of his younger sibling: “The stories I could tell. Not the type of character you want making decisions about your future.” The 67-year-old also wrote that he was “100% opposed to all his ideology” and had thought about endorsing Trump, the Post reported. In comments published Wednesday by NewsNation, Jeff Walz said that he was still irked he learned on the radio that his brother would be Harris’ running mate but that he didn’t intend to influence the political debate and doesn’t want to be involved with anybody’s campaign. Jeff Walz told NewsNation that he and the 60-year-old governor have not spoken since the funeral of their younger brother, Craig Walz, in 2016, aside from a brief phone call last month through their mother. He told NewsNation that what he was referring to in his post by “stories” were from their childhood. “Nobody wanted to sit with him, because he had car sickness and would always throw up on us, that sort of thing,” Jeff Walz said. “There’s really nothing else hidden behind there. People are assuming something else. There’s other stories like that, but I think that probably gives you the gist of it.” He also told NewsNation that he would make no further statements on the subject, and he did not return messages left Wednesday by the AP.

In today’s edition, national political reporter Bridget Bowman breaks down what the post-Labor Day flood of House ads tell us about the broader political environment. Plus, chief political analyst Chuck Todd examines how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are trying to portray each other as the incumbent in the 2024 race. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. 3 key 2024 trends, as told by the battle for the House By Bridget Bowman The presidential race has been raging for months, but many House campaigns save their resources for the final stretch before unloading their money on the issues that they most want to highlight. That’s happening right now, with a wave of new TV ads hitting battleground districts around Labor Day. And what’s happening in the House speaks volumes about the political environment that will also decide the presidential election. Here are three big takeaways: 1. Harris and Trump are largely absent from the House campaigns right now. An NBC News analysis of nearly 150 broadcast TV ads that aired over the last week in the 44 most competitive House districts identified by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter found no Democratic ads name-checked Donald Trump and just four GOP ads directly referenced or showed Kamala Harris. It’s hard to imagine that would be the case if Joe Biden hadn’t dropped out of the race. 2. Cost of living is paramount, especially among Republicans. The high cost of living remains top of mind for voters, and the issue has been dominating House races, with nearly a quarter of ads referencing the issue. Around 40% of recent GOP ads have focused on cost of living, compared with around 16% of Democratic spots. Republicans view this issue as a salient one for the party up and down the ballot, with voters in recent polling giving Trump higher marks on the economy than Harris. 3. Democratic attacks on abortion are largely going unanswered, while GOP attacks on the border are prompting a response. Democrats are going on offense on abortion access, echoing a key argument from the Harris campaign. Abortion was the top issue across Democratic spots, referenced in 30% of the party’s ads in the last week. Just two Republicans launched ads over the last week on those issues. While Republicans have launched attacks on border security, more Democrats have responded to those missives, with about 20% of Democratic ads mentioning the issue. It echoes Harris’ decision to go up with a border ad within weeks of becoming the Democratic presidential candidate, after Biden didn’t run a single TV ad on the border during his 2024 campaign. How Gen Z voters are viewing the Harris-Trump matchup By Stephanie Perry and Marc Trussler A new NBC News Stay Tuned Gen Z Poll, powered by SurveyMonkey, shows that Harris has opened up a lead over Trump with young voters, but is lagging behind Biden’s 2020 margins with the critical bloc. Half of registered voters under 30 said they supported Harris, compared with 34% for Trump. One in 10 respondents said they will not vote in the presidential election, while 6% said they backed another candidate. Harris is backed by 60% of young voters who say they’re almost certain that they will cast a ballot this fall. That figure pulls in line with the 60% of 18- to 29-year-olds won by Biden four years ago, according to NBC News exit poll results. Gender gap: Young women said they’re going to vote for Harris by 30 points. Young men also said they favor Harris, but by only 4 points over Trump. Education gap: Harris led Trump among college graduates (56% to 30%) and currently enrolled college students (54% to 29%). Support between the two candidates is tied at 41% among young voters without a college degree who are not currently enrolled in school. On the issues: Three in 10 voters under 30 said inflation and cost of living is the most important problem facing the country, followed by threats to democracy (11%) and abortion (9%). Harris and Trump try to paint each other as the incumbent By Chuck Todd How do you hold a change election — when the two candidates are a sitting vice president and the most recent former president? That question may mask itself as a riddle, but who voters decide is “the incumbent” is easily the single most important question if you are trying to figure out who is going to win the 2024 election. In short, the candidate who loses will likely be the one that a majority of swing voters view as more “incumbent-like” in their minds. And the debate next week will go a long way in establishing that, depending on how well the candidates do at painting the other as part of the current problem. There’s an obvious reason why both campaigns are furiously trying to cast the other as the incumbent: The electorate is grumpy and has been for just about the entire 21st century. When you step back and examine the U.S. voters’ take on whether the country is headed in the right direction or off on the wrong track, the country has basically been on the side of “wrong track” for nearly two decades — call it a massive and generation-long political recession. And our presidential and midterm election outcomes in that time have indicated that a majority of said electorate was looking for change. Only two national elections in this century — 2004 and 2012 — did not see a flip of one of the following three Washington power centers: the White House, which has changed partisan hands three times (2008, 2016 and 2020); the Senate four times (2002, 2006, 2014 and 2020); and the House four times (2006, 2010, 2018 and 2022). Both candidates are and should be having a hard time making the case for change simply due to their current and former jobs. That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

AB 2918 is designed to address valid concerns about some aspects of mandated high school ethnic studies courses. It has been delayed to next year’s legislative session to allow more time to work with opponents. According to Assemblyman Zbur, “We don’t have the same level of review and guardrails (for ethnic studies) that are generally put in place for other kinds of curriculum that we bring into the classroom in the state of California.” He also noted that “There are cases that are popping up around the state where we’re seeing curriculum that is just clearly inappropriate.” AB 2918 would require schools to submit a detailed explanation if they choose to develop a course differing from the state model curriculum to ensure that the school’s curriculum meets state requirements for students. There is no “apparent pro-Israel bias” in ensuring that ethnic studies curriculum is fair and inclusive for all students. Julia Lutch Davis Legislature sets back justice reform effort Justice reform took a small loss when our California Legislature decided against moving SB 94, a Senate bill that was going to help inmates sentenced to life without parole in California get a chance at parole board hearings. Once again we who are sentenced to life without parole suffer the injustice of serving a death sentence that doesn’t get recognized as such. Death by prison is a real thing. To give a man no incentive, yet ask him to be a model inmate is an oxymoron. Everyone deserves a second chance at life. I’ve been in prison for nearly three decades for crimes that occurred when I was 18 years old. Don’t I as a youth offender deserve a second chance? I have completely changed my life. Yet I do not get the same opportunity as other youth offenders, due to my sentence to life without parole.

It is long past time for the East Bay Times to stop spewing the right-wing bleating of Marc Thiessen. Thiessen, a former partner of convicted criminals Paul Manafort and Roger Stone and former mouthpiece of racist Jessie Helms. Now, here he is spewing complete falsehoods about inflation while ignoring the thousands of American deaths directly attributable to Donald Trump’s narcissistic (“slow the testing down“) and buffoonish (injecting bleach) handling of the COVID pandemic. But, with regard to his dire historical warning to VP Kamala Harris, Thiessen would do well to remember the American “history” leading up to the election of our nation’s first Black president. And now we are poised to make new history with the first Black woman president, something causing his former boss Jesse Helms to roll over in his grave.

Whether Donald Trump is defiling the most sacred section of Arlington National Cemetery, committing felonies, attempting to overthrow the government or stealing confidential documents, the message is clear: Rules shouldn’t apply to Trump. Equal justice is just such a basic tenant of the United States, I don’t understand how his supporters can ignore it.

Unfortunately, a federal judge based in Rockford seems to have bought into that philosophy. In a decision released last Friday, Judge Iain D. Johnston, a Donald Trump appointee, said Illinois’ ban on concealed firearms on public transportation is unconstitutional. (The ban remains in effect until any appeals play out.) Johnston based his decision, in part, on the fact that the gun ban was not historically consistent with the Second Amendment of the Constitution, a standard set in a U.S. Supreme Court decision. But the gun ban could hardly have met the standard: The Second Amendment was written in the 18th century, an era when people used horses to get around, not the CTA, Metra or Pace. The firearms ban on public transportation came about because in 2012, Illinois was the only remaining state with an outright prohibition on concealed carry. But in a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated in an opinion written by then-Judge Richard Posner, that Illinois had to allow the concealed carrying of firearms. In dissent, Seventh Circuit Judge Ann Claire Williams, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote that “protecting the safety of its citizens is unquestionably a significant state interest” and that “when firearms are carried outside the home, the safety of a broader range of citizens is at issue. The risk of being injured or killed now extends to strangers, law enforcement personnel, and other private citizens who happen to be in the area.” Unfortunately, Williams was on the losing side of the vote. So after the court ruling, the Legislature hashed out a concealed carry law that went into effect in 2013. In part, it banned concealed weapons from “any bus, train, or form of transportation paid for in whole or in part with public funds, and any building, real property, and parking area under the control of a public transportation facility paid for in whole or in part with public funds.” The lawmakers rightly believed that putting guns in the hands of amateurs in confined spaces was not, to put it mildly, a particularly good idea. For anyone horrified by the level of gun violence in America, the goal should be to keep finding ways to reduce the omnipresence of guns. Instead, the appeals court decided to chip away at protections that had been negotiated in the Legislature more than a decade ago. Licensed gun owners can still pose a risk During the debates over Illinois’ concealed carry law, and since then, some people have argued that no one knows how many people illegally carry guns on public transit and that concealed-carry license holders, who must have 16 hours of training, are not a threat and need guns to protect themselves. But back in 2016, the Illinois Concealed Carry Licensing Review Board granted concealed-carry permits 82% of the time even when Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart objected, as he is allowed to do under the law, because he thought the applicants posed a risk. Presumably, many of those people walking around today with concealed-carry permits would be permitted to hop aboard public transit if Judge Johnston’s ruling becomes the final law. One of those who received a concealed-carry permit despite Dart’s objection at the time had two arrests for unlawful use of a weapon, a violation of an order of protection and a domestic battery case. Widespread possession of guns severely erodes domestic tranquility, a guiding principle noted in the Constitution’s preamble, in our nation. The evidence is clear, for anyone willing to see it: On Wednesday, at least four people were killed and nine others were wounded and hospitalized in a shooting at a Georgia high school. Early Monday, four people were fatally shot on the CTA’s Blue Line in Forest Park. As of Wednesday afternoon, there were 385 mass shootings nationwide this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. More guns means more shootings. Many innocent victims have learned that lesson. It’s time the courts did, too. The Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds. See our guidelines. Send letters to letters@suntimes.com Get Opinions content delivered to your inbox.

A pool of 100 potential jurors will be parsed in efforts to find a panel to decide the guilt or innocence of President Joe Biden’s son, who faces nine tax-related counts, including three felonies and six misdemeanor counts of failing to pay more than $1.4 million in taxes. Hunter Biden, 54, of Malibu, “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,” the indictment alleges. Defense lawyers say they believe the case was brought “in direct response to political pressure,” according to filings in Los Angeles federal court. Hunter Biden’s attorneys said the defendant has repaid the government $2 million in back taxes and penalties. He is charged with evading a tax assessment, failing to file and pay taxes, and filing a false or fraudulent tax return. TODAY: Hunter Biden’s tax trial carries less political weight but heavy emotional toll for the president There are no reported indications the sides are close to a plea agreement. The trial is expected to last two weeks, with opening statements anticipated Monday in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, an appointee of former President Donald Trump. Evidence of the younger Biden’s partying during a period when he was admittedly using crack cocaine and allegedly willfully failing to pay more than $1.4 million in taxes may become part of the trial, federal prosecutors indicated. Scarsi previously rejected Hunter Biden’s bid to toss the case after the defendant sought to argue that David Weiss, the special counsel overseeing the prosecution, was improperly appointed. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Biden’s request to revive a bid to have the charges against him dismissed. Regarding the tax charges, the 56-page indictment alleges that between 2016 and Oct. 15, 2020, “the defendant spent this money on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature, in short, everything but his taxes.” Hunter Biden’s defense attorney, veteran Los Angeles criminal lawyer Mark Geragos, unsuccessfully petitioned the court to allow testimony that the death of the defendant’s mother and sister in a 1972 car crash and the death of his brother from cancer in 2015 caused him to ignore his tax obligations. This is Hunter Biden’s second federal criminal case of 2024. In June, the president’s son was convicted of three felony charges in a separate case brought in Delaware stemming from his 2018 purchase of a gun. Hunter Biden was found guilty of having lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs — when, in fact, he later admitted to having been addicted to illegal narcotics at the time. Court papers show Hunter Biden is scheduled to be sentenced in the Delaware gun case on Nov. 13, in the week after the presidential election. Described in the indictment as a Georgetown- and Yale-educated lawyer, lobbyist, consultant and businessperson, Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate and a Chinese private equity fund during the time of the tax allegations. “He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements for business and legal services that paid millions of dollars of compensation to him and/or his domestic corporations, Owasco PC and Owasco LLC,” according to the indictment for tax evasion. In addition to his business interests, the defendant was an employee of a multinational law firm, the document states. Hunter Biden has said he had forgotten to pay his taxes during a period when he was in the grip of drug addiction.","summary":"A pool of 100 potential jurors will be parsed in the trial of President Joe Biden's son on nine tax-related counts.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/09/04/hunter-biden-jury-selection-begins-thursday-in-la-federal-courthouse/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24163469744961.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:28:22","author":"City News Service","authors":["City News Service"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.454},{"id":255661166,"title":"Sheriff from Georgia delivers heartfelt speech following tragic shooting at Apalachee High School, resulting in four fatalities","text":"Sheriff Jud Smith of Barrow County has reacted with horror to the shooting at Apalachee High School in Georgia, calling the event an act of ‘pure evil.’ Authorities identified Colt Gray, a 14-year-old student at the school, as the shooter who killed two students and two teachers. Nine victims were taken to hospitals with gunshot injuries, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. ‘My heart hurts for these kids, my heart hurts for this community, but I want to make it very clear that hate will not prevail in this county,’ Sheriff Smith during a press conference on Wednesday. ‘Love will prevail over what happened today, I assure you of that.’ Smith said he was born and raised in the county and was once a student in the Barrow County School System, which includes Apalachee High School. ‘My kids go to this school system. I’m proud of this school system,’ he said. The high school, which is home to around 1,900 students, is in the town of Winder, about 25 miles west of Athens. Smith didn’t speculate on the motive of the shooter, nor did he mention him by name in his short address to the media. It’s been revealed that Gray will be charged with murder and will be tried as an adult. ‘I don’t know why it happened. I may not ever know. We may not ever know, but I ask that you and our community lift up our schools, lift up our public safety and that again we do not let this hateful event prevail.’ He thanked Georgia Governor Brian Kemp for offering support, as well as the myriad of state, local and federal agencies that helped in the response to the shooting. ‘They prevented a lot more tragic events from happening,’ he said. Smith also confirmed that the school resource officer engaged with the shooter, who eventually surrendered to police. ‘The shooter quickly realized that if he did not give up that it would end with an OIS, or an officer-involved-shooting. He gave up, got on the ground and the deputy took him into custody,’ he said. Smith repeatedly said the investigation was in its early stages, and wasn’t able to answer a question about how the shooter obtained his gun, nor did he identify the type of weapon he used. He added that authorities don’t know that Gray had any specific targets. He also didn’t confirm whether Gray had a connection to any of the victims. More information should come to light soon though, as Smith revealed that the shooter has been interviewed by police and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. So far, the only victim that has been identified is special education math teacher David Phenix, who survived but was rushed to hospital after being shot in the hip and foot. Phenix’s daughter, Katie, revealed on Wednesday that he ‘arrived to the hospital alert and awake’ and was rushed straight into surgery. ‘He just got out of surgery and is stable,’ she said. Phenix, who has been a teacher for 22 years, had intended to retire in 2023 but decided to stay when offered the chance to coach golf. Before the sheriff’s office received the first reports of a shooting at around 10:20am ET, the high school received a threat via phone, CNN reported. The caller reportedly claimed there would be shootings at five schools and that Apalachee would be first. Authorities said there were no other shootings besides the one at Apalachee and will investigate the source of this call. Governor Kemp said he was ‘heartbroken’ by the shooting, adding that his office will ‘continue to work closely with local, state and federal partners to make any and all resources available to help this community on this incredibly difficult day and the days to come.’ The candidates for president have also addressed the heinous crime, with Vice President Kamala Harris calling it a ‘senseless tragedy.’ ‘We have to end this epidemic of gun violence in our country once and for all. It doesn’t have to be this way,’ she added. Former President Donald Trump called the shooter a ‘deranged monster.’ ‘Our hearts are with the victims and loved ones of those affected by the tragic event in Winder, GA. These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a sick and deranged monster,’ he wrote on Truth Social.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSheriff Jud Smith of Barrow County has reacted with horror to the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Sheriff from Georgia delivers heartfelt speech following tragic shooting at Apalachee High School, resulting in four fatalities first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/sheriff-from-georgia-delivers-heartfelt-speech-following-tragic-shooting-at-apalachee-high-school-resulting-in-four-fatalities/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Georgia-sheriff-gives-emotional-speech-after-Apalachee.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:26:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.497},{"id":255661272,"title":"Harris campaign agrees to muted mics in debate against Trump","text":"Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign was unable to sway ABC News, the host of next week's presidential debate, to keep the microphones unmuted for the 90-minute debate against former President Donald Trump. Her campaign agreed to let the microphones remain muted when a candidate isn't speaking, according to a letter it sent to ABC News, ending the back-and-forth over the rules for the Sept. 10 debate. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones,\" said the letter, which was obtained by CBS News. The Harris campaign also told CBS News it was offered assurances as to how any crosstalk may be handled. The microphones may be unmuted if there is significant crosstalk between the candidates. A candidate who constantly interrupts their opponent will be warned by the moderator and their comments may be relayed to the audience. And, if the microphones don't pick up the exchanges, a group of reporters who will be in the room would report anything noteworthy. \"Notwithstanding our concerns, we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format,\" the letter read. \"We do not want to jeopardize the debate. For this reason, we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.\" The Biden campaign had requested that the candidates' microphones be muted when their opponent was speaking during the match-up between President Biden and Trump in June, which was hosted by CNN. Trump's campaign opposed changing the rules for the September debate. \"We agreed to the same rules. I don't know, doesn't matter to me,\" Trump said Aug. 26 while campaigning in Virginia. \"I'd rather have it probably on, but the agreement was that it would be the same as it was last time. In that case, it was muted. I didn't like it the last time but it worked out fine.\"","summary":"A candidate's microphone will be muted when it's their opponent's turn to answer a question.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harris-trump-debate-muted-mics-rules/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/04/31746cb7-b8ed-428f-9a99-be06513b1bb5/thumbnail/1200x630g2/03fabd5fbfce1112ed163c78dccc2e6f/screenshot-2024-08-03-at-9-57-05-pm.png?v=631cf5f2b4e8db7f9bc428589402864d","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3167476_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:20:53","author":"Caitlin Yilek,Ed O'keefe","authors":["Caitlin Yilek","Ed O'keefe"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":255661924,"title":"Trump’s tough talk on crime is taking a major hit. Here’s why.","text":"Former President Donald Trump and much of the GOP have staked their 2024 electoral hopes on convincing voters that Democrats are willfully allowing violent criminals to roam the streets. In doing that, they’ve frequently deployed the racist “Willie Horton strategy” — in essence, cherry-picking stories of gruesome crimes, particularly crimes committed by immigrants — to suggest Dems don’t care about keeping Americans safe. Getting voters to believe this, coming from Trump of all people, was always going to require that they ignore the irony. On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump stoked violence against fellow Americans, and he’s promised to free the people involved if elected. He’s not a credible voice when it comes to crime. On Tuesday’s episode of The ReidOut, Joy spoke with Judd Legum, the reporter who broke a story on Jaime Davidson, a convicted cop-killer and drug dealer whose sentence Trump commuted on the last day of his term. Davidson, who was convicted of murder for coordinating the fatal, armed robbery of a New York undercover officer in 1990, was released by Trump, but convicted of domestic abuse earlier this year and handed a three-month sentence in July. (He's appealing the conviction.) Legum’s report explains the peculiar circumstances surrounding Davidson’s release: Davidson’s release also got support from Alice Johnson, a formerly incarcerated woman whose sentence Trump commuted after Kim Kardashian drew the Trump White House’s attention to her case. Another person granted clemency under Trump now stands accused of a violent crime. Jonathan Braun, a convicted drug kingpin and violent loan shark, was also released via last-minute commutation by Trump in 2021. Braun was arrested last month and is facing charges in New York over claims he assaulted his wife and father-in-law on various occasions in July and August. He pleaded not guilty and his attorney told CNBC he’d address the claims in court. As The New York Times reported, the circumstances around Trump’s commutation of Braun were “troubling.” The move came after Braun’s family made inroads with the Trump family through their connections to Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared. And the commutation reportedly disrupted a major federal probe into predatory lending that Braun was expected to assist. According to the Times' reporting, the younger Kushner played a “major role in the less structured vetting process” that led to Braun’s commutation. The commutation announcement for Braun ironically mentions his plans to support the wife he’s now accused of assaulting. Trump's administration circumvented the normal processes to release people that are known to be violent, only for them to commit violent crimes — allegedly, in Braun’s case — yet again. This provides a window into how Trump could abuse the commutation process in the future. But unlike when such claims are lobbed at liberals, I don’t expect these stories to get wall-to-wall coverage in conservative media. In fact, Trump’s campaign gave a rather milquetoast statement in response to Legum’s reporting, “President Trump believes anyone convicted of a crime should spend time behind bars.” For a variety of reasons, it's an wholly unbelievable claim.","summary":"Trump and the GOP attack Democrats as soft on violent criminals.

Harris spoke Wednesday at a brewery south of Portsmouth on a stage protected on three sides by bullet-proof glass, an apparent first for her, while Trump too used such reinforced protection during a recent outdoor event.Harris, who has revived Democratic hopes with just 61 days until the November 5 vote, unveiled proposed tax breaks for small businesses as she fleshed out her economic policy.In a rare break with Biden, she proposed a 28 percent tax rate on capital gains, lower than the 39.6 percent planned by the president, in her latest attempt to appeal to centrist voters. \"We know when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth, and it creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger,\" Harris said.Team Trump meanwhile blasted the plans, saying in a statement that Harris's various proposals would lead to tax hikes \"on almost 26 million small businesspeople in America.\"Trump himself participated in a pre-recorded town hall event that airs at 9:00 pm (0100 GMT Thursday) on conservative-leaning Fox News in Pennsylvania.The appearance came after the Republican's notable campaign trail absence over the US Labor Day weekend, traditionally the start of the final sprint.Then on Tuesday, millions of American voters will finally see Harris and Trump do battle in-person during their debate on primetime television.\"She's had her honeymoon period. People are learning who she is,\" Trump told a local New Hampshire radio station Wednesday. \"We can't go another four years with a dumb president.\"Harris, 59, has upended the race since Biden dramatically quit as the Democratic candidate after the 81-year-old's disastrous performance in a debate against Trump exacerbated fears about his age and mental acuity.America's first female, Black and South Asian vice president has swiftly erased Trump's poll lead and forced the ex-president and convicted felon to rethink his campaign.Despite his unprecedented attempt to overturn the 2020 election -- culminating in a mob of supporters storming the US Capitol -- 78-year-old Trump retains passionate support on the right.He faces a new challenge with Harris. A CNN poll released Wednesday showed the race remains nail-bitingly close in six key battleground states likely decide the presidency.Harris holds the edge against Trump over likely voters in the \"Rust Belt\" states of Wisconsin and Michigan, by 50 percent to 44 percent, and 48 percent to 43 percent respectively. Trump meanwhile has the edge in Arizona by 49 percent to 44 percent.But the race is essentially tied in three other states -- most critically in Pennsylvania, the biggest swing state prize in terms of votes in the US electoral college system.Biden won all six states when he defeated Trump in 2020.The findings come a day after a USA Today/Suffolk University poll found Harris leading Trump 48 percent to 43 percent -- with double-digit gains with crucial groups including Hispanic and Black voters and younger people.Harris got a boost of sorts Wednesday from Republican quarters when former congresswoman Liz Cheney, an arch conservative and never-Trumper, endorsed the Democrat for president.\"Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump but I will be voting for Kamala Harris,\" Cheney told a gathering at Duke University, in videos posted to social media.On the economic front, the American steel industry was rocked by a report that President Joe Biden plans to block a deal selling US Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel.The American firm warned it could shut factories in Pennsylvania.Harris travels to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Thursday, while Trump is slated to hold a rally Saturday in swing state Wisconsin.","summary":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump returned to the US campaign trail Wednesday, with new polls showing the White House race remains on a knife-edge less than a week before their crucial first debate.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/harris-trump-hit-campaign-trail-debate-looms-1851240","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1858746/kamala-harris-donald-trump-are-both-hitting-campaign-trail.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:18:12","author":"Joseph Prezioso, With Danny Kemp In Washington","authors":["Joseph Prezioso, With Danny Kemp In Washington"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.179},{"id":255661928,"title":"Fellow Muslims keep asking me why I support Kamala Harris. Here’s what I say.","text":"The first Muslims to arrive in what became the United States of America were Black like me. They were brought here via the trans-Atlantic slave trade. These enslaved Africans were faithful Muslims praying in the U.S. colonies before Thomas Jefferson was even born. And they suffered, as all enslaved Africans suffered, through genocide and brutal and deadly oppression. Although there’s a mistaken belief that Muslims first arrived en masse in the United States with an influx of Arab and Pakistani immigrants in the 1960s, the history of Black Muslims, who were here before there was a country, is a reminder that while we may share the same faith as Muslims from the Middle East and South Asia, we have a different experience of America. These Black Muslim ancestors left rich histories and a legacy of fighting for what’s right. I am proud to have carried on this legacy throughout my career, most recently by founding the Black Muslim Leadership Council — a first-of-its-kind nonprofit dedicated to advancing justice and equity for Black American Muslims through policy advocacy, civic education, voter mobilization and leadership development. Our advocacy wing, the Black Muslim Leadership Council Fund, has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, and I, in my personal capacity, am doing the same. Despite my consistent calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, and despite my history of working with the Palestinian community in my native Philadelphia, my support of the vice president’s candidacy has led to accusations that I am ignoring the human rights catastrophe in Gaza and undermining the Palestinian cause. Despite my leadership in the Uncommitted Pennsylvania campaign, which led to more than 60,000 voters using the write-in vote to protest President Joe Biden’s leadership; and despite my directly telling President Biden about the history of solidarity between Black Americans and Palestinians and the moral dilemma his candidacy presented, I have been repeatedly asked by other Muslims to defend my vote for Harris. My parents converted to Islam in the early 1970s, finding a safe haven and a home alongside other Black American Muslims in a country that so often tried to reject them. This community is now my haven. My Pennsylvanian Muslim family is my foundation, and serving them is my way of life. Every day, I see the struggles facing my people, and I see the courage and resolve it takes to overcome and thrive. Despite so many advancements, my community still suffers significant oppression. I have been harassed, targeted and doxxed by people throughout the country — including by other Muslims. My support of Vice President Harris has been attacked, as many have chosen not to support Harris, seeing her as an extension of President Biden, who has been widely criticized for his handling of the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. My goal in my career is to advance policy for the American Muslim community at large, but with a focus on Black American Muslims. I will continue to focus on the nuanced needs of my specific community because, in large part, no one else is focusing on us. This is how I honor the legacy of my father, a prominent imam who devoted his life to serving this same community. While I share many of the same goals and concerns as other American Muslims, I also am specifically dedicated to uplifting the needs of the Black American Muslim community. My community cares deeply about the crisis in Gaza, as well as the suffering of Muslims in Sudan and its Darfur region, Congo, Yemen, Syria, Kashmir and China. We care about reproductive rights, particularly for people who have experienced sexual abuse, and for women who have died during childbirth — especially Black women, who die at much higher rates than other women in the United States. We care about economic opportunity, including the paths to establish generational wealth, which have for so long been denied to Black people, including Black Muslims. We care about public safety and ending the rampant gun violence that has led to the deaths of so many people, especially Black men. Harris is the candidate who has most effectively supported the causes that are important to my community. Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, has shown in his track record and on the campaign trail that he will not support these causes. I have heard from many who say they’ll vote third-party to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, or who say they will not vote at all. As tantalizing as some of these third-party candidates may be, they are not a viable option. Other third-party candidates have deeply problematic and even dangerous stances on international relations, health care and immigration. Not voting is not an option either. The threat that faces our country, and our world, is too great not to use the greatest gift of democracy: our vote. In its purest essence, politics is about strategy. This sometimes means having to make tough choices to achieve the best possible outcome for ourselves and our community. It would be nice to agree with each and every one of our chosen candidate’s decisions and platforms. But we do not have to do this to keep our democracy alive. We have, on one hand, a candidate who fights for voter rights, reproductive rights and public safety. On the other, we have a candidate who seeks to consolidate power, threaten our constitutional freedoms and implement policies reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. We have a candidate who, as a Black and South Asian woman, understands personally the oppression faced by the most neglected of us and has overcome adversity to rise to a position of power, and we have a candidate who moved to ban Muslims from entering the country, has called majority Black nations, many of them with large Muslim populations, “s---hole countries,” and who bases his campaign on sowing division and hatred. As I have already done, I will continue to advocate for the innocent people who are being killed in Gaza, as well as advocate for the other domestic needs of my community. I will also continue to tell Muslims asking me to defend my vote for Harris that I see her as not only the best chance for a cease-fire, but also the best chance we have to protect fundamental freedoms — for every one of us. In this decision, and in my personal and professional career, I stand on the shoulders of the great Black American Muslim women and men who came before me — who fought through unspeakable traumas to build a better life for their descendants. I am proud to be part of this legacy. The fight continues now, as it has for centuries — and it will take each one of us committing to defending our freedoms to ensure that we will not go back.

Harris, who noted there are only 62 days until the November 5th general election, was in North Hampton at Throwback Brewery when she made the announcement. According to the vice president, her plan would open entrepreneurship to those currently excluded by the high cost of starting a new business. “Now, I’m setting what I think some are going to call a very ambitious goal. But, you know what? I think we should admire ambition in each other,” she said. “So I want to see 25 million new small businesses applications by the end of my first term.” Harris would accomplish this, she said, by lowering the cost of building a new enterprise. Right now, the vice president said, it costs about $40,000 to get the average small business off the ground, but that cost is only offset by a $5,000 tax deduction. “That is a great financial barrier for a lot of folks, and it can hold entrepreneurs back,” she said. “Not everyone has access to that kind of wealth.” Harris’ plan, she said, would increase that tax deduction tenfold. “We will expand the tax deduction for start ups to $50,000,” she said. “It’s essentially a tax cut for starting a small business.” Under a Harris-Walz administration, the government would also provide “low and no interest loans” to small businesses “that want to expand” and “cut the red tape that can make starting and growing a small business more difficult than it needs to be.” “We will make it cheaper and easier for small businesses to file their taxes, similar to how individuals can take a standard deduction,” she said. “Let’s just take away some of the bureaucracy.” According to Harris, the change would open opportunities to a new pool of American talent currently kept on the sidelines by their lack of wealth. “It’s not that they don’t have the skills, it’s not that they don’t have the work ethic, it’s access to these resources,” she said. Harris’ plan would require the support of Congress, which is responsible for adjusting the tax code. According to former President Donald Trump’s campaign, New Hampshire voters should not be fooled by Harris’ turn toward the small business community. “If Kamala wanted to help small businesses, why hasn’t she done it during her four years as vice president? Why has Kamala proudly supported Bidenomics, which has caused historic inflation and record-high energy costs for small businesses, minimizing their profit margins and threatening their livelihood?” Trump’s team said in a release.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise campaign stop in New Hampshire to announce a new policy proposal on Wednesday, when she laid out an “ambitious\" plan to get millions of small businesses started.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/04/kamala-harris-hits-new-hampshire-to-unveil-ambitious-small-business-plan/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/malanl010.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:08:58","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.354},{"id":255661420,"title":"Harris accepts rules for Sept. 10 debate with Trump on ABC, including microphone muting","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted the rules set forth for next week’s debate with former President Donald Trump, although the Democratic nominee says the decision not to keep both candidates’ microphones live throughout the matchup will be to her disadvantage. The development, which came Wednesday by way of a letter from Harris’ campaign to host network ABC News, seemed to mark a conclusion to the debate over microphone muting, which had for a time threatened to derail the Sept. 10 presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. President Joe Biden’s campaign had made the muting of microphones, except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak, a condition of his decision to accept any debates this year. Some aides have said they now regret that decision, saying voters were shielded from hearing Trump’s outbursts during the June debate. A disastrous performance for the incumbent Democrat fueled his exit from the campaign. Once Harris rose in Biden’s stead and became their party’s pick for president, her campaign had advocated for live microphones for the whole debate, saying previously that the practice would “fully allow for substantive exchanges between the candidates.” But on Wednesday, in a letter obtained by The Associated Press, Harris’ advisers wrote that the former prosecutor will be “fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President.” “We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign’s insistence on muted microphones,” her campaign added. Despite those concerns, Harris’ campaign wrote, “we understand that Donald Trump is a risk to skip the debate altogether, as he has threatened to do previously, if we do not accede to his preferred format.” So as not to “jeopardize the debate,” Harris’ campaign wrote, “we accepted the full set of rules proposed by ABC, including muted microphones.” According to an official with Harris’ campaign, a pool of journalists will be on hand to hear what the muted candidate may be trying to say when his or her microphone is turned off. That detail was not in the full debate rules, also released Wednesday by ABC, which are essentially the same as they were for the June debate between Trump and Biden. The network laid out parameters from the basic format — 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks — to specifications that moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis “will be the only people asking questions,” perhaps hoping to avert a free-for-all between the candidates. “Moderators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a civilized discussion,” the network noted. The Harris campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss planning around the debate, said a candidate who repeatedly interrupts will receive a warning from a moderator, and both candidates’ microphones may be unmuted if there is significant crosstalk so the audience can understand what’s happening. After a virtual coin flip held Tuesday and won by Trump, the GOP nominee opted to offer the final closing statement, while Harris chose the podium on the right side of viewers’ screens. There will be no audience, written notes or any topics or questions shared with campaigns or candidates in advance, the network said. ___ AP White House Correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted the rules set forth for next week&#8217;s debate with former President Donald Trump, although the Democratic nominee says the decision not to keep both candidates&#8217; microphones live throughout the matchup will be to her disadvantage.

The decision would be a rare rejection of a proposal from a major company in Japan, a key U.S. ally. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have both voiced opposition to the takeover plan without providing a detailed rationale, as votes from blue-collar workers have become critical for the U.S. presidential election in November. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Financial Times said the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States told Nippon Steel recently that the planned acquisition posed national security concerns that could not be mitigated by the two producers. The Washington Post reported Biden is planning to announce that he will formally block the Japanese steelmaker's proposed buyout. Without confirming those reports, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said the committee's ongoing review of the case is \"incredibly independent\" and it \"hasn't transmitted a recommendation yet to the president and that's the next step in this process.\" She also told a press briefing that Biden and Harris are \"committed to ensuring steel is made in America.\" The committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, is in charge of examining certain foreign investment transactions in U.S. firms and determining whether they pose national security threats. Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-largest producer, and U.S. Steel, the 24th-largest, announced the $14.1 billion acquisition deal in December. U.S. Steel and its shareholders are in favor of the takeover, which would make it more competitive globally and create the world's third-largest steelmaker by volume. But the powerful United Steelworkers union -- which has endorsed Harris for president after Biden's withdrawal from the race against Republican nominee Donald Trump -- is strongly opposed to the deal, dragging the two private companies into political controversy. Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, said at a Labor Day campaign rally in Pittsburgh on Monday that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned and operated. Her first reference to the planned acquisition since launching her presidential campaign was in sync with Biden, who has said multiple times this year that the company should remain in American hands. \"It is vital for our nation to maintain strong American steel companies,\" Harris told the crowd at the rally. \"I couldn't agree more with President Biden...and I will always have the back of America's steelworkers and all of America's workers.\" U.S. Steel, founded in 1901, and the labor union are both headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the Nov. 5 election. In response to Harris' remarks, Nippon Steel said it is confident that the envisaged acquisition will \"revitalize the American steel rust belt\" and \"benefit American workers, local communities and national security in a way no other alternative can.\" On Wednesday, the Japanese company made an additional announcement, saying that U.S. citizens will still make up the majority of board members and core senior management of U.S. Steel following the close of the pending acquisition. \"We want elected leaders and other key decision makers to recognize the benefits of the deal as well as the unavoidable consequences if the deal fails,\" a U.S. Steel statement released separately quoted its president and CEO, David Burritt, as saying. Without realizing the tie-up, it said, \"U.S. Steel will largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist, and depriving the American steel industry of an opportunity to better compete on the global stage.\" It added that losing the deal with the Japanese company would also raise serious doubts about the iconic company remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh.

The Democrats’ official August figures are yet to be released by the Harris campaign. Both sides are bombarding battleground states with television ads. The Harris campaign had said last month that the campaign and the Democratic Party’s main fundraising group had raised a combined $310 million in July. President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid on July 21 and endorsed Harris in the Nov. 5 election. Biden’s withdrawal from the race came amid questions about his age and health after a halting debate performance against Trump in late June. The ascension of Harris has re-energized a Democratic campaign that harbored doubts about Biden’s chances. Polls showed that Trump had built a lead over Biden, including in battleground states, but Harris’ entry has tightened the polls.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign and his party raised $130 million in August, ending that month with $295 million cash on hand, the campaign said in a statement today.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/04/breaking-news/trump-campaign-says-it-raised-130-million-in-august/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_20240904_brk_tru01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-04 23:00:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.613},{"id":255660670,"title":"Liz Cheney Says She Will Vote for Harris in Presidential Election","text":"Former Rep.

Both are based in Russia and remain at large. The Tennessee company produced nearly 2,000 videos on topics like immigration and inflation that have been viewed 16 million times on YouTube since last November, according to the Justice Department. In one instance, Afanasyeva told the company to provide a video that blamed Ukraine and the United States for a terrorist attack on a Moscow music venue, the Justice Department said. The indictment does not name the Tennessee company or charge any of its executives with wrongdoing. However, it alleges that the company failed to disclose that it was funded by RT and its executives never registered with the Justice Department that they were acting as agents of a foreign government. The Justice Department has previously warned that Russia remains a threat in the election and appears to be favouring Republican Donald Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris. US intelligence assessments found that Moscow tried to help Trump in 2016 when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, and in 2020 when he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Moscow has denied the allegations. On social media, Trump repeated his accusation that the Justice Department is working to defeat him in the election. Justice Department officials say Russian President Vladimir Putin and his proxies have adopted increasingly sophisticated techniques, targeting specific groups of voters and those in battleground states, and are now using bot farms and artificial intelligence. The FBI last month searched the homes of two Americans with ties to Russian state media, including former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter and Dimitri Simes, an adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign. The US government has also accused Iran of attempting to influence the upcoming election through cyber operations against both the Trump and Harris campaigns.

Harris’ team was originally pushing to not have their mics muted. “We believe both candidates’ mics should be live throughout the full broadcast,” Brian Fallon, the Harris campaign’s senior adviser for communications, said in a statement on Aug. 26. He added that Trump’s handlers preferred the muting approach since, as he put it, they “don’t think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.” Jason Miller, senior adviser for Trump, told Politico at the time that the Vice President was “looking for a way to get out of any debate with President Trump.” Next week’s debate will be 90 minutes long with two commercial breaks and will be moderated by ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis. Other notable points include: • Trump won the virtual coin toss on Tuesday and chose to offer the last closing statement. Meanwhile, Harris selected the right podium position on screen (stage left). • Candidates will be introduced by the moderators and, as the incumbent party, Harris will be introduced first. • There will be opening statements and closing statements will be limited to two minutes per candidate. • The moderators will be the only people asking questions and candidates are not permitted to ask each other questions. • Candidates will stand behind podiums for the duration of the debate, ostensibly to avoid a “he’s right behind her” situation that occurred during the podium-free 2016 event with Trump and then-rival Hillary Clinton or the wandering that took place in a 2000 debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore. • Props or prewritten notes are not allowed onstage, but candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. • No topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates. • Candidates will have two-minute answers to questions, two-minute rebuttals, and one extra minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. • Candidates’ microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate. • Campaign staff may not interact with candidates during commercial breaks. • Moderators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a “civilized” discussion. • There will be no audience in the room.

A spokesperson for his 2024 campaign commented this week on reports of a Trump clemency recipient being convicted of a domestic violence-related charge by saying, \"President Trump believes anyone convicted of a crime should spend time behind bars.” The statement from Trump’s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, to The New York Times was in response to a new conviction of Jaime A. Davidson, whose sentence Trump commuted in 2021. Trump was convicted in May by a Manhattan jury on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18. Leavitt and another campaign spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about Trump's view on jail time for convicts as it relates to his own conviction. Trump has long sought to portray his New York conviction and other pending trials as witch hunts. On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected Trump's bid to transfer the New York hush money case to federal court. Trump's legal team is also asking the judge who presided over the case, Juan Merchan, to delay the sentencing until after the Nov. 5 presidential election. Merchan is set to rule on the matter Sept. 16, two days before the sentencing hearing. Trump has been charged in other cases — two involving election interference allegations and one focused on classified documents. He has pleaded not guilty in each case.","summary":"Trump was convicted this year in his New York hush money case.

He also pledged to name a woman as his VP. Harris officially became the Democratic nominee for president during a virtual roll call last month and then formally accepted the candidacy during the party’s convention in Chicago. She is the first black and South Asian female vice president in US history. Supreme Court justices are generally expected to steer clear of politics, but Jackson kept her focus trained on Harris hitting the milestone as the Democratic nominee. “I’m a first, not because I’m the first person who could ever do this job, right? But because our times have changed. Our society has changed,” Jackson went on. The 53-year-old liberal justice has been on a media tour to promote her memoir “Lovely One,” which tells the story of her upbringing and how she ascended to the highest court in the land. During her media itinerary, Jackson has carefully navigated politically charged questions about the Supreme Court. “I am confident that the courts will faithfully uphold the law, because that is our duty,” she replied when asked if she had confidence in the Supreme Court’s ability to navigate potential 2024 election cases. Jackson also waded in on controversy surrounding whether or not the Supreme Court should have a stricter ethical code. Last year, the high court rolled out a non-binding ethics code, but critics have argued it should adopt something with more teeth to it. “The question is, [how] is that going to play out? We’re still pretty early in the process,” Jackson maintained. “I guess I think about all of this as democracy at work, public engagement, these ideas of reforms, are the kinds of things that have been around since the beginning of our Republic.” Last term, the Supreme Court’s most high profile case was its decision on former President Donald Trump’s request for absolute presidential immunity. Ultimately, the high court concluded that presidents enjoy “absolute” immunity for official acts, but left key questions unanswered about the division between official and personal acts. It also remanded the challenge against Trump’s 2020 election supervision indictment back to the lower courts. Jackson dissented in the immunity decision, which was handed down by the high court’s conservative majority. “The majority instead decided that, no, we’re going to essentially create a new system for presidents, former presidents that is such that they are not subject to the law under certain circumstances,” she said. “They are immune from even being asked about or prosecuted for certain criminal activity, and I just thought that seemed like it was inconsistent, at least, with my view of our constitutional norms.” The Supreme Court’s next term is slated to commence in October.","summary":"Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson claimed Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris becoming the first black and South Asian female to lock down the Democratic nod gives people \"hope.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/us-news/justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-says-harris-nomination-gives-a-lot-of-people-hope/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/88945676-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4XA1EP7Z-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-04 22:46:52","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.089},{"id":255660084,"title":"9 years after closure, Exide plant in Vernon proposed as Superfund site by EPA","text":"The shuttered Exide Technologies in Vernon, responsible for a swath of lead and arsenic contamination stretching 1.7 miles in southeast Los Angeles County communities, is scheduled to be a Superfund site, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday, Sept. 4. Placing the heavily-polluted, former lead-acid battery recycling plant on the National Priorities List of Superfund sites would prioritize federal funds for permanent cleanup of the abandoned facility, as well as continued removal of toxic chemicals from thousands of nearby properties, authorities said. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) estimates lead, arsenic and cadmium released by Exide during its decades of operation contaminated parks, schools and nearly 10,000 homes in the largely working-class Latino neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles, Maywood, Huntington Park and Commerce. So far, the state has committed $700 million and cleaned up nearly half the affected homes. “When finalized, the listing will provide access to federal funding and resources that EPA will utilize to take a more comprehensive approach to the contamination in the community,” said EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Martha Guzman in a prepared statement. The proposal will be brought before the public for comments from Sept. 5 until Nov. 4. Comments can be submitted online at www.regulations.gov and search docket number EPA-HQ-OLEM-2024-0376. Written comments can be mailed to: U.S. EPA, EPA Docket Center Superfund (EPA-HQ-OLEM-2024-0376), Mail Code 28221T, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC, 20460. After the comments are reviewed, the EPA is expected to add Exide to the list of the most heavily polluted sites in America in the spring, said Michael Brogan, EPA spokesperson on Wednesday. “We are almost there with this one. It is trending in the right direction,” said Brogan. He said the relentless political pressure from the California Congressional delegation, Gov. Gavin Newsom and California EPA has moved this proposal forward, ever since the state kickstarted the process in July 2022 and EPA responded by pursuing rulemaking. “There has been a lot of collaboration with the feds and with the state on this,” Brogan added. Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has represented the entire area for years and more recently East LA after redistricting. Solis, of the First District, who has fought for decades to expedite cleanup to make the area safer for residents, called it “a sore spot in the community” and a matter of upholding environmental justice. She believes the designation will be finalized and new federal dollars could be used to finish the work started by the state and LA County. “We still have another 5,000 homes to be cleaned up,” she said on Wednesday in an interview. “And the obligation to clean up the site — that hasn’t been touched.” Exide closed its doors in 2015 as part of a nonprosecution agreement that allowed the company to avoid criminal charges. The lead battery recycling facility had operated for about 90 years at 2700 South Indiana Street. In 2020, Exide filed for bankruptcy and a federal court and the Department of Justice allowed Exide to abandon the property without fulfilling the terms of the agreement, which required the company to demolish and clean up the shuttered facility. Solis, who worked as President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Labor, blamed President Donald Trump for the DOJ agreement that left much cleanup work undone since 2020. The pending listing as a Superfund site will re-start remediation, she said. “It is a big victory for the Biden-Harris administration,” she added. Solis led people who lost loved ones to cancer, and those whose children tested positive for lead in their bodies to testify before committees on pollution and environmental justice in Sacramento, she said. “These toxins do grave damage to one’s system,” she added. A study by USC in May 2019 found twice as much lead in the baby teeth of children near the facility as those in a similar study in Boston. Soil samples from 8,000 properties collected by DTSC found the median concentration of lead in soil was 190 parts per million, well above the state threshold of 80 parts per million. Lead exposure can lead to developmental disabilities, cancer and other long-term health effects. “We are really being harmed by the lack of cleanup,” Solis said. The Superfund has 1,339 sites, where historic releases of hazardous pollutants or contaminants pose health threats to people and the environment, according to the EPA statement and its website. In California, there are 96 sites on the list, according to the EPA Superfund website. These include: Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, San Diego County; Del Amo, Southern L.A. County; George Air Force Base, Victorville; Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA), Pasadena; Montrose Chemical Corp., Torrance; Norton Air Force Base, San Bernardino; Omega Chemical Corp, Whittier; Operating Industries, Inc. Landfill, Monterey Park; Pemaco, Maywood; ground water basins in the San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley; Waste Disposal, Inc. Santa Fe Springs.

What Happened: The spark of controversy ignited when Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, took to X (formerly Twitter) to endorse an interview featuring Carlson and Darryl Cooper, host of The MartyrMade Podcast. Musk wrote, “Very interesting. Worth watching,” drawing attention to the interview. Carlson had introduced Cooper as possibly “the best and most honest popular historian in the United States,” noting that Cooper’s latest project delves into what Carlson termed “the most forbidden of all: trying to understand World War Two.” Cuban, entrepreneur and part-owner of the Dallas Mavericks, responded to Musk’s endorsement with a simple yet pointed message: “Delete your account.” Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. The interview between Carlson and Cooper covered a wide range of controversial topics. They discussed the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict and delved into World War II, including an assessment of former U.K. Prime Minister Churchill. The conversation also touched on how history is rewritten and propagandized, a topic that often generates intense debate in academic and political circles. Furthermore, Carlson and Cooper explored contemporary issues such as mass immigration in Europe and the Civil Rights Movement, drawing parallels to the Black Lives Matter movement. They also shared their views on several prominent political figures, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and former U.S. President Donald Trump.

Why It Matters: In August, Musk sent Carlson a Tesla Cybertruck to review, which Carlson used for stunts, including shooting at the vehicle. The tension between Cuban and Musk is not new. Recently, Cuban raised concerns about a discrepancy in a poll on X, suggesting Musk could influence the platform’s algorithm. This incident further fueled the ongoing friction between the two billionaires. Additionally, Musk’s response to Cuban’s poll debacle, where he commented on the “tenacity of his stupidity,” added another layer to their public feud. Despite the criticism, Cuban continues to post on X, stating he values the platform for its diversity of opinions. Read Next: How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you?

Liz Cheney says she'll vote for Democrat Kamala Harris for president","text":"Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney on Wednesday said she would support Kamala Harris for president, ending weeks of speculation about how fully the member of a GOP dynasty-turned-Trump critic would embrace the Democratic ticket. Cheney, who co-chaired the House investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, became a fierce Trump critic and was ousted in her 2022 Republican primary in Wyoming as a result, made her announcement at an event at Duke University. In a video posted on the social media network X, she finished by talking about the “danger” she believed Trump still poses to the country. “I don’t believe that we have the luxury of writing in candidates’ names, particularly in swing states,” she said. “As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this. Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.” The daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney has been perhaps Trump's highest-profile Republican critic. She joins other Republicans like her former Jan. 6 committee member, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Rep. Denver Riggleman, as backers of Harris. More than 200 alumni of the Bush administration and former Republican presidential campaigns of the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney also announced their endorsement of Harris last week. Cheney was in House Republican leadership at the time of the Jan. 6 attack but broke with most of her caucus over Trump's responsibility. She lost her leadership post and was one of the few Republicans willing to serve on the Jan. 6 committee, which was appointed by Democrats who controlled the House at the time.","summary":"Former Republican Rep.
