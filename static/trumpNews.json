The cause: untreated hyperbilirubinemia. Both identified as religious and, despite noticing the newborn was ill, chose not to take him to a doctor and prayed for recovery instead. The case occurred in Ohio, and during the hearing the judge found the baby had a 99% chance of survival if he had received medical care.\n\nIn that same U.S., in 2025 measles rates are the highest since the country eradicated the disease. There have been more than 1,300 cases since the start of the year, most of them in the state of Texas, which accounts for 3 out of every 4 reported infections.\n\nThe above are just two examples, among many, that should alert us to narratives that question not only vaccines but science in general—an even bigger problem when authorities repeat those claims.\n\nOne example is Donald Trump, whose message is echoed in Chile by right-wing figures Kast and Kaiser: he says climate change “is a hoax,” and he recently claimed that acetaminophen use during pregnancy causes autism in babies—an assertion thoroughly dismissed by medical science.\n\nScientific denialism by authorities or political representatives, and the spread of their extreme rhetoric across society, poses a serious risk that must be addressed in time. From Chile, University of Chile epidemiologist and academic María Paz Bertoglia reminds us that anti-vaccine groups “bear significant responsibility for the rise in these diseases” and reiterates that “now, through social media, this false information has greater reach.”\n\nAs a proposal, she and other researchers and scientists have called for a large-scale campaign—especially on social media, where anti-vaccine groups are active. What’s needed is to provide answers to people with reasonable doubts, but, as Professor Bertoglia notes, “we have to give people a real sense of the risk: when you don’t vaccinate your child, you put them at risk of getting sick and dying.”\n\nIn Chile, public policy on this issue follows a different path from the U.S. One example is that, for the second consecutive year, the country recorded no deaths among infants under 1 year old due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which emerges during the winter season. A key factor in this achievement was vaccination and effective management of the immunization schedule.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, moving the influenza vaccination start date up to March 1 marked a turning point in the prevention strategy, achieving 77.78% coverage with more than 8.1 million doses administered. The strategy also resulted in a 62% reduction in RSV hospitalizations compared with 2023 and a 45% decrease in the activation of pediatric critical-care beds year over year.\n\nAll of this was made possible by the use of the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab via a vaccine-like injection, which was acquired for Chile by President Gabriel Boric’s government in 2024 and integrated into the National Immunization Program, which is entirely free of charge.\n\nThe strengthening of Public Health in Chile is also reflected in the latest Budget Law presented by the Executive, which increases the Health allocation by 900 billion pesos—bringing the total increase to more than 30% over President Boric’s four-year term.\n\nWith this, among other measures, the country will make the largest investment in the Explicit Health Guarantees (GES) system since its creation in 2004, adding coverage for a very high-cost cystic fibrosis medication and inpatient treatment for severe depression and suicide risk among children under 15.\n\nThese are valuable social policies aimed at delivering life and well-being—countering those who treat them as mere expenses and seek to further squeeze public health and the public system with massive cuts they still cannot explain how or where they would implement.\n\nThat is why it’s necessary to stress that the contrasting realities experienced by thousands of people in the U.S. and in Chile are a direct consequence of the policies and rhetoric their respective governments adopt. Let this column serve to show the concrete effects of an administration that rejects science and questions even its most basic findings, versus another that trusts the value of knowledge and medicine as tools to benefit the population across the country.\n\nBy Paula Rosso, psychologist and regional councilor for Valparaíso.-\n\nEl Ciudadano","summary":"El Ciudadano\n\n\nBy Paula Rosso, psychologist and regional councilor for Valparaíso.- A few weeks ago in the United States, a couple was convicted over the death of their baby just 2 days after birth.

Speaking ahead of the annual Albies awards ceremony in London — an event he and his wife Amal Clooney founded to honour global human rights defenders — the actor said the President's concern about jobs leaving California was justified but misplaced in its remedy. \"Trump's take that movie industry jobs are leaving California is true,\" Clooney said. \"But that's because we don't have proper tax incentives or rebates like you do in New York.\" He added that a better solution would be to strengthen domestic support for the industry rather than penalising international productions. \"If he wants to implement a federal incentive that would match the kinds of incentives we get in Louisiana and New Jersey and New York, then I think that would make a big difference in helping out,\" Clooney said. President Trump announced earlier this week that he plans to impose 100% tariffs on all films produced overseas, claiming that foreign-made movies are undermining America's film industry. If implemented, it would mark the first time the United States has applied tariffs on cross-border delivery of entertainment services. Also Read: Trump's Tariffs on Films - Bollywood, Hollywood, Who All Will Be Hit In a post on social media platform Truth Social, Trump said: \"Our movie making business has been stolen from the United States of America, by other Countries, just like stealing candy from a baby.\" The move would extend Trump's protectionist trade agenda into cultural industries, creating new uncertainty for major studios that rely heavily on international co-productions and box-office revenue from global audiences. Industry analysts say the measure could have wide-ranging effects, as most films today are produced and distributed digitally through platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+. While these services are largely based in the US, their content is often created through international partnerships. The US film industry recorded a $15.3 billion trade surplus in 2023, backed by $22.6 billion in exports to international markets, according to data from the Motion Picture Association. Studio executives have expressed confusion about how such a tariff could be implemented, given that modern film production involves complex global supply chains — from visual effects teams in Canada and the UK to post-production facilities in Asia. \"It's not clear how a movie tariff would even work,\" one studio executive told news agency Reuters earlier this year, noting that many projects blend production, financing and creative work across several countries. A coalition of American film unions and guilds had earlier written to the White House urging the administration to focus on domestic tax incentives rather than punitive tariffs. The group argued that encouraging productions to return to US states through fiscal measures would be a more effective way to protect industry jobs. Critics now fear that a sweeping tariff could harm the thousands of American workers employed on overseas film projects whose work often depends on international collaboration.

A draft design shows US President Donald Trump with his fist raised under an American flag, along with the words “Fight, Fight, Fight.” Those words recall what Trump shouted after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania last year. US Treasurer Brandon Beach revealed the draft design on X, writing that the coins are “real” and will honor the nation’s semi-quincentennial. He added that more details will be shared once the ongoing partial government shutdown ends. Law Allows 250th-Anniversary Coins The idea of a 250th-anniversary coin is not new. In 2020, Trump signed a bipartisan law allowing $1 coins to be issued in 2026 to commemorate the country’s independence. One side of the draft coin shows Trump’s profile next to the words “Liberty,” “In God We Trust,” and “1776-2026.” The other side highlights the assassination attempt, showing Trump’s raised fist with the American flag, as per The Guardian report. The Treasury Department later clarified that the design posted online is only a draft, not the final version. Still, it said the design represents “the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.” Trump, now in his second term as president, has faced falling approval ratings. His administration has been criticized for cutting healthcare protections and food assistance, increasing tariffs that raised consumer prices, and reducing funding for vaccines.

Also representing the coalition are Democracy Forward, Justice Action Center, Kuck Baxter LLC, Joseph & Hall, P.C., and IMMpact Litigation.\n\nThey are suing President Donald Trump and the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and State, accusing them of illegally usurping the power of Congress, and the department of exceeding its authority and violating its own rules on making changes to visa programs.\n\n“The government failed to consider how extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation,” the lawsuit filed in Northern California U.S. District Court said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the President’s actions were legal, and accused the plaintiffs of habitually filing frivolous lawsuits.\n\n“President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas,” Jackson said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKalpana Peddibhotla, executive director of the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, said the fee threatens workers and their families, along with the financial and social wellbeing of communities.\n\n“South Asians make up the majority of H-1B workers and are part of the fabric of America, staffing rural hospitals, advancing lifesaving research, and driving innovation in businesses across the country,” Peddibhotla said.\n\nTrump last month signed a proclamation imposing the fee, which went into effect Sept. 21.\n\nThe H-1B visa, long a flashpoint in America’s immigration debate, pits Big Tech, along with the industry’s investors and the staffing firms supplying foreign workers to it, against critics who point to the alleged replacement of U.S. workers and undercutting of wages.\n\nEarlier this year, the controversy burst into angry political battles after a conservative influencer attacked employment of Indian tech workers in the U.S., leading to schisms among Trump supporters, who include anti-immigrant factions and influential tech-industry figures in his administration. Among Democrats, Big Tech donors have faced off against organized labor over the visa.\n\nRecently, the visa has faced bi-partisan criticism over hiring of H-1B workers by companies also laying off employees.\n\nThe visa is intended for skilled foreign workers, but research indicates many who hold it are paid less than typical wages in their fields. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the time of Trump’s proclamation that, “no longer will you put trainees on an H-1B visa … if you’re going to train people, you’re going to train Americans.” Companies wanting a “very sophisticated engineer” can pay the fee, Lutnick said.\n\nSome 600,000 foreign workers in the U.S. hold the visa, including large numbers in the Bay Area. Each year, 85,000 new H-1B visas are issued by lottery.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the fee order as unconstitutional and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act and asks the court to nullify the new fee requirement. It said the visa supports immigrants in launching new businesses that create jobs. Educators and healthcare workers make up a tenth of H-1B holders, and the U.S. “faces a projected shortfall of nearly 86,000 physicians in the next decade,” while nurses are also in short supply, and K-12 schools need the visa to fill empty jobs, the lawsuit argued.\n\nPlaintiffs include Global Nurse Force, Global Village Academy Collaborative, Society of the Divine Word, the Fathers of St. Charles, Church on the Hill, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW International), UAW Local 4811, American Association of University Professors, Committee of Interns and Residents, Service Employees International Union.

He will also be under five years’ supervised release after his time in prison is served.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Arun Subramanian said “a history of good works can’t wash away the record in this case, which shows that you abused the power and control over the lives of women who you professed to love.”\n\n“You were no john,” he added. “You were more than that, even if your currency was satisfying your sexual desires instead of money.”\n\nSubramanian said a substantial sentence is required “to send a message to abusers and victims alike that exploitation and violence against women is met with real accountability.”\n\nFederal prosecutors had asked that Combs, 55, be sentenced to at least 11 years and three months in prison. Comb’s lawyers urged the judge to sentence him to no longer than 14 months, which would have resulted in his near-immediate release, as he has already served nearly 13 months in a Brooklyn jail.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Combs’ six children crowded around the podium, imploring the judge to give their father a second chance.\n\nQuincy Brown, the 34-year-old son of Kim Porter, who was adopted by Combs, shared that his father “has learned a lesson.” The family had seen him evolve, Brown said, and “he is completely transformed.”\n\n“My father is my superhero. Seeing him broken down and stripped of everything is something I will never forget,” said another son, Justin Combs, 31.\n\nChance Combs, his eldest daughter, told the judge that while her father was been incarcerated, she saw changes in him that “feel real and lasting.”\n\n“When we talk he speaks with a clear mind and sense of purpose that I didn’t always hear before,” she added.\n\n“I know how hard it was to stand up here and tell me those things, but it’s important for me to hear,” Subramanian said to them.\n\nAfter an emotional series of statements from the children, Combs’ legal team presented an 11-minute tribute video that featured clips showcasing the rapper’s philanthropic efforts, motivational speeches, home videos and scenes of him mourning his late partner Porter, who died in 2018.\n\nWhile addressing the judge, Combs thanked Subramanian for “giving me the chance to finally speak up for myself,” as the former rapper did not testify during his trial.\n\n“One of the hardest things that I’ve had to handle is having to be quiet. Not being able to express how sorry I am for my actions,” Combs said in his statement to the court.\n\n“I want to personally apologize again to Cassie Ventura for any harm or hurt that I’ve caused her – emotionally or physically,” he added.\n\nCombs called his conduct “disgusting, shameful and sick.”\n\n“Because of my decisions, I lost my freedom, I lost the opportunity to effectively raise my children and be there for my mother,” Combs said. “I lost all my businesses, I lost my career, I totally destroyed my reputation.”\n\nCombs said that he’s “lost my self-respect” and he has been “humbled and broken to my core.”\n\n“I hate myself right now. I got stripped down to nothing,” Combs said. “I want to apologize to my seven children. Y’all deserve better.”\n\nThe sentencing marks the conclusion of the disgraced hip-hop mogul’s New York trial, which began on May 5.\n\nIn a letter to Subramanian ahead of his sentencing, Combs proclaimed himself to be a new man after realizing that he was “broken to my core.”\n\n“Over the past year there have been so many times that I wanted to give up. There have been some days I thought I would be better off dead. The old me died in jail and a new version of me was reborn. Prison will change you or kill you — I choose to live,” he said.\n\nCombs admitted that he had “no one to blame for my current reality and situation but myself.”\n\n“In my life, I have made many mistakes, but I am no longer running from them,” he wrote. “I am so sorry for the hurt that I caused, but I understand that the mere words ‘I’m sorry’ will never be good enough as these words alone cannot erase the pain from the past.”\n\nHe went on to apologize for hitting, kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 — an attack captured on security camera.\n\n“The scene and images of me assaulting Cassie play over and over in my head daily,” Combs wrote. “I literally lost my mind. I was dead wrong for putting my hands on the woman that I loved. I’m sorry for that and always will be.”\n\nRather than make an example out of him with a lengthy sentence, Combs asked Subramanian to “make me an example of what a person can do if afforded a second chance.”\n\nThe charges: What led to Combs’ sentencing?\n\nCombs has been behind bars since his September 2024 arrest. He faced federal charges of coercing girlfriends into having drug-fuelled sex marathons with male sex workers while he watched and filmed them.\n\nCombs had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers argued that prosecutors were trying to criminalize Combs’ swinger lifestyle and that, if anything, his conduct amounted to domestic violence, not federal felonies.\n\nIn July, Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution, including the transportation of Ventura to engage in prostitution. He was also found guilty of the transportation of former girlfriend “Jane” for the same purposes.\n\nThe Bad Boy Records founder was acquitted in July of the top charges — racketeering and sex trafficking. The defence won three acquittals after he was found not guilty of running a criminal enterprise and two counts of sex trafficking.\n\nIn all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs’ former girlfriends Ventura and “Jane,” who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he was often violent toward them. Ventura said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers, while Jane recounted numerous “hotel nights.”\n\nAfter the verdict was read, Combs’ lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked the court to release Combs from federal detention now that he is no longer charged with sex trafficking.\n\nCombs’ legal team attempts to secure his freedom\n\nCombs was denied bail after a jury convicted him of federal prostitution-related offences in July.\n\nJudge Subramanian noted Combs’ violent history: “At trial, the defence conceded the defendant’s violence in his personal relationships, saying it happened with Cassie and Jane.”\n\nAgnifilo asked that Combs be released on conditional bail to his home in Miami, and offered a US$1-million bond. Prosecutor Maurene Comey countered, saying to Subramanian that Combs should remain in jail until sentencing.\n\nLater that same month, lawyers for Combs asked a judge to release him on a $50-million bond as he awaited sentencing.\n\nAgnifilo said conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn were “dangerous,” and said defendants convicted in the past of prostitution-related charges that were similar to Combs’ were typically released before their sentencing.\n\nHe argued that the court should release Combs “on reasonable conditions” in advance of sentencing. The lawyer claimed that Combs “is not a risk of flight nor is he a danger to the community or to any specific people.”\n\nAgnifilo said that if Combs was released on conditions, he “will not be violent to anyone.”\n\nCombs’ lawyer also added a proposed bail package for the rapper with conditions including “a $50-million bond secured by Mr. Combs’ home in Miami,” which would also be co-signed by three “financially responsible people.”\n\nThe judge denied bail for Combs a second time.\n\nHis lawyers revealed they even reached out to U.S. President Donald Trump seeking a pardon following his conviction.\n\nA source close to Combs’ legal team confirmed to NBC News that they had been in contact with the Trump administration.\n\nThis came after Nicole Westmoreland, a member of Combs’ defence team, told CNN in an exclusive interview that the music mogul’s team had reached out to Trump for a potential pardon.\n\nIn early August, Trump told Newsmax that Combs’ lawyers have “talked to me about Sean” but said he was unlikely to pardon the music mogul.\n\n“I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” Trump said.\n\nWhen Trump was asked if granting Combs clemency was more likely a “no,” he said, “I would say so.”\n\nLast month, lawyers for Combs urged a judge to sentence him to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction. In a written submission, Combs’ legal team said he had already been punished enough.\n\nThey said their client is a “changed man,” who had realized that his overuse of drugs had contributed to violent acts he participated in.\n\nWhat’s next for Combs?\n\nCombs was denied acquittal and a new trial on Tuesday, the judge rejecting his lawyers’ argument that he was an amateur pornographer — not engaging in prostitution — and that the guilty verdict violates his First Amendment rights.\n\n“The government proved its case many times over. That by itself might be enough to dispose of Combs’s challenge,” Subramanian wrote in the 16-page opinion and order.\n\n“Illegal activity can’t be laundered into constitutionally protected activity.”\n\nHe called Combs’ filming “incidental,” pointing to trial evidence that showed he didn’t typically give notice or ask for consent for filming, as a film producer would.\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"Sean “Diddy” Combs has been sentenced to just over 4 years in prison, three months after he was found guilty of two counts of prostitution.

'You can disagree with someone, and still love them.

It drives innovation and economic growth in the US, and allows employers to fill jobs in specialised fields, the lawsuit said.\n“Without relief, hospitals will lose medical staff, churches will lose pastors, classrooms will lose teachers, and industries across the country risk losing key innovators,” Democracy Forward Foundation and Justice Action Centre said in a press release. “The suit asks the court to immediately block the order and restore predictability for employers and workers.” They called the new fee “Trump’s latest anti-immigration power grab.” Messages seeking comment from the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection, which are named as defendants along with Trump and the State Department, were not immediately returned.\nThe H-1B visa program was created by Congress to attract high-skilled workers to fill jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. About a third of H-1B workers are nurses, teachers, physicians, scholars, priests and pastors, according to the lawsuit.\nCritics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as USD 60,000 annually, well below the USD 100,000-plus salaries typically paid to US technology workers.\nHistorically, H-1B visas have been doled out through a lottery. This year, Seattle-based Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.\nThe USD 100,000 fee will discourage the best and brightest minds from bringing life-saving research to the U.S., said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors.\nMike Miller, Region 6 Director of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, said Trump’s plan “prioritizes wealth and connections over scientific acumen and diligence.” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, contends the “exorbitant fee” invites corruption and is illegal. Congress created the program and Trump can’t rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by executive order, the groups said.

If the administration were to send in the Army division, it would almost certainly be challenged in court under federal laws limiting how the military can be used domestically. \n\nThe Trump administration ordered National Guard troops — not the 82nd Airborne — to Portland this week. The messages suggest that the once-extraordinary step of sending military troops into an American city has been normalized within the administration, the subject of a chat in a public place. \n\nAnthony Salisbury, a deputy to White House top policy adviser Stephen Miller, sent the texts over the private messaging app Signal while traveling in Minnesota and in clear view of others. Troubled by seeing sensitive military planning discussed so openly, a source contacted the Star Tribune and allowed a reporter to review images of the texts. \n\nOver the course of several conversations, totaling dozens of messages, Salisbury chatted candidly, and at times profanely, about a wide range of matters with Hegseth’s adviser Patrick Weaver and other high-ranking federal officials. \n\nAccording to Weaver, Hegseth wanted Trump to expressly tell him to send troops into the American city. \n\n“Between you and I, I think Pete just wants the top cover from the boss if anything goes sideways with the troops there,” Weaver wrote. \n\nHe acknowledged the potential political ramification of deploying Army troops to a U.S. city.

Finally free he tells of jail hell - and his fear of revenge attacks","text":"Rhys McDonald’s nightmare began when he received a call at work from his mother one day in August 2024, telling him that the police had just spoken to her and wanted to see him urgently. He had no idea what this was likely to be about.\n\nWithin hours, officers had handcuffed him, taken him to his local station and locked him in a custody cell.\n\nIt was the 35-year-old’s first spell of incarceration – but the long months that lay ahead of him were set to be infinitely worse.\n\nIn his extraordinary prison ordeal, which he has never spoken about before, this mild-mannered father-of-one was spat at, received multiple death threats, racially abused for being white and repeatedly feared for his life as he was forced to lock himself in own his cell for up to ten days at a time.\n\nA mere two days after that fateful call from his devoted mother, Mr McDonald was in the magistrates’ court, still wearing his work clothes, on a charge of ‘publishing written material to stir up racial hatred’.\n\nThis, you will remember, was the febrile summer of mass protests following the sickening murders in Southport of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, by Axel Rudakubana, a teenager born in Britain to Rwandan immigrants.\n\nProsecutors claimed that the subsequent disorder, during which hundreds were injured and looting and arson attacks took place across the country, was fuelled by misinformation on social media claiming that the killer was an illegal migrant. Keir Starmer promised swift prosecutions and warned that those ‘whipping up this action online’ would ‘regret taking part’.\n\nSo what did Mr McDonald actually say? The court heard that his friend, Christopher Taggart, 37, had written on Facebook: ‘Who’s up for a rally?’\n\nMcDonald replied that they needed to march ‘with torches and pitchforks’, adding: ‘They need to protest at the hotels where these animals are living.’\n\nUndiplomatic language, certainly. But in the intemperate hours following an atrocity that had convulsed Britain, similar sentiments could probably be heard in pubs up and down the country. Many would insist, in any case, that Mr McDonald was hardly inciting violence – and that this was scarcely a matter for the law.\n\nHe also made clear in online posts: ‘It’s not about immigration, it’s about an ideology… Sadly due to uncontrolled immigration going on for more than 20 years, in some places this ideology is still embedded... It’s about radical Islam.’\n\nReferring to the ‘animals’ comment, this lifelong Tory voter, who has never attended a political march or been a member of a political party, tells me: ‘I wrote a stupid offensive message on social media – but I never incited anyone to attack anyone.’ He makes it clear he was not calling for people to literally march with pitchforks, insisting the phrase was a reference to an episode of The Simpsons cartoon, in which an angry mob chase Homer Simpson.\n\nNevertheless, with the Prime Minister himself urging the courts to throw the book at anyone and everyone, Mr McDonald’s lawyers advised him to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. ‘It all happened so quickly,’ he says.\n\nIn the event, this aircraft fitter, who had no criminal record, was dumbfounded to receive a 28-month sentence – more than two years – for that brief social media post.\n\nMr Taggart received 32 months – almost three years.\n\nNothing could prepare Mr McDonald for the fear and intimidation that awaited him in prison – a dystopian nightmare from which he is only just recovering.\n\nHe served a total of 50 weeks, but it was in his third jail, Stoke Heath in Shropshire, that his problems really began. The prison, which was built in 1964, was found in a recent report to be seriously overcrowded, with up to 784 inmates.\n\nAt Stoke Heath he quickly discovered a worrying fact. He tells me: ‘The authorities had moved me to a prison which appeared to have a dominant black and Asian population. Was it to teach me a lesson? Another punishment?’\n\nOther inmates soon discovered why Mr McDonald was inside. Not only were the prisoners’ names and photos on the doors of their cells, but he learnt that many of the black and ethnic-minority inmates had closely watched trials such as his, related to the Southport killings. They had even gathered newspaper cuttings and photographs of the likes of Mr McDonald.\n\n‘They were on to me,’ he says. One day when he was working in a prison workshop he looked up. A large inmate, who happened to be black, was staring at him.\n\nThis man then spat in Mr McDonald’s face, saying: ‘This is just the start of it. You have no idea what we do to racists.’\n\nHe then picked up on the prison grapevine that a group of inmates, all black and Asian and many of them Muslims, had decided to ‘do him in’ because of his conviction.\n\nHis voice cracking with emotion, Mr McDonald tells me: ‘To say I was scared is an understatement. I thought I was going to die. I locked myself in my cell for ten days and would not leave.’\n\nEach day his cell echoed to the relentless noise of fellow prisoners trying to kick the door down. They would slide open the observation hatch in the cell door to threaten him, shouting: ‘Racists must die! You are a marked man! We will stab you! Watch your back!’\n\nHe tells me: ‘It went on and on. They told me I was a white trash racist who had to be cut open.’\n\nThe prison staff began bringing his meals to his cell, pushed through a hatch so as not to unlock the door. ‘They told me not to provoke the situation and if I was attacked not to fight back because it would make matters worse. No one was helping me. I was a nervous wreck.’\n\nHe often cried himself to sleep worrying about his family and especially his son ten-year-old son Freddie. ‘I wondered if I’d ever see them again.’\n\nTipping the scales at 16st when he went into prison, when he left he was 3st lighter.\n\nAs the effective siege continued, the prison staff threatened to remove privileges such as his TV if he did not leave the cell during the ‘socialising period’.\n\n‘I said to a senior prison officer: “If I leave, I am going to get hammered [beaten up].” He said: “You should have thought about that before you were p***ing about in Southport.” I haven’t been to Southport since I was a schoolboy! The prison staff didn’t have a clue what I had actually done. They seemed to think I was one of the rioters burning cars.’\n\nEventually, with the help of some sympathetic warders, Mr McDonald managed to convince his fellow inmates that he was not a racist and that the social media posts that had put him in jail were about illegal migrants.\n\n‘I made the point some [illegal migrants] came from Somalia. Some came from Poland. It was not anti-black or brown.’\n\nWhen he eventually came out of his cell he pointedly avoided contact with anyone who was not white.\n\n‘Ironically I was acting like a racist. I walked with my back to the wall so I could see people all the time. I was on high alert. They told me to watch my back. Trust me, I did. I went back to my cell as soon as I could and locked it.’\n\nMr McDonald is speaking to me in the five-bedroom terrace house in Runcorn where he grew up. He’s been living there with his parents Janet, 66, and Glen, 70, since he broke up with his partner following his imprisonment (he had already separated from the mother of his son Freddie).\n\nIn the neat house, dogs are barking, GB News is playing on the TV and a plaque on the wall bears the legend: ‘Home is where the heart is.’ As his mother pours us both tea, Mr McDonald tells me: ‘She’s been my rock but it was too much even for her when I called home on Christmas Day from prison. She couldn’t speak to me. She was too upset.’\n\nFreddie visited him regularly. ‘He desperately tried to hide the fact he had been crying when he saw me. He wanted to be brave for his dad. It was absolutely heartbreaking.’\n\nIn the first prison, Altcourse in Liverpool, he spent 23 hours a day in his cell, shared with his friend Mr Taggart. He was then transferred to HMP Liverpool, where he was jailed with violent offenders including two murderers serving 35 and 45 years respectively.\n\nThe prison where he was targeted by the gang, he said, stank of the synthetic marijuana ‘spice’, which can cause psychosis.\n\n‘It’s tolerated because it puts some of the inmates into a numb state. One bloke was off his head four nights running, needing medical help. I would hear the drones dropping off the stuff over the prison walls all night. It was like an airport.’\n\nEventually he was moved to an open prison for the last four months of his sentence. On his release, he discovered he had lost his job. ‘It’s hard to get an interview if you have a criminal record associated with Southport. I’ve always worked. Now I’m unemployed and struggling financially.’\n\nHe adds: ‘This experience has made me fall out of love with this country. It’s been devastating. A lesser man might have crumbled. Sometimes I tried to kid myself it was all a terrible dream and Jeremy Beadle was going to jump out with a TV camera and say: “You’ve been framed!” But instead I was living a nightmare, cheek by jowl with drug dealers, sex offenders and murderers.’\n\nA Liverpool football fan, he now says he is too scared to cheer on England. ‘I feel it’s a crime to be a flag-waving patriot in Keir Starmer’s Britain. I feel abandoned by my own country. In court they implied I had been threatening to burn down hotels with children inside, which was an outrageous misrepresentation.’\n\nHis experience has echoes of Lucy Connolly, 42, the wife of a Tory councillor, who served ten months in prison for tweeting: ‘Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f***ing hotels full of the b******s.’ She deleted the tweet within hours of writing it.\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage raised Ms Connolly’s case with allies of Donald Trump on a visit to US Congress as ‘a symbol of Keir Starmer’s authoritarian, broken, two-tier Britain’ – and friends of Mr Trump, including Vice President JD Vance, are known to be shocked at her case.\n\nMr McDonald, who read about Ms Connolly’s case in prison, tells me today: ‘We were both political prisoners.’\n\nWhile Mr McDonald was in prison, he saw on TV the conviction of Mike Amesbury, Labour MP for Runcorn, for punching a constituent to the ground. Jailed for ten weeks, Amesbury was released after just three days.\n\n‘What he did in a drunken rage was a million times worse than what I did and he was an MP – a public figure. Yet Starmer told President Trump he was “proud” of the tradition of free speech in Britain. I’m living proof that we don’t have that tradition anymore.’\n\nSarah Pochin MP, who won the Runcorn by-election for Reform after Amesbury’s conviction, visited Mr McDonald in prison.\n\nShe has been outraged by his treatment and plans to raise it in Parliament.\n\n‘I was a magistrate for 20 years,’ she tells me.\n\n‘Violent and sex offenders get shorter sentences than my constituent. He would not have got a custodial sentence in my court. Our two-tier justice system has turned this good man’s life upside down. It’s shameful.’\n\nNow Mr McDonald is attempting to rebuild his life. ‘I lost my job,’ he says. ‘I’m on the dole for the first time in my life. I’ve lost my reputation. My relationship ended.\n\n‘I wish I could take back the inflammatory language. But what I went though was like a Soviet show trial.’","summary":"Rhys McDonald's nightmare began when he received a call at work from his mother one day in August 2024, telling him that the police had just spoken to her and wanted to see him urgently.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15160057/white-trash-racist-foolish-Southport-Facebook-message.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/03/17/102684377-0-image-m-69_1759507255213.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:55:50","author":"Andrew Pierce,Editor","authors":["Andrew Pierce","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":366007424,"title":"Trump has announced peace in the Middle East - the problem is Hamas and Israel are backing different deals","text":"Friday night brought flickers of what almost everyone - bar Benjamin Netanyahu’s extreme right, war-mongering cabinet ministers - has been desperate for. News of a ceasefire, and a possible plan to free Gaza from the slaughterhouse it has become over the last two years.\n\nHamas tentatively welcomed Donald Trump’s efforts, as well as those of the international community and Arab states, to end the devastating war.\n\nThe militant group, responsible for the bloody attacks on 7 October 2023, agreed to release all the remaining 48 hostages – both dead and alive – “according to the exchange formula” in Trump’s 20-point plan. \n\nThis, they added, would be done “in a manner that achieves an end to the war”.It followed Benjamin Netanyahu’s endorsement of Trump’s plan last week, albeit with his own interpretations.\n\nSo, is this the moment millions have been dreaming of and campaigning for? The end to mass slaughter in Gaza? To the two-year-long nightmare for the families of Israeli hostages and captives? The end to a region-wide war that has pushed the world to the brink?\n\nTrump, who has campaigned as the peacemaking president and has eyed up the Nobel Peace Prize - certainly thinks so: “Based on the statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE. Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the hostages out safely and quickly! This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long-sought PEACE in the Middle East,” he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe devil, however, is (as always) in the detail. And so far, neither Netanyahu nor Hamas has agreed to every specific point in the plan. Instead, both have publicly declared their own interpretations of the proposal and vowed to support that.\n\nThe problem is that the 20-point plan is vague. So vague, in fact, that it has allowed Trump, Netanyahu, Hamas, and key figures in the region to effectively release and promote their own interpretations of it.\n\nThe statements accompanying each endorsement paint such entirely different pictures, you wonder whether they were even looking at the same document. And this, I fear, will be the issue when it comes to actually trying to implement it and achieve much sought after peace.\n\nFor a start, Hamas said this evening that it would be willing to hand over all the hostages and captives within 72 hours, a significant breakthrough -adding that it would immediately be open to discussions on the details.\n\nResponding to Trump’s plan, it welcomed the “full withdrawal” of Israeli from the Gaza Strip, the exchange of Palestinian prisoners, the immediate entry of aid, the rejection of the occupation of the Strip, and the rejection of the forcible displacement of Palestinian people.\n\nHamas also said it was willing to hand over administration of Gaza to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats, as outlined in Trump’s document.\n\n But crucially they also said that Hamas would remain part of the Palestinian “national frameworks” and would contribute “with full responsibility”. In other words, Hamas is not going to simply disappear.\n\nPouring fuel on the fire is the fact that Trump’s plan contains no provisions or guarantees for the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nInstead – somewhat confusingly – it states that after the removal of Hamas, if the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority in the West Bank is “reformed” enough to be allowed back into some role of power, then “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.\n\nBut again: no guarantees. At the press conference announcing the plan last week, Netanyahu jumped on this. He said he welcomed Donald Trump’s rejection of a Palestinian state, and added that recognising one would, in the context of the October 7th attacks, “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”.\n\nHe also added a few more caveats, including to the PA’s “reform” that are not listed in Trump’s 20-point proposal –such as ending “lawfare” against Israel at the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice (in other words, impunity), stopping incitement in the media, and the PA recognising a “Jewish state”.\n\nOnce again, we’re looking at interpretations of a vague text that directly contradict one another.\n\nThe question remains: can these disparate statements – cherry-picking and interpreting different aspects of the vague 20-point plan – translate into meaningful, long-term peace?","summary":"Hamas has said it will accept key parts of Trump’s peace plan, but how much closer are we to an end to its conflict, with Israel, asks Bel Trew","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/trump-peace-gaza-israel-deal-b2839169.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/03/22/39/Donald-Trump.png?crop=2438,1625.3,x0,y15.3&trim=15,0,15,0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:55:24","author":"Bel Trew","authors":["Bel Trew"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":366004430,"title":"Pew survey: majority of Americans critical of Israeli government","text":"Oct. 3 (UPI) -- Americans are becoming more critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza and the Middle East nation's government, according to a Pew Research Foundation Survey.\n\nThe findings were released Friday on the day militant Hamas leaders said they will release all hostages, living and dead, but need more than three days to do so, prompting President Donald Trump to urge Israel to stop bombing Gaza. Earlier in the day, Trump gave Hamas a 48-hour deadline to agree to the peace proposal, backed by the Israeli government.\n\nThe war began on. 7, 2023, after Israel was bombed by Hamas.\n\nIn the public opinion poll, 59% hold an unfavorable opinion of the Israeli government, which is up from 51% in early 2024 and 43% in December 2023.\n\nAnd 39% say Israel is going too far in its military operation, which is higher than 31% in early 2024 and 27% in December 2023. Just 16% now say Israel is taking about the right approach to the conflict, and 10% say it isn't going far enough.

The 29-year-old pleaded guilty to the attempted assassination in April.\n\n“I sincerely apologize to the justice and his family,” Roske said in court, adding that “this tragic mistake will follow me for the rest of my life,” according to CNN.\n\nRoske traveled from California to Kavanaugh’s home in Maryland on June 8, 2022, with a plan to assassinate him, according to the Justice Department. U.S. Marshals who were protecting Kavanaugh’s home spotted Roske getting out of a taxi and walking down the street.\n\nShortly afterward, Roske called 911 and told the operator she traveled to the state with a gun to kill a Supreme Court justice. At the time of the incident, she was known as Nicholas Roske.\n\nInvestigators later found a gun in Roske’s suitcase, along with several other items, including a knife, ammunition, zip ties and pepper spray.\n\nWhen interviewed by police, Roske said she was upset about a “recently leaked Supreme Court draft decision on abortion as well as the recent school shooting in Uvalde, Texas,” the Justice Department said. A month prior, Politico had published a leaked draft of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v Jackson, which overturned the Constitutional right to an abortion established in 1973 in Roe v Wade.\n\nProsecutors asked the judge to sentence Roske to at least 30 years. They also argued that the sentence should serve to deter others, citing a letter Kavanaugh received in April that said he “should die” from a gunshot and referenced Roske, CNN reports. Meanwhile, the defense asked for 96 months.\n\nThe prosecution’s request was “not reasonable,” Boardman said in court. She cited Roske’s decision to tell authorities about her plan, as well as her mental health struggles, according to CNN. Roske struggled with depression for years and had attempted suicide in the past, according to her defense attorneys.\n\n“If she had not called 911, law enforcement would have never known about Sophie Roske and her plot to kill a Supreme Court justice,” Boardman said.\n\nBoardman also cited President Donald Trump’s executive order from January 20, which states that transgender inmates must be incarcerated in prisons that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth, ABC News reports. Roske’s attorneys disclosed in September that she is transgender.\n\nBoardman went on to acknowledge the “real harm that was caused to Justice Kavanaugh and his family,” adding that they should “never have to face a fear of threat because he does his job.”\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said prosecutors will be appealing the “woefully insufficient” sentence, arguing it “does not reflect the horrific facts of this case.”\n\n“The attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was a disgusting attack against our entire judicial system by a profoundly disturbed individual,” Bondi said in a statement.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs mental health assistance right now, call or text 988, or visit 988lifeline.org to access online chat from the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

Peter’s criticism surfaced after Kimmel’s September 30, 2025, interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.This was his first interview since Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned to air, following the show’s suspension over Kimmel’s earlier comments about the late Charlie Kirk.During this September 30 interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel criticized Trump for celebrating his show’s temporary shutdown, which had left his staff without work.“I mean, that son of a b*tch…No, I never imagined that we’d ever have a president like this, and I hope we don’t ever have another president like this again,” he remarked.He went on to argue that Trump had crossed a line by taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.“I never even imagined there would ever be a situation in which the president of our country was celebrating hundreds of Americans losing their jobs. But somebody who took pleasure in that, that to me is the absolute opposite of what a leader of this country is supposed to be,” Kimmel added.On October 2, 2025, X user Joe Rogan Podcast News shared a clip from the September 30 episode of The Late Show, featuring Kimmel’s comments on Trump. That same day, Zack Peter reposted the aforementioned video, contending Kimmel’s subsequent apology upon his reinstatement. He argued that the late-night host only apologized to salvage his career.“Kimmel learned not a damn thing. His apology was fake. He was sorry he got suspended, but not sorry for hurting, offending, and isolating half of this country,” Peter wrote as he reposted the clip on X.Zack Peter @justplainzackLINKKimmel learned not a damn thing. His apology was fake. He was sorry he got suspended but not sorry for hurting, offending, and isolating half of this country.Jimmy Kimmel opens up about his show’s temporary suspensions during his The Late Show appearanceJimmy Kimmel (Image via Getty Images)During his September 30 appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel also addressed the temporary suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, reflecting on what he described as an “emotional roller coaster” after being abruptly pulled off the air.For context, ABC had suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 17 following remarks Kimmel made during his September 15 broadcast, which drew intense backlash.In that episode, the late-night show host criticized supporters of President Donald Trump, saying the “MAGA gang” tried to spin the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk for political gain. His comments prompted widespread criticism, including from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, which ultimately led ABC to intervene.During the recent interview, when Colbert asked Kimmel how he learned his show had been “indefinitely” suspended, Kimmel recalled the moment vividly. “It was about 3:00. We tape our show at 4:30. I’m in my office, typing away as I usually do. I get a phone call, it’s ABC. They say they want to talk to me. This is unusual,” he detailed.Unable to find privacy in his office, Jimmy Kimmel recounted how he ended up taking the call inside a bathroom. During the conversation, ABC executives expressed concern about what he might say on air. That's when they informed him that they were taking his show off the air.Hearing thus, Colbert’s audience responded with boos, directed at ABC executives, which then mirrored Kimmel’s own reaction“That’s what I said. I started booing… I said I don’t think that’s a good idea, and they said, ‘Well, we think it’s a good idea.’ And then there was a vote and I lost the vote. So I put my pants back on, walked out to my office, called in some of the executive producers—about nine people—and said, ‘They’re pulling the show off the air,’” Kimmel recounted.Jimmy Kimmel (Image via Getty Images)Kimmel went on to describe leaving the meeting looking so pale that his wife compared him to comedian Jim Gaffigan. At the time, he feared he was “never coming back on the air.”Kimmel further detailed how, after the shutdown, he remained at the El Capitan Theatre, where his show is filmed, before attempting to drive home. However, his trip quickly turned chaotic as paparazzi and TMZ reporters surrounded his car, with even helicopters following him.The incident, however, weighed more heavily on his family. Kimmel admitted that his wife and two children were “shaken” by the ordeal and the media frenzy surrounding it.Reflecting on the days that followed, Kimmel remarked:“It was like a DUI in L.A., three days in jail where I couldn’t say anything. I just had to sit quiet and make a lot of phone calls and take a lot of phone calls. You [Colbert] were very kind to call me. … I did hear from literally everyone I have ever met.”Despite the turmoil, Jimmy Kimmel Live! returned on September 23, just days after the suspension.Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. EDT, featuring a blend of celebrity interviews, comedy performances, and music from its house band.","summary":"Podcaster Zack Peter accused Jimmy Kimmel of issuing a “fake” apology following the late-night host’s controversial remarks about U.S. President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/podcasts/news-zack-peter-claims-jimmy-kimmel-s-apology-fake-late-night-show-host-calls-trump-that-son-b-tch","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/10/57483-17595343283562-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:51:02","author":"Shayari Roy","authors":["Shayari Roy"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.559},{"id":366003956,"title":"‘Will they change course?’: US Senate in deadlock over government shutdown","text":"“ Well, the shutdown melodrama continues.”\n\nThat’s how, with the verbal equivalent of a sigh, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana summed up the third day of the United States government shutdown.\n\nOn Friday, the US Senate reconvened before a weekend recess to vote yet again on a continuing resolution that would keep the government funded through November 21.\n\nRepublicans have touted the resolution as a “clean” budget bill, maintaining the status quo. But Democrats have said they will refuse to consider any bill that does not consider healthcare spending.\n\nBy the end of the year, subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are slated to expire, a fact expected to cause insurance premiums to spike for many Americans. And Democrats have called on Republicans to reconsider cuts to Medicaid, the government insurance programme for low-income households, following the passage of a bill earlier this year that narrows its requirements.\n\nBut the result has been an impasse on Capitol Hill, with both parties exchanging blame and no resolution in sight. Frustration was visible on both sides.\n\n“This shutdown is bone-deep, down-to-the-marrow stupid,” Kennedy said from the Senate floor.\n\nFor a fourth time on Friday, Democrats rejected the Republicans’ proposal, which previously passed the House of Representatives along party lines.\n\nOnly three senators splintered from the party caucus: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Democrat John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Independent Angus King of Maine.\n\nOn the Republican side, Senator Rand Paul also refused to vote alongside members of his party. His concern, he said, was how the spending would contribute to federal debt.\n\nThe result was a vote of 54 to 44 in the 100-seat Senate chamber, far short of the 60 votes Republicans need to overcome a Democratic filibuster to scuttle the bill.\n\nAs a counterproposal, Democrats put forward a bill that would see more than $1 trillion dedicated to healthcare spending. But that too floundered in a Senate vote.\n\nFinger-pointing on Capitol Hill\n\nIn a news conference afterwards, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the deadlock could only be broken if the Republicans changed their tactic and negotiated on the question of healthcare.\n\n“Today, we saw the Republicans run the same play, and they got the same result. The question is: Will they change course?” he told reporters.\n\nSchumer accused Republicans of having “wasted a week” with four votes that ended in the same result.\n\n“ My caucus and Democrats are adamant that we must protect the healthcare of the American people,” he said. “ Instead of trying to come to the table and negotiate with Democrats and reopen the government, the White House and fellow Republicans have vowed to make this a ‘maximum pain’ shutdown.”\n\nRepublican leaders, meanwhile, accused the Democrats of attempting to bog down the process instead of proceeding with the status quo.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson also argued that programmes like Medicaid were in desperate need of reform.\n\n“Medicaid has been rife with fraud and abuse, and so we reformed it. Why? To help provide more and better health services for the American people,” he said at a news conference. “ We had so many people on Medicaid that never were intended to be there.”\n\nJohnson accused Schumer of attempting to appeal to the progressive branch of the Democratic Party, in anticipation of a 2028 primary for his Senate seat: “ He’s got to show that he’s fighting Republicans.”\n\nBoth sides of the aisle, however, expressed sympathy for the federal workers caught in the middle of the shutdown.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that nearly 750,000 people are facing furloughs each day the shutdown continues. Others are required to keep working without pay.\n\nThe total compensation for the furloughed employees amounts to roughly $400m per day, according to the budget office’s statistics. Thanks to a 2019 law, the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, federal employees will eventually receive backpay – but only after the shutdown concludes.\n\nPressure tactics\n\nIn an effort to force the Democrats to pass the continuing resolution, Johnson issued a notice on Friday afternoon that the House of Representatives would not return to session until October 14 at the earliest.\n\nInstead, his memo called on representatives to engage in a “district work period”, away from the US capital.\n\nThat announcement was designed to place pressure on the Senate to act on the continuing resolution the House had already passed. Prior to Johnson’s announcement, the House had been expected to resume its work in the Capitol on October 7.\n\nMeanwhile, John Thune, the Senate majority leader, indicated he would be willing to weigh the Democrats’ concerns about healthcare, but only once the government was reopened.\n\nStill, he made no guarantee that the expiring healthcare subsidies would be re-upped if the Democrats did relent.\n\n“ We can’t make commitments or promises on the COVID subsidies because that’s not something that we can guarantee that there are the votes there to do. But what I’ve said is I’m open to having conversations with our Democrat colleagues about how to address that issue,” Thune said.\n\n“ But that can’t happen while the government is shut down.”\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to use the shutdown as an opportunity to slash the federal workforce and cut programmes that benefit Democratic strongholds.\n\nAlready this week, his administration has said it is suspending $18bn in New York City infrastructure projects, including for tunnels under the Hudson River, as well as about $8bn in clean energy initiatives.\n\nBut on Friday, Russ Vought, Trump’s director for the US Office of Management and Budget, announced another major city would be targeted for cuts: Chicago, Illinois.\n\nVought posted on social media that two Chicago infrastructure projects, worth $2.1bn, “have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting”.\n\nAt a news briefing afterwards, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said a reduction in the federal workforce was also in the works, with Vought meeting with agency leaders to discuss layoffs.\n\n“Maybe if Democrats do the right thing, this government shutdown can be over. Our troops can get paid again. We can go back to doing the business of the American people,” Leavitt said.\n\n“But if this shutdown continues, as we’ve said, layoffs are an unfortunate consequence of that.”\n\nBut Democratic leaders dismissed those threats as pressure tactics meant to distract from the key question of healthcare.\n\nIn his remarks, Schumer argued that healthcare was a top priority for Republican districts too, and that Republican leaders should respond accordingly.\n\n“It’s simple,” Schumer said. “ They can reopen the government and make people’s healthcare more affordable at the same time.”","summary":"The third day of the US government shutdown has yielded no breakthrough as Democrats and Republicans split on spending.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/3/will-they-change-course-us-senate-in-stalemate-over-government-shutdown?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25276740906880-1759524891.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:44:27","author":"Allison Griner,Apps Support","authors":["Allison Griner","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.525},{"id":366003872,"title":"Donald Trump orders Israel to ‘immediately’ stop bombing Gaza as Hamas agrees to free hostages","text":"Donald Trump ordered Israel to “immediately” stop bombing Gaza as he welcomed Hamas’s partial acceptance of his ultimatum to end the nearly two-year war.\n\nHamas has agreed to release all hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, as well as surrender governing power in the Gaza Strip, in accordance with Trump’s plan.\n\nIn a statement on Friday evening, the Palestinian militant group asked for further negotiations on other parts of the plan, and did not say whether it would lay down its arms – a key part of Trump’s proposal unveiled on Monday.\n\nDespite the qualified response by Hamas, Trump said in a post on Truth Social: “Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.\n\n“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it’s far too dangerous to do that.\n\n“We are already in discussions on details to be worked out. This is not about Gaza alone, this is about long sought PEACE in the Middle East.”\n\nIn a brief video message posted separately Trump said it was a “very special day, maybe unprecedented” and added that “Everybody will be treated fairly.”\n\nThe unprecedented order from Trump underlined that Israel and Hamas are the closest they have been in two years to achieving an end to the war in Gaza.\n\nTrump is widely seen as the only international leader with the power to compel the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire deal.\n\nIn a statement earlier on Friday night, Hamas said it was giving its “approval of releasing all occupation prisoners – both living and remains – according to the exchange formula contained in president Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange”.\n\nHamas also said it was prepared to turn over “the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”.\n\nHowever, the group said “other issues” in Trump’s proposal would need to be discussed further “within a unified Palestinian national framework”. The unspecified issues would likely include arms, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and international guarantees for a permanent ceasefire.\n\nTrump’s plan called for an immediate end to fighting in Gaza, an exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners within 72 hours of the deal’s signing, a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and a transitional authority led by Trump.\n\nThe deal also stipulated a surge of aid to Gaza, parts of which are experiencing famine, and the reconstruction to the mostly demolished strip.\n\nThe deal was largely seen as unfavourable to Hamas and, if agreed in full, would likely spell the group’s end as an armed Palestinian faction while demanding few concessions from Israel. International pressure on the group to accept the plan has been intense, with most regional and international powers welcoming the Trump initiative.\n\nThe catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza, with Israel’s continued aid blockade and daily bombing, also puts pressure on the group to reach an agreement to end the war.\n\nThough Hamas did not immediately agree to disarm, its acceptance of a hostage handover will be seen as significant. The 48 hostages have been used as leverage throughout the nearly two-year war. Giving them up would we leave the group with few bargaining chips going forward.\n\nIsrael’s war in Gaza has killed more than 60,000 Palestinians and wounded about 170,000, according to the Gaza health authority, mainly civilians. The figure does not include the thousands buried under the rubble or those killed by indirect consequences of the war.\n\nThe war was launched by Israel in response to Hamas-led militants killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages in Israel on 7 October 2023.\n\nThe Qatari ministry of foreign affairs also welcomed Hamas’s response, and said it had begun working with fellow mediator Egypt to coordinate with the US on negotiations towards ending the war in Gaza.\n\nA spokesman for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end”, while the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, called for the Trump plan to be implemented “without delay”, saying Hamas’s acceptance of it was “a significant step forwards”.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said that “after almost two years, this is the best chance for peace”.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/donald-trump-orders-israel-immediately-233751670.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/z.4ShuBDxdmIdD4lQAEEyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xOTIwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/751d42dfdf74b18e8feb3484b295b576","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:37:51","author":"William Christou In Jerusalem","authors":["William Christou In Jerusalem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":366004560,"title":"Trump Says \"Everybody Will Be Treated Fairly\" In Gaza Deal","text":"Access Denied\n\nYou don't have permission to access \"http://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-everybody-will-be-treated-fairly-in-gaza-peace-deal-9393185\" on this server.\nReference #18.8ea72917.1759536815.8ab151d\nhttps://errors.edgesuite.net/18.8ea72917.1759536815.8ab151d","summary":"US President Donald Trump said Friday he believed Hamas was ready for \"lasting peace\" and told Israel to stop bombing Gaza, after the Palestinian militant group declared it was ready to free hostages under his ceasefire plan.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-everybody-will-be-treated-fairly-in-gaza-peace-deal-9393185","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:36:28","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-1},{"id":366009412,"title":"US considers US$1 Trump coin to mark 250th independence celebrations","text":"The US Treasury is considering making a US$1 coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate 250 years since the declaration of American independence in 2026, it said on Friday.\nImages of the potential design showed Trump holding a raised clenched fist on one side of the coin alongside the words “fight, fight, fight” – a reference to what he said immediately after surviving an assassination attempt last year.\nThe other side of the coin shows Trump in profile with the word “liberty” above him and “1776-2026” written below, according to images shared by Treasurer Brandon Beach on social media.\n“While a final US$1 coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States’ semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles,” a Treasury spokesperson said in a statement.\nBeach said on social media that more information would be shared following the end of the government shutdown, which has suspended many federal operations while lawmakers remain at an impasse over a new spending bill.\n\nCongress in 2020 passed a law that allows the Treasury Secretary to mint US$1 coins in 2026 “with designs emblematic of the US semiquincentennial”.\nTo mark the 1976 bicentennial celebrations, the Treasury sponsored a national competition and picked for the US$1 coin a design by a sculpture student featuring the Liberty Bell, a symbol of American independence, and the moon.\nThe other side of the coin showed former president Dwight D.

His peace plan has been accepted by Israel and welcomed internationally.\n\nKey mediators Egypt and Qatar welcomed the latest developments, and Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, said they would “continue discussions on the plan.”\n\nA spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end.” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”\n\nMr. Trump had warned on social media earlier Friday that Hamas must agree to “this LAST CHANCE agreement” by Sunday evening, threatening an even greater military onslaught: “THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”\n\nUnder the plan, which Mr. Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Mr. Netanyahu, Hamas would immediately release the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive. It would also give up power and disarm.\n\nIn return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction. Plans to relocate much of Gaza’s population to other countries would be shelved.\n\nThe territory of some 2 million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Mr. Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.\n\nHamas objections\n\nPalestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous U.S. proposals as strongly favoring Israel.\n\nMr. Trump’s proposal “cannot be implemented without negotiations,” Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based outside of Gaza, told the Al Jazeera network.\n\nThe Hamas statement said it was willing to return all remaining hostages according to the plan’s “formula,” likely referring to the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body.\n\nBut Mr. Abu Marzouk said it might be difficult for Hamas to release all the hostages within 72 hours as the proposal dictates, because it could take days or weeks to locate the remains of some of the captives.\n\nHe said Hamas was willing to hand over its weapons to a future Palestinian body that runs Gaza, but there was no mention of that in the official statement.\n\nAnother Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Araby television that Hamas would refuse foreign administration of the Gaza Strip and that the entry of foreign forces would be “unacceptable.”\n\nIsraeli pressure\n\nIsrael has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine, and other goods for 2 1/2 months and has seized, flattened, and largely depopulated large areas.\n\nMost of Hamas’ top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks.\n\nHamas has long insisted it will only release the remaining hostages – its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields – in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Mr. Netanyahu has rejected those terms.\n\nThousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.","summary":"Replying to President Donald Trump’s ultimatum to accept his plan for ending the war, Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects require consultations.

Does supporting it equate to a betrayal of the sacrifices made or could it open a path toward a different kind of struggle?\n\nThese questions lie at the heart of Palestine’s current ordeal. For decades, the people of Gaza have faced relentless aggression, their rights systematically denied while the international community has largely remained silent. Now, with Trump’s formula suggesting a demilitarized Gaza and amnesty for Hamas members in exchange for hostages, the Palestinian leadership and their supporters face difficult choices. On the surface, the plan seems designed to weaken Hamas, yet it also promises prisoner exchanges and hints at broader recognition of Palestinian political struggle.\n\nDr. Adil points out that this proposal did not emerge in isolation. It was reportedly shaped through consultations with Muslim leaders during the United Nations General Assembly. Leaders such as Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed cautious approval, calling the initiative encouraging. Their stance suggests that at least some in the Muslim world view it as a possible step toward easing Gaza’s suffering, though not without deep reservations. The recent defence pact between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, welcomed across the Muslim world, also adds weight to the notion that regional power alignments are shifting in preparation for a political settlement.\n\nYet, profound skepticism remains. Israel has consistently rejected UN resolutions and pursued its vision of “Greater Israel,” with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly defying international law while overseeing policies that amount to ethnic cleansing. Given this history, can Palestinians afford to place their trust in an arrangement backed by Washington and Tel Aviv? Dr. Adil suggests that while Muslim governments may have considered public opinion and Palestinian welfare in their endorsement, the absence of direct consultation with Hamas raises questions of legitimacy.\n\nThe deeper challenge is whether Palestinians can transition from armed resistance to sustained political struggle without losing the essence of their cause. Dr. Adil draws a compelling historical parallel with the Indian subcontinent after 1857, when military defeat gave rise to a long, patient political campaign that eventually secured independence. If Trump’s formula does indeed guarantee space for nonviolent political struggle, Palestine may enter a similar historical phase, where moral authority outweighs brute force over time.\n\nStill, the dangers are real. To disarm Hamas without robust guarantees of protection would expose Palestinians to further massacres, as past experience has shown. Muslim countries, therefore, must insist on international or regional forces to safeguard civilians if disarmament is pursued. Otherwise, the formula risks becoming a tool for further subjugation rather than liberation.\n\nIn the end, the path to peace cannot rest solely on external proposals. It requires genuine recognition of Palestinian rights, implementation of UN resolutions and a commitment by the Muslim world to back words with decisive action.

Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". \n\nAs part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. \n\nOn the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". \n\n\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" \n\nSome Democrats - including Connecticut Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. \n\nCiting a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. \n\nEarly polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. \n\nAnother 23% said they were unsure.\n\n(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce32eegrlpko","image":"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cd98/live/b2ab9a80-a094-11f0-b1b3-b903aa8071ae.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:28:02","author":"Bernd Debusmann Jr","authors":["Bernd Debusmann Jr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":365998474,"title":"Hamas response is significant - but there are key omissions","text":"The Israeli government will now be poring over the wording of the statement to glean the true intent.\n\nIt will need to decide whether it sees this as a genuine good faith acceptance of some of the key points of the deal, or merely an attempt to buy time and reopen long drawn out negotiations.\n\nGiven that it came just a few hours after President Donald Trump issued his final ultimatum for Hamas to agree by Sunday evening or face \"all hell\", some members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet are likely to be deeply sceptical.\n\nThat is particularly true now the US president has called on Israel to immediately stop the bombing of Gaza. \n\n\"Based on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\" Trump said shortly after the Hamas statement was released.\n\n\"Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly,\" he said. \"Right now, it's far too dangerous to do that.\"\n\nThe Israelis will not like the last paragraph of his statement suggesting Hamas would retain a role in negotiations over the long term future of Gaza. \n\nThe Hamas statement is significant, no doubt.

Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Israel, which is largely shut down for the Jewish Sabbath, and Hamas' response fell short of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demands that the group surrender and disarm. Israel had earlier accepted Trump's plan in its entirety.\n\nTrump welcomed the Hamas statement, saying: “I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE.\"\n\n“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly! Right now, it’s far too dangerous to do that. We are already in discussions on details to be worked out,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nHamas said aspects of the proposal touching on the future of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian rights should be decided on the basis of a “unanimous Palestinian stance” reached with other factions and based on international law.\n\nThe statement also made no mention of Hamas disarming, a key Israeli demand included in Trump’s proposal.\n\nLatest ceasefire effort is widely welcomed\n\nTrump appears keen to deliver on pledges to end the war and return dozens of hostages ahead of the second anniversary of the attack on Tuesday.\n\nKey mediators Egypt and Qatar welcomed the latest developments, and Majed Al Ansari, a spokesman for Qatar's Foreign Ministry, said they would “continue discussions on the plan.”\n\nA spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said he “urges all parties to seize the opportunity to bring the tragic conflict in Gaza to an end.” French President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that “the release of all hostages and a ceasefire in Gaza are within reach!”\n\nThe main organization representing the families of Israeli hostages said Trump's demand to halt the fighting “is essential to prevent serious and irreversible harm to the hostages.\" It called on Netanyahu “to immediately begin efficient and swift negotiations to bring all our hostages home.”\n\nTrump’s plan would end the fighting and return hostages\n\nEarlier, Trump had warned that Hamas must agree to the deal by Sunday evening, threatening an even greater military onslaught.\n\n“If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,\" Trump wrote Friday on social media. \"THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”\n\nUnder the plan, which Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Netanyahu, Hamas would release the remaining 48 hostages — around 20 of them believed to be alive, within three days. It would also give up power and disarm.\n\nIn return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction. Plans to relocate much of Gaza's population to other countries would be shelved.\n\nThe territory of some 2 million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.\n\nPalestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous U.S. proposals as strongly favoring Israel.\n\nHamas officials air objections in TV interviews\n\nTrump’s proposal “cannot be implemented without negotiations,” Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official based outside of Gaza, told the Al Jazeera network on Friday.\n\nThe Hamas statement said it was willing to return all remaining hostages according to the plan’s “formula,” apparently referring to an exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body.\n\nBut Abu Marzouk said it might be difficult for Hamas to release all the hostages within 72 hours, because it could take days or weeks to locate the remains of some of the captives.\n\nHe said Hamas was willing to hand over its weapons to a future Palestinian body that runs Gaza, but there was no mention of that in the official statement.\n\nAnother Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, told Al Araby television that Hamas would refuse foreign administration of the Gaza Strip and that the entry of foreign forces would be “unacceptable.”\n\nUS and Israel seek to pressure Hamas\n\nIsrael has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine and other goods for 2 1/2 months and has seized, flattened and largely depopulated large areas.\n\nExperts determined that Gaza City had slid into famine shortly before Israel launched a major offensive aimed at occupying it. An estimated 400,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks, but hundreds of thousands more have stayed behind.\n\nOlga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian office, said she saw several displaced families staying in the parking lot of Shifa Hospital during a visit on Thursday.\n\n“They are not able to move south because they just cannot afford it,” Cherevko told The Associated Press. “One of the families had three children and the woman was pregnant with her fourth. And there were many other vulnerable cases there, including elderly people and people with disabilities.”\n\nMost of Hamas' top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks.\n\nHamas has long insisted it will only release the remaining hostages — its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields — in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Hamas must surrender and disarm.\n\nSecond anniversary approaches\n\nThousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.\n\nThe ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.\n\nThe offensive has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and left much of the territory uninhabitable.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump administrations have tried to end the fighting and bring back the hostages while providing extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel.","summary":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday ordered Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip after Hamas said it had accepted some elements of his plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.\n\nThe $100,000 fee will discourage the best and brightest minds from bringing life-saving research to the U.S., said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors.\n\nMike Miller, Region 6 Director of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, said Trump’s plan “prioritizes wealth and connections over scientific acumen and diligence.”\n\nSkye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, contends the “exorbitant fee” invites corruption and is illegal. Congress created the program and Trump can’t rewrite it overnight or levy new taxes by executive order, the groups said.","summary":"The group says the new fee has “thrown employers, workers and federal agencies into chaos.”","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/03/immigration-h-1b-visas-lawsuit/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trump_40106_ea08ba-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:15:19","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":366003988,"title":"Hamas’s response to Trump’s plan shows desire to end Gaza conflict — Egypt","text":"CAIRO, October 4. /TASS/.

Anexisting allowance of €1,200 for an individual or €2,000 for a couple or family is in place.\n\nThe offer has been met with criticism by migrant groups, with NGO Irish Refugee Council calling it an attempt to “coax” or “to lure” people away from Ireland.\n\nWhat do people in the international protection system itself think?\n\nPeople seeking international protectoin in Ireland told The Journal that they found aspects of the government’s offer infuriating, naive and little better than a “bribe” to leave the country.\n\nSome language in the leaflet was cited by residents of International Protection Accommodation Services centres (Ipas) who feel that it was “threatening” them.\n\nIn the document, it says that the Irish government won’t “inform authorities in your country” about their return if they take the money.\n\nA section of the leaflet outlining the differences between deportation and voluntary returns.Department of Justice\n\nDepartment of Justice\n\nOne Somalian woman staying at an Ipas centre in Dublin said it would have made no sense for her and her husband to take the offer and bring their children home.\n\nThe 30-year-old and her family came here after she converted from Islam to Christianity to marry her husband, but they both found themselves shunned by their relations.\n\nShe outlined how her home was burned down as a result during an attack by people known to her – a medical report notes the injuries the woman still suffers to her spine following the attack.\n\nSo we take the money and go back – to what? Honestly, is the money we’re being told to take worth more than our own lives and those of our children?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother man, aged in his 40s, came here in recent months from the US because of the ramped up deportation efforts under President Donald Trump to deport migrants.\n\nThis man, who is a US citizen but of Latino heritage, cited the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency – better known as ICE – as one reason for his move.\n\nHe outlined being in a mixed-race marriage, and that he and his family had faced “threats of people calling ICE” in their town in the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to recent data on the agency, one-in-five Latinos with no criminal record are arrested and detained by ICE agents.\n\nThe Department of Justice has been asked when the increased payment offer ends and for further comment.\n\nWhy some people might take the offer\n\nSeveral people staying in Ipas centres told The Journal the payment might appeal to some who had been studying in other countries, such as the UK, but had to leave because they couldn’t find a sponsoring company to continue their stay.\n\nIf they wanted to stay in Europe, some opt for Ireland due to the easier nature of crossing the border after arriving in Belfast and other cities in the North.\n\nAnother aspect that might appeal to this group is that, if they take the payment, they will be able to return to Ireland and other EU states legally.\n\nAlthough the number of people coming to Ireland seeking asylum has almost halved this year, there are still up to 1,000 people arriving each month. This has seen the government try and reduce numbers in various ways, including by ramping up deportations.\n\nOne man in his late 20s from Nigeria, who arrived two years ago, said he feels that the government and some in the public put too much emphasis on the economic conditions of asylum seekers.\n\nHe said that part of the appeal of coming here is that both Ireland and Nigeria share English as a common language.\n\nBut this man complained of a view that asylum seekers are “dumb and broke”, when there was “€17,000 in my bank account coming here”.\n\n“I ended up in Ireland because my life was in danger,” he said, outlining threats received from paramilitary groups in northern Nigeria. “The money won’t make me go back.”\n\nDefending the measure this week, Minister for Justice JO’Callaghan said his actions would be “saving the state money” by offering an incentive for people to leave the country at an earlier stage.\n\nHe said, on average, it costs €122,000 to accommodate the processing of an international protection applicant and €30,000 per annum to accommodation an international protection applicant.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...\n\nA mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.\n\nOver 5,000 readers like you have already stepped up and support us with a monthly payment or a once-off donation.\n\nSupport The Journal\n\nEoghan Dalton\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Asylum seekers offered money by government to drop claims feel 'bribed' and 'threatened'”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Asylum seekers offered money by government to drop claims feel 'bribed' and 'threatened'”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nAsylum Seekers\nasylum seekers return payment\n\nImmigration\n\nIpas return payment\nJim O'Callaghan\n\nreintegration grant\n\nThe Morning Lead\n\nNews in 60 seconds\n\nTrump tells Israel to 'immediately' stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agrees to make a deal\n\nSean 'Diddy' Combs jailed for four years after being convicted of prostitution charges\n\nSomeone is promising €30m for Waterford Airport - but local politicians aren't allowed to know who\n\nDublin doctor responds to nearly 50 medical emergencies in his spare time\n\nMan, 29, charged over alleged south Dublin assault spree remanded in custody\n\nLetterkenny\nMan (40s) dies after storm-related incident during red weather alert in Co Donegal\n\nStorm Amy: Man dead in weather incident as 180,000 homes and businesses still without power\n\nWriter, documentary-maker and Irish language advocate Manchán Magan has died aged 55\n\nStorm Amy: Man dead in weather incident as 180,000 homes and businesses still without power\n\nThe Morning Lead\nStorm Amy: Orange wind warning extended to sixth county, with gusts of up to 120km/hr forecast\n\nLetterkenny\nMan (40s) dies after storm-related incident during red weather alert in Co Donegal\n\nmore from us\n\nInvestigates\n\nDaft.ie Property Magazine\n\nAllianz Home Magazine\n\nThe 42 Sports Magazine\n\nTG4 Entertainment Magazine\n\nMoney Diaries\n\nThe Journal TV\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nAbout FactCheck\n\nOur Network\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nmore from us\n\nTV Listings\n\nGAA Fixtures\n\nThe Video Review\n\nJournal Media\n\nAdvertise With Us\n\nOur Network\n\nThe Journal\n\nFactCheck Knowledge Bank\n\nTerms & Legal Notices\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\n© 2025 Journal Media Ltd\n\nTerms of Use\n\nCookies & Privacy\n\nAdvertising\n\nCompetition\n\nSwitch to Desktop\nSwitch to Mobile\n\nThe Journal supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

let us all pray it’s exceeded by the joy of family reunification.\n\nTrump means to make it work: He quickly answered Hamas’ statement with a call for Israel to cease bombing at once to allow for immediate hostage releases; that sounds right to us.\n\nBut let’s be clear: The terrorists need to show immediately that the statement wasn’t simply a ploy to evade the 6 p.m. Sunday deadline that our president set Friday morning.\n\nHamas has played endless games in negotiations, even on Trump’s watch; no one should believe it’s giving up its last real leverage until every hostage is home.\n\nWe can’t help but notice that the terror group’s statement to Al Jazeera conspicuously didn’t mention some key points of the plan, such as the “Hamas disarms” provision.\n\nIt also suggests Hamas expects a voice in forming the area’s new governing authority.\n\nBut this is at least a start, and it’s well worth giving the terrorists a chance to deliver on the concessions they do make explicitly — first and foremost, handing over the remaining 48 hostages, 20 or 21 of whom Israel believes still live.\n\nIn line with the president’s words, the IDF plainly needs to cease offensive operations at once and prepare to pull back to the first withdrawal line as per the Trump plan.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas must start freeing hostages immediately: We see absolutely no reason why the first releases can’t start Saturday.\n\nIn the chaos of war, and with some hostages farmed out to Islamic Jihad and other terror factions, a few more days may be needed to get them all out — but this crucial first step can’t wait on any negotiations except over the practical details of the handovers.\n\nNo taking time to hold those macabre public ceremonies.\n\nWe’ll understand if Israel’s response is cautious, but Jerusalem simply can’t point to the terrorists’ initial weaseling as reason to claim Hamas has rejected the plan: Give them a chance to prove their bad faith, if that’s what it is.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s overriding concern now must be the hostages and their families.\n\nAfter all, if Hamas insists on negotiating other details about its exit and the future Gaza government — well, fine, as long as it frees the hostages first.\n\nShould it then make outrageous demands, the IDF will be free to go back in to finish the job.\n\nFor now, we’ll hope that the hesitation is simply saving face, or at least that a reasonable full and final accord — one that permanently ends the terror threat to Israel from Gaza — is within reach.\n\nFingers crossed; focus now on getting those hostages home.\n\nAnd if the rest of this works out, Trump clearly will deserve that Nobel Peace Prize.","summary":"This is at least a start, and it’s well worth giving the terrorists a chance to deliver on the concessions they do make explicitly — first and foremost, handing over the remaining 48 hostages.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/03/opinion/hamas-says-it-accepts-trumps-peace-plan-the-first-test-is-whether-hostage-releases-begin-now/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/2025-pictured-nuseirat-central-gaza-112696470.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:02:36","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":366007898,"title":"Trump wants his face on US currency, no matter that it's illegal","text":"The Department of Treasury is in talks to mint a $1 coin that will feature President Donald Trump's face, a move the administration says will mark the 250th anniversary of the country.\n\nU.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed in a post on X that his department is in talks to mint the Trump coin.

Trump, our nation is entering its 250th anniversary stronger, more prosperous, and better than ever before,” a Treasury Department spokesperson told Politico. “While a final $1 dollar coin design has not yet been selected to commemorate the United States’ semiquincentennial, this first draft reflects well the enduring spirit of our country and democracy, even in the face of immense obstacles.”\n\nAside from the fact that it’s incredibly tacky and egomaniacal for Trump’s administration to mint a coin of himself, it is also illegal. In 31 U.S. Code § 5114, it says, \"Only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency and securities.\"\n\nGiven that Trump is currently alive, he is not legally allowed to be put on U.S. currency.\n\nHowever, Trump and his goons have shown they don’t care about following the laws or the Constitution. His administration has ignored court orders to stop deporting people to foreign prisons. It is carrying out extrajudicial killings off the coast of Venezuela without congressional approval, and is even freezing and cancelling congressionally appropriated funds. \n\nTrump is such an egomaniac that you could absolutely see him ignoring the law so that he could get his fugly face on the very U.S. currency he is devaluing with his idiotic economic policies.\n\nUltimately, this would be the latest way Trump is using taxpayer dollars to celebrate himself.\n\nAlready, he spent millions on what turned out to be the lamest military parade of all time, which took place on his birthday.\n\nTrump is also defacing the White House by putting his tacky and hideous gold ornaments all over the walls of the Oval Office. And he's even building a gigantic, gaudy ballroom that will be bigger than the White House itself—even continuing the construction of the gargantuan stain on the White House complex despite the government shutdown.\n\nAt the end of the day, Trump fancies himself as a king. Ignoring the law to put his face on currency would put him one step closer to achieving that goal.","summary":"The Department of Treasury is in talks to mint a $1 coin that will feature President Donald Trump's face, a move the administration says will mark the 250th anniversary of the country.\n\n\n\nU.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed in a post on X that his department is in talks to mint the Trump coin.

The Puerto Rico-born singer kicks off his worldwide tour for his album “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” next month. The tour, however, doesn’t have any U.S. stops, which the “King of Latin Trap” said was due to concerns about his fans potentially being targeted by ICE.\n\nNews of Bad Bunny being named the halftime show act quickly sparked backlash online from conservatives, who have criticized the NFL in recent years for being too “woke” — rhetoric Lewandowski doubled down on during his podcast appearance.\n\n“It’s so shameful that they’ve decided to pick somebody who seems to hate America so much to represent them at the halftime game,” the Trump advisor said.\n\nJohnson was critical of the NFL’s decision, as well.\n\n“Massive Trump hater; Anti-ICE activist; No songs in English…The NFL is self-destructing year after year,” he posted on social media on Sunday night.\n\nSanta Clara spokesperson Janine De la Vega said in a statement that the city “is proud to be one of the safest in the nation, and our police department’s top priority is the safety and well-being of our residents and visitors, including attendees, players, and staff during the Super Bowl.”\n\n“Immigration enforcement is not within the city’s scope or authority,” she said. “Our collective goal is to ensure everyone can safely attend and enjoy events at Levi’s Stadium. We are not aware of any special enforcement plans related to immigration, outside of the recent media reports this week.”\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers, who manage Levi’s Stadium, declined to comment on Lewandowski’s remarks.\n\nA representative from the Bay Area Host Committee — a nonprofit formed with the goal of bringing major sporting events to the region — did not respond to a request for comment. President and CEO Zaileen Janmohamed previously praised the decision to pick Bad Bunny as the halftime show performer. In a statement released Sunday evening, she called him “one of the most awarded and celebrated artists of the last decade.”\n\n“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is one of the most anticipated and iconic musical performances in the world, and we are confident that Bad Bunny will deliver an unforgettable experience for fans in Levi’s Stadium and watching globally,” she said in a news release. “This selection further amplifies the Bay Area’s position as a premier destination for world-class events, and we look forward to a spectacular show that showcases the unique spirit and diversity of our region.”\n\nSanta Clara is set to host both the Super Bowl and six matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup next year.\n\nBut concerns about whether ICE would be present had been brewing long before Lewandowski suggested immigration enforcement efforts could take place. The CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinal match at Levi’s Stadium in July appeared to keep some fans away over concerns about ICE raids.\n\nThe Santa Clara Police Department will serve as the lead public safety agency for both events, and in a section on the city’s website about immigrant relations and resources, it says that Santa Clara “honors the rich diversity within our community.”\n\n“The police department will not conduct sweeps or other coordinated efforts to detain suspected undocumented immigrants,” the city’s website states. “It is neither the police department’s mission or role. The police department will not detain, question or arrest a person for the sole purpose of discovering a person’s citizenship or status under civil immigration laws.”","summary":"Santa Clara hosts its second Super Bowl on Feb. 8, 2026.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/03/trump-advisor-suggests-ice-could-be-present-at-super-bowl-lx-at-levis-stadium/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE_Immigration_07194.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 23:00:09","author":"Grace Hase","authors":["Grace Hase"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.367},{"id":366007054,"title":"Why Has Pete Hesgeth Suddenly Fired Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison?","text":"US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday dismissed Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, a powerful top aide who had played a central role in reshaping the service's bureaucracy, according to a report by Politico. The abrupt move came just days after the Senate confirmed Hung Cao as undersecretary of the Navy, two defence officials and a former official told Politico. In a statement, the Pentagon confirmed Harrison's departure, saying: \"He will no longer serve as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Navy. We are grateful for his service to the Department.\" Traditionally a behind-the-scenes position, the Navy secretary's chief of staff is responsible for keeping the office running smoothly. But Harrison, a Trump administration appointee who joined the Navy in January, wielded an unusually high level of influence. Together with Navy Secretary John Phelan, Harrison had introduced sweeping reforms to the Navy's policy and budgeting offices and sought to curb the authority of the undersecretary role. Politico reported that Harrison and Phelan had reassigned several aides who were meant to assist Cao in his new position and had planned to personally interview all future military assistants for the undersecretary to ensure decisions flowed through the secretary's office. Cao, a high-profile Navy veteran and former Republican Senate candidate in Virginia, was nominated by President Donald Trump. The dismissal marks the latest in a series of high-level changes at the Pentagon. Earlier this year, Hegseth removed several top aides and replaced the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff along with the uniformed leaders of the Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. Trump has pledged to revive America's shipbuilding industry, though major Navy programmes remain years behind schedule, with both US allies and rivals now outpacing the country's shipyard productivity.

Until the end of the last century, the Second Amendment was construed differently.\n\nWe, as a nation, are suffering from gun violence daily. The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as an incident where four or more people, excluding the shooter, are shot. In 2025 there have been 301 mass shootings in the U.S.A. Johns Hopkins reports that in 2020, gun injuries became the leading cause of death for U.S. children aged one to 17, and this trend continued through 2024.\n\nOur sympathies are with Mr. Kirk’s family and friends. However, we need more than thoughts and prayers to avoid deaths and injuries from gun violence. We need common sense gun restrictions to protect our “other God-given rights,” such as our rights to life and happiness. Even if such laws might not have forestalled the tragedy of Mr. Kirk’s death, gun safety laws can save lives.\n\nLorraine Hansen\n\nRollinsford, N.H.\n\nOh, dear. According to the Republican Manual of Style, by quoting Charlie Kirk’s own words you’ve just celebrated his murder. How rude.\n\nNote for any Republicans reading this paper: The above paragraph is meant to be satirical. Frankly, we fear it doesn’t rise above the level of mere sarcasm, but we’re pressed for time. We’re also a bit too aggravated by your peevish complaints to give much of a damn.\n\nIn fact, we are shocked—shocked—at how many rugged, gun-totin’ Republican Americans can so easily get their feewings hurt.\n\nBreathtaking Hypocrisy and Deceit\n\nTo the Editor,\n\nThe hypocrisy and deceit of the Republican Party is breathtaking. Notice how cleverly they assert that any criticism of this bigot is celebrating his death. Democratic leaders have without exception decried the murder of Charlie Kirk, but we object to those on the right reinventing him as a great American patriot. They compare to Martin Luther King, a bully who spoke with unending malice toward blacks, gay people, Jews, and others. The Republicans honor this man but had nothing to say about a recent school shooting and the assassination of two Democratic representatives in Minnesota. And recall how the likes of Ted Cruz, Kari Lake, and Donald Trump made fun of the attack on Paul Pelosi by some lunatic with a hammer. They know their claim that Democrats are promoting hatred is a lie. Trump’s Justice Department just buried a report which concluded that a solid majority of political violence in this country comes from the right.\n\nMichael Behrendt\n\nDurham, N.H.\n\nIt is pretty incredible. If this tendency had set in overnight, it would have been front page news: “Linguistic Epidemic: major political party forgets how language works.”\n\nIt’s happened gradually, though, over thirty years. It started when the GOP released the memo, “How to Talk Like Newt.” Here’s the tl/dr: act like a grade school pedant, twist the meaning of words inside out, pretend you’re pure as the driven snow while your opponent is satanic, and throw a hissy fit if anyone objects.\n\nOur corporate news media, fearful of losing their precious access, have consistently knuckled under throughout this sorry process. On those rare occasions when they’ve been called to account for their failure to defend plain English, they hide behind the skirts of their supposed neutrality.\n\nIs This a Reading Comprehension Problem?\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs Andru Volinsky’s Substack of September 24, 2025 makes clear (contrasting the N.H. Constitution with that of the state of Maine), those Republican “Free-Staters” and other poorly-informed politicians who do not feel it is the duty of the State of New Hampshire to provide an adequately-funded public education for all N.H. students would benefit from reading Part 2, Article 83 of the N.H. Constitution, to wit:\n\n“Knowledge and learning, generally diffused through a community, being essential to the preservation of a free government; and spreading the opportunities and advantages of education through the various parts of the country, being highly conducive to promote this end; it shall be the duty of the legislators and magistrates, in all future periods of this government, to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries and public schools, to encourage private and public institutions, rewards, and immunities for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, and natural history of the country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and economy, honesty and punctuality, sincerity, sobriety, and all social affections, and generous sentiments, among the people: Provided, nevertheless, that no money raised by taxation shall ever be granted or applied for the use of the schools of institutions of any religious sect or denomination.” [Emphasis added.]\n\nHow smart and insightful those early N.H. peoples were!\n\nHow foolish and unwise are those who, in violation of the N.H. Constitution, support the use of N.H. taxpayer funds ($Millions) to support voucher programs (“Education Freedom Accounts”) that fund religious and other academic endeavors with virtually no academic or financial accountability, and without any earned income limit that would exclude such well-off families from taking taxpayer funds!\n\nExeter, N.H.\n\nAh, yes, the dreaded Spawn of Benson. Perhaps after the great success of his Nosferatu, former Lee, N.H. resident Robert Eggers could find the backing for a sci-fi/horror film about their takeover.\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, Craig Benson was the first incumbent governor in 78 years to be denied re-election after a single term [2003-2005]. We frequently used to see the Governor’s Humvee lurking around town. On one memorable occasion, we watched it being driven across a sidewalk.\n\nFor two decades now, Benson has been New Hampshire Republicans’s version of Voldemort—“he who must not be named.” Then, in January, Governor Ayotte, who had been Benson’s legal counsel, then his Attorney General, took a shot at rehabbing her old boss. On her first day in office she made him chairman of a 15-member Commission on Government Efficiency. We haven’t heard much about that lately—which is probably a good thing.\n\nA Texan’s Screed Dissected\n\nDear Mr. Fowle,\n\nSeveral federal judges have created a form of protection for criminal migrants but, meanwhile, they ignored President Trump and the majority of American citizens that had the original purpose of deporting dangerous criminal migrants during the process of I.C.E.\n\nIt is believed that most of these judges (which were appointed by Presidents Obama and Biden) are the same judges that produced numerous injunctions for [the] purpose of blocking President Trump’s agendas, but [are] completely silent on the subject of anti-I.C.E. protestors.\n\nWhy is it happening in America that these biased judges (mainly, democrats) [sic] are constantly “trying” to control this country and not our president?\n\nThey should spend more of their time and effort to work on true and equal justice cases for ordinary American citizens.\n\nIndications show that these unelected judges have exceeded their authority and, thereby, should be removed from their current federal positions.\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\n\nIn an effort to make it more comprehensible, we took the liberty of breaking down your diatribe into single-sentence paragraphs. You’re welcome.\n\nYour first sentence crams in two lies about judicial intent, mis-characterizes the law, and conjures up a misinformed presumption about public opinion.\n\nYour second sentence uses the passive voice to assert judicial bias, but fails to provide any supporting evidence.\n\nYour third sentence—an ungrammatical mess, by the way—amounts to nothing more than distraught hand-waving.\n\nYour fourth sentence exposes the typical right winger’s chronic urge to control others.\n\nYou wind up by suggesting that all the above actually amounts to something. In our opinion, it does not.\n\nTrump Giving China the Upper Hand\n\nTo the Editor;\n\nInnovation is the prime driver of both productivity increases and growth in the economy. Process innovation improves productivity by making organizations more efficient, thereby using fewer resources to manufacture products or deliver services. Consequently, in competitive markets where large corporations do not have excessive bargaining power, wages tend to increase and prices to decrease, increasing the wealth of citizens. Innovation may also be the source of entirely new products or services, creating new demand that stimulates economic growth.\n\nThe process of innovation, however, is often misunderstood. Contrary to what some Silicon Valley barons like to claim, innovation is not solely the result of the creative brilliance of entrepreneurs. Rather, it is the result of a long-term, iterative process that builds on prior knowledge that often originates in institutions outside of the business that eventually commercializes an innovation. For example, it is estimated that two-thirds of innovative drugs introduced by Big Pharma can be traced back to research first sponsored by the National Institute of Health. Additionally, innovation is a highly uncertain process, characterized by trial-and-error experimentation that results in more failures than success. The trial-and-error process yields incremental learning necessary for development, but it can take years before commercial success is achieved. The process occurs within an ecology comprised of diverse organizations. Research institutions in universities as well as in government are necessary for the creation of basic knowledge that is the seed corn for all innovation. The financial support of both government agencies and commercial banks is necessary for providing the venture capital that supports the development of innovative ventures in their early stages. The commercialization of creative ideas must take place in both small and large businesses so that game-changing products or processes can be brought into the market. All these organizations are essential components of a network that must work together to ensure that innovation flourishes within the economy.\n\nThe U.S. has been the global leader in generating innovation for decades, attracting both venture capital and aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world. Today, that leadership is being challenged. The rate of breakthrough innovations in the U.S. is declining while China has achieved significant technological advances. Chinese manufacturers lead in electric car and solar panel design and manufacturing. They dominate rare earth battery technology, and several U.S. manufacturers are dependent on Chinese battery manufacturers for use in electric cars, energy storage systems, defense and military systems as well as a variety of consumer products. Alarmingly, recent reports show that China has surpassed the U.S. in the number and impact of published scientific research papers, and a global ranking of top research institutions lists eight Chinese institutes in the top ten while only one U.S. university (Harvard) made the list. These are canary in the coal mine statistics since the development of scientific knowledge is the launching pad for future innovations.\n\nChina is implementing a national strategy for economic growth based on innovation; meanwhile, the Trump administration is dismantling the American innovation infrastructure. His vengeful and arbitrary attacks on universities have resulted in the cancellation of billions of dollars dedicated to basic research while his chaotic government budget cuts have hamstrung many research projects. We will never know what benefits may have been generated from the cancelled research. Trump’s confused immigration policies have reduced the number of foreign graduate students and professors entering U.S. universities. This cohort has long been a source of creative discovery and entrepreneurship that has boosted the American economy. The President’s capricious intervention in the market, providing benefits to firms that support him while penalizing those that oppose him is nothing more than crony capitalism. Trump has generated a climate of fear and intimidation among corporate leaders that requires their obsequious subjugation to his whims, hardly the condition for starting bold ventures that create innovation.\n\nRobert D. Russell, Ph.D.\n\nHarrisburg, Pa.\n\nWe are disappointed but hardly surprised to learn that a man who lost money running a casino is now squandering America’s future.\n\nWhere the Founders Fell Short\n\nTo the editor:\n\nIn light of recent high-handed governmental interference—eliminating and/or intimidating persons and/or entities of their rightful and lawful free speech—perhaps certain changes to the First Amendment are now imperative. A proposed version suggested herewith, to wit:\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances; or to mock, criticize, needle, parrot, pillory, spoof, parody or lampoon any and all governmental or otherwise notable liars, fabricators, jackasses, boneheads, dim bulbs, dolts or vengeful pompous-ass ex-real-estate schmucks.\n\nBarnabas Umbrage\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nThe wisdom of this is self-evident. In retrospect, we are deeply disappointed that our sainted Founding Fathers failed to think of this.\n\nIn Which We Make AN EXCEPTION!\n\nDear Editor:\n\nDonald Trump is not a doctor, but he plays one on social media. Recently Trump posted, in all caps, to pregnant women, “DON’T USE TYLENOL UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, DON’T GIVE TYLENOL TO YOUR YOUNG CHILD FOR VIRTUALLY ANY REASON, BREAK UP MMR SHOT INTO THREE TOTALLY SEPARATE SHOTS (NOT MIXED), TAKE CHICKEN P SHOT SEPARATELY, TAKE HEPATITAS [sic] B SHOT AT 12 YEARS OLD, OR OLDER, AND IMPORTANTLY, TAKE VACCINE IN 5 SEPARATE MEDICAL VISITS.”\n\nThere is no legitimate medical scientific evidence to support any of Trump’s recommendations, in fact they have some serious risks associated with them. Where to begin?\n\nFirst, Trump’s advice regarding Tylenol fails to mention that Tylenol is simply one brand of the generic drug acetaminophen. Accordingly, he should have used the generic term to cover all brands containing acetaminophen if this was a real concern. Secondly, acetaminophen is used to reduce fever in young children. If Trump’s recommendation not to give it to young children “for virtually any reason” is followed, some parents may use aspirin to reduce fever as an alternative. This can be very dangerous since giving aspirin to children with fever caused by some viral infections can cause a potentially fatal case of Reye’s syndrome.\n\nWith regard to taking the MMR and Chicken Pox vaccine separately, these recommendations also come with risks, increased costs, inconvenience, and lack any supported medical evidence. And Trump seems not to know that children at 2, 4, and 6 months routinely receive a polio immunization and a combined diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine (DTP). I guess he is unaware of this combined vaccine schedule. Taking the MMR and chicken pox vaccine separately in five medical visits would extend the period of time a child is at risk of contracting one of these diseases and would add significant costs to cover unnecessary extra medical visits and cause more unnecessary inconvenience.\n\nTrump’s recommendations lack any immunological or other medical evidence to support them. Hopefully parents and pregnant women will take their medical advice from their trained and experienced health care providers.\n\nRich DiPentima, RN, MPH\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nWe have long had an aversion to publishing long blocks of text composed of upper case letters. The result is, in our view, ugly. In this case we make an exception, because we’re living in ugly times.\n\nOnly The People Can Fix America Today\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAmerica’s two grand political parties and their voluminous constituencies have lost the ability to discern between right and wrong. For one of the parties, white is right, and brown is wrong. Republicans are worried sick about the “great replacement” phenomenon, where Hispanics will surpass whites in population in America in maybe 10 years if mass deportations are not expedited like crazy. As far as the other party, imperialist war is right and peace is wrong. Democrat presidents provoked or championed the Mexican-American War of 1846 where we picked up our West Coast states, the Spanish-American War of 1898 where we got a bunch of islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific, World War I and World War II where we planted 800 military bases in 100 countries across the globe, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the War on Gaza, for starters.\n\nGovernment at the highest levels today is deeply corrupt and subversive of our foundational laws and values. Its everyday domestic goal is to sow chaos and despair on both national and state levels so that the electorate will exercise desperate and total faith in a leader who says he is the only one who can harvest what he has sowed. Government exports all this corruption out to the world by various means like speeches at the United Nations and by world leaders receiving “You are summoned to the Oval Office” notices to be lectured on the mandates of the Very Newest New American World Order.\n\nCorporations are given over to misleading or false advertising. Monopoly, perpetuation of outrageously high consumer interest rates, and regressive taxation are their holy trinity. Over a hundred years ago, the largely clandestine and soft-shoe activities of the Robber Barons were defeated by a coalition of both political parties. But today leaders of both parties protect a permanent class of aristocrats, plutocrats, and oligarchs operating proudly out in the open.\n\nChurches have been plodding along for a thousand years on faulty notions of ancient science and ancient spiritual matters, which were originally much more rational and much less mysterious than today’s doctrines. Conservative churches today go overboard on trying to overpower the secular world with Christian nationalism, while liberal churches act like tiny church mouses with their focus on behind-the-scenes volunteering at food pantries and marching in pride parades, not believing even for a minute that Jesus ever took a stand on the testy political issues of his own day.\n\nSchools and universities have no idea what the priority is for curriculum in a democratic republic. The whole purpose of literacy in the days of the Founding Fathers and Mothers was to enable school children to read and study the constitutions and histories of democratic nations so the fabulous new American republic could last maybe 500 years like the one in ancient Rome did. Instead, Americans have opted to go flaming out after only 250 years, like the Hebrew Republic did when it ignored Samuel’s warning and opted for the despotic rule of King Saul.\n\nScience has become politicized and is marshalled into the service of hurting people rather than helping them. Public health, once the linchpin of democracy in Athens, Rome, and biblical Israel, has now devolved into a tool used by the rich to impale and subjugate the poor so they have no strength to stand up against the ruling 1 percent class. Politics in electioneering has devolved into manipulation of electoral districts by gerrymandering, disappearing of election day ballot submission options, and outright force like the January 6th insurrection in the nation’s capital, rather than the much more familiar rational persuasion and intellectual reputation of the candidate.\n\nAmerican sports, entertainment, and news culture today is largely destructive, benefitting our filthy rich class rather than the mass audience. Once known to be immoral, unethical, and destructive of the social fabric of a democracy, today casino gambling and sports gambling, pornography, celebrity worship of studs and starlets, never-ending dull, sophomoric and anti-democratic Hollywood movies, daytime and primetime TV shows and streaming options, and newscasts focused on sensationalist videos about airport near plane wrecks, shark attacks, and other slop, fill American brains with toxic pablum that sits there taking the place of anything serious and sophisticated that might pass by their eyes and ears.\n\nAnybody willing to get to work fixing this mess today? If not, see you in the hell of our own making, neighbor.\n\nKimball Shinkoskey\n\nWoods Cross, Utah\n\nGee, when you put it that way, things seem kinda bleak!\n\nIt seems to us that your diagnosis fails to properly assign… what shall we call it? Power? Agency?\n\nHunter S. Thompson famously wrote, “Politics is the art of controlling your environment.” Your average American has about as much capacity to control his or her environment as a lab rat. Meanwhile, those who do have power, thanks to a half-century of tax cuts, lavishly fund think tanks whose Prime Directive is to generate new ways to set the rest of us at each others’ throats, so as to keep us too busy to gang up on them.\n\nHaving spent decades trying, we can assure you that no matter how limited our success, trying to exert some small measure of control over our information environment goes a long way towards making life—even under these circumstances—far more tolerable.\n\nRepublicans: Now The Party Of Death\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nHalloween is upon us, and the Republican Party is dressing up as the Grim Reaper. They’re trick or treating as the “Party of Death.”\n\nTrump appointed RFK Jr., a crank with zero medical or scientific expertise, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He has fired hundreds of doctors, medical researchers, and scientists. He rails against vaccines and proposes outlandish and fully debunked connections (autism and vaccines). Meanwhile, he rejects vaccinations, which have saved 154 million lives just since 1974.\n\nThe Party of Death has siphoned off hundreds of billions of dollars from medicaid and medicare, they have increased premiums on the affordable care act, and will force hundreds of hospitals, particularly in rural areas, to close. They gutted cancer research. And, the reason for this desperate need to “save” money: to provide multi trillion dollar tax breaks to the wealthiest families in the U.S.\n\nAt the same time, the Party of Death is stopping subsidies and research for renewable energy, promoting coal use and drilling for oil in national parks. All of this reduces the health of Americans significantly. U.S. coal burning puts 524 tons of mercury into the atmosphere annually.\n\nOf course all this fossil fuel activity is feeding global climate warming, which leads to massive hurricanes, floods, vast wildfires, drought, super hot summers, increased tornadoes, and thousands of deaths—all things climate scientists predicted years ago but the Party of Death rejected.\n\nMichael Frandzel\n\nPortsmouth, N.H.\n\nBen Franklin—who almost certainly stopped by our premises when he visited Portsmouth in 1763—wrote to a friend, late in life, “…in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes!”\n\nRepublicans, who have never been fond of our favorite old rogue, are now making us all suffer in their effort to dodge both.","summary":"To the Editor: Charlie Kirk, of Turning Point U.S.A., had a byline, “Prove me wrong.” Unfortunately, events appear to have proved him right.

I cannot stop the Trumpasaurians from thinking and saying and believing what they think and say and believe. But the real and actual truth is that I am not glad or grateful or relieved that Charlie Kirk was murdered.\n\nThere is, however, a kind of cosmic irony to his murder, a certain galactic symmetry, given that he himself publicly declared on April 5th, 2023: “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights.

Where was our president’s outrage when Minnesota Speaker of the House Melissa Hortman and her husband were gunned down by an evangelical Christian posing as a police officer? Where were Stephen Miller and Pam Bondi and Kash Patel?\n\nI do not rejoice over the murder of Charlie Kirk. But I am not going to shed a tear over his death. He was a racist, sexist, homophobic spewer of bigotry who stood for everything that is twisted and cruel and unkind about Trumpian America. My real regret is that the Trumpsters have turned this man who worried that Black airline pilots are not competent to fly, who believed that “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America,” that the “American Democrat party hates this country,” that successful Black women “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” but instead “steal a white person’s slot,” that separation of church and state is “a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it is not in the constitution,” that women should “reject feminism” and submit to their husbands, insisting “you’re not in charge.” My regret is that the Trumpasaurians have turned this man into some kind of sainted martyr.\n\nPeople who seem perfectly happy with the dismantling of our American constitutional republic and the transformation of American politics and civil society into dictatorship and authoritarian executive rule get upset when anyone equates what is happening in this country to what happened in Germany in the 1930s. My own senator, alleged Democrat John Fetterman, recently condemned the use of the words “fascism” and “Naziism” in connection with the Trump Administration (though his commitment to thwarting Trump’s policies has been questionable at best).\n\nAnd while historical analogies never hold up well under close examination because no two circumstances are ever identical, the similarities and parallels are certainly disturbing. Hitler came to power by legal means supplemented by quasi-legal actions and violent intimidation. Trump’s refusal to accept the outcome of the 2020 election, and his incitement to riot and insurrection can be called “quasi-legal” only because a Republican-controlled Senate did not have the courage or decency to declare it illegal and were intimidated by his power to punish them if they ruled against him. And he has not needed Brown-shirted thugs and bullies to intimidate his opponents, because he has been able to sue them endlessly or threaten their economic viability or have his Department of Injustice investigate them and charge them with crimes.\n\nAdolph Hitler and his Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels relied on what historians have come to call The Big Lie: if you tell a lie often enough, eventually people will believe it. Donald Trump and his Minions have gone the Nazis one better and turned all of reality into The Big Lie. Anything that contradicts their version of events, their vision of the world we live in, is Fake News.\n\nGlobal warming is nothing more than a leftist conspiracy. Voter fraud is rampant in America. Urban violence is out of control, but only in cities run by Democrats. Job creation and employment figures indicating that Trump’s economic policies are failing are fraudulent. Trump’s majority unpopularity ratings are falsified by biased pollsters. Leftist domestic terrorists are responsible for Charlie Kirk’s murder. An escalator that stopped working just as Trump and his third wife stepped onto it was a terroristic attempt to harm and perhaps kill the president. (Seriously. Did you hear the Fox News Talking Heads ranting about all of this? It would have been comical except that they were serious. And millions of their viewers actually believe them.)\n\nSo when I see what the Trumpsters are doing to Charlie Kirk, I just find it impossible not to think of Horst Wessel, the murdered Nazi who became the inspiration for the Nazi anthem, “Die Fahne hoch.’’ My very real regret about the murder of Charlie Kirk is the opportunity it gives Donald Trump and his Minions to take advantage of the murder to hasten the decline and fall of American Constitutional governance.\n\nW.D.

How does it work?","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday signed into law a deal that will allow hundreds of thousands of rideshare drivers to unionize and bargain collectively while still being classified as independent contractors. The legislation — a rare compromise between labor groups and Silicon Valley gig economy companies — grants collective bargaining rights to Uber and Lyft drivers, and follows years of political and legal battles over the job status of rideshare and delivery drivers. The new law does not apply to other types of gig workers, including those who deliver food through apps like DoorDash. Besides the collective bargaining deal, Newsom is also expected to sign a law backed by Uber and Lyft that would significantly reduce the companies’ insurance requirements. Newsom, with his signing of the deal, drew a contrast with Trump's posture towards workers and labor unions, with his administration banning collective bargaining at half a dozen federal agencies earlier this year. “Donald Trump is holding the government hostage and stripping away worker protections. In California, we’re doing the opposite: proving government can deliver,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"That’s the difference between chaos and competence.” Labor leaders from Service Employees International Union California, a powerful union that has been working for years to organize app-based drivers, say the deal is one of the largest expansions of private sector unions in 90 years, allowing hundreds of thousands of California gig drivers to gain a seat at the bargaining table. It does so by exempting workers from the state and federal antitrust laws that normally prohibit collective action by independent contractors. \"The gig economy isn’t going away, but worker exploitation doesn’t have to be part of it.” David Green, SEIU 721 President and Executive Director. Ramona Prieto, Uber’s Head of Public Policy for California, said in an emailed statement that the compromise \"lowers costs for riders while creating stronger voices for drivers — demonstrating how industry, labor, and lawmakers can work together to deliver real solutions.” Experts say the prospect of a union gives some gig workers their first-ever outlet to vent frustrations about workplace conditions. But how exactly does it work? And what are rideshare companies getting in return? Here’s what you need to know: Under federal law, employees in the U.S. can unionize by holding an election or reaching a voluntary agreement with their employers for a specific union to represent them. The process for California Uber and Lyft drivers under the collective bargaining law, called Assembly Bill 1340, would be somewhat different. A group can seek to be the bargaining representative for active drivers by collecting signatures from at least 10% of them. At that point, a group would be able to petition for access to names and contact information for all active drivers in California from the state’s Public Employment Relations Board, which is designated to oversee the unionization process. With that contact list, the process of organizing drivers would in theory become easier. Once a group signs up 30% of active drivers, they could petition the board for union certification. If more than one organization is in the process of gathering signatures, an election would be held to determine which would represent drivers. Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), who co-authored the bill with Marc Berman (D-Menlo Park), said the new process means drivers will be able to\"bargain for better pay and protections, and help build a future where the gig economy works for the people behind the wheel.” The law outlines a formula as to which drivers qualify as \"active\" based on a median number of rides they completed during the prior six month period, which determines who would be eligible to vote in the election. It's unclear at this point how many active drivers California has, as the number fluctuates, and rideshare companies do not release the information. Uber and Lyft will be required to submit data on active drivers to the state labor board on a regular basis under the new law. That path to collective bargaining mirrors a ballot initiative approved by Massachusetts voters last fall that was also backed by SEIU, which allows drivers to form a union after collecting signatures from at least 25% of active drivers in the state. Drivers affiliated with SEIU who supported the California bill said they spend long hours on the road, as many as 10 to 12 a day, but are not given the same protections as other workers. They say the law gives them an opportunity to negotiate their pay and other terms of their agreements with the companies. “Drivers have had no way to fight back against the gig companies taking more and more of the passenger fare, or to challenge unfair deactivations that cost us our livelihoods,” said Ana Barragan, a gig driver from Los Angeles in a statement. “We’ve worked long hours, faced disrespect, and had no voice, just silence on the other end of the app.\" Some driver advocates have worried the law may not be strong enough to ensure that drivers can reach a fair contract. Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine who studies the effect of technology on workers, had said the legislation does not clarify whether drivers would be protected if they collectively protested or went on strike, and doesn’t require that the companies provide data about wages. “These are the crux of what makes a union strong and the very, very bottom line of what members need and want,” Dubal said. “That they couldn’t achieve those things — that’s a win for Uber.” Michael Reich, a professor of economics and co-chair of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UC Berkeley who has closely studied the gig economy and advised on driver-related legislation, called a potential driver union \"a golden opportunity\" and the pair of laws \"a good deal for both sides.\" The insurance bill, backed by Uber and Lyft and introduced by state Sen. Christopher Cabaldon (D-Yolo), would reduce the amount of insurance that companies like Uber and Lyft are required to provide for rides. Uber said in a blog posted to its website, that the law helps to address \"one of the biggest hidden costs impacting rideshare passengers and drivers in California.\" Currently, the companies must carry $1 million in coverage per rideshare driver for accidents caused by other drivers who are uninsured or underinsured. The companies have argued that current insurance requirements are so high that they encourage litigation for insurance payouts and create higher costs for passengers. But beginning next year, passenger trips will instead be covered by $60,000 in uninsured motorist coverage per rideshare driver and $300,000 per accident. Uber said it will maintain $1 million in liability insurance to cover injuries or property damage in accidents caused by their rideshare drivers, as well as insurance that covers the cost to repair the driver's car, regardless of who is at fault for the damage. The companies are also required to maintain $1 million in occupational accident coverage under gig economy law Proposition 22, which is supposed to help drivers with medical bills if they’re injured while driving, no matter who is at fault, Uber said. After the California Legislature in 2019 rewrote employment law in 2019, clarifying and limiting when businesses can classify workers as independent contractors, Uber and Lyft went to the ballot in California, bankrolling an initiative to exempt their drivers. When California voters passed Proposition 22, the ballot measure the companies funded in 2020, drivers were classified as independent contractors who, under federal law, do not have the right to organize. Proposition 22 had language that explicitly barred drivers from collectively bargaining over their compensation, benefits and working conditions. But SEIU California argued that court decisions over Prop. 22 left an opening for the state Legislature to create a process for drivers to unionize, setting the state for lawmakers to introduce the collective bargaining bill. Uber and Lyft initially opposed the bill, until a deal was hammered out and announced in August. Times staff writer Laura Nelson contributed to this report.","summary":"Drivers for Uber and Lyft now have collective bargaining rights after a rare compromise between unions and Silicon Valley.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-03/new-law-signed-by-newsom-allows-ride-share-drivers-to-unionize","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9083305/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5614x3547+0+0/resize/1486x939!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F74%2F60af0b5d4a97a404545f8b8733c4%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyi","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-03 22:49:17","author":"Melody Gutierrez,Suhauna Hussain","authors":["Melody Gutierrez","Suhauna Hussain"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.215}]}
