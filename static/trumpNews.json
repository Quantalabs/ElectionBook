During a conversation with the media, Trump surprised many by sharing a photo with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hinting that the Russian leader might attend the global tournament.\nSharing an image taken during their meeting in Alaska, Trump remarked, “I believe he [Putin] will be coming [to the 2026 FIFA World Cup], depending on what happens.” He added, “He’s been very respectful of me and of our country but not so respectful of others.”\n\nDuring an announcement about the 2026 World Cup, US President Trump showed reporters a picture of himself and Putin taken in Alaska during their summit, which he says was given to him by the Russian President pic.twitter.com/FUwypoMyHc\n— Reuters (@Reuters) August 22, 2025\n\nThe comments came just minutes after Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. “I’m not happy about anything about that war — nothing… I think over the next two weeks, we’re going to find out which way it’s going to go, and I better be very happy,” Trump said.\n\n.@POTUS on the war in Ukraine: “I’m not happy about anything about that war — nothing… I think over the next two weeks, we’re going to find out which way it’s going to go, and I better be very happy.” pic.twitter.com/TFtQolUgy2\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) August 22, 2025\n\nTrump’s remarks on Putin appeared to catch many off guard, including the FIFA President, as Russia remains suspended from both FIFA and UEFA competitions. Following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian national and club teams were banned from international football “until further notice.” Consequently, Russia did not participate in qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\nAt Friday’s event, Infantino also presented Trump with the first official ticket to the 2026 World Cup. The ticket, labeled “Row 1, Seat 1,” bore the number “45/47”, a symbolic nod to Trump’s previous term as the 45th president and his current tenure as the 47th US President.\nTrump playfully asked Infantino about the US team’s chances of winning during the meeting. When the FIFA President asked the US President to touch and lift the FIFA World Cup trophy, the US President quipped if he could keep it.\nThe 2026 FIFA World Cup will mark the first time the tournament is hosted across three countries. The official draw is expected to take place in Washington this December. The last time the US hosted a World Cup was in 1994.","summary":"Trump’s remarks appeared to catch many off guard, as Russia remains suspended from both FIFA and UEFA competitions.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-says-putin-could-join-fifa-world-cup-2026-criticises-russia-ukraine-war-watch-ws-l-9522703.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-10-2025-08-09404df165f995b61ee1bb79f03f56d8.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 01:14:02","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":353434460,"title":"Born Sergey Gorokhovsky In Tashkent: Who Is Sergio Gor, Named New US Ambassador To India By Trump?","text":"On Friday, President Donald Trump announced on his social media platform, Truth Social, that he has named Sergio Gor as the next US ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs. \nThe appointment of Gor, a longtime political operative and close Trump ally, is pending US Senate confirmation.\nBorn in erstwhile Soviet Union\nSergio Gor, whose birth name is Sergey Gorokhovsky, was born in 1986 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, then part of the Soviet Union. His family later moved to Malta before eventually settling in the United States, where he became a citizen. \nAfter graduating from George Washington University, where he was active in conservative causes, he began his career in Washington politics.\nAssociation with Rand Paul\nGor’s early political work included roles with the Republican National Committee and serving as a spokesman for several Republican representatives. \nHowever, he is perhaps best known for his decade-long association with Senator Rand Paul, where he rose to become the Kentucky senator’s deputy chief of staff and communications director. In 2020, Gor pivoted to work directly with the Trump campaign, serving as the chief of staff for the Trump Victory Finance Committee.\nIn Trump’s ‘good books’\nHis influence within the Trump orbit grew significantly after he co-founded Winning Team Publishing, a conservative publishing house, with Donald Trump Jr. The company published several of the president’s books. In addition, Gor served as a senior advisor to the super PAC, MAGA Inc, and led another political action committee, Right for America, demonstrating his deep engagement with the pro-Trump political movement.\nPrior to his nomination as ambassador, Gor served as the director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office. In this role, he was responsible for vetting and hiring thousands of officials for the current administration, a task President Trump has publicly praised him for. Trump described Gor as a “great friend” and someone he can “fully trust to deliver on my agenda”. The appointment to the critical diplomatic post in India and the surrounding region signals the administration’s reliance on a trusted and proven loyalist for key foreign policy initiatives.","summary":"The appointment of Gor, a longtime political operative and close Trump ally, is pending US Senate confirmation","url":"https://www.news18.com/explainers/born-sergey-gorokhovsky-in-tashkent-who-is-sergio-gor-named-new-us-ambassador-to-india-by-trump-9522682.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Donald-Trump-and-Sergio-Gor-2025-08-c9c80f858804172b50f1b510ab93434c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 01:00:13","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.405},{"id":353433490,"title":"Hegseth orders National Guard troops in DC to carry weapons on patrol","text":"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., to carry weapons on patrol, according to multiple reports. \n\nThe nearly 2,000 troops “will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,” Fox News reported late Friday morning, citing an unnamed U.S. defense official. \n\nIt’s been over two weeks since the start of what the Trump administration is referring to as a crime crackdown, despite crime declining in recent years. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb called it a “hostile takeover” as he sued President Donald Trump and other administration officials. \n\nLast week, Trump announced he had placed the Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control and deployed about 800 National Guard troops to D.C.\n\n“I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor, and worse,” he said.\n\nThe number of National Guard troops in the capital has grown to nearly 2,000, with Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia sending soldiers. \n\n\"The Interim Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard retains the authority to make any necessary force posture adjustments in coordination with the D.C. Metropolitan Police and Federal law enforcement partners,” the defense official told Fox News. “The D.C. National Guard remains committed to safeguarding the District of Columbia and serving those who live, work, and visit the District.”\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on X Friday morning there have been 719 arrests made and 91 illegal guns seized in D.C. since Trump’s federal takeover. \n\n“Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member,” she said. “Thank you @POTUS for your unwavering support to make DC safe again!”\n\nDespite the Trump administration painting D.C. as a crime-ridden city, statistics released by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for D.C. in January showed violent crime went down by 35 percent in 2024, a 30-year low, after peaking in 2023.\n\nTrump thanked roughly 300 men and women from the Metropolitan Police Department, National Guard, Homeland Security Investigations and other federal agencies during a photo op at the U.S. Park Police facility in Anacostia Thursday evening.\n\n“We've had some incredible results that have come out, and it's like a different place. It's like a different city. It's the capital. It's going to be the best in the world,” the president told the crowd.","summary":"The number of National Guard troops has grown to nearly 2,000 as President Donald Trump continues his federal takeover of the capital","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dc-national-guard-armed-weapons-hegseth-b2812838.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/22/23/31/SEI262979447.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/EcKT4liw-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:58:38","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":353431268,"title":"Strictly Come Dancing contestants 'negotiate higher fees as danger money' due to string of scandals","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Aug 23rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGhislaine Maxwell believes Epstein was MURDERED but there was NO client list\n\nIrish band are hauled off stage at UK festival after starting pro-Palestine chant and brandishing flag - but are backed by rappers Kneecap\n\nGhislaine Maxwell's bizarre defense of Epstein as she reveals why he preferred younger women in DOJ grilling over billionaire's 'deviant' behavior: Live updates\n\nWhy the Palace was SO appalled by Harry's TV 'stitch-up'... and tasteless plea that came next: in a new edition of his peerless biography of the King, Royal author ROBERT HARDMAN reveals astonishing new details of Prince's behaviour.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:40 BST, 23 August 2025 |Updated:01:52 BST, 23 August 2025 \n\nStrictly Come Dancing contestants have reportedly 'negotiated higher fees as danger money' to compete in this year's series after it was hit by a string of scandals. \nAfter the show revealed its full line-up last week, it was been hit by fresh claims that bosses have called in police to investigate a new allegation into the show.\nDuring the last series, Wynne Evans, 53, was accused of inappropriate behaviour and forced to apologise for making an unacceptable sexual remark on stage at a press event. He denied it was a sexual remark but was later sacked by the BBC. \nIn 2023, Amanda Abbington, 51, complained about Giovanni Pernice, 34, being 'unnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean'. Whilst he was cleared of the 'overwhelming majority' of allegations, a probe did uphold some of her complaints of verbal bullying and harassment. \nThe same year, former Love Island contestant Zara McDermott, 28, was left 'incredibly distressed' following her experience in the training room with Graziano Di Prima, 31, who admitted to kicking the documentary maker, resulting in his axing. \nNow, according to reports, one celebrity agent has claimed some fellow agents have requested a 'higher fee' for their clients in response to the scandals. \n\nStrictly Come Dancing contestants have reportedly 'negotiated higher fees as danger money' to compete in this year's series after it was hit by a string of scandals\n\nAfter the show revealed its full lin-eup last week, it was been hit by fresh claims that bosses have called in police to investigate a new allegation into the show (Wynne Evans and Katya Jones pictured last year)\nA source told The Mirror: 'Everyone is a little more mindful about the fact that things can blow up - and one mis-step is all it takes. The phrase \"danger money\" has been bandied about.' \nAnother added: 'Some agents are becoming wary about putting their clients forward because of recent headlines.' \nHowever, a BBC source added: 'There has been no change when it comes to booking stars for this year's show, or the types of fees being requested or paid out.' \nDaily Mail has contacted the BBC for comment. \nIt comes as Strictly was hit with a fresh scandal just weeks before the new series kicks off.\nThe BBC have reportedly alerted the Metropolitan Police to investigate a new allegation, after lawyers began an inquiry into the series.\nThe broadcaster had already launched an inquiry into the family show amid claims two of its stars had used cocaine.\nAccording to The Sun on Sunday, detectives from the Met Police are allegedly examining other allegations.\n\nNow, according to reports, one celebrity agent has claimed some agents have requested a 'higher fee' for their clients in response to the scandals \nSources claim: 'It’s a significant new development in the BBC’s recent string of crises that they have now got the police involved in investigating allegations surrounding Strictly. This is a very dramatic turn of events.\n\n Strictly 'suffers fresh scandal as BBC call in the police after external probe into show' \n'Despite all the show and its team have been through over recent months, it’s hugely controversial that you’ve now got Scotland Yard detectives probing Strictly.\n'This is their biggest prime-time family entertainment show, so it’s not a good look for the BBC.'\nThe BBC declined to comment on any police investigations when contacted by the Daily Mail.\nA spokesperson for the broadcaster previously stated: 'We have clear protocols and policies in place for dealing with any serious complaint raised with us. \n'We would always encourage people to speak to us if they have concerns. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.'\nStrictly's new series has been hit by a string of scandals in the lead-up to its return, including revelations that the broadcaster had hired a law firm to probe allegations of drug use by two individuals.\nOne of the stars involved in the drugs probe was also suspected of drinking while working on the show after crew smelt alcohol on their breath.\n\nThe Sun alleged that it was widely known that the pair, who have not been named, took the Class A substance, and that one of these Strictly performers was known for being a drinker.\nThe publication have now reported that junior members of the team were asked to keep an eye on them during last year's show and to look for signs that they may have been boozing during work hours.\n\nSTRICTLY LINEUP 2025\n\nHarry Aikines-Aryeetey\n\nProfession: Olympic Sprinter and Gladiator\nHarry says: 'I'll be bringing tons of energy to light up the dance floor.

Also Read | Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1: Google Starts Rolling Out Latest Batch of OS; From Smarter Dark Mode to Themed Icons, Here's Everything You Need To Know.\nThat's after its deadline was extended first in January, then in April and later in June. The administration has \"very substantial American buyers\" lined up to acquire the firm, Trump said on Friday, echoing comments that he had made in June. But, he said, a deal, which would require China's approval, may not be reached in time for the deadline next month, as per The New York Times.\nCongress approved a US ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has so far extended the deadline three times during his second term -- with the next one coming up on Sept. 17.\nAlso Read | Black Moon 2025 Date and Time: Total Lunar Eclipse Set To Grace the Sky, Know When, Where and Whether It Will Be Visible in India.\n\"I haven't spoken to President Xi about it -- at the right time, I'll do it,\" Trump said, referring to China's leader, Xi Jinping. \"In the meantime, until the complexity of things works out, we just extend a little bit longer. But we have buyers.\"\nThe first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban -- approved by Congress and upheld by the US Supreme Court -- took effect. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.\nThe delays involving the law, which passed with broad bipartisan support and originally called for a sale by January, have raised serious questions about the limits of presidential power and the rule of law in the United States. Some legal experts opined to The New York Times that the actions represent an alarming expansion of presidential authority.\nTrump did not indicate who might be interested in buying TikTok, which has 170 million users in the United States. This year, officials in Washington had coalesced around a plan to bring on a group of new US investors that included private equity giants and venture capital firms.\nAnother extension would clash with some recent comments from Trump administration officials, who have suggested taking a harder line on TikTok. Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said last month that the app would \"go dark\" if China did not approve a deal for TikTok.\nLawmakers and intelligence officials have argued for years that TikTok poses a national security risk under Chinese ownership, because Beijing could use the app to seek sensitive data on Americans or to spread propaganda to advance its policy goals. TikTok has pushed back, saying it has safeguards in place to prevent such tampering.\nTrump made the comments on Friday at a museum run by the White House Historical Association.\nhttps://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1957937708057211300\nEarlier, on August 20, the White House joined TikTok.

The tariffs will not take immediate effect, but Trump indicated that a final decision could be made within the next 50 days, possibly by October.\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump detailed the plan. “Within the next 50 days, that Investigation will be completed, and Furniture coming from other Countries into the United States will be Tariffed at a Rate yet to be determined,” Trump wrote. He added, “This will bring the Furniture Business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and States all across the Union.”\nThe announcement triggered a swift reaction in financial markets. Shares of major furniture and home goods retailers, including Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma, dropped sharply in after-hours trading. In contrast, shares of La-Z-Boy, which manufactures most of its furniture in the US, rose on the news, reported Reuters.\nWhile Trump did not elaborate on the specifics of the investigation, a US official told Bloomberg that the Commerce Department is conducting the probe as part of its ongoing review into timber and lumber imports. The investigation falls under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose tariffs on goods considered vital to national security.\nIt remains unclear whether the proposed tariffs would be in addition to existing country-specific duties that Trump has negotiated through bilateral trade agreements.\nThe tariff plan aligns with Trump’s ongoing strategy to incentivise manufacturers to shift production back to the US, particularly in states with a legacy of furniture-making. States like North Carolina were once leading hubs of furniture manufacturing before much of the industry relocated overseas due to lower labour costs. According to government data cited by Reuters, employment in furniture and wood product manufacturing has declined significantly, from 1.2 million in 1979 to just 340,000 today.\nThe Trump administration is already weighing increased tariffs on a range of imported goods, including copper, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.","summary":"It remains unclear whether the proposed tariffs would be in addition to existing country-specific duties.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trump-announces-potential-tariffs-on-furniture-imports-decision-expected-by-october-ws-l-9522694.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/06/MixCollage-09-Jun-2025-01-31-PM-8177-2025-06-7887d33ba0a71805ab3608fadb60993d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:38:27","author":"New.storytailors,News18,World Desk","authors":["New.storytailors","News18","World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":353433746,"title":"Trump nominates close aide Sergio Gor as US Ambassador to India","text":"NYT News ServiceSergio Gor is the new US Ambassador to India\n\nUS President Donald Trump has nominated his longtime aide Sergio Gor, who is currently the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, as the next US Ambassador to India.

Documents show activations are planned in states including Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Virginia, and others, starting from late August through mid-November, as per Fox News. Texas is expected to have the largest number of Guard members. So far, fewer than 2% of the authorized troops have been mobilized, but the numbers are expected to grow in the weeks ahead. In Virginia, about 60 soldiers and airmen will begin training on August 25 to prepare for duty in early September. The Virginia National Guard said its members will not make arrests or carry out law enforcement tasks but will instead perform administrative and support roles under the direction of the state’s governor. What National Guard Will Do The Guard members will not directly enforce immigration laws but will provide support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Their duties include case management, clerical work, transportation, and logistical tasks. They may also assist with data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swabs, and photographing of migrants in ICE custody. A US defence official said that these tasks come close to law enforcement functions, so the troops will serve under Title 32 authority, a status that keeps them under state control while exempting them from federal restrictions like the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement. Trump’s Plan President Trump has signalled that the mobilizations in Washington, DC, may expand to cities like Chicago and New York. In last few weeks, nearly 2,000 National Guard troops from DC and six states have already been stationed in the nation’s capital to protect monuments, man checkpoints, and maintain a visible security presence. “These criminals need to be taken out,” Trump said on Friday in the Oval Office. “We’re going to make it safe, and then we’ll move on to other places,” he added. Pentagon officials said that the deployments in 19 states and the Guard’s presence in Washington, DC, are separate missions, even though both fall under Trump’s larger directive on immigration and territorial security. In DC, Guard members have been authorized to carry weapons if needed, while in the states, each governor decides how forces will be used. While most states are moving forward with mobilization plans, Vermont declined to activate its National Guard, despite Pentagon authorization. The rollout of Guard deployments is expected to be gradual, beginning in states like Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, and Nevada in early September. Officials said timelines will vary by state since the final decision rests with governors.

But the reverse is a reminder that the road ahead will be bumpy and apprehension will arise from statements that could be bad news for companies in the sector.\n\nThe upset in the past few days was aggravated by remarks from US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick about the types of microchips that the $4.3trillion (£3.2trillion) Silicon Valley titan Nvidia sells to China.\n\nThis reaction suggests that it’s time to assess your exposure to the sector – and to consider data centres, which are one of the new ways to bet on the upheaval to be wrought by AI.\n\nThese massive sheds, full of computers that store, process and disseminate data, are central to the expansion of AI, hence being hailed by some as ‘the engines of modern life’.\n\nFulfilling the demand for these mega warehouses is predicted to trigger a $3trillion (£2.2trillion) construction frenzy, with as much as $500billion (£370billion) being spent on power plants and transmission systems alone.\n\nShares of companies involved in this boom have leapt in line with these forecasts. The price of GE Vernova, the US group that provides data centre ‘electrification solutions’, has jumped by 231 per cent over the past year.\n\nBut even it retreated this week following a warning from Sam Altman, the billionaire boss of OpenAI – the $500billion (£370billion) US group behind ChatGPT, the ground-breaking generative AI system.\n\nEarlier this month, Altman said: ‘Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is, yes.’ But he continued: ‘Is AI the most important thing to happen in very long time? My opinion is, also, yes.’\n\nThese words, which coincided with a study showing businesses’ expenditure on AI is not showing returns, spooked Wall Street traders who have been driving up shares in key AI players. This list includes the ‘Magnificent Seven’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) as well as Palantir, the defence and health analytics titan.\n\nYou are likely to have money in all or some if you hold global funds. This is not time to flee, but to find out more about the outlook and explore opportunities in the vast spaces of data centres.\n\nPrepare for Volatility\n\nAltman compares current conditions in tech stocks with the dot-com bust of 2000.\n\nBen Rogoff, manager of Polar Capital Technology, the FTSE 100 investment trust, thinks a better comparison is with 1995 to 1998, when the internet’s development was gathering pace.\n\nHe says: ‘During that time the US tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose by about 350 per cent.\n\n‘But there were seven big drops along the way. There are always challenges when you are on a steep and rapid innovation curve – AI is an innovation on the scale of the internet, or steel.’\n\nTwo shocks have already hit the sector this year. In January, ChatGPT seemed imperilled by DeepSeek, its low-cost Chinese rival. And in April, Donald Trump’s tariffs announcement sparked another tumble.\n\nEnthusiasm was soon rekindled. Nvidia was $178.21 (£131.65) yesterday, having recovered from its April low of under $87 (£64.28) and analysts are forecasting a further advance. Shares are more than 31,000 per cent higher than a decade ago.\n\nPolar Capital Technology is a ‘maximalist AI trust’, says Rogoff, structured to put investors ‘in the front row of the revolution’.\n\nHe argues that we cannot yet tell how great the disruption caused by AI will be, but that one of the breakthroughs could be a ‘democratisation’ of healthcare, with low-cost access to Harley Street-style medical expertise for low-income patients.\n\nThe latest evidence indicates that the speed of the transformation may be scary.\n\nPauline Llandric, technology portfolio manager at AXA Investment Management, comments: ‘AI has moved from tech curiosity to an essential tool for consumer and companies, as evidenced by OpenAI’s ChatGPT whose weekly active users rose from about 400m in February to 700m this month.’ You cannot invest in OpenAI, but Microsoft has a slice of the group.\n\nHow to back the construction boom\n\nThe focus on data centres reflects the growth forecast for the spread of warehouses whose requirement for energy and water is ever more controversial.\n\nAccording to one prediction, US data centres could gobble up 25 per cent of the nation’s gas and electricity by 2030. Meanwhile, every request made to ChatGPT uses 500ml of water – about the same as two small glasses.\n\nAt present the global data centre market is worth about $243billion (£179.60). But by 2032 this is forecast to soar to $585billion (£432.40).\n\nIn the UK the number of data centres is poised to increase by about 20 per cent from the current 477, with some funding coming from Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet.\n\nThese provide cloud computing services to businesses through data centres which is why, in 2026, they will be splashing out £295billion on these edifices.\n\nAmong the British names aspiring to exploit this trend is Segro. This real estate investment trust (Reit) used to be known as Slough Estates; nowadays it operates more than 30 data centres in this Berkshire town which is Europe’s largest data centre hub. Segro says it should deliver a 9 to 10 per cent return from this activity. This compares with a 6.9 per cent net yield from its distribution warehouses. Its shares are down 10pc this year, but analysts are targeting a rise from the current 646.8p to 802p.\n\nTritax Big Box, another Reit, is also aspiring to be a major player, developing an operation in Slough. Analysts’ target for the trust’s shares is 174p, against the current 142.5p.\n\nAmong Polar Capital Technology’s holdings are four US groups engaged in what is being called the data centre ecosystem – Equinix, Credo Technology, GE Vernova and Vertiv.\n\nThe trust also invests in two British businesses – Rolls-Royce, whose small nuclear reactors will provide power to data centres, and Filtronic. This Aim-listed business manufactures radio frequency components, another of the items essential to data centres. Its shares have doubled over the past year to 135p.\n\nAlec Cutler, a portfolio manager at Orbis Investment, is keen on the ‘enablers’ such as British infrastructure specialist Balfour Beatty and Prysmian, the Italian cable maker.\n\nGerrit Smit, manager of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, cites two more such companies, both American: the electrical equipment maker Amphenol; and Eaton, a supplier of electrical infrastructure.\n\nThe revolution has just begun\n\nIt is also worth looking at the ‘pick and shovels’ stocks, a reference to the riches amassed by the retailers of tools during the US gold rush which were far greater than those of most prospectors.\n\nNvidia is seen as the ultimate pick and shovel play, explaining why brokers Morgan Stanley believe that shares could move to $206 (£152.11).\n\nCutler argues a better buy could be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which makes Nvidia’s microchips. Its shares are a mere 880 per cent above their level of a decade ago – the kind of figure on which people will be concentrating in the weeks to come.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven and others may see themselves as the sure-fire winners in the revolution but, as wise investors realise, it’s far too early to tell.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThis week&#8217;s abrupt sell-off in technology stocks – even after yesterday&#8217;s rally&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Continue to Support the AI Revolution Even Though Technology Stocks Are Declining first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/business/continue-to-support-the-ai-revolution-even-though-technology-stocks-are-declining/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rewrite-this-title-Dont-give-up-on-AI-revolution-despite.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:31:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.039},{"id":353428216,"title":"Redistricting Tug-of-War: California, Texas Clash Over Congressional Map Redrawing | Midterms | 4K","text":"Last Updated:August 23, 2025, 06:00 IST Crux Videos\n\nThe battle to redraw congressional maps is heating up as California and Texas take opposing actions that could impact future elections.

His reaction was clearly one of admiration, marking the moment as a diplomatic success.\n\nThe letter, shared by Trump on his Truth Social page recently, was an emotional appeal to the Russian leader, focusing on the plight of children, without directly referencing the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nMelania’s message articulated: ‘Every new generation begins life with innocence and purity that transcends borders, politics, and beliefs, a notion I’m certain you’ll appreciate, Mr. Putin.’\n\n‘Yet in today’s world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them… Mr Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.’\n\nFor many in Washington, the emergence of former-model Melania, 55, who was born in Slovenia – then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – as a serious player on the international political scene has come as a surprise, not to say a shock.\n\nDuring her husband’s first term at the White House, after all, she was openly mocked as being out-of-touch and politically inept. But while some have accused her of being a ‘part-time’ First Lady since Trump’s second term began in January, insiders say that is well wide of the mark.\n\nNot only is Melania relishing her role, she is actively influencing her husband, pushing him, for example, to end the war in Ukraine. In part, this is a bid to cement the Trump legacy – a key preoccupation for the First Lady.\n\nAs if to make the point, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky hand-delivered a letter written by his own wife Olena – addressed to Melania – during his visit to the White House just a few days ago. \n\nThe source said: ‘Olena’s letter hasn’t been made public but it thanked Melania for her support and for focusing on the plight of the children. Melania’s letter was a masterclass in shifting the conversation. It flattered Putin without going too far. People are taking her seriously. She’s the one who matters when it comes to dealing with her husband. She has his ear.’\n\nSocialite Toni Holt Kramer has known Melania since 2011. A member of the club at Mar-a-Lago in Florida where Melania spends much time, Mrs Holt Kramer heads The Trumpettes, an all-female fundraising group.\n\n‘People have always underestimated Melania because she’s the opposite of her husband,’ she said. ‘He loves to be in the public eye, loves being the centre of attention. Melania isn’t shy but she’s a private person.\n\n‘During their first term she undoubtedly had some struggles. Barron [their son] was a young boy, she wasn’t surrounded by good people and she was picked on relentlessly by her husband’s political rivals.\n\n‘The Melania you meet today is strong, confident, very much her own woman. She knows what she wants and, for sure, she is the person who the President listens to the most. He trusts her implicitly. She is enjoying it much more this time around.’\n\nSo, what has changed? For starters, says Mrs Holt Kramer, Barron is now 19 and off at university, ‘so she doesn’t have to worry about him so much’.\n\nThen there was the assassination attempt when a bullet grazed Trump’s ear as he campaigned in Pennsylvania in July last year. Mrs Holt Kramer said: ‘Everything changed in that moment, how could it not? The president has become very religious. He believes he was saved for a reason. It profoundly affected Melania.’\n\nFriends and those who work alongside the Trumps say they are both now ‘utterly focused’ on their legacy. ‘This is his second and final term in the White House and there is a sense of urgency,’ a close political ally told the Daily Mail last night.\n\n‘Melania is in the driving seat. She wants her husband to go down in the history books as a peacemaker, a deal-broker, a man who not only saved America but saved the world too. She has been urging him to make peace deals, with Russia/Ukraine being the ‘big one’. She is far more involved than people know.’\n\nEven steadfast political foes like Hillary Clinton say Mr Trump should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize if he successfully negotiates a peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nMrs Holt Kramer said Melania has no aspirations to outshine her husband, yet some suggest that were he to receive the Nobel Prize – an oft-stated ambition – it should be awarded jointly to her.\n\n‘That’s not her style at all,’ responds the friend. ‘The First Lady has never made a secret of the fact that she considers being a wife and mother her greatest accomplishment.\n\n‘Make no mistake about it, she is very much an equal partner.’\n\nMelania influenced her husband’s volte-face on the Israeli-Palestine conflict, for example, with Trump acknowledging ‘real starvation’ in Gaza for the first time last month.\n\nAs Trump said at the time, ‘Melania thinks it is terrible. She sees the same pictures that you see and we all see. Everybody, unless they are pretty cold-hearted or worse than that, nuts, thinks there’s nothing you can say other than it’s terrible when you see the kids.’\n\nIn her only interview since returning to the White House, the First Lady told Trump-friendly Fox News: ‘Maybe some people, they see me as just the wife of the President but I’m standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts. I have my own ‘yes’ and ‘no’.\n\n‘I give him my advice and sometimes he listens and sometimes he doesn’t and that’s OK.’\n\nBut it’s when it comes to Putin – who Trump repeatedly called ‘a great guy’ during his campaign – that Melania has brought the greatest influence to bear.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Melania took to social media platform X to send her prayers to the people of Ukraine. A source said: ‘Melania grew up in a communist-run country and came to the West in her 20s. She is careful not to say publicly which side she’s on but privately it’s clear where her loyalties lie.’\n\nTrump, who stunned the world by shouting down Zelensky during a White House visit in February this year, recently admitted he no longer sees the Ukrainian leader as the one blocking a path to peace. \n\nAt a meeting with the Nato secretary general Mark Rutte on July 15 he said: ‘I’d get home, I’d say: ‘I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’ll turn on the television or she’ll say to me one time: ‘Wow, that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’\n\n‘Melania is very smart. She’s very neutral. She’d like to see people stop dying.’\n\nCritics have complained Melania has only been photographed a handful of times at the White House, preferring to spend her time in her 3,500 square-foot private villa at Mar-a-Lago or her gilt-lined penthouse flat inside Trump Tower on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe source close to Trump said: ‘Just because you don’t see her, don’t assume she’s not there. He’s on the phone to her all day long.’\n\nFor now, Melania is focused on carefully building her husband’s legacy but also her own – as the ‘quiet power’.\n\nHer official portrait set the tone for her second term as First Lady – a ‘power shot’, which showed her leaning over a boardroom table wearing a sharp Dolce & Gabbana trouser suit with the Washington Monument gleaming behind her.\n\nMelania has just finished filming a $40 million (£30 milion)documentary for Amazon Prime’s streaming service with Hollywood director Brett Ratner (responsible for the Rush Hour franchise starring Jackie Chan). It is scheduled for release later this year.\n\nA source involved with the project said: ‘It’s a look inside Melania’s world. People will be surprised. It’s not all ladies’ luncheons and visits to [her hairdresser] Frederic Fekkai.’\n\nShe is currently finalising her wardrobe for the Trumps’ State Visit to Britain next month when they will meet the King and Queen at Windsor Castle.\n\nPlans are in place for the couple to meet Prince William and, possibly, the Princess of Wales although that has yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe Trump source said: ‘This is an unprecedented second State Visit for a US President. The President met your late Queen Elizabeth during his first State Visit [in 2019] and is a huge fan of the Royal Family. He is very much looking forward to meeting King Charles and Queen Camilla.’\n\nA friend of Melania’s said she is ‘acutely aware’ of an embarrassing moment during the 2019 State Visit when Trump barged in front of the late Queen as they inspected a guard of honour.\n\nAppearances matter to Melania, and that’s why ‘she’s been working on her wardrobe choices for months,’ said her friend. ‘This time, nothing will go wrong. Underestimate her at your peril.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt was billed as a triumph of diplomacy for two of the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Why Melania is Committed to Preserving Donald Trump&#8217;s Legacy first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/why-melania-is-committed-to-preserving-donald-trumps-legacy/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Why-Melania-is-determined-to-secure-Donald-Trumps-legacy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:29:38","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.361},{"id":353430274,"title":"Davina McCall reveals she will never marry again but is 'always in the honeymoon period' with partner Michael Douglas as she discusses their relationship","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaturday, Aug 23rd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGhislaine Maxwell believes Epstein was MURDERED but there was NO client list\n\nIrish band are hauled off stage at UK festival after starting pro-Palestine chant and brandishing flag - but are backed by rappers Kneecap\n\nGhislaine Maxwell's bizarre defense of Epstein as she reveals why he preferred younger women in DOJ grilling over billionaire's 'deviant' behavior: Live updates\n\nWhy the Palace was SO appalled by Harry's TV 'stitch-up'... and tasteless plea that came next: in a new edition of his peerless biography of the King, Royal author ROBERT HARDMAN reveals astonishing new details of Prince's behaviour.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy LAURA PARKIN, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:01:01 BST, 23 August 2025 |Updated:01:28 BST, 23 August 2025 \n\nDavina McCall has revealed that she will never marry again but is 'always in the honeymoon period' with her partner Michael Douglas. \nThe TV presenter, 57, who has been married twice before, gave an insight into their relationship ahead of her latest dating show. \nDavina was friends for years with celebrity hairdresser Michael, 47, but they only began dating after she finalised her divorce with ex-husband Matthew Robertson in April 2018. \nDavina was married to Matthew for 17 years, and had three children with him, Holly, Chester, and Tilly. Previously she was married to Andrew Leggett from 1997 until 1999. \nAdmitting that she's isn't looking to tie the knot again, she told The Mirror: 'We go on honeymoons all the time but without getting married. We're in the honeymoon period even after all these years.\n'I couldn't be more happy. And sometimes there's an idea of, why change anything?' \n\nDavina McCall has revealed that she will never marry again but is 'always in the honeymoon period' with her partner Michael Douglas\n\nThe TV presenter, 57, who has been married twice before, gave an insight into their relationship ahead of her latest dating show\nDavina explained how her late father taught her that every successful relationship needs 'friendship, attraction, trust and respect'. \nShe added: 'And if any of those things are lacking, love can't flourish. And I think he was absolutely spot on.' \nShe and Michael met when he styled her hair during her stint on Big Brother. \nWith so much in common, the pair stayed good friends until they realised they had romantic feelings for each other.\nThey went public with their relationship in 2018 and by January 2023, Michael had moved in with her. \nDavina is currently preparing for the release of her new dating show Stranded On Honeymoon Island. \nThe show is a bold reality dating format that sees 12 unlucky-in-love singletons matched into couples who marry on the spot - then immediately begin their honeymoon on a remote tropical island.\nDavina will host the show, guiding the newlyweds as their instant marriages are put to the test in paradise.\n\nShe told The Mirror: 'We go on honeymoons all the time but without getting married. We're in the honeymoon period after all these years'\n\nDavina was married to Matthew Robertson (pictured) for 17 years, and had three children with him. Previously she was married to Andrew Leggett from 1997 until 1999\nRevealing it was the 'sexiest series ever', Davina told The Sun: 'Obviously, you don’t want it to turn into some kind of soft porn TV programme, but there are couples who get intimate, I’m going to say that much.\n'It’s part of saying how much you like someone. Saying we’ve taken it to the next stage or something like that.' \nSpeaking about the show in March, Davina told the BBC: 'I am a serial matchmaker…. So I jumped at the chance to host the BBC's new dating show.\n'I can't wait to meet our couples and find out how they get on when they're Stranded on Honeymoon Island. For some it will be challenging and others, idyllic!!! Hopefully it's the start of some very beautiful relationships.'\nDavina McCallBig BrotherMichael Douglas\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDavina McCall reveals she will never marry again but is 'always in the honeymoon period' with partner Michael Douglas as she discusses their relationship\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Among the group, an individual identified as Adrian Guerrero was charged with assault and destruction of federal property after allegedly slashing the tire of a government vehicle and threatening to stab a law enforcement officer.\n\nAccording to the press release Guerrero repeatedly yelled, “I’m going to fuck you up,” “I’m going to go after your family,” and “I’m going to stab you” while standing arm’s length from an officer. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Acting US Attorney Points Out ‘Bizarre’ Trend In California Anti-ICE Rioter Cases)\n\n“Our brave ICE law enforcement are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens. These acts of violence are fueled by sanctuary politicians’ rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in the press release.\n\n“We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down,” Noem added. “Every day our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators.”\n\nUpon being arrested at the scene, officials found a black knife, a patterned headscarf, and orange-tinged goggles with Guerrero.\n\nDuring the operation, ICE agents attempted to conduct their sworn duties when the mob of rioters allegedly “surrounded and assaulted four federal agents outside the building,” according to DHS. Multiple agents sustained injuries, including some from pepper spray deployed by rioters and a jammed finger.\n\nThe attack against ICE agents comes amid an increase in anti-ICE riots as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on illegal migrants.\n\nIn early August, an ICE office in Washington had a rock thrown through its window, and a fire was set on the back of the property. While no injuries were reported, the attack comes as border czar Tom Homan and Gov. Noem have warned about the rise in violence against ICE and other officials.\n\nAccording to DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, assaults against ICE law enforcement have increased a staggering 830% since President Donald Trump returned to office in January.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In under 48 hours, nearly 500 volunteers answered the president's call of duty, as assignments became available via USAJOBS.com. Recruiting agencies include Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \"This is a national security problem, and our civilians have the critical skill sets to support DHS in their mission,\" Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary for Civilian Personnel Policy Michael A.

This follows several events in the previous weeks in which Donald Trump butted heads with Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, before reversing stance and signaling US interest in investment in Intel. Trump administration officials have shared that the US government will transfer grants from the CHIPs act under previous President, Joe Biden, into equity to complete the deal.\n\nUS federal investment into Intel was announced by US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, via his personal social media this week. The deal is meant to support the US push to bring tech manufacturing back to the States and reduce reliance on overseas chips and components:\n\n\nBIG NEWS: The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies.This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America’s technological edge.Thanks to Intel… pic.twitter.com/AYMuX14Rgi\n— Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) August 22, 2025\n\n\n\nLutnick would go on CNBC to further explain that the US government intends to tap the CHIPs Act of 2022 under Joe Biden to pay for much of the investment into Intel:\n\n\"We should get an equity stake for our money,” Lutnick told CNBC. “So we’ll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We’ll get equity in return for it.”\n\nThe investment from the US government is interesting considering Intel has been struggling for years, having disclosed a $7 billion loss in 2023 related to costs of spinning up new chip foundries.The company initiated a cost reduction plan that included mass layoffs earlier this year, but it has still yet to find its footing amid increasingly strong competition.\n\nWith the investment from the US government and Trump administration, Intel may yet scrape itself out of its rough position, but it remains to be seen where this investment will lead. Stay tuned to the Intel topic for further updates.","summary":"The Trump administration previously signaled interest in investing in the struggling chip maker and will use funds from Biden's CHIPs Act for the investment.","url":"https://www.shacknews.com/article/145623/intel-intc-us-government-10-percent-investment","image":"https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2025/08/22/the-united-states-of-america-officially-owns-10-of-intel-intc-stock_feature.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:25:02","author":"Tj Denzer","authors":["Tj Denzer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":353431264,"title":"Ghislaine Maxwell claims it was Sarah Ferguson who introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein - not her","text":"Ghislaine Maxwell has sensationally claimed she did not introduce Prince Andrew to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nInstead, it was Andrew's wife Sarah Ferguson who pushed for a friendship with the convicted paedophile, she said.\n\nAnd she defended the Duke of York, saying he is innocent of the sex allegations against him and that the 'bull****' claims were fabricated to make money and to attack the Royal Family.\n\nHer bombshell comments were revealed in audio tapes and a 380-page transcript, released last night, of a two-day interview convicted child sex trafficker Maxwell had with US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month.\n\nShe provided no incriminating information on high-profile individuals but spoke about her interactions with several well-known names.\n\nDisgraced socialite Maxwell, 63, defended Andrew against allegations made by the late Virginia Giuffre that she had been trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17.\n\nAndrew has always vehemently denied the allegations against him.\n\nMaxwell, daughter of billionaire publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, repeated her claims that the photo of her standing behind Andrew and Virginia isn't real. 'I believe it's literally a fake photo,' she told officials.\n\nShe insisted Andrew was introduced to Epstein through his ex-wife Sarah, who had met Epstein via US socialite Lynn Forester De Rothschild.\n\nShe said: 'I did not introduce him [Epstein] to Prince Andrew. That's a flat untruth. Lynn Forester had a house… and invited Epstein to go and I believe that's where he met Prince Andrew. \n\n'However, I believe that before that event he had gone to the Bahamas and had hung out with Sarah Ferguson. And Sarah had called Epstein and had arranged with Lynn. I think Sarah is the one that pushed that.\n\n'I couldn't even imagine Epstein and Andrew together. And I thought that Sarah was trying to put the moves on Jeffrey.' \n\nMaxwell described the Duchess of York as 'a frenemy', saying: 'I don't know if she liked me... I think my friendship with her ex-husband, well, sometimes she really did like me and sometimes she didn't. So maybe a frenemy. I think there was some latent hostility.'\n\nShe also said that Epstein told her to organise a trip that Andrew was making to New York, saying: 'He wanted to make sure that Andrew was taken care of and that he was comfortable, he had whatever he needed.'\n\nMaxwell also denied there was a 'client list' of powerful men, saying: 'There is no client list.' She added that Epstein was 'proud to flaunt royal connections'.\n\nMs Giuffre's name has been redacted from the documents. Maxwell said: 'The allegation was that at my house in London, in March 2001... we went to London, especially so that X [Virginia] could have a relationship with Prince Andrew and she was paid a vast amount of money for that purpose.\n\n'And that she then got in… my bathroom in my house and had sexual relations with him and then went into my guest room and had full-blown sex.\n\n'And a photograph was taken of them just before all these events took place in my study... I think it's absolute rubbish.'\n\nShe said her Victorian bath was too small for Andrew and Virginia to have sex in: 'There is no way in God's green earth if that had taken place, that this is something that you would miss, because you couldn't miss it.'\n\nMaxwell said she was not even sure Prince Andrew and Virginia had ever met. She said: 'I do not know that they met. I don't have any recollection of that.' \n\nBut then she seemingly backtracked to say: 'Could Andrew have come to the house to see me or see Epstein and she had been there? Yes, I can't say that didn't happen.'\n\nMaxwell said she placed mirrors around her tiny bathroom at her London mews home to make it seem bigger. \n\nShe said: 'She [Virginia] could say she was having sex with 5,000 generations of the Royal Family because that's how far back you could see yourself.'\n\nShe accused Ms Giuffre, who committed suicide earlier this year, of making up the story for financial gain: 'I can absolutely, categorically say that I never, at any time, set Andrew up to have relations with her or any other human being ever.\n\n'I believe that story was created for the purposes of – well, there are multiple. The first one is financial ... for the serialization, both of her book and [her story] in the papers. And for the story to attack the Royal Family.'\n\nMaxwell is currently serving 20 years for her 2021 convictions on sex trafficking charges. She has appealed to the US Supreme Court to hear her case. \n\nShe told Mr Blanche she believed Epstein may have been murdered, saying: 'I do not believe he died by suicide, no. If it is indeed murder I believe it was an internal situation.'\n\nMaxwell defended President Donald Trump – whose administration has been rocked by claims of a cover-up over the Epstein Files – saying she never heard that Trump acted inappropriately 'absolutely never, in any context'.\n\nShe said: 'The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.' She also said Mr Trump never received massages from underage girls. \n\nShe added that she never saw anyone behaving inappropriately with a woman 'of any age' but said her definition of 'inappropriate' could differ from others.\n\nMaxwell also said she did not remember Trump submitting a sketch to a book she put together for Epstein's 50th birthday. \n\nMr Trump is suing the Wall Street Journal over claims he wrote a note to Epstein which included a sketch of a naked woman with his signature as the pubic hair.\n\nMaxwell mentioned other big names including Bill Clinton, saying: 'President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend.'\n\nShe claimed Clinton only travelled on Epstein's jet for philanthropic trips and never visited the paedophile's private island.\n\n'He never. Absolutely never went,' Maxwell said. 'I don't believe he had an independent friendship with Epstein.'\n\nAnd she mentioned Tesla billionaire Elon Musk saying she met him at Google co-founder Sergey Brin's birthday party: 'We went to another friend's island and we were together for... three or four days.'\n\nSupermodel Naomi Campbell struck up a friendship with Epstein and may have gone to his Island, Little St Jeff's, nicknamed 'Paedo Island', Maxwell claimed.\n\nMaxwell said of Campbell: 'I believe she may have gone to the island and she may have gone to see his house in New York... They were friends. Her friendship with Mr Epstein was independent of me.'\n\nMaxwell also mentioned a trip she took to Africa alongside President Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey and comedian Chris Tucker on Epstein's private jet, nicknamed the 'Lolita Express.'\n\nAnd she said she went to Virgin billionaire Sir Richard Branson's private Necker Island in the Caribbean with Epstein, adding: 'I wouldn't characterize Branson and him as friends but he did go, and I think I went with him.'\n\nMaxwell attempted to whitewash claims she was Epstein's madam – made by multiple victims – saying: 'I am not here to defend him. But I never knew about it.'\n\nMaxwell claimed both Epstein and she had 'medical conditions' that prevented them from having a lot of sex. Epstein told her he had a heart condition and she explained she had a medical condition which 'precludes me having a lot of intercourse'.\n\nShe acknowledged that at one point Epstein began preferring younger women but insisted she never understood that to 'encompass children'.\n\nShe was interviewed on July 24 and July 25 in a Tallahassee federal courthouse close to the jail where she was sent after her conviction. She was told that she would have immunity over anything she said in the interview unless it transpired to be a lie.\n\nThe Duchess of York was contacted for comment.","summary":"Maxwell also defended the Duke of York, saying he is innocent of the sex allegations against him and that the 'bull****' claims were fabricated to make money and to attack the Royal Family.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15026767/Ghislaine-Maxwell-Jeffrey-Epstein-Sarah-Ferguson-Prince-Andrew.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/23/00/100837025-0-image-m-10_1755906487136.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:23:32","author":"Caroline Graham,Editor","authors":["Caroline Graham","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":353430022,"title":"Justice Department won't defend grants for Hispanic-serving colleges, calling them unconstitutional","text":"The Trump administration said Friday it will not defend a decades-old grant program for colleges with large numbers of Hispanic students that is being challenged in court, declaring the government believes the funding is unconstitutional.\n\nIn a memo sent to Congress, the Justice Department said it agrees with a lawsuit attempting to strike down grants that are reserved for colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding Latino students were attending college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.\n\nJustice Department officials argued the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity.\n\nThe state of Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action organization sued the U.S. Education Department in June, asking a judge to halt the Hispanic-Serving Institution program. Tennessee argued all of its public universities serve Hispanic students, but none meet the “arbitrary ethnic threshold” to be eligible for the grants. Those schools miss out on tens of millions of dollars because of discriminatory requirements, the lawsuit said.\n\nOn Friday, the Justice Department released a letter in which Solicitor General D. John Sauer notified Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that the department “has decided not to defend” the program, saying certain aspects of it are unconstitutional. The letter, dated July 25, cited the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action, which said “outright racial balancing” is “patently unconstitutional.”\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nTennessee is backed in the suit by Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative legal group that successfully challenged affirmative action in admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. That suit led to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that forbids universities from considering students’ race in admissions decisions.\n\nEdward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said Friday the group would decline to comment.\n\nMore than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grant program. Congress appropriated about $350 million for the program in 2024. Colleges compete for the grants, which can go toward a range of uses, from building improvements to science programs.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden made Hispanic-serving universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding. President Donald Trump revoked the order his first day in office.\n\nTrump is taking steps to dismantle the Education Department and has called for massive funding cuts, yet his 2026 budget request preserved grants for Hispanic-serving colleges and even asked Congress for a slight increase. Even so, there have been doubts about his administration’s commitment to the funding.\n\nA national association of Hispanic-serving universities filed a motion last month to intervene as a defendant in the Tennessee lawsuit, voicing concern that the federal government would not adequately represent the group’s members.\n\nThe Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities said Trump’s agenda is “entirely adverse” to the group’s interests, citing the president’s aim to close the Education Department entirely. The administration is “on record denouncing programs like HSIs, that take account of and seek to redress ethnic or racial disparity,” the group wrote.\n\nTennessee and Students for Fair Admissions did not object to the group’s request to lead the legal defense.\n\nUnlike historically Black or Native American tribal colleges and universities, which receive their designations based on their missions, any college can receive the HSI label and grants if its Latino enrollment makes up at least 25% of the undergraduate student body.\n\nThe list of HSIs includes flagship campuses like the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona, along with many community colleges and smaller institutions.\n\nIn its court filing, the national association argues the grants are constitutional and help put its members on an even playing field.\n\nThe group’s schools enroll 67% of the nation’s Latino undergraduate students, yet studies find those schools receive far less in state and federal funding than other institutions.

Epstein’s friendships with wealthy and powerful individuals have fuelled conspiracy theories that others were involved with his crimes, but no one other than he and Maxwell have been criminally charged.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021 for helping Epstein abuse underage girls. She pleaded not guilty and is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction.\n\nIn interviews while campaigning, Trump pledged to release government records pertaining to the Epstein investigation and left open the possibility that Epstein’s death had not been a suicide.\n\nIn February, when asked by Fox News whether the Justice Department would be releasing what a reporter called Epstein’s client list, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, “It’s sitting on my desk right now to review.”\n\nTrump was ‘always very cordial’, Maxwell tells DOJ\n\nBlanche’s interview of Maxwell on 24 July and 25 July came as Trump sought to tame the political fallout from the Justice Department’s decision not to release the files.\n\nIt is rare for a justice department official as senior as Blanche — who has also served as Trump’s personal lawyer — to directly interview a criminal defendant. The conversation also came as Maxwell’s lawyer, David Markus, said Maxwell would welcome clemency from Trump.\n\nTrump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell’s trial the financier’s longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, testified that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane multiple times. Trump has denied flying on the plane.\n\nMaxwell told Blanche she never saw Trump receive a massage or engage in other inappropriate activity.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nGhislaine Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey Epstein, told a top US official&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Ghislaine Maxwell Informs US Justice Department of No Knowledge Regarding Epstein&#8217;s &#8216;Client List&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/au/ghislaine-maxwell-informs-us-justice-department-of-no-knowledge-regarding-epsteins-client-list/","image":"https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/73b4bf2/2147483647/strip/false/crop/1650x758+0+74/resize/1234x567!/format/jpeg/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fd2%2F08c85e2b47ab969ad162a4e7c5c6%2Fghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-eps","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:21:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":353431032,"title":"'How stupid do these people think we are?'

In the Netflix documentary \"The Truth About Jussie Smollett?,\" Smollett spoke about the messages he read on social media rallying behind him after he claimed to have been the victim of a racial and homophobic attack in January 2019. The documentary featured a news clip rounding up messages from A-listers like Viola Davis and John Legend, as well as then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who said, \"Homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie.\" FROM JUSSIE SMOLLETT TO BYU, THE MEDIA'S HISTORY OF PEDDLING RACE HOAXES A clip of President Donald Trump's reaction was also included, saying at the time that the alleged attack was \"horrible.\" \"There was a moment when I went on social media, and I felt like I was being eulogized,\" Smollett said. \"I felt like I had died, and I was alive to see - and what people were saying was so kind, but it was too much for me.\" \"It made me very uncomfortable, made me very extremely embarrassed. It made me feel extremely emasculated,\" he continued. Later in the documentary, Smollett attempted to fend off the questions that had swirled around the time of the controversy, including why he refused to hand his phone over to the police, which he said was to hide his drug use, as well as why he was walking around at 2 o'clock in the morning. He claimed he \"always did that.\" JUSSIE SMOLLETT CALLS CHICAGO PD AND RAHM EMMANUEL ‘VILLAINS' WHILE DENYING HATE CRIME HOAX In the early hours of Jan. 29, 2019, during a historic polar vortex in Chicago, Smollett alleged he was attacked by two MAGA hat-wearing thugs who yelled racial and homophobic slurs at the actor while he was out getting a Subway sandwich, yelling \"This is MAGA country!\" He claimed the two men assaulted him, poured bleach on him and tied a noose around his neck. The incident was quickly denounced by the left, including then-Sen. Kamala Harris who called the attack a \"modern day lynching.\" The media similarly offered sympathetic coverage. \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts sat down with Smollett for his first interview following the alleged incident, offering minimal skepticism to his claims. CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS As it turned out, it was a hoax. Police said Smollett orchestrated the attack, hiring two Nigerian brothers to assault him while wearing red hats. Smollett was later charged and convicted for his crimes against the city of Chicago but was let out of jail just six days into his 150-day sentence. Smollett's conviction was later overturned in 2024, and the actor reached a settlement with the city of Chicago in May.

The tariff hike was set to take effect immediately, at 12:01 am the following day.

Greg Abbott pushing through a new congressional map to benefit Republicans and California Gov. Gavin Newsom seeking to do the same for Democrats, Obama lent a weary world his wisdom.\n\n“Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he began in a Wednesday post on X.\n\n“But,” he stipulated.\n\nBut of course.\n\n“Since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Gov. [Gavin] Newsom has approached this,” insisted Obama.\n\n“He’s put forward a smart, measured approach in California, designed to address a very particular problem at a very particular moment in time.”\n\nWho didn’t see that one coming?\n\nObama’s high opinion of himself has only ever been matched by his scorn for the masses.\n\nHe hopes no one will notice his blatant projection: Obama himself personally participated, to put it lightly, in a highly beneficial gerrymander over 20 years ago.\n\nWithout a doubt, the former president’s initial suggestion has merit. \n\nIt would be wonderful if House districts were drawn so as to be maximally representative of discrete communities, and to keep representatives maximally attuned to their constituents’ interests.\n\nPerhaps one day the two parties will come together to ensure as much.\n\nAlas, that’s not the world we live in today.\n\nAs it stands, both sides are locked in an unforgiving battle to enshrine the most structurally advantageous maps into law in as many states as possible.\n\nIn Illinois, where Texas Democrats initially fled to deny Abbott the quorum needed to pass his new map, Democrats represent 14 of 17 districts, or more than 82% of the state.\n\nYet Kamala Harris won Illinois last year by fewer than 11 percentage points, 54.4% to 43.5%.\n\nDemocrats achieved this feat by creating a map so preposterous that even Stephen Colbert felt compelled to ask Prairie State Gov. JB Pritzker about it during an otherwise softball interview.\n\nIn New Jersey, where President Donald Trump won 46% of the vote in 2024, the GOP holds just 25% of the congressional seats.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Trump won 36%, but Republicans hold none of the state’s nine seats.\n\nTrump actually won Nevada, yet Democrats occupy three of its four spots in the House.\n\nAnd in California, where Newsom is supposedly championing a “smart, measured approach” — and where a supposedly independent commission is responsible for redistricting — the GOP is already at a massive disadvantage.\n\nTrump won over 38% of the vote in the country’s largest state, and Republicans represent only about 17% of its districts.\n\n“We’re responding to what occurred in Texas. We’re neutralizing what occurred, and we’re giving the American people a fair chance,” Newsom declared before signing his plan into law on Thursday.\n\nJust how much more lopsided must it be for elections to be “fair” to “the American people,” by which Newsom means “the Democratic Party”?\n\nNow, it’s undeniable that Republicans have also drawn unrepresentative maps in states they control.\n\nWisconsin, Texas and the Carolinas are particularly damning examples.\n\nBut with both Team Red and Team Blue adopting no-holds-barred approaches to redistricting, honest observers must admit that gerrymandering is a bipartisan pastime in which all’s fair — even if it shouldn’t be.\n\nAnd that’s precisely what makes Obama’s claim to the moral high ground so galling.\n\nNewsom has every right to advance his undemocratic map; Obama has every right to support it.\n\nThey ought not insult our intelligence by flattering themselves, though.\n\nThey’re motivated by the same political objectives that Republicans are, not some nobler commitment to principle that excuses their actions — much less makes them deserving of praise.\n\nObama is the same ambitious, self-serving partisan he was back in 2001, when he personally helped draw an Illinois state Senate district to boost his political prospects after falling short in a House campaign the year prior.\n\nThe lines he created gave him new constituents in some of Chicago’s wealthiest neighborhoods — donors he tapped to fuel his ascent to the US Senate and, not long after, the White House. \n\nSo much for only reluctantly endorsing Newsom’s proposal to retaliate against Texas: Obama himself embraced the power of the gerrymander in a smoke-filled room decades ago.\n\nHis haughty tone now is perfectly representative of the Democrats’ collective hero complex.\n\nNot to mention their palpable disdain for the public, whom they believe can be duped into believing in it.\n\nIt adds insult to injury — and sanctimony to sin.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Barack Obama took blue California's side in the redistricting fight with Texas, but his own history with gerrymandering makes his claim to the moral high ground galling.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/22/opinion/hypocrite-obama-scorns-gerrymandering-unless-it-helps-him/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/OB121212.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:09:36","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":353426552,"title":"'I Look Extremely Good In Shorts': Trump's 'Leg-Pulling' About Playing 2026 World Cup, Keeping FIFA Trophy","text":"In a characteristic display of his public persona, US President Donald Trump veered from a substantive announcement to offer a personal assessment of his physical appearance. Speaking at the White House on Friday, the President was flanked by FIFA officials as he announced that the 2026 World Cup draw would be held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.\nDuring the press conference, a reporter asked if he would participate in the December draw and whether he might consider wearing shorts, given the athletic context of the event. President Trump, whose public attire is almost exclusively a suit and tie, responded with a confident boast about his own physique. “I look extremely good in shorts,” he said, to a mix of chuckles and nods in the room. He did not directly confirm whether he would be wearing them for the event, instead pivoting back to the importance of the World Cup.\n\nThe comment, while seemingly off-the-cuff, highlights a consistent theme in the President’s public remarks: his focus on physical image and self-assured confidence. It also follows recent reports about his health, specifically a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency in his legs that the White House disclosed in July. The medical condition, which can cause swelling, led to speculation about his overall health, a topic he has consistently sought to dismiss.\nWhen a reporter asked him if he would take part in FIFA events, Trump said, “I may play. I see the money these players make. I am a very good athlete.”\nAs FIFA chief Gianni Infantino showed the World Cup trophy to Trump, saying it was “only for winners”, the US President grabbed the coveted prize and held on to it. “Can I keep it?” he joked. “We’re not giving it back! It’ll fit very well on the wall over there.”\nBy making a lighthearted and assertive comment about his appearance, President Trump sought to project an image of vigour and good health. The remarks quickly circulated on social media, becoming a topic of discussion that, for a moment, overshadowed the official announcement of the World Cup draw.","summary":"The President was flanked by FIFA officials at the White House as he announced that the 2026 World Cup draw would be held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC","url":"https://www.news18.com/viral/i-look-extremely-good-in-shorts-trumps-leg-pulling-about-playing-2026-world-cup-keeping-fifa-trophy-9522686.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-6-2025-08-00dbd8b9458d741f650b1c06dd83eb68.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:07:00","author":"News18,Pathikrit Sen Gupta","authors":["News18","Pathikrit Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.26},{"id":353429172,"title":"Let another government body pay for it","text":"I’ve been belatedly reading Jeremiah Joyce’s 2021 book “Still Burning: Half a Century of Chicago, from the Streets to the Corridors of Power; A Memoir.” The former 19th Ward alderman and Southwest Side state senator is a conversational writer and speaks frankly about some very divisive times, particularly regarding race. (It can get cringey.)\n\nJoyce is remembered now as a consummate insider, but he came up the hard way without regular party support. It wasn’t until he forged a bond with Richard M. Daley, the first Mayor Daley’s son, that he came into his own as a power broker.\n\nAnyway, what I wanted to tell you about was one of Joyce’s observations of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who died in office in 1976 during Joyce’s one and only aldermanic term.\n\n“Over time,” Joyce wrote of the first Mayor Daley, “he developed a firm though rarely spoken theory of Chicago government — let some other entity pay, whether it be the state, the county, a regional body, or the federal government.”\n\nIt was true then, and it’s still true today, although perhaps stated more bluntly by the city’s current mayor and some of his closest allies.\n\nWe saw it again for the umpteenth time last week when Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates castigated the governor and the Democratic legislative majorities for not spending more on the city’s public schools.\n\nGates, Mayor Brandon Johnson’s most visible ally, was responding to Gov. JB Pritzker’s remarks to reporters that CTU’s demand for $1.6 billion in additional state funding is “just not going to happen.”\n\n“And it’s not because we shouldn’t,” Pritzker clarified. “We should try to find the money, but we don’t have those resources today, and we’re not going to see the resources from the federal government level either.”\n\nPritzker went on to blame the Trump administration. “The federal government has taken away education funding from schools all across the United States,” he said, adding the state has increased funding by $2.5 billion during his time in office.\n\n“We are all having to deal with the onslaught of Donald Trump on education in this country, and I’m going to continue to stand up for and protect students across the state of Illinois, including students in the city of Chicago,” the governor continued.\n\n“But, at the local level, every school is going to have to do whatever is it is required in order to protect those students, and I will stand with them in that endeavor. But there is not extra money laying around in Springfield, mainly in part because of what Donald Trump has done at the federal level.”\n\nCTU President Gates issued a blistering response: “Logic would tell you that if the Republican despot in the White House is defunding public education, then a state with a Democratic supermajority should take the opposite approach by fully funding schools in its largest district. There was no delay in giving $10 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest businesses and individuals in our state, so why do Black and Brown children have to wait?”\n\nThe CTU has mentioned these “$10 billion in tax breaks” quite often, so I reached out and asked what that was all about.\n\nFor the most part, these aren’t actually “tax breaks.” Instead, almost $6 billion, according to CTU spokesperson B. Loewe, comes from the Illinois Revenue Alliance’s list of potential tax hikes on corporations, although a very small part of that is from closing corporate tax loopholes.\n\nAnother $4.5 billion is from not imposing a state surcharge on annual income over $1 million, which would require a constitutional amendment and couldn’t be implemented until after the 2026 election, if voters approved it.\n\nLoewe also pointed to several state incentives criticized by a group called Good Jobs First, including tax breaks for electric vehicles, data centers, and TV and film production.\n\nBut it’s not like state leaders can snap their collective fingers and suddenly produce $10 billion in new revenues. Lots of labor unions, particularly the trades, would strenuously object to some of these ideas.\n\nWhat the CTU really wants is an immense expansion of the state tax base.\n\n“Why do students at Carver Elementary have to go without their flag football team?” Gates asked. “Why are educators being told to conserve toilet tissue and paper towels? Why does everyone have to subsidize the foot-dragging of our governor and Democratic General Assembly.” \n\nFrom the first Mayor Daley to the present, some things never change.\n\nRich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com.

National Guard soldiers and federal agents on the streets last week with a mandate to reduce crime.\n\n\"It was horrible and Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long, because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, referring to Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser.\n\nRecent statistics, which Trump dismissed, show crime has declined in the US capital since a 2023 peak.\n\nWashington is a unique federal enclave, established in the US Constitution and falling under the jurisdiction of Congress, not belonging to any state.\n\nIn 1973, Congress passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, allowing residents to elect a mayor and council members.\n\nContinuing his off-the-cuff remarks at the White House, Trump mused about extending his efforts to other cities. He has declined to explain how the federal government could intervene in local law enforcement in cities outside of the federal enclave of DC.\n\n\"Chicago is a mess,\" Trump said, deriding its mayor.\n\n\"And we'll straighten that one out probably next.\"\n\nTrump said some of his supporters in Chicago have been \"screaming for us to come\".\n\n\"I did great with the Black vote, as you know, and they want something to happen,\" he said.\n\n\"So I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.\"\n\nAs in Washington, crime, including murders, has declined in Chicago in the last year.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said he took Trump's comments seriously but has not received formal communication from the administration about federal law enforcement or military deployments.\n\nThe mayor said Trump's approach has been \"unco-ordinated, uncalled for and unsound\".\n\nHe added: \"There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them.\"\n\nNew York City, also criticised by Trump, has reported a steady decline in violent crime in recent decades, and now has a relatively low murder rate among big American cities. Trump also threatened federal government intervention in San Francisco, another city governed by Democrats.\n\nWhile the Republican president has cast his efforts as an urgent move to help residents feel safe again, Democrats and other critics say he aims to expand the powers of the president beyond the bounds of the Constitution and assert federal control over cities run by Democratic officials.\n\nThe US Constitution's Tenth Amendment generally prevents the federal government from commandeering state or municipal officials and from intervening in states' legal and criminal justice systems unless citizens' constitutional rights are being violated.","summary":"Critics have slammed US President Donald Trump's purported claims about crime in America's big cities as \"unco-ordinated, uncalled for and unsound\".","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/crime/trump-threatens-more-us-cities-with-federal-takeover-c-19776575","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-19776575/7c182882d9a4a4805dbd83003b6b54d6cd1bc8b0-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:01:44","author":"Andrea Shalal","authors":["Andrea Shalal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":353427848,"title":"Trump has taken over DC.

Escribió que los demandados estatales y federales no pueden llevar a nadie a la instalación más que aquellos que ya se encuentran detenidos. La orden no prohíbe modificaciones o reparaciones en las instalaciones existentes, “que sean únicamente con el propósito de aumentar la seguridad o mitigar riesgos ambientales o de algún otro tipo en el lugar.”\n\nLa orden preliminar incluye “a aquellos que están en concierto activo o participación con” el estado de Florida o los demandados federales o sus funcionarios, agentes, empleados”, escribió la jueza en una orden de 82 páginas.\n\nLa jueza dijo que los funcionarios estatales nunca dieron una explicación suficiente del por qué la instalación necesitaba estar en medio de los Everglades. “Lo que es evidente, sin embargo, es que en su apuro por construir el campamento de detención, el estado no consideró ubicaciones alternativas”, dijo Williams.\n\nLos esfuerzos por preservar los Everglades\n\nWilliams dijo que su orden daba tiempo a los demandados estatales y federales para reducir gradualmente los trabajos en la instalación de modo que pueda someterse a las evaluaciones ambientales requeridas. Mencionó más de 75 años de esfuerzos por preservar los Everglades.\n\n“Desde entonces, cada gobernador de Florida, cada senador de Florida y un sinnúmero de figuras políticas locales y nacionales, incluidos presidentes, han prometido públicamente su apoyo inequívoco a la restauración, conservación y protección de los Everglades”, escribió. “Esta orden no hace más que cumplir con los requisitos básicos de la legislación diseñada para cumplir esas promesas”.\n\nEl presidente Donald Trump recorrió la instalación el mes pasado y dejó entrever que podría ser un modelo para futuros centros de detención en todo el país, a medida que su gobierno se apresura a expandir la infraestructura necesaria para el aumento de deportaciones.\n\nGrupos ambientalistas y la tribu Miccosukee habían argumentado que las obras y operaciones del lugar debían detenerse hasta que las autoridades federales y estatales cumplieran con las leyes ambientales. Su demanda afirma que el proyecto ponía en riesgo humedales sensibles que son hogar de flora y fauna protegida y revertiría miles de millones de dólares en restauración ambiental.\n\nEve Samples, directora ejecutiva de Friends of the Everglades, calificó el fallo como una victoria histórica para los Everglades y los estadounidenses que creen que este ecosistema en peligro debe ser protegido.\n\n“Envía un claro mensaje de que las leyes ambientales deben ser respetadas por los líderes en los niveles más altos de nuestro gobierno, y que hay consecuencias por ignorarlas”, subrayó Samples en un comunicado.\n\nEl presidente de la tribu Miccosukee, Talbert Cypress, dijo que esta no es la primera vez que la tribu ha tenido que luchar por su tierra y sus derechos.\n\n“Siempre defenderemos nuestra cultura, nuestra soberanía y a los Everglades”, dijo Cypress en un comunicado.\n\nLos abogados de los demandados estatales y federales no respondieron de momento a consultas. Anteriormente han argumentado que, aunque el centro de detención albergaría a detenidos federales, la construcción y operación de la instalación están completamente bajo el estado de Florida, lo que significa que la ley ambiental federal no se aplicaba.\n\nLa jueza ha dicho que la instalación de detención era, como mínimo, una asociación conjunta entre el estado y el gobierno federal.\n\nConstrucción apresurada\n\nEl centro de detención se construyó a toda prisa hace casi dos meses en un aeropuerto de entrenamiento de una sola pista en medio de los Everglades. Actualmente alberga a varios cientos de detenidos, pero fue diseñado para recibir eventualmente hasta 3.000 detenidos en carpas temporales.\n\nDentro de las grandes tiendas blancas del complejo, filas de literas están rodeadas por jaulas de malla metálica. Las personas detenidas en el lugar afirman que la comida tiene gusanos, los inodoros no funcionan y las aguas residuales inundan los pisos, mientras que los mosquitos y otros insectos están por todas partes. A veces, los aires acondicionados se apagan abruptamente en medio del calor sofocante. Los detenidos afirman que pasan días sin ducharse o recibir medicamentos recetados, y sólo pueden hablar con abogados y seres queridos vía telefónica.\n\nTestigos de los grupos ambientalistas declararon durante la audiencia que se habían agregado al menos 8 hectáreas (20 acres) de asfalto a la instalación desde que la División de Manejo de Emergencias de Florida comenzó la construcción. Añadieron que el pavimento adicional podría llevar a un aumento en la escorrentía de agua hacia los humedales adyacentes, esparcir químicos dañinos en los Everglades y reducir el hábitat de la pantera de Florida, un animal en peligro de extinción.\n\nLos abogados de las agencias federales y estatales han pedido a Williams que desestime o transfiera la solicitud de orden judicial, diciendo que la demanda se presentó en la jurisdicción incorrecta. Williams dictaminó el jueves que su tribunal era el lugar adecuado.\n\nOtra jueza federal en Miami desestimó esta semana parte de una demanda que afirmaba que a los detenidos se les negaba el acceso al sistema legal en el centro de detención de inmigrantes, y luego trasladó los cargos restantes del caso a otro tribunal.\n\nLas demandas se dirimen mientras el gobernador de Florida, el republicano Ron DeSantis, aparentemente se preparaba para construir un segundo centro de detención de inmigrantes en un complejo de entrenamiento de la Guardia Nacional de Florida en el norte del estado.","summary":"“Las deportaciones continuarán hasta que mejore la moral”, dijo el portavoz de DeSantis, Alex Lanfranconi","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/22/jueza-florida-debe-detener-la-expansin-del-centro-de-inmigracin-alcatraz-de-los-caimanes/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FLORIDA-C193RCEL_PARA_INMIGRANTES_96928.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-23 00:00:52","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.587},{"id":353430892,"title":"Lorne Michaels says Fallon, Meyers are safe at NBC following Colbert cancellation","text":"\"Saturday Night Live\" creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels expressed confidence that NBC's late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers are safe after CBS' stunning cancellation of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\" In an interview with Puck News' Matt Belloni, Michaels said that he was \"just stunned\" by the Tiffany network's announcement last month that it was pulling the plug on Colbert's late-night program in May.

At the ET World Leaders Forum, he said India doesn't hyphenate trade and geopolitics, which stand on their own. Goyal said the government wants to decriminalise more sections under the Jan Vishwas programme. He underlined that Press Note 3 was context-specific and \"when times change, decisions can be made to suit the time.\" India Inc ‘Super-confident’“Geopolitical considerations or wanting to look good will never drive India's trade decisions… We are multilateral in every dimension, but when it comes to opening India's market and expanding trade, our stakeholders, their views and their best interests are paramount,” Goyal said. “What's good for the industry and the country, that's what drives us for a deal.”With US President Donald Trump stepping up his tariff threats against India, American trade negotiators have postponed their visit to the country for the next round of talks on the bilateral trade agreement (BTA) that was scheduled to start August 25. Trump has threatened to double the tariff on Indian goods to 50%.India Inc isn’t worried about this, Goyal said.Live EventsBusinesses have told him they are working on several alternatives and are “super-confident that this year will be better than last year.”The government is also looking to address the issue. “India is looking at the entire situation very strategically, realistically and is not reacting to the situation,” he said.“Our ministry and different line ministries are already looking at complementarity of our strength areas with other economies, so that we can look at expanding trade with other countries,” the minister said. “Maybe buy some more from them what we need, sell some more what they need. So there are different ways in which we can ameliorate this current situation, until we are able to come to a settlement.”When asked about Press Note 3, which mandates government approval for FDI coming from countries that share a land border with India, Goyal said the move has to be seen in its context. “We decided on coming out with Press Note 3 as a strategic decision,” he said, referring to the post-Covid drop in valuations of Indian companies.Goyal said India engages regularly with the European Union over their proposed trade agreement and there are certain non-tariff barrier issues on both sides that are under consideration and discussion.“So we are working very actively, and I would think it's very much doable,” he said, adding that a trade pact with New Zealand will be completed in the next few months. India’s agreement with Oman should be concluded by next month, he said. “We are working with Eurasia, Central Asia and other countries. So there is a lot on the plate,” he said.The government is also looking at opportunities to expand trade partnerships in key sectors along with other ministries.On the pact with the Asean, the minister said, “We are certainly very concerned because domestic industry gives us quite a negative feedback about the Asean trade deal done during the Congress regime.”As part of increasing the ease of doing business, Goyal said the government plans to expand Jan Vishwas 2 in the next few days. “We have decriminalised 355 sections… want to take it up to 1,355,” he said.As part of the upcoming GST revamp, the government is looking at how many labour-intensive sectors, such as food processing and textiles, can be supported through the indirect tax framework to give domestic demand a boost.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onIndia US trade relationsPiyush Goyaltariff threats by TrumpIndia's trade strategytrade dealsIndia trade partnershipsbilateral trade agreementAsean trade dealJan Vishwas programmeET World Leaders Forum\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

PRICE\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — With National Guard troops in the streets and federal agents at the door of his former adviser, President Donald Trump spent a heavy dose of his Friday channeling his inner tourist and reliving his bygone days as a sports team owner and construction mogul.\n\nHe stopped by a gift shop near the White House, visited the Kennedy Center that he now chairs and returned to his increasingly gilded Oval Office to trumpet the U.S. cohosting next year’s World Cup.\n\n“We have a lot of fun,” Trump said. “We’re fixing up the whole world.”\n\nThe president’s stops around the city came as the nation’s capital is increasingly on edge amid Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and federalization of Washington’s police force in an effort to better curb crime.\n\nJust before he left the White House, officials announced there had been 76 arrests citywide the previous evening as part of the crackdown. The Pentagon also said National Guard troops patrolling the streets of D.C. would soon start carrying weapons.\n\n“We are going to make D.C. totally safe. When people come from Iowa, Indiana, all of the beautiful places, and they come, they’re not going to go home in a body bag,” Trump said after visiting the People’s House exhibit and its gift shop. “They’re not going home in a coffin, and it’s very safe right now.”\n\nWith the crackdown now entering its third week, however, many Washington residents and visitors don’t feel as safe as the president suggests, with persisting concerns that the White House is amplifying racist narratives about urban crime and tearing down homeless camps where the most vulnerable live.\n\nTrump has shrugged off criticisms and declared, when asked about the FBI searching the home and office of his former national security adviser John Bolton, “I’m actually the chief law enforcement officer.” Still, he spent far more time looking and acting like a president relishing the parts of the job that make him happiest.\n\nAt the Kennedy Center, Trump’s activities Friday weren’t public, but he told reporters he’d show off the marble that might be used to refurbish the building — along with other planned renovations, including change the paint on its signature columns from gold to white.\n\nTrump has begun frequently joking about renaming it the Trump Kennedy Center but deadpanned Friday: “We’re not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.”\n\nThe president also said he’ll be leading yet more White House renovations — this time on the bathroom attached to the iconic Lincoln Bedroom. It last underwent renovations in 2005.\n\n“We’ll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco,” Trump said, adding, “We’re making it actually incredible.”\n\nThe president even floated the idea of refurbishing the sprawling Old Executive Office Building on the White House grounds, saying it was “such a beautiful building, but it doesn’t look it.”\n\nTrump has already made extensive changes to the White House, redoing the Oval Office to add gold decor, installing patio seating with external speakers around the Rose Garden, erecting two towering flagpoles on its lawn and promising to build a ballroom.\n\nLater in the day, Trump was joined in the Oval Office by FIFA President Gianni Infantino to announce that the Kennedy Center would host the draw for the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe former owner of the New Jersey Generals of the USFL, Trump has been heavily promoting sporting events that will take place during his second term, including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\n“I just left the Kennedy Center. We’re spending a lot of money wisely and making it really beautiful,” Trump said during the event with Infantino. “It’s going to be beautiful again. It’s like Washington, D.C.”","summary":"Trump said he’d seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/22/trump-dc-crackdown-tourist/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_68912-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 23:56:59","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.064},{"id":353429600,"title":"The eight key takeaways from Ghislaine Maxwell’s prison interview","text":"The full transcripts of Ghislaine Maxwell’s interview with Donald Trump’s deputy attorney have been published.\n\nMaxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein, was interviewed by Todd Blanche in July.\n\nReleasing the full transcripts to the public appears to be an attempt to put an end to weeks’ worth of damaging stories which have dogged Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nThe US president has faced fierce criticism from his base for refusing to publish documents held by the government on Epstein, the paedophile financier who died in 2019.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice released hundreds of pages of transcripts and audio recordings of the interview in what Blanche called “the interest of transparency”.\n\n“Except for the names of victims, every word is included. Nothing removed. Nothing hidden,” Mr Blanche said.\n\nTrump ‘the perfect gentleman’\n\nMr Trump has faced immense political pressure over his former friendship with Epstein, whom he fell out with over a property deal in Palm Beach.\n\nCritics and supporters of the US president alike have called for him to release the so-called “Epstein files” — all of the files the government holds on the late paedophile.\n\nAsked about her knowledge of Mr Trump and Epstein’s relationship, Maxwell said she has no incriminating evidence against Donald Trump.\n\nShe said: “I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way.\n\n“The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”\n\nPrince Andrew and Epstein\n\nIn the recordings, Maxwell contradicted Prince Andrew’s claim that she introduced him to the paedophile Epstein.\n\n“First of all, let’s just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew. I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew or to Sarah Ferguson. That is a flat untruth. I’ll start with that.”\n\nThe Duke was accused of sexually abusing one of Epstein’s first accusers, Virginia Giuffre, on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. She had sued him for unspecified damages.\n\nThe case was settled by the Prince, who has always denied any wrongdoing. Giuffre died this year by suicide.\n\nDuring a Newsnight interview to address the accusations in 2019, Prince Andrew said the British socialite was the one who acquainted him with Epstein.\n\nDuchess of York ‘put the moves on Epstein’\n\nMaxwell claimed the Duchess of York, who she described as her “frenemy”, pursued Epstein.\n\nShe said: “I thought that Sarah was trying to put the moves on Jeffrey, if I’m being honest, and I thought the whole thing was annoying and I was pissed off.”\n\nShe said she believed the duchess “liked Mr Epstein.”\n\nWhen asked why she thought so, Maxwell responded: “My female intuition.”\n\nDuchess of York ‘tried to put the moves on Epstein’\n\n‘Epstein never loved me’\n\nMaxwell told Todd Blanche her ex-boyfriend did not ever love her and that she wasn’t his “type”.\n\n“There was some indications that [Epstein] would actively tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from me, and that he never loved me and I wasn’t his type,” Maxwell said.\n\nThe pair had a romantic relationship but after breaking up continued to work together until his arrest in 2019.\n\nThe nature of the couple’s relationship was brought under the spotlight during Maxwell’s trial.\n\nIntimate pictures of the pair together, including the now-infamous photos of Maxwell giving Epstein a foot massage, were presented by attorneys for the US government.\n\nSeveral witnesses testified that they thought the pair were a couple, while others believed they had just a business relationship.\n\nFinancier’s death was ‘no suicide’\n\nMaxwell stated that she does not believe Epstein died by suicide in prison in 2019.\n\nThe nature of Epstein’s death is a contentious point for many Trump supporters, who believe he was murdered in order to suppress in order to cover up a so-called “client list” of high-profile figures.\n\n“I do not believe he died by suicide, no,” she said.\n\nShe said she did not know who was behind his death but that it was not a difficult thing to arrange.\n\n“In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay – somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That’s about the going rate for a hit with a lock today.”\n\nNo client list\n\nMaxwell also denied that Epstein maintained a “client list” or “black book”.\n\n“There is no list,” she told Todd Blanche during the first day of their interviews.\n\nThe FBI and justice department last month released a memo drawing the same conclusion last month.\n\nI don’t remember Trump birthday message\n\nMaxwell did not recall Donald Trump allegedly sending a lewd letter featuring a drawing of a nude woman for Epstein’s 50th birthday.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that Mr Trump had submitted a note for an album Maxwell was assembling for her then-boyfriend’s birthday, in which he told Epstein they had “certain things in common”.\n\nThe note allegedly concluded: “May every day be another wonderful secret”.\n\n“I do not remember,” Maxwell answered, when asked whether Mr Trump had sent a message for Epstein’s 50th birthday. She added that she had not found a birthday letter from the president among her possessions in New York.\n\nHowever, she confirmed she had put together a book of birthday messages for Epstein, and that the financier had told her: “I love that idea.”\n\nMr Trump has fiercely denied writing or sending the letter and has launched legal proceedings against the newspaper and its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch.\n\nName-drops, but no smoking guns\n\nIn addition to Mr Trump and Prince Andrew, a number of high-profile individuals came up during Maxwell’s interview but she did not incriminate any of them.\n\nNaomi Campbell: “[Campbell] may have gone - well, she certainly - well, I believe she visited him in Palm Beach, and I believe she may have gone to the island and she may have gone to see his house in New York.”Robert F Kennedy: “Bobby knew Mr Epstein,” Maxwell said. “We went on a trip together. Was - we went to - dinosaur bone hunting in the Dakotas.”Elon Musk: Asked whether Mr Musk knew Epstein, Maxwell said: “I believe they did.” She pointed to emails seen in trial documents as the “only reason” she believed that they knew each other, rather than her memory.George Soros: “I don’t think he (Soros) knew him (Epstein).”Richard Branson: “I think I remember that I went to Richard Branson’s island with Mr Epstein, and maybe he went another time, but I don’t - I wouldn’t characterise Richard Branson and him as friends, but he did go and I think I went with him”.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/eight-key-takeaways-ghislaine-maxwell-235150576.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/44MDLqdJYTNyUJA3d5GMkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNDk4O2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/f3053db0903286eb6cdc7e5bfea53594","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 23:51:50","author":"Benedict Smith","authors":["Benedict Smith"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.353},{"id":353426502,"title":"After joining TikTok, Trump says he could extend sale deadline if needed","text":"Lawmakers have argued that US President Donald Trump's administration is ignoring national security concerns related to Chinese control over TikTok.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has urged democratically governed states to remove policies preventing local police from collaborating with federal authorities on immigration issues.\n\nABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch\n\n“I think Chicago will be our next,” Trump told reporters at the White House, later adding, “And then we’ll help with New York.”\n\nThe remarks were made as the Pentagon began the process on Friday of arming troops in Washington, although there have been no explicit signs of threats justifying the need for firearms.\n\nTrump has consistently portrayed some of the country’s largest cities, primarily led by Democrats, with Black mayors and predominantly minority populations, as hazardous and unclean.\n\nHe singled out Chicago on Friday, calling it a “mess” and saying residents there are “screaming for us to come.”\n\n“We’ll straighten that one out probably next. That will be our next one after this,” Trump said.\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office with a red hat that read, “Trump Was Right About Everything,” the president asserted that people in Chicago are donning hats identical to his.\n\nHe added, “African American ladies, beautiful ladies, are saying, ‘Please, President Trump, come to Chicago, please.'”\n\nABC7 Chief Legal Analyst Gil Soffer told the I-Team while an action like activating the National Guard likely would be challenged in court, the seldom used strategy of deploying National Guard troops is becoming more and more common.\n\n“Until a year ago, you could count on one hand the number of times that the National Guard has been activated, federalized,” Soffer said. “We’ve already now seen it happen in Los Angeles. There’s a threat to make it happen in Chicago. It could happen beyond that.”\n\nMayor Brandon Johnson responding in a statement to Trump, saying, “The problem with the President’s approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound.”\n\nIt comes amid a large-scale threat campaign from the Trump Administration, including lawsuits from the Justice Department challenging Sanctuary City policies across the country, including Illinois, and a visit to the Chicago area from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem calling out local politicians.\n\n“They’re being obstructionist when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off their streets,” Noem said.\n\nAnd now, there have been letters sent from Attorney General Bondi to dozens of districts, including Illinois, calling on states to dismantle Sanctuary policies or face federal funding cuts.\n\n“I’m not daring them to do anything,” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said. “I’m just saying they don’t have a right to, federal law and state law separate endeavors, and they don’t have a right to do the things that they’re threatening to do. 42:03\n\nAs the I-Team reported last month, a landmark lawsuit from the Justice Department over Sanctuary policies in Illinois, Chicago and Cook County was dismissed by a federal judge. The Justice Department’s deadline to replead the case is Friday.\n\nThe I-Team confirmed with the Illinois National Guard they have received no orders from the president to mobilize in the city. As of 6 p.m. Friday, the Justice Department has not amended or repleaded its lawsuit against the state and Chicago over sanctuary policies. If they do not by midnight Friday, the judgement will be final, although they will have a chance to appeal to a higher court.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued the following statement:“We take President Trump’s statements seriously, but to be clear the City has not received any formal communication from the Trump administration regarding additional federal law enforcement or military deployments to Chicago. Certainly, we have grave concerns about the impact of any unlawful deployment of National Guard troops to the City of Chicago. The problem with the President’s approach is that it is uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound. Unlawfully deploying the National Guard to Chicago has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust between police and residents is foundational to building safer communities. An unlawful deployment would be unsustainable and would threaten to undermine the historic progress we have. In the past year alone, we have reduced homicides by more than 30%, robberies by 35%, and shootings by almost 40%. We need to continue to invest in what is working. \n\n“We know that our communities are safest when we fully invest in housing, community safety, and education. The National Guard will not alleviate the housing crisis. It will not put food in the stomachs of the 1 in 4 children that go to bed hungry every night in Chicago. The National Guard will not fully-fund our public schools or provide mental healthcare or substance abuse treatment to Chicagoans in need. The National Guard is no substitute for dedicated local law enforcement and community violence interrupters who know and serve our communities every day. There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them.” \n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker issued the following statement:“As Donald Trump attempts to create chaos that distracts from his problems, we will call it out for what it is. Trump and Republicans are trying to distract from the pain they are causing working families-from tariffs raising the prices of everyday goods to stripping away healthcare and food from millions of Americans.\n\n“After using Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. as his testing ground for authoritarian overreach, Trump is now openly flirting with the idea of taking over other states and cities. Trump’s goal is to incite fear in our communities and destabilize existing public safety efforts – all to create a justification to further abuse his power. He is playing a game and creating a spectacle for the press to play along with.\n\n“We don’t play those games in Illinois. Our commitment to law and order is delivering real results. Crime rates are improving. Homicides are down by more than 30% in Chicago in the last year alone.

During the recorded sessions in which the convicted sex offender, who was found guilty for her role in Epstein’s crimes, was granted immunity, she made several interesting claims. Here are 10 top takeaways. Claims there is no client list EPSTEIN’S FORMER LAWYER: GHISLAINE MAXWELL SHOULD GET IMMUNITY IN EXCHANGE FOR SECRETS Maxwell denied the existence of a black book with Epstein’s clients on it – and least to her knowledge. \"There is no list,\" she told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Maxwell said she believed the origin of rumors that there was a list came in 2009 after Epstein had finished a 13-month sex trafficking sentence in Florida, and a lawyer at Rothstein Adler involved in a civil suit against him called the FBI to say he had a \"piece of evidence\" that belongs to Epstein. That was \"the list,\" she claimed, adding that she believes he became a confidential informant to the FBI. She said he obtained the list through a sting operation involving Epstein's former butler, who said in a deposition he had \"handwritten notes, or a journal, whatever.\" Doesn’t believe Epstein killed himself GHISLAINE MAXWELL TELLS DOJ SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE JEFFREY EPSTEIN DIED BY SUICIDE IN FEDERAL PRISON Maxwell said she doesn’t believe Epstein killed himself when he was found hanging in his New York jail cell in 2019. \"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" she told Blanche when asked. She added that she didn't have any speculation about who could have killed him, but claimed the U.S. Bureau of Prisons is rife with mismanagement. \"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" she said, adding she didn't believe his death was a way to silence him. \"I do not have any reason to believe that,\" she told Blanche. \"And I also think it's ludicrous because if that – I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target.\" Never saw President Donald Trump do anything inappropriate Maxwell said while she believes President Trump (before he was president) and Epstein were friendly, she didn’t think they were \"close.\" \"I think they were friendly, like people are in social settings. I don't — I don't think they were close friends or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of — I don't recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.\" she said. \"I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting.\" She added, \"I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\" Former President Bill Clinton never went to Epstein’s island Maxwell claimed that former President Bill Clinton, whose name has previously been linked to Epstein, \"absolutely never went\" to Epstein’s Caribbean island where sex trafficking of young girls took place. She added, \"I can be sure of that because there's no way he would've gone – I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island, had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had 16 an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein.\" She also said that Clinton was her friend, not Epstein’s, and that she knew him through the Clinton Global Initiative and was part of the inception of the organization. TRUMP DOJ TO BEGIN HANDING OVER EPSTEIN FILES TO HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATORS Calls Epstein ‘disgusting,’ but doesn’t believe he’s guilty of everything he was accused of Maxwell called Epstein \"disgusting\" in the interview but said she doesn’t believe he was guilty of all the accusations. \"I do believe that Epstein did a lot of, not all, but some of what he's accused of, and I'm not here to defend him in any respect whatsoever,\" Maxwell told Blanche. \"I don't want to, and I don't think he requires, nor deserves any type of protection or – from me in any way, to sugarcoat what he did or didn't do.\" She added, \"This is one man. He's not some – they've made him into this – he's not that interesting. He's a disgusting guy who did terrible things to young kids.\" Never saw Prince Andrew do anything inappropriate and believes the photo of him with accuser Virginia Giuffre is fake Maxwell told Blanche that she also never saw Prince Andrew do anything inappropriate while she was with him, adding that she believes the infamous photo of the prince with his hand around accuser Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 isn’t real. \"I believe it's literally a fake photo,\" she said of the picture, purported to have been taken at her former London townhouse. \"I do not know that they met.\" Giuffre died of suicide earlier this year. She had accused the royal of forcing her into sex inside Maxwell's home in London's ritzy Belgravia neighborhood. The prince was relieved of his royal duties amid fallout from the scandal but has always denied allegations of wrongdoing. He agreed to pay Giuffre an undisclosed settlement in 2022 and to donate to her charity for crime victims. BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO TO WOULD ‘IMPLICATE’ TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS Maxwells claims she has memory problems after being on suicide watch for 2 years Maxwell claimed to Blanche her \"memory’s not as good as it was\" because she was kept on suicide watch at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn after her arrest for nearly two years, and she was woken up every 15 minutes. She said because of her memory lapses she had taken notes before the interviews, and throughout the interview still struggled to recall many details. Claims Epstein had a heart condition and told her he couldn’t have sex often Maxwell said that when she traveled with Epstein, they slept in the same bed, but he told her he had a heart condition and couldn’t have sex frequently. \"Which meant that he didn't have intercourse a lot, which suited me fine, because I actually do have a medical condition, which precludes me having a lot of intercourse,\" she told Blanche. She added that she didn’t know the exact nature of the condition, but he liked \"other forms of sexual activities.\" Claims Epstein never loved her and said she wasn’t his type and that he told people to lie to her Maxwell told Blanche she and Epstein had a friends with benefits relationship while she was working with him, but at one point Epstein said that one of his associates didn’t want to be seen with her too much because of her father’s company’s embezzlement accusations. But she said she believed that was all a ruse just to keep her from traveling with Epstein. \"Today – not contemporaneously, but today I don't believe that that's even true. I think it was used as a means to not have me travel with him to Ohio or whatever. It was just a way to park me,\" she said. She added that after her arrest during the legal discovery process she saw evidence that \"he would actively tell other people to lie to me or conceal things from me, and that he never loved me and I wasn't his type.\" Claims Epstein took testosterone, which altered his character Maxwell also claimed that in the late ‘90s, Epstein started taking testosterone, \"and that altered his character.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While discussing the frequency at which he got sexual massages, she said the testosterone both made him more \"aggressive\" and she thought it likely \"altered his desires.\" Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking of minors.","summary":"Ghislaine Maxwell tells federal prosecutors she believes Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in jail and no client list exists, contradicting conspiracy theories.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/key-takeaways-from-dojs-release-ghislaine-maxwells-epstein-interviews","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6377268246112","publish_date":"2025-08-22 23:47:07","author":"Brie Stimson","authors":["Brie Stimson"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.389},{"id":353425994,"title":"CNN’s Harry Enten Explains Why Gavin Newsom’s Trump Feud Is Earning Him ‘A Rising Tide of Support’ | Video","text":"CNN’s Harry Enten explained how Gavin Newsom’s continued feud with Donald Trump is leading to “a rising tide of support” from voters, particularly California Democrats. \n\nThe network’s chief data analyst explained Friday how the California governor’s many prods and call-outs against the president have only led to his growing success in the polls.\n\n“I absolutely think it’s showing signs of working; and let’s take a look at the voters who know Gavin Newsom best — those voters out in California, those California Democrats,” Enten said. “California Democrats on Newsom for [president].

And now, 75% are excited for him to run; and more than that, he’s getting a higher percentage of the vote than Kamala Harris in her home state. He is beating the former vice president — who, of course, was the Democratic nominee in 2024.

This new investment adds to the $2.2 billion in CHIPS Act grants previously awarded to the company but not yet disbursed, bringing the total federal support to $11.1 billion.\nAccording to Intel, the funds will come from grants previously promised under the CHIPS and Science Act, passed during President Joe Biden’s administration.

Edgar Hoover wrote in a memo claiming there was not enough evidence to indict the two alleged killers with federal kidnapping or civil rights charges.Letters from citizens about the Till murder and Justice Department responses.Internal FBI correspondence on the preliminary investigation and the two men later acquitted of murdering Till.\n\nThis first batch of documents is from the National Archives itself and consists mostly of older records turned over years ago by the FBI and Justice Department, Klibanoff said.\n\nThe board anticipates publishing tens of thousands of additional pages of documents it expects to receive from the FBI and DOJ, Klibanoff said, though he was unclear when that might happen.\n\nKeith Beauchamp, director of the 2005 documentary “The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,” has researched Till’s murder for 30 years. He said he has already read all 6,500 pages published online because he had previously obtained the documents through records requests.\n\nThe documents span from the opening of the Till investigation to the Montgomery bus boycott.\n\nBeauchamp’s research led to the FBI reopening its investigation in 2004. The government also reopened the case in 2017. Both times, the case was closed without any charges filed.\n\nBeauchamp said he “truly applauds” the government for releasing the documents. He notes that some of the documents explain why the federal government did not pursue charges in the 1950s and how Hoover did not want charges filed despite public pressure.\n\nThe most intriguing documents, Beauchamp said, show civil rights activist Dr. T. R. M. Howard having a “tiff” with Hoover over the handling of the murder. He said the documents also show the FBI trying to pit certain African American activists against each other.\n\nBeauchamp said he was “quite moved” reading accounts of witnesses testifying and speaking to the press.\n\n“Overall, I’m happy that the files are being released. But there’s a lot more in those files that should be revealed to the public,” said Beauchamp, who estimates there are around 30,000 files total.\n\nThe timing of the publication of these documents is important, considering the 70th anniversary of Till’s death is Aug. 28, said Christopher Benson, a Northwestern University professor who co-wrote “Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime That Changed America” with Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley.\n\nBenson said the documents will correct misreporting in the past, particularly the claim that Carolyn Bryant Donham had recanted her accusation against Till. The documents show she was unrepentant to her deathbed and even claimed she had suffered more than Till, Benson said.\n\nThe records were released under the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018, signed by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/08/22/emmett-till-records-archive-history-black","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5abedb0/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2534+0+0/resize/1486x1255!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2F40%2Fe9cee0aec3e43b594bbdf381ffa0%2Fmerl","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-22 23:38:35","author":"David Struett","authors":["David Struett"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.409}]}
