Jay Monahan, who announced the framework agreement in June 2023, will stay on as commissioner of the PGA Tour. Monahan announced in December the search for a CEO of PGA Tour Enterprises, now backed by a $1.5 billion investment from Strategic Sports Group. The tour declined comment on the hiring, first reported by Sports Business Journal. A person with direct knowledge of the tour's plans confirmed the hiring, speaking on condition of anonymity because nothing has been announced. Such developments typically are not publicized during major championships. Rolapp has been with the NFL since 2003 and has been executive vice president and chief media and business officer since 2017, working closely with Commissioner Roger Goodell. Sports Business Journal obtained a memo Goodell sent to staff Thursday announcing Rolapp would be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Monahan announced an agreement with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which was never finalized. From that framework agreement came a for-profit arm, PGA Tour Enterprises, which Rolapp would oversee. The tour brought on SSG in January 2024, and soon announced a first-of-its-kind equity plan for players. Monahan said in December of the CEO search, \"We're bringing new perspectives on to our team to help us realize the incredible opportunities ahead for our sport.\" Meanwhile, negotiations with PIF to bring the world's best players together stalled in the spring, even with the involvement of President Donald Trump, as LIV Golf wants to keep its team concept in place. LIV Golf has since hired Scott O'Neil as its new CEO. Rolapp brings strong media connections to the PGA Tour, which is starting to plan for new broadcast deals that run through 2030. The PGA Tour has seen a strong uptick this year through extensive feedback from its fans, including a recent decision to revamp the Tour Championship to crown its FedEx Cup champion. Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner who is part of SSG, was part of the search committee that included Tiger Woods and Adam Scott, Monahan, PGA Tour board chairman Joe Gorder and Sam Kennedy from SSG.

Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said that his country carried out the attack, without saying what it targeted. \"In the wake of the state of Israel's preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,\" he said in a statement.

It was unclear if he had been informed but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes. Trump earlier said he was urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being while the administration negotiated with Iran. \"As long as I think there is a (chance for an) agreement, I don't want them going in because I think it would blow it,\" Trump told reporters.

The victims included beloved singer Rubby Pérez, who was performing when the roof caved in, and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz. Also killed was former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel, who was pulled from the debris but died at a hospital, and Dominican baseball player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera.

Fox News' Trey Yingst reported that Israel carried out strikes in Iran, adding that explosions were heard in the capital of Tehran. A state of emergency has been declared across Israel as the country braces for an Iranian response. The strikes came after Israel first threatened to go after Iran’s nuclear facilities in early November following a series of back-and-forth missile attacks between April and October last year. Direct engagement between Israel and Iran began after Tehran in April 2024 levied its first ever direct strikes against Israeli territory. Israel responded less than a week later and destroyed part of Iran’s S-300 long-range air defense system. TRUMP WARNS ISRAEL STRIKE ON IRAN 'COULD HAPPEN' AMID MIDDLE EAST EVACUATION, NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS On Oct. 1, Iran levied a ballistic missile strike on Israel, to which Jerusalem responded with a series of hits on Oct. 26 that targeted military facilities and missile storage locations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later confirmed that Israel’s October strike partially degraded part of Iran’s nuclear program, and international concerns remained heightened that the security threat could escalate in the region. Some hoped that President Donald Trump’s administration would be able to make headway in nuclear negotiations where the Biden administration, and others in the international community could not. Negotiations between Washington and Tehran, mediated by Oman, resumed in Muscat on April 12 and Trump repeatedly called on Netanyahu not to hit Tehran and to let negotiations proceed. IRAN BECOMING 'MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE' IN NUCLEAR TALKS, TRUMP TELLS FOX NEWS Following the first round of talks, Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News that the U.S. was looking to limit Iran’s uranium enrichment to 3.67%, a level generally used for civil nuclear energy needs. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Trump pulled out of in 2018, Iran committed to maintaining no more than this level of enrichment until 2031 – though it has been found to have repeatedly violated this agreement. But the next day, on April 15, Witkoff backtracked his comments and said in a statement that \"Iran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\" Four days later the U.S. entered its second round of nuclear talks in Rome on April 19, before a third round was held in Muscat on April 26. Both sides expressed optimism following the talks. Details of the negotiations were not released, but reports suggested the discussions largely focused on limiting Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief. Talks appeared to take a turn after the U.S. hit Iran with another round of sanctions in late April, which resulted in the postponement of the previously scheduled May 3 talks. The fourth round of talks began to show signs of strain when Iran described the negotiations as \"difficult but useful,\" and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made clear that Washington’s zero enrichment demand was a \"non-negotiable.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi reported that \"some but not conclusive progress\" was made following the fifth round of talks held in Rome on May 23. By early June, Trump and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei had repeatedly made clear they both would refuse to bend when it comes to the issue of enrichment, but a sixth round of talks was still set for June 15 in Oman. It is unclear if those talks will continue following the Israeli strike.","summary":"Israel launches military strikes against Iran as Trump administration&apos;s nuclear negotiations stall, following months of escalating conflict.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-launches-sweeping-strike-on-iran-while-trump-administration-seeks-diplomatic-solution","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/06/931/523/iran_israel-split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:35:31","author":"Caitlin McFall,Greg Wehner,Rachel Wolf","authors":["Caitlin McFall","Greg Wehner","Rachel Wolf"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.378},{"id":330864068,"title":"Iran attack fears","text":"AS the fate of the US-Iran talks remains undecided, there are worrying signs that in case the negotiations collapse, a devastating new conflict could engulf the Middle East and its surrounding regions.

But the resolution was not unanimous; three states voted against it while 11 abstained, indicating a likely geopolitical role in the drafting and passage of the resolution. Both Russia and China, which have cordial ties with Iran, voted against it, while the US and its European allies supported it. Tehran has said that in case further sanctions are imposed on it, it will leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Iran has said it will hit American bases in the region if it is attacked.\n\nConsidering these worrying developments, the US-Iran talks to be held in Oman on Sunday — if they go ahead — will provide a make-or-break opportunity to walk back from the brink for both sides. Donald Trump, who had initially been upbeat about the talks, said personnel were being withdrawn as the Middle East “could be a dangerous place”. But instead of withdrawing his people, the American president needs to put pressure on Israel to refrain from a dangerous attack on Iran. He has prevailed on the Zionist state to hold off on such reckless behaviour before, and must continue to do so in the interest of regional peace. While the US-Israel combine has an obvious military edge, Iran will surely retaliate if attacked, just as it hit Israel twice last year. Moreover, while Iranian allies such as Hezbollah, Hamas and Syria’s Bashar al-Assad may be weakened or out of the picture, Tehran still has formidable military capabilities, while Yemen’s pro-Iran Houthis, who say an Israeli attack will cause a regional war, are also capable of causing the US and its allies much pain. Therefore, in order to avoid a nightmarish new war, it is essential that Israel is reined in, and diplomacy is given a chance in Oman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025","summary":"AS the fate of the US-Iran talks remains undecided, there are worrying signs that in case the negotiations collapse, a devastating new conflict could engulf the Middle East and its surrounding regions.

The post includes Morales Reyes’ photo and an excerpt from the letter he purportedly wrote in English. But the claims quickly fell apart as Wisconsin authorities determined that Reyes, who doesn’t speak English well or write in the language, was framed.\n\nMorales Reyes was a victim in a violent 2023 attack where his bike was stolen.

Morales Reyes was set to be a witness in Scott’s July trial for armed robbery and aggravated battery.\n\nMorales Reyes was released after paying the $7,500 bond that an immigration judge set on Tuesday.

'They've turned out to be great,' says US President on farm workers; watch video","text":"Despite his typically hardline stance on immigration, US President Donald Trump on Thursday signalled a potential shift—suggesting some undocumented immigrants may be allowed to remain in the US to prevent labour shortages in critical sectors like agriculture and hospitality. Speaking at a White House event, Trump said an executive order is being considered to allow certain undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, especially those working for American farmers. \"Our farmers are being hurt badly. They have very good workers,\" Trump said. \"They've worked for them for 20 years. They're not citizens, but they've turned out to be great. We're going to have to do something about that,\" he added. Trump indicated the possible executive action would also impact the hotel sector: \"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have.\" \"We're going to have an order on that pretty soon. We can't do that to our farmers,\" US President said. He did not specify what the order would contain or when it might be issued. Farm industry leaders have long urged the administration to shield agriculture from mass deportations, warning that such policies could severely disrupt the nation’s food supply chain, which relies heavily on immigrant labour. According to the US Departments of Labour and Agriculture, nearly half of America’s estimated 2 million farm workers—and many in the dairy and meatpacking industries—lack legal status. \"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform. \"Changes are coming!\" The US president’s remarks come amid nationwide protests against immigration raids. Demonstrators have criticised the targeting of undocumented immigrants without criminal records, especially those detained at their workplaces. Protests intensified last week following enforcement actions in Los Angeles. On Thursday, Trump acknowledged the broader economic consequences of strict immigration enforcement, including within the hotel industry—an area connected to his own business interests.","summary":"US President Donald Trump hinted at a potential policy shift on immigration, suggesting some undocumented immigrants could stay to prevent labor shortages in agriculture and hospitality.

Sirens sounded at 3 a.m. alerting Israelis across the entire country to prepare for an Iranian missile attack in retaliation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Operation Rising Lion in an on-camera statement: \"Our voice is now heard The purpose of this unprecedented attack is to hit Iran's nuclear facilities and its military capabilities until we remove the threat to us.\" \"I want to warn you that Iran still has the capabilities that can cause us harm and we have prepared. I ask for your cooperation. You have shown your resilience throughout the long months of war and we need this resilience now,\" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu thanked U.S. President Donald Trump for his support for Israel. He has said Iran must not have a nuclear weapon. Reuters reported, citing a witness in Natanz City, that there were sounds of multiple explosions heard near Iran's Natanz nuclear facility. Netanyahu said that Israeli forces \"targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb, we also struck the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program.\" \"Following the situational assessment, it was determined that as of today (Friday), at 03:00, immediate changes will be made to the Home Front Command guidelines,\" the military said in a statement. \"As part of the changes, it was decided to shift all areas of the country from Full Activity to Essential Activity.

The Saberin news agency, affiliated with pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, reported explosions in the Shahid Mahalati area, northeast of the Iranian capital. Saberin also reported that air defense systems were activated west of Tehran. Israeli officials did not confirm whether the United States would take part in the strike or in Israel's defense in case of an Iranian retaliation, but said there may be a \"logistical role.\" Sources in Israel said the attacks target Iranian nuclear and military sites and officials said there was no intention of bringing down the Iranian regime. A US official tells CNN that there was no U.S. involvement or U.S. assistance in the strikes carried out by Israel in Iran. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday the United States was not involved in Israel's strikes against Iran while also urging Tehran not to target U.S. interests or personnel in the region. \"Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel,\" he added. IDF spokesman Effie Defrin said in a statement that \"The Iranian regime has proclaimed that its objective is to destroy the State of Israel. Senior officials in the Iranian regime have publicly declared their intent to destroy Israel, and are operating to achieve this together with their proxies in the Middle East. Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world. The State of Israel will not allow a regime whose objective is to destroy the State of Israel to obtain weapons of mass destruction.\" \"The IDF has conducted a process of preparations for a campaign on the frontline and on the home front. The resilience of Israel's citizens will be an important factor of the campaign,\" he said, adding: \"The IDF is ready to continue to act as required. The State of Israel has the obligation to act in defense of its citizens and will continue to do so everywhere it is required to do so, as we have done in the past.\" Follow Ynetnews on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Telegram","summary":"IDF activates sirens across the country to alert Israelis of an Iranian retaliatory attack; Defense Minister Israel Katz announces a nation-wide emergency;  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Operation Rising Lion, targeting Iran's nuclear facilities and its military capabilities","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/skf5t1yxel","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/06/13/Sks90yt7ge/Sks90yt7ge_0_316_961_540_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:23:22","author":"Ynet","authors":["Ynet"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":330863422,"title":"Israel launches operation ‘Rising Lion’ on Iran as explosions rock Tehran & emergency declared over retaliation fears","text":"ISRAEL has launched strikes against Iran in a dramatic escalation risking all-out war in the Middle East.\n\nExplosions rung out and plumes of smoke rose above the capital Tehran after a volley of \"preemptive strikes\" as part of Operation Rising Lion.\n\nThe attack comes after tensions flared following Iran's advancing nuclear programme, with Donald Trump warning of a \"massive conflict\" between the enemy nations.\n\nIran has been stockpiling uranium and it is feared they are close to having enough weapons-grade fusion material for as many as 15 nuclear bombs.\n\nThe US has already declared it had no involvement in the strikes, which Israel claimed targeted nuclear and military sites.\n\nFearing a reprisal, Israel has already declared a \"special state of emergency\", closing schools and public gatherings and sounding air-raid sirens.\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz said: \"Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future.\"\n\nThe orders have been imposed across the entire state, with emergency messages sent to mobile phones ordering Israelis to stay close to shelters and limit movement in open areas.\n\nSpeaking after the blitz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a \"decisive moment in Israel's history\".\n\nOn Thursday, the UN's nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency censured Iran for failing to work with its inspectors.\n\nIran's nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, slammed the resolution as \"extremist\" and blamed Israeli influence.\n\nTrump, whose administration is in talks with Iran in a bid to hammer out a deal over its nuclear programme, said he had urged ally Israel to hold off as he stressed his commitment to a diplomatic solution.\n\n\"I don't want to say imminent, but it looks like it's something that could very well happen,\" Trump told reporters at the White House when asked if an Israeli attack loomed.\n\nTrump said he believed a \"pretty good\" deal on Iran's nuclear program was \"fairly close,\" but said that an Israeli attack on its arch foe could wreck the chances of an agreement.\n\nThe US has already pulled some diplomats from Tehran and offered evacuations for troops and families stationed in the Middle East.\n\nMore to follow...

It’s not that a leader can simply say something and it becomes it.”\n\nBreyer did not directly address Newsom’s request to block the deployment of Marines in Los Angeles, taking issue with the request because the troops have yet to be deployed for street-level operations.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

The same night protests began, the Trump administration began weighing the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles. Protests continued into the week and federal troops were deployed, eventually reaching a point where National Guard members were briefly detaining protesters before handing them off to local law enforcement for arrest. Newsom has sharply blasted the use of the National Guard, accusing Trump of “putting fuel on the fire” and taking the president to court over the decision. The governor has claimed his authority was infringed upon with the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines, though the latter force has yet to participate in operations within Los Angeles.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLos Angeles Protests: National Guard Has Detained Some Protesters (Forbes)\n\nSen.

Kelly moved to solitary confinement and won't eat for fear of poison, lawyers say","text":"R. Kelly’s lawyers say the imprisoned R&B singer was moved to solitary confinement after they alleged this week he’s the target of a prison murder plot — and Kelly has refused to eat the food offered since Tuesday afternoon because he’s afraid it might be poisoned.\n\n“This is not done for protection,” attorney Beau Brindley wrote Thursday, complaining about Kelly’s new living conditions. “It is done for punishment.”\n\nThe remarks appear in a four-page document filed in Chicago’s federal court, seeking to bolster Kelly’s bid to be moved out of prison and into home detention.\n\n“Mr. Kelly has spiders crawling over him as he tries to sleep,” Brindley wrote. “He is alone in the dark in miserable conditions. [Mr.] Kelly has not eaten since the afternoon of June 10. This is because the only food they will bring him comes from the very chow hall about which a prison official warned him.”\n\nAfraid of the move, Kelly “pointed out that Jeffrey Epstein died in solitary confinement,” he told prison officials, and he said, “he would feel safer in his room with the door locked,” according to Brindley.\n\nThe singer also can’t take medicine on an empty stomach, the lawyer noted.\n\nKelly, 58, is being held in a medium-security prison facility in Butner, North Carolina, records show. He’s serving a 30-year sentence there for his 2021 racketeering and sex-crime convictions in New York.\n\nKelly is also serving a mostly simultaneous 20-year sentence for his 2022 child pornography conviction in Chicago. He’s not due out of prison until December 2045, when he would be nearing his 79th birthday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Martha Pacold in Chicago has scheduled a hearing for June 20 in the wake of Kelly’s request for home detention. However, that hearing seems likely to revolve around jurisdictional issues, not the merits of Kelly’s claims.\n\nBrindley launched a new legal assault on Kelly’s twin federal convictions this week, alleging federal prison officials enlisted a leader of the Aryan Brotherhood to kill Kelly to prevent the disclosure of damaging information.\n\nTo support that claim, Brindley filed a five-page declaration “signed, sworn and affirmed” by the inmate allegedly recruited to carry out the task, Mikeal Glenn Stine.\n\nBrindley has said he’s also preparing a motion to undo Kelly’s convictions because of alleged government misconduct, and he’s appealed to President Donald Trump, who has made prolific use of his pardon power.\n\nFederal prosecutors laid out Stine’s “stark” criminal history in a court filing earlier this year in Colorado. They wrote that he’s “spent the bulk of his life since 1980 imprisoned for one crime or another.”\n\nThose crimes ranged from dealing marijuana to contempt of court, to grand theft, to bank robbery to a gang sexual assault of a cellmate, they explained. In Colorado, he’d also been convicted of threatening a federal judge and a prosecutor, allegedly saying he “would snap” the prosecutor’s neck if he could get his hands around it.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/r-kelly/2025/06/12/r-kelly-moved-to-solitary-confinement-and-wont-eat-for-fear-of-poison-lawyers-say","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a7a239/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6234x3559+0+299/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4c%2F78%2Fbf3f68ee9a0be19f96af68d74e36%2Frkel","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:14:43","author":"Jon Seidel","authors":["Jon Seidel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":330862160,"title":"Israel attacks Iran’s capital with explosions booming across Tehran","text":"By JON GAMBRELL and JOSEF FEDERMAN\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) — Israel attacked Iran’s capital early Friday, with explosions booming across Tehran as Israel said it targeted nuclear and military sites.\n\nThe attack comes as tensions have reached new heights over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. The Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years on Thursday censured Iran over it not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones. \n\nIsrael for years has warned it will not allow Iran to build a nuclear weapon, something Tehran insists it doesn’t want — though official there have repeatedly warned it could build them. The U.S. has been preparing for something to happen, already pulling some diplomats from Iraq’s capital and offering voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.\n\nPeople in Tehran awoke to the sound of the blast. State television acknowledged the blast. \n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what had been hit, though smoke could be rising from Chitgar, a neighborhood in western Tehran. There are no known nuclear sites in that area — but it wasn’t immediately clear if anything was happening in the rest of the country. \n\nAn Israeli military official says that his country targeted Iranian nuclear sites, without identifying them.\n\nThe official spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation, which is also targeting military sites.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude spiked on the attack, rising nearly 5% on the news.\n\nIsrael’s Defense Minister Israel Katz said that his country carried out the attack, without saying what it targeted.\n\n“In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement. \n\nThe statement added that Katz “signed a special order declaring an emergency situation in the home front.” \n\n“It is essential to listen to instructions from the home front command and authorities to stay in protected areas,” it said\n\nThe White House did not have an immediate comment Thursday night. \n\nAs the explosions in Tehran started, President Donald Trump was on the lawn of the White House mingling with members of Congress. It was unclear if he had been informed but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes.\n\nTrump earlier said he was urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being while the administration negotiated with Iran.\n\n“As long as I think there is a (chance for an) agreement, I don’t want them going in because I think it would blow it,” Trump told reporters.","summary":"The attack comes as tensions have reached new heights over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/12/israel-attacks-irans-capital-with-explosions-booming-across-tehran/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Iran_01181_f1ac8b-1.jpg?w=1024&h=676","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:13:46","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.62},{"id":330862166,"title":"Takedown of California’s senior U.S. Senator, Alex Padilla, expected to ratchet up interest in Saturday protests in Bay Area","text":"California’s senior U.S. senator, Democrat Alex Padilla, was forcibly removed, pushed to the floor and handcuffed Thursday after he interrupted a news conference by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about her department’s ongoing deportation enforcement in Los Angeles.\n\nThe incident in the federal building in Los Angeles drew immediate fire from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n“A United States Senator seeking clarification from a cabinet secretary should not be assaulted or treated like this,” Silicon Valley Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna said in a social media post on X.\n\nSoon after the incident, Padilla’s office said the senator was no longer detained.\n\nBay Area Republican strategist Matt Shupe described Padilla’s attempt to abruptly question Noem “pure political theatrics.” Shupe said if he or a Republican legislator were to “barge onto” the scene of a news conference by Padilla or Gov. Gavin Newsom, “the exact same thing would’ve happened to us.”\n\nIt was unclear whether Noem, her staff, or security members knew who Padilla was initially. The senator can be heard identifying himself in video recorded at the scene, but Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of Homeland Security, said in an X post that he “announced himself as he was being removed.”\n\nHomeland Security said on X that Padilla “lunged toward Secretary Noem,” and that Secret Service agents “thought he was an attacker and … acted appropriately.” The video of the incident does not capture its entirety but does not show Padilla lunging at Noem.\n\nSan Jose State University emeritus professor of political science Larry Gerston said he would expect that “a number of people” at the news conference knew who Padilla was,” adding that, “there aren’t that many senators — there are 100.”\n\nPadilla’s office said he had been in Los Angeles “exercising his duty to perform Congressional oversight of the federal government’s operations in Los Angeles and across California.” On video, Padilla appears to be trying to ask Noem about deportations of people alleged by the administration of President Donald Trump to be violent criminals.\n\nGerston described the incident as “extraordinary,” and a “slippery slope.”\n\n“We know that both the press and elected officials particularly have a job and that job is to get to the facts and understand what’s going on either for constituents in the case of elected officials or for the public,” Gerston said. “In the last few weeks we’ve seen mounting hostility toward both from the Trump administration.”\n\nDan Schnur, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and a former Republican political consultant, said Padilla may have crossed a line in interrupting the event, but the reaction from Noem’s security detail clearly went over the line.\n\n“Senator Padilla made a questionable decision,” Schnur said. “There are more appropriate ways for members of the United States Senate to talk about an important policy issue with a member of the cabinet. But in no way did his decision in any way excuse the response that he faced. No American, let alone an elected official, ought to be subjected to that kind of violent reaction.”\n\nThe incident occurred amid heightened political tensions nationwide, including protests this week against federal immigration authorities over increasingly aggressive sweeps of migrants and immigrants, and deportations. Trump commandeered California’s National Guard to put troops on the ground in Los Angeles, and mobilized U.S. Marines to that city. This week, New Jersey Democratic Congresswoman LaMonica McIver was charged with “forcibly impeding and interfering” with federal law enforcement over a May 9 confrontation outside an immigration center in her state.\n\nPolitical analysts said they believe the incident with Padilla will ratchet up discontent among liberals ahead of nationwide anti-Trump “No Kings” protests planned around the country and the Bay Area for Saturday, the same day Trump will hold a military parade in Washington, D.C. celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, and coinciding with his own.\n\n“This is going to ramp up the interest in those protests,” said Claremont McKenna College political science professor Jack Pitney.\n\nThe U.S. stands at a “pivotal moment” as Trump seeks to consolidate power in the executive branch, Gerston said, and the size and tone of the No Kings events will be meaningful.\n\n“If the turnout is muted or modest, I think it gives strength to the Trump administration,” Gerston said. “If the turnout is large and angry, that may be an indication that people are beginning to see they’ve gone too far.”\n\nFor Americans on the left, the Padilla takedown follows a cascade of actions that together “raise alarm bells,” said Nolan Higdon, a history and media studies lecturer at Cal State University East Bay.\n\n“I’m thinking of things like the National Guard in Padilla’s state without the governor’s agreement,” Higdon said. “The Marines. He’s got a military parade. He’s ignored due process for certain individuals arrested allegedly for being gang members. He’s ignored the courts.”\n\nPitney said he believes Padilla’s forcible detainment will not be the last such actions. “I don’t think the Trump administration will hesitate to use force,” Pitney said. “In the months ahead we’re going to see many different versions of force.”\n\nNoem said in an X post she met with Padilla for 15 minutes after her security took him down.\n\n“We probably disagree on 90% of the topics but we agreed to exchanged (sic) phone numbers and we will continue to talk — that is the way it should be in this country,” Noem wrote. “I wish he would’ve acted that way in the beginning rather than creating a scene.”\n\nNoem at the news conference said federal immigration enforcement efforts would continue in the Los Angeles region. She assailed Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who have both spoken out repeatedly against the Trump administration’s actions on migrants and immigrants.\n\n“We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and this mayor have placed on this country and this city,” Noem said.\n\nNewsom, whose administration sued the federal government Monday over the National Guard deployment, called the response to Padilla at the news conference “outrageous, dictatorial and shameful.”","summary":"The incident occurred amid heightened political tensions nation-wide, including protests this week against federal immigration authorities over increasingly aggressive sweeps of migrants and immigrants, and deportations.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/12/californias-u-s-senator-democrat-alex-padilla-taken-down-handcuffed-at-homeland-security/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/APTOPIX-Immigration-Protests.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:12:48","author":"Ethan Baron","authors":["Ethan Baron"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":330861350,"title":"Democratic senator pushed to ground and handcuffed at LA protests briefing","text":"A US senator has been forcefully removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and handcuffed by officers as he tried to protest recent immigration raids.\n\nVideo shows Alex Padilla, a representative for California, standing by the front of the press pack as a Secret Service agent on Ms Noem's security detail grabs him by his jacket and shoves him from the room.\n\n\"I'm Senator Alex Padilla,\" he shouts in a halting voice. \n\n\"I have questions for the secretary.\"\n\nScuffling with officers outside the room, he can be heard yelling, \"Hands off!\"\n\nAs the person recording the incident follows the tussle around a corner, Senator Padilla is seen on his knees and then being pushed to the ground and handcuffed in a hallway, with several officers atop him.\n\nThe senator's aggressive removal from a cabinet secretary's news conference prompted immediate outrage from his Democratic colleagues.\n\nFootage of the scuffle in Los Angeles ricocheted through the halls of congress, where stunned Democrats demanded an immediate investigation and characterised the episode as another in a line of mounting threats to democracy by President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw \"sickened my stomach\".\n\n\"We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,\" the New York senator said from the Senate floor.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Senator Padilla \"chose disrespectful political theatre\" and Secret Service agents \"thought he was an attacker\".\n\nThe statement claimed Senator Padilla did not identify himself, but video shows he did as he was being pushed from the room.\n\n\"Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers' repeated commands,\" the statement said, adding \"officers acted appropriately\".\n\nEmerging afterward, Senator Padilla said he was removed while demanding answers about the Trump administration's \"increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions\".\n\nHe said he and his colleagues had received little to no response to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.\n\n\"If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day labourers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California, and throughout the country,\" he said.\n\nMs Noem told Fox LA afterward that she had a \"great\" conversation with Senator Padilla after the scuffle, but called his approach \"something that I don't think was appropriate at all\".\n\nThe White House has accused the senator of grandstanding.\n\n\"Padilla didn't want answers;

Esto dejó a los migrantes en Tijuana devastados, ya que las citas que habían esperado durante meses fueron eliminadas repentinamente.\n\nLa administración Trump “les quitó la alfombra a quienes habían tomado decisiones drásticas y costosas basándose en los requisitos de procesamiento que el gobierno había creado”, alega la demanda. Los demandantes argumentaron que Trump y su administración han “establecido barreras que han hecho prácticamente imposible” que los demandantes y otros solicitantes de asilo en situaciones similares accedan al proceso de asilo en los puertos de entrada.\n\nSkye Perryman, presidenta y directora ejecutiva de Democracy Forward, una de las organizaciones que representa a los demandantes, afirmó que Trump esencialmente ha abandonado a “solicitantes de asilo que huyen de circunstancias peligrosas temiendo por sus vidas, en una extralimitación ilegal que pone en peligro a miles de personas, incluidos niños, en circunstancias extremas”.\n\n“Estados Unidos ha ofrecido refugio a quienes buscan asilo durante el último medio siglo. Esta administración no puede socavar nuestros valores y derechos democráticos consagrados en la legislación estadounidense de un plumazo”, declaró Perryman.\n\nLa demanda nombra como acusados ​​a Trump, a la secretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), Kristi Noem, al secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, a la fiscal general, Pamela Bondi, y a dos funcionarios interinos de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP). El DHS no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios el miércoles por la tarde.\n\nLos demandantes en el caso incluyen ciudadanos de México, Colombia, Venezuela, Afganistán, Haití, Rusia, Guatemala y Ecuador. Entre sus desgarradoras historias, una mujer mexicana alega haber sido secuestrada repetidamente por un cártel notoriamente violento por cooperar con las autoridades en la investigación del asesinato de su primer esposo. Alega que el cártel desapareció a su hijo, su nuera y su nieta de dos años. La demanda alega que ella y su segundo esposo tenían una cita el 9 de febrero para una evaluación de asilo en el puerto de entrada de San Ysidro, pero fue cancelada el día de la toma de posesión.\n\nLa demanda afirma que cada uno de los demandantes, incluido un haitiano que estaba en la fila para su cita programada en CBP One cuando esta fue cancelada repentinamente el día de la toma de posesión, “tiene la intención de buscar protección en Estados Unidos” presentándose en los puertos de entrada entre Estados Unidos y México, pero las acciones de los demandados han “cerrado todo acceso al asilo en los puertos de entrada”, dejándolos sin ningún método para buscar protección.\n\nTambién se nombran como demandantes Al Otro Lado, con sede en Los Ángeles pero oficinas en San Diego y Tijuana, y la Alianza del Puente Haitiano, con sede en San Diego. Ambas organizaciones brindan asistencia legal y humanitaria a solicitantes de asilo y alegan que las acciones de los demandados “han obstaculizado su capacidad para llevar a cabo sus actividades principales”.\n\nLa demanda sostiene que, según la legislación estadounidense, los migrantes deben poder solicitar asilo si llegan a Estados Unidos o a un puerto de entrada y tienen un “temor creíble de persecución” si regresan a sus países de origen. La demanda sostiene que, desde que Trump asumió el cargo en 2016, el poder ejecutivo ha “inventado un experimento político tras otro para restringir el acceso al asilo”.\n\nEntre las políticas señaladas en la demanda se encuentra la práctica de “metering”, es decir, devolver a los solicitantes de asilo y obligarlos a esperar en México para ser procesados ​​posteriormente. Esta práctica comenzó durante la administración Obama y posteriormente fue formalizada por la administración Trump. Un juez federal de San Diego la declaró posteriormente inconstitucional en un fallo confirmado por el Tribunal de Apelaciones del Noveno Circuito de Estados Unidos.\n\nDespués llegó el Título 42, una orden de salud pública emitida por la primera administración Trump que se utilizó para impedir la entrada a Estados Unidos de solicitantes de asilo y otros migrantes durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Cuando el gobierno de Biden puso fin al Título 42 en mayo de 2023, comenzó a depender casi exclusivamente de la aplicación CBP One, implementada en enero de 2023.\n\nLa aplicación tenía sus problemas: solo estaba disponible en ciertos idiomas y a menudo los solicitantes de asilo tardaban meses en programar una cita. Sin embargo, casi un millón de migrantes programaron citas de evaluación a través de la aplicación entre enero de 2023 y diciembre de 2024. En la frontera entre San Diego y Tijuana, se admitían diariamente a unas 400 personas con citas confirmadas.\n\nEn su primer día de regreso a la Casa Blanca, Trump emitió una orden ejecutiva titulada “Asegurando Nuestras Fronteras” que puso fin al uso de la aplicación CBP One, entre muchas otras medidas antiinmigratorias.\n\nLa demanda sostiene que otras partes de esa orden ejecutiva han hecho prácticamente imposible solicitar asilo en Estados Unidos y constituyen una “Política de Cierre del Asilo”.\n\nLa demanda del miércoles es al menos la segunda demanda importante que cuestiona las políticas de asilo del gobierno, sumándose a una presentada en febrero en el Tribunal de Distrito de Estados Unidos en Washington, D.C.\n\nOriginal story","summary":"El presidente Donald Trump canceló las citas para la evaluación de asilo realizadas a través de la aplicación CBP One","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/06/12/demanda-en-san-diego-desafia-el-cierre-de-procesos-de-asilo-en-los-cruces-fronterizos-entre-estados-unidos-y-mexico/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SUT-L-BORDER-APP-0122-17.jpg?w=1024&h=721","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:09:59","author":"Alex Riggins","authors":["Alex Riggins"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.698},{"id":330864028,"title":"F.D. Flam: ‘Organs-on-a-chip’ is one of many alternatives to animal testing","text":"There’s one area of surprising agreement in the often adversarial relationship between conservatives and the scientific community: the need to phase out animal testing in biomedical research.\n\nThe new leaders of both the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have said they plan to reduce their use in federally funded research, continuing an effort started in the Biden administration.\n\nTechnology is helping bring about change with advances that allow scientists to create structures from human cells that can mimic our organs. In some contexts, those cells work better for studying diseases and drug side effects than traditional experiments that lead to the deaths of millions of rodents, dogs and primates every year.\n\nThe primary argument for using animals in research has been their biological similarity to humans, which allows scientists to observe diseases and treatments that are not easily replicated with other methods. Animal safety testing is sometimes required before human trials can begin.\n\nTraditional opponents of such testing have been animal rights activists and others whom critics have sometimes labeled as anti-science. But raising ethical concerns about such research isn’t anti-science. In fact, failing to acknowledge them ignores what science has shown us about animals’ emotional complexity, including altruism among rodents and evidence that they are sentient and experience pain, suffering and fear just as we do.\n\nWe have an ethical imperative to find alternatives.\n\n“If you read through the animal ethics literature, half the citations are to science articles about the structure of animals’ brains,” said Jonathan Kimmelman, a professor of biomedical ethics at McGill University. We don’t allow experiments on prison inmates, for example, even if it would benefit science.\n\nKimmelman said there’s evidence that some alternatives maintain or even improve the quality of research and save money.\n\nThere’s still much work to be done to ensure the alternatives work as well as the traditional methods. Then, more research is needed to standardize and scale them for widespread use. Two of the more promising approaches involve tools known as “organs-on-a-chip” and organoids.\n\nOrgans-on-a-chip are miniature devices that use human cells to mimic organs. Harvard bioengineer Donald Ingber and his colleagues demonstrated that cells configured into a liver-on-a-chip, for example, were far better than lab mice in predicting the toxicity of a variety of drugs.\n\nIngber said these chips are so named because the first ones borrowed miniaturization techniques from the computer chip industry. He is also developing them for the lungs, intestines, lymph nodes and women’s reproductive organs. They can also be modeled to represent infections and tumors — even rare diseases, he said. In 2014, he founded the biotech Emulate Inc. to scale up the technology.\n\nIngber, founding director of Harvard’s Wyss Institute, said he was ordered to stop work on several projects soon after the Trump administration escalated its attacks on the university for refusing to cede to the president’s demands. He had grants from NASA and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to use the chips to study the health effects of radiation on organs. “We were making great progress” before the stop work orders came in, he said.\n\nLena Smirnova, an assistant professor in engineering and public health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is using human cells configured into structures called organoids. Scientists start with stem cells — usually adult cells that are programmed to revert to an embryonic stage. The cells are prompted to develop into organs. “Even if it’s not an entire organism, they will still better recapitulate certain aspects of human physiology than animals will do,” Smirnova said.\n\nHer lab focuses on the development of brain organoids, which can be created from cells obtained from healthy individuals or those with autism, Alzheimer’s disease, or other conditions. They can mimic not just brain cells but aspects of brain architecture. They’re even figuring out how to simulate learning and memory by using electrical stimulation of the organoids and reading their EEG patterns.\n\nShe’s using the technology to answer questions about the effects of pesticides, flame retardants, lead and other heavy metals and environmental hazards on brain development.\n\nKimmelman, the ethicist, said he thinks the broad agreement on the need to reduce animal testing is similar to the moral evolution that turned workplace sexual harassment from something that was mostly tolerated to unacceptable. As long as this evolution happens gradually and society commits to developing alternatives, the change could eventually improve the quality of science. However, research and development require funding, and now is the time for increased support for science, not less.\n\nF.D. Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering science.

It is premature to call it a broad-based anti-war movement, which can happen only when all the Israeli hostages are returned. But I did see signals flashing that more Israelis, from the left to the center and to even parts of the right, are concluding that continuing this war is a disaster for Israel morally, diplomatically or strategically.\n\nFrom the political center, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert wrote an essay in the newspaper Haaretz in which he pulled no punches against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition.\n\n“The government of Israel is currently waging a war without purpose, without goals or clear planning and with no chances of success,” Olmert argued. “What we are doing in Gaza now is a war of devastation: indiscriminate, limitless, cruel and criminal killing of civilians.” His conclusion: “Yes, Israel is committing war crimes.”\n\nFrom the right, you have the likes of Amit Halevi, a member of Netanyahu’s own right-wing Likud party, who is staunchly pro-war but thinks its execution has been bungled. Halevi had his membership on the Knesset’s foreign affairs and defense committee suspended by Netanyahu’s coalition after he voted against a proposal to extend the government’s ability to issue emergency call-up orders for Israeli reservists. In an interview with the newspaper Yediot Ahronot following his dismissal, Halevi said, “This war is a deception. They lied to us about its achievements.” Israel has “been fighting a war for 20 months with failed plans,” and it “is not succeeding in destroying Hamas.”\n\nAnd from the left, Yair Golan, the leader of Israel’s liberal alliance, called the Democrats, stated in an interview with Israel Radio: “Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don’t return to acting like a sane country. A sane country does not fight against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the aim of expelling populations.”\n\nAfter the “hobby” comment drew an outcry, Golan, himself a Gaza war hero, clarified that he was not blaming the military but rather the politicians who were extending the war for reasons that no longer have anything to do with Israel’s national security needs.\n\nWhile Golan probably should have used a different word, so as not to give Israeli rightists an easy way to discredit him, the truth is this: Virtually no independent foreign journalists have been allowed to report firsthand from Gaza. When this war is over and Gaza is saturated with international reporters and photographers free to roam, the level of death and destruction is going to be fully reported and pictured — and that is going to be a very bad time for Israel and world Jewry.\n\nSo Golan was right to warn his nation — bluntly — to stop now, forge a ceasefire, get the hostages back, get an international and Arab force into Gaza, and deal with the remnants of Hamas later. When you are in a hole, stop digging.\n\nBut Netanyahu keeps digging\n\nUnfortunately, Netanyahu has insisted on continuing to dig, claiming that he can bomb Hamas into giving up its remaining 20 or so living Israeli hostages — and because the religious-nationalist members of his coalition have essentially told him that if he stops the war, they will topple him. So the Israeli military is going after more and more secondary targets, and the result is Gaza civilians being killed every day.\n\nAmos Harel, the military analyst for Haaretz, explained why: “Many bombing runs are actually assassination attempts against Hamas leaders, often when they’re with their families. And these officials no longer live in private houses or apartment buildings — they’re usually in the crowded tent camps with thousands of civilians. Even when the army declares multiple steps of caution, these attacks result in massive killing.”\n\nIt is not only, and indeed not even mostly, the rise in Gaza civilian casualties that is turning more and more Israelis against the war. It’s simply that the war has worn down the whole society. The signs, Harel notes, are everything from “an increasing number of suicides (which the army doesn’t report) to families that are breaking up and businesses that are collapsing. The government conveniently ignores these developments and scatters promises of victory instead.”\n\nTrapped by their leaders\n\nIf many Israelis feel trapped by their own leaders, many people in Gaza clearly feel the same. Polling in Gaza is obviously difficult, but the anti-war movement there seems to be stirring as well — although there you can get killed by Hamas for protesting. A survey by the independent, Ramallah-based Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research of people across the Gaza Strip found that 48% supported the anti-Hamas demonstrations that erupted in several places in recent weeks.\n\nIndeed, be assured that it’s not only some Israeli leaders who will face a reckoning when the guns of Gaza finally fall silent. Hamas’ leaders will live in infamy. They attacked Israeli border communities on Oct. 7, 2023, and, when Israel predictably retaliated, they essentially offered up Gaza’s civilians as a collective human sacrifice to win global sympathy for their cause — while Hamas leaders hid in tunnels and abroad. Hamas is still operating, but now Gaza is unlivable. Yet Hamas’ leadership is still stubbornly saying it will not turn over all its remaining live hostages unless Israel agrees to leave Gaza and return to an open-ended ceasefire.\n\nReally? Israel should leave all of Gaza and accept a ceasefire? What a great idea. If Hamas achieved that “victory,” it would mean that Hamas fought this entire war — losing tens of thousands of fighters and civilians and having few buildings in Gaza left intact — in order to get back to exactly what Hamas had on Oct. 6, 2023: a ceasefire and Israel out of Gaza.\n\nFor this alone, history will remember Hamas leaders as mendacious fools. They thought they were unleashing an apocalypse on Israel and instead unleashed an apocalypse on their own people that also ended up giving license to Netanyahu to destroy their ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon and Syria, which weakened Iran’s grip on both of those nations, as well as on Iraq, and helped drive Russia out of Syria. It was a rout of the Iran-led “resistance network.”\n\nBut here’s the rub. As a result of Netanyahu’s military operations, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah — not to mention Saudi Arabia — are all now much freer to join the Abraham Accords and normalize relations with Israel to a degree they never were when Iran’s regional mercenary network was so powerful.\n\nYes, Netanyahu made that happen. But he also never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity for peace. Netanyahu today staunchly refuses to harvest what Netanyahu has sown. He will not do the one thing that would unlock the politics of the whole region: Open a road, no matter how long, to a two-state solution with a reformed Palestinian Authority.\n\nNo wonder Donald Trump doesn’t want to waste time with Netanyahu — he can’t make any money from him, and Netanyahu won’t allow Trump to make any history with him.\n\nThe more I would argue to Israelis that Netanyahu is making a historic mistake — trading peace with Saudi Arabia for peace with the far-right extremists who keep him in power — the more they would ask me “Do you think Trump can save us?” That question is the ultimate sign that your democracy is in trouble.\n\n‘Bibi is actually their pawn, not the real player’\n\nI had to explain that Trump goes to countries that give him things — cash, 747s, $Trump meme coin and Official Melania Meme sales, arms purchases, hotel deals, golf courses, AI data centers — and not countries that ask him for things, like Israel.\n\nIn fairness to Trump, he probably has no idea how much Israel has internally changed. Even many American Jews don’t understand how big and powerful the ultra-Orthodox and religious-settler-nationalist community in Israel has grown and how much it sees Gaza as a religious war.\n\n“Bibi is actually their pawn, not the real player,” explained Avrum Burg, a former speaker of the Knesset, referring to the religious-nationalist-settler right in Israel. “You tell them Israel could have peace with Saudi Arabia and they will shrug and tell you that they are waiting for the Messiah. You tell them they could have peace with Syria, and they will tell you the Jewish people already own Syria — it’s part of Greater Israel. You tell them about international law, they will tell you biblical law. You will tell them Hamas, they will tell you Amalek” (a biblical enemy of the Israelites).\n\nThe real divide in Israel today, concluded Burg, who teaches about relations between religion and state, is not between conservatives and progressives. “It’s between the Jewish tribe and the democratic tribe. And the Jewish tribe is now winning. If Zionism was originally the triumph of secular nationalism over religious Judaism, what is happening to today is the resurgence of religious-nationalist Judaism over democracy.”\n\nUndermining courts and more\n\nAnd so, after a week, I flew home from off-Broadway — Israel — only to discover that the same play, only bigger, is running on Broadway, in America. It is eerie to watch how Trump and Netanyahu are using a similar playbook to undermine their respective democracies. My only question is whose authoritarian impulses will trigger a full-blown constitutional crisis first.\n\nEach leader stands accused of trying to undermine his country’s courts and the “deep state’’ — i.e., all the institutions that uphold the rule of law. In Trump’s case, it’s effectively to enrich himself personally and shift wealth in the country from the least privileged to the most privileged. In Netanyahu’s case, it’s effectively to escape the many corruption charges against him and shift power and money away from the democratic, moderate Israeli center to the settlers and the ultra-Orthodox. That group will keep Netanyahu’s coalition in office as long as he excuses the ultra-Orthodox from fighting in Gaza and allows the settlers to continue their march to annex the West Bank today and Gaza tomorrow.\n\nWhen Netanyahu was elected in November 2022 and began forming his Jewish supremacist coalition, I wrote a column the next morning headlined “The Israel We Knew Is Gone.’’ I hope I was premature — but I hope even more that I won’t soon have to write the same column about America.\n\nThe year 2026 will have a lot to say about whether the Netanyahu and Trump cults can be contained. That year, Netanyahu will have to hold national elections, and Trump will have to face the midterms. Those committed to democracy and decency in both countries have one job between now and then: Organize, organize, organize to win power.\n\nNothing else matters. And everything is riding on it.\n\nThomas Friedman writes a column for the New York Times.","summary":"If many Israelis feel trapped by their own leaders, many people in Gaza clearly feel the same. Polling in Gaza is obviously difficult, but the anti-war movement there seems to be stirring as well — although there you can get killed by Hamas for protesting.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/06/12/thomas-friedman-an-anti-war-movement-is-stirring-in-israel/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Israel_Palestinians_84050-1.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-13 00:05:05","author":"Thomas Friedman","authors":["Thomas Friedman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.515}]}
