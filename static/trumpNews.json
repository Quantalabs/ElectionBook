Former President Donald Trump owns the club and was playing golf on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Fla. The prosecutors also charged Routh with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and assaulting a federal officer. They earlier charged Routh with removing a firearm's serial number and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The prosecutors say Routh created a list of venues and dates from August to October where Trump either appeared or was scheduled to appear while campaigning for a second term as president. Prosecutors also say Routh months ago sent a letter to a witness in which he said, \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you.\" According to prosecutors, the only reason Routh was in West Palm Beach on Sept. 15 and in August was to assassinate Trump. A Secret Service agent thwarted Routh's plan when he spotted the barrel of an SKS-style rifle with a scope protruding from the treeline located near the sixth green on the golf course. The agent opened fire on Routh, who fled the scene but was arrested on a nearby highway. Secret Service agents escorted Trump to a safe location while police searched for the suspect. The case is assigned to Judge Aileen Cannon with an arraignment hearing scheduled for Monday. Cannon recently dismissed special counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump, accusing him of violating federal law by retaining classified documents. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a House bill requiring equal Secret Service protection for major party candidates after Trump survived the second assassination attempt on Sept. 15. An earlier assassination attempt made by Matthew Crooks, 20, during Trump's rally in Butler, Pa., on July 13 ended with a Secret Service sniper shooting Crooks dead after he struck Trump's right ear and killed a bystander. The proposed legislation goes to President Joe Biden for consideration.","summary":"Federal prosecutors charged Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, with the attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/09/24/ryan-routh-charged-trump-assassination-attempt/1721727220722/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1721727220722/2024/upi/4a472ed4b846b2eeeb775fef4b7c03ab/v1.2/Ryan-Routh-charged-with-attempted-Trump-assassination.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:59:10","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":257296618,"title":"Trump golf course suspect Ryan Routh charged with attempted assassination","text":"Washington — The man arrested after he was allegedly spotted by Secret Service with a high-powered rifle at a golf course a few hundred yards away from former President Donald Trump is being charged with attempted assassination of a political figure. A federal grand jury in Miami indicted Ryan Wesley Routh Tuesday on a charge of attempting to kill Trump on Sept. 15. The charge carries a maximum potential sentence of life in prison. He was also indicted on charges of assaulting federal officer and a third firearms count, adding to the two that he was charged with last week. The case has been assigned to Trump appointee Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the government’s classified documents case against him in July. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh and the barrel of a gun in the bushes along the fence at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, while Trump was playing golf at the course earlier this month. No shots were fired at the former president, but the Secret Service agent fired at the suspect, who fled and was later arrested. Months ago, according to a court filing on Monday, Routh had left a handwritten letter with a man that said: “This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster.” The court filing also revealed that Routh had a list of dates and places in his vehicle where Trump had appeared or was expected to appear, as well as a cellphone that had searched for directions from West Palm Beach to Mexico. Near the fence at the golf club, the FBI found an AK-47 style rifle with a scope attached and extended magazine. The rifle was loaded with 11 rounds, and its serial number was obliterated and unreadable, according to a court filing. A backpack and shopping bag found at the site contained plates that “were capable of stopping small arms fire,” according to the filing. “Violence targeting public officials endangers everything our country stands for, and the Department of Justice will use every available tool to hold Ryan Routh accountable for the attempted assassination of former President Trump charged in the indictment,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Tuesday. “The Justice Department will not tolerate violence that strikes at the heart of our democracy, and we will find and hold accountable those who perpetrate it. This must stop.” FBI Director Christopher Wray said the bureau is still investigating the alleged plot. At his detention hearing on Monday, Routh was ordered to remain in federal custody. The incident is the second time since July in which Trump has been targeted. He was shot in the ear at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The gunman, who was killed by a sniper, killed one attendee and wounded two others.","summary":"Washington — The man arrested after he was allegedly spotted by Secret Service with a high-powered rifle at a golf course a few hundred yards away from former President Donald Trump is being charged with attempted assassination of a political figure.  A federal grand jury in Miami indicted Ryan Wesley Routh Tuesday on a charge &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Trump golf course suspect Ryan Routh charged with attempted assassination appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/trump-golf-course-suspect-ryan-routh-charged-with-attempted-assassination/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/16/f74f6f70-ae35-4a6a-b6ca-c59c8f1e8c3d/thumbnail/1200x630g2/236085f1b547bf8a6db482a4d1890dcc/ryan-wesley-routh-arrest.jpg?v=36448e13600c4b59440e954caff28fc1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:59:03","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.734},{"id":257296396,"title":"Judge grants special counsel Jack Smith’s motion to file an ‘oversized’ brief on presidential immunity in Trump 2020 election interference case ","text":"The federal judge overseeing former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election interference case approved a request by special counsel Jack Smith on Tuesday allowing him to file an “oversized” brief responding to the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. Smith sought permission for District Judge Tanya Chutkan to file a “comprehensive” opening brief explaining how the government intends to prosecute Trump in light of the Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling which granted the 45th president absolute immunity for certain presidential acts. The special counsel’s Saturday request noted that his brief – due to Chutkan on Thursday – would be “quadruple” the size of the court’s 45-page limit and contain a “substantial number of exhibits,” including potential new evidence in the case. “The length and breadth of the Government’s proposed brief reflects the uniquely ‘challenging’ and factbound nature of those determinations,” Judge Chutkan wrote in her ruling, referring to the prosecution’s effort to apply the Supreme Court’s immunity decision to the case. Trump’s legal team opposed the request, calling Smith’s proposed filing a “monstrosity” and arguing that the government “aims to proffer their untested and biased views to the Court and the public as if they are conclusive” just weeks before Election Day. Last month, Smith filed a superseding indictment against Trump in response to the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision. Trump, 78, remains charged with the same four counts unveiled last August in connection with his bid to overturn his 2020 election defeat by Joe Biden, but Smith’s team retooled some of their arguments to comply with the high court’s determination that the former president enjoys “absolute” immunity from prosecution for certain official acts. The former president has pleaded not guilty on all counts and has demanded a total dismissal of the case. The case will not head to trial before Election Day on Nov. 5.","summary":"The special counsel’s Saturday request noted that his brief – due to Chutkan on Thursday – would be “quadruple” the size of the court’s 45-page limit and contain a “substantial number of exhibits,” including  potential new evidence in the case.   ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/24/us-news/judge-grants-special-counsel-jack-smiths-motion-to-file-an-oversized-brief-on-presidential-immunity-in-trump-2020-election-interference-case/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/judge-grants-special-counsel-jack-90335040.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/u1Lz48cO-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:52:26","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.116},{"id":257296178,"title":"\"The Bro Vote\": Analyzing Trump's efforts to court young men","text":"\"The Bro Vote\": Analyzing Trump's efforts to court young men Between UFC appearances, podcast interviews and cryptocurrency ventures, former President Donald Trump's campaign has made it their mission to court young men, or as it is often referred to, \"the bro vote.\" Peter Hamby, host of the Snapchat show \"Good Luck America,\" joins CBS News to discuss the efforts.","summary":"Between UFC appearances, podcast interviews and cryptocurrency ventures, former President Donald Trump's campaign has made it their mission to court young men, or as it is often referred to, \"the bro vote.\" Peter Hamby, host of the Snapchat show \"Good Luck America,\" joins CBS News to discuss the efforts.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/bro-vote-analyzing-trump-efforts-court-young-men/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/24/45001909-edd7-414b-b833-5348ee13a944/thumbnail/1200x630/5737bd023516b0e72b1cb56ebaea098d/cbsn-fusion-bro-vote-analyzing-trumps-efforts-court-young-men-thumbnail.jpg?v=36448e13600c4b59440e954caff28fc1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:41:14","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.257},{"id":257296184,"title":"Trump, Harris highlight economic policies","text":"Trump, Harris highlight economic policies Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are both highlighting their economic proposals in campaign stops this week.

The strong show of bipartisan support came days after the House passed the measure, known as the Enhanced Presidential Security Act, without any opposition in a 405-0 vote. The bill would give former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris the same level of protection provided to Biden. At only three pages long, the bill gives broad discretion to the Secret Service on how to apply measures to reach that level. It comes the same month as an apparent second attempt to assassinate Trump. Biden called on Congress to act last week, saying that the Secret Service “needs more help.” The Trump campaign, the Harris campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Senate passage of the bill. The Enhanced Presidential Security Act was introduced in the House by Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., brought the legislation to the Senate floor. Following the House vote on Friday, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said during a press conference that Trump is already receiving “the highest levels of secret service protection.” He added that Trump was receiving everything Biden is “with respect to Secret Service.” At the same time, Rowe said the agency needs “a paradigm shift” in its approach to protecting presidents. The passage of the bill comes as the House mulls a broader spending measure that includes a plan to provide an additional $231 million for the Secret Service. It also comes a day after Trump accused the Justice Department of “downplaying” the alleged assassination plot against him in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump was previously shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — The Senate unanimously passed legislation Tuesday to boost Secret Service&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Congress Approves Bill to Enhance Security for Presidential Candidates Following Alleged Plot Against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/congress-approves-bill-to-enhance-security-for-presidential-candidates-following-alleged-plot-against-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Congress-passes-bill-to-boost-presidential-candidate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:36:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":257295460,"title":"From India to S Korea, people peacefully deciding their future through elections this year: Biden","text":"UNITED NATIONS, Sep 24 : Citing the example of India, US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that the world witnessed people across the globe “peacefully” choosing their future through elections held this year. “We’ve seen citizens across the world peacefully choosing their future, from Ghana to India to South Korea – nations representing one-quarter of humanity will hold elections this year alone,” Biden said as he addressed world leaders from the podium of the UN General Assembly Tuesday. Delivering his last address as President of the United States, Biden told the General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly “it is remarkable, the power of we the people, that makes me more optimistic about the future than I’ve ever been since I was first elected to United States Senate 1972.” The Indian general elections, conducted in seven stages over six weeks, concluded in June this year and were the largest electoral exercise in the history of mankind, with 650 million voters exercising their franchise and bringing the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi back to power for a historic consecutive third term.

It was a difficult decision. Being president has been the honour of my life. There’s so much more I want to get done. As much as I love this job, I love my country more. I decided, after 50 years of public service, it’s time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward. My fellow leaders, let us never forget, that some things are more important than staying in power.

Ryan Routh, 58, was hit with the charge in federal court Tuesday morning, a little over a week removed from the failed assassination on the prominent political candidate. He had already been facing two gun-related charges after cops said he pointed a rifle through a fence at Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, where he is now being tried. The indictment came during the suspect’s second day in court, after the Justice Department asked a grand jury on Monday to approve the more serious attempted assassination charge, which carries a max sentence of life in prison. Routh previously faced 20 years, after staking out the aspiring two-term president for 12 hours, feds said. ‘Violence targeting public officials endangers everything our country stands for, and the Department of Justice will use every available tool to hold [Routh] accountable for the attempted assassination,’ said AG Merrick Garland of the updated indictment. ‘The Justice Department will not tolerate violence that strikes at the heart of our democracy, and we will find and hold accountable those who perpetrate it. ‘This must stop.’ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco issued her own statement, in which she painted the suspect’s alleged actions as ‘a direct attack on our democracy. ‘Political violence has no place in this country – not then, not now, not ever,’ she said in a press release Tuesday afternoon. ‘The charges today reflect the Department’s continued resolve to deploy every available resource to ensure public officials remain safe and to hold accountable those who target public officials to the fullest extent of the law.’ FBI Director Christopher Wray also responded to the development, remarking in his own statement how the charge of assassinating a presidential candidate ‘strikes at the very heart of our democratic system.’ ‘The FBI is continuing our investigation into this alleged plot and will use the full weight and resources of the FBI to uncover and provide as much information as possible about what led to the events in West Palm Beach,’ Wray said. ‘In our country, we have to hold accountable people who resort to violence.’ As the charge was announced, Trump continued to campaign in Georgia Tuesday, speaking at the Johnny Mercer Theatre Civic Center in Savannah. This comes as polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in a tight race ahead of the looming election, where states like Georgia will likely prove pivotal in the selection of the next president. Trump’s focus in Savannah seemed to surround promises to lower taxes and putting a premium on American manufacturing. He also spent much of his 90 minutes speech criticizing Harris’s policies, as several experts have suggested he focus on his rival’s track record in the current administration when it comes to he border and the economy. During that span, Trump did not mention the second attempt on his life, or the hearing that was occurring just a few hundred miles away in the Sunshine State. Prosecutors there said Routh spent a month in South Florida stalking the former commander-in-chief, with cell phone data putting him near the golf course and Trump´s Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago multiple times within that span. He was also found with a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump spoke or was expected to appear, the indictment revealed – detailing how a Secret Service agent opened fire after discovering the gun poking through a fence while searching the golf course ahead of Trump’s round. This caused Routh to flee, prosecutors said – explaining how he was then arrested within an hour, along a stretch of nearby highway. Feds also produced a chilling letter he penned admitting he failed in trying to take the life of the former president, where the suspect also offered $150,000 for anyone who could ‘finish the job’. ‘This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,’ a section of the note released by the Department of Justice on Monday and obtained by DailyMail.com read. ‘I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.’ It was addressed to ‘the world’ and accused Trump of ‘end[ing] relations with Iran unsuccessfully. In other court filings, feds wrote how the gunman was able to get near Trump on his Florida golf course because he does not have to same security detail as a sitting president – as was the case in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Routh, meanwhile, has yet to enter a plea. His lawyers sought to have him released on bond ahead of his trial but were unsuccessful. Prosecutors have alleged that months before the incident, Routh dropped off a letter to an unidentified person alluding to ‘an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.’ He was also convicted of unspecified felonies in North Carolina in December 2002 and March 2010, feds said Tuesday – adding that the FBI is investigating the case. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting, with the charges now finalized.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh accused of attempting to assassinate Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/58-year-old-ryan-wesley-routh-accused-of-attempting-to-assassinate-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/24/23/90057871-13888131-image-m-14_1727218052137.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:31:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":257295470,"title":"FBI finds violent crime declined in 2023. Here’s what happened","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Violent crime in the U.S. dropped in 2023, according to FBI statistics that show a continued trend downward after a coronavirus pandemic-era crime spike. Overall violent crime declined an estimated 3% in 2023 from the year before, according to the FBI report Monday. Murders and non-negligent manslaughter dropped nearly 12%. Violent crime has become a focal point in the 2024 presidential race, with former President Donald Trump recently claiming that crime is “through the roof” under President Joe Biden’s administration. Even with the 2020 pandemic surge, violent crime is down dramatically from the 1990s. Here’s what to know about the FBI’s report and the state of crime in the U.S.: The numbers Crime surged during the coronavirus pandemic, with homicides increasing nearly 30% in 2020 over the previous year — the largest one-year jump since the FBI began keeping records. The rise defied easy explanation, though experts said possible contributors included the massive disruption of the pandemic, gun violence, worries about the economy and intense stress. Violent crime across the U.S. dipped to near pre-pandemic levels in 2022, according to the FBI’s data. It continued to tick down last year, with the rate falling from about 377 violent crimes per 100,000 people to in 2022 to about 364 per 100,000 people in 2023. That’s just slightly higher than the 2019 rate, according to Deputy Assistant Director Brian Griffith of the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Division. “Are we looking at crime rates at a return to pre-pandemic levels? I think a reasonable person would look at that and say, ‘Yes, that’s what has happened,’” Griffith said in an interview with The Associated Press. Law enforcement agencies in the biggest municipalities in the U.S. — communities with at least 1 million people — showed the biggest drop in violent crime last year — nearly 7%. Agencies in communities between 250,000 and 499,999 people reported a slight increase — 0.3%— between 2022 and 2023. Rapes decreased more than 9% while aggravated assault decreased nearly 3%. Overall property crime decreased more than 2%, but motor vehicle theft shot up nearly 13%. The motor vehicle theft rate — nearly 319 per 100,000 people — was the highest last year since 2007. The limitations of the FBI’s data The FBI collects data through its Uniform Crime Reporting Program, and not all law enforcement agencies in the U.S. participate. The 2023 report is based on data from more than 16,000 agencies, or more than 85 percent of those agencies in the FBI’s program. The agencies included in the report protect nearly 316 million people across the U.S. And every agency with at least 1 million people in its jurisdiction provided a full year of data to the FBI, according to the report. “What you’re not seeing in that number are a lot of very small agencies,” Griffith said. Other crime reports The FBI’s report is in line with the findings of the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice, which earlier this year analyzed crimes rates across 39 U.S cities, and found that most violent crimes are at or below 2019 levels. That group found there were 13 percent fewer homicides across 29 cities that provided data during the first half of 2024 compared the same period the year before. On the campaign trail, Trump has cited another recent Justice Department survey to suggest the crime is out of control under the Biden administration. That National Crime Victimization Survey, released earlier this month, shows that the violent crime victimization rate rose from about 16 per 1,000 people in 2020 to 22.5 in 2023. But the report notes that the rate last year was not statistically different from the rate in 2019 — when Trump was president. And the rate has declined dramatically overall since the 1990s. The FBI’s report and the National Crime Victimization Survey use different methodologies and capture different things. The victimization survey is conducted every year through interviews with about 240,000 people to determine whether they were victims of crimes.

The former First Lady of the US secretly played a key role in the royal romance, the Mail on Sunday reported. Harry, 33, and Barack Obama have been firm friends since they first met in 2015, when the former President was still in office. In particular, they bonded over their involvement with the Invictus Games and were pictured laughing together in Toronto last year. But now it's been claimed the connection goes deeper still. A source told the MoS: \"Michelle had a hand in introducing Harry to Meghan. In his mind there wouldn’t be a wedding without her and that is reason enough to invite them. He was not happy such a legitimate reason was ignored.\" It was widely known that the couple had wanted to invite the Obamas but that it would have caused a huge diplomatic headache for the government. Harry and Meghan are known to dislike President Donald Trump, who was the US Commander in Chief when they wed, and to snub him while inviting his rival could have sparked uproar. It appears the royal couple have had to accept defeat. Neither the Obamas, President Trump or the then Prime Minister of the Theresa May attended the glittering event. The official reasoning was that it was not necessary to invite political leaders because Harry, unlike his brother William, is not likely to become king. A Kensington Palace spokesman said at the time: \"It has been decided that an official list of political leaders - both UK and international - is not required for Prince Harry and Ms Markle's wedding. Her Majesty's Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.\"","summary":"The former American First Lady is believed to have been instrumental in bringing the couple together but it was decided it wasn't appropriate for her to be at the wedding","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/michelle-obama-brought-harry-meghan-33694167","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29608957.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Hunter-Foundation-fundraising-dinner.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:30:00","author":"Steve Robson","authors":["Steve Robson"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":257295610,"title":"US charges suspected Trump gunman with attempted assassination","text":"WASHINGTON: The man accused of staking out Donald Trump's Florida golf course with a rifle was indicted on Tuesday on a charge of attempted assassination of a political candidate, federal prosecutors said.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, for \"baseless fearmongering\" in their unsubstantiated claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are \"eating their neighbor's pets.\" The leader of Haitian Bridge Alliance filed the charges in Clark County Municipal Court under a state statute that allows private citizens to file criminal charges. Their \"lies have harmed the Springfield community, and their lies have violated criminal law,\" the group said in a press release. Among the charges against the running mates are making false alarms, disrupting public service, committing telecommunications harassment, committing aggravated menacing and violating the prohibition against complicity, according to the Chandra Law Firm, which is representing the group. During this month's presidential debate, Trump claimed, \"In Springfield, they're eating dogs, the people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people who live there.\" Vance has made similar claims and, when confronted, told CNN, \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.\" Local officials in Springfield and the city's mayor have flatly denied claims of pet-eating, saying they have received no credible reports substantiating the rumors. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine called the claims a false \"piece of garbage\" as he acknowledged the immigration surge has caused other problems for the city. \"What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal. They came to Springfield to work. Ohio is on the move, and Springfield has really made a great resurgence with a lot of companies coming in,\" DeWine told ABC's \"This Week.\" DeWine confirmed he has sent money and additional state troopers to Springfield to handle a surge in healthcare issues and traffic problems that he attributed to the exploding migrant population. A bomb threat on Sept. 15 at Clark State College in Springfield forced officials to close the campus and hold classes virtually for the rest of the week. The Haitian nonprofit blamed Trump and Vance for the ongoing disruptions. \"The Haitian community is suffering in fear because of Trump and Vance's relentless, irresponsible, false alarms and public services have been disrupted. Trump and Vance must be held accountable to the rule of law,\" said lead counsel Subodh Chandra. \"Anyone else who wreaked havoc the way they did would have been arrested by now.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to Tuesday's charges. He said, \"President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.\"","summary":"A Haitian nonprofit in Ohio filed criminal charges Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen.

The poll, conducted from September 9-16, finds that Trump and Harris are locked at 47 percent among 692 likely voters when third-party candidates are included in the fray. One percent backs Libertarian Chase Oliver, while the Green Party’s Jill Stein does not secure a percent of support, and three percent are undecided. Trump leads Harris with both independents and Hispanic voters. Independents break for Trump over Harris by a 47 percent to 41 percent margin, while 49 percent of Hispanics prefer Trump and 44 percent support Harris. The poll gauged a strictly two-way race between Trump and Harris among the likely voters, finding Harris has a razor-thin edge on this front at 48 percent to 47 percent. Trump holds a five-point lead with independents and a three-point lead with Hispanics in this statistical tie. Noble Predictive Insights also sampled 812 registered voters, a less reliable data point considering likely voters are registered voters who plan to cast a ballot. In the four-way race, Harris has a 46 percent to 43 percent advantage over the 45th president with registered voters, while Oliver garners one percent and Stein does not procure a point. Three percent do not like any candidates, while six percent are unsure who they will back. Trump has a two percent advantage with independents, while Harris leads with Hispanics by two percent. Harris continues to hold the three-point edge in the hypothetical head-to-head race among registered voters. She draws 48 percent of support to Trump’s 45 percent. Seven percent are unsure. Harris’s leads in both iterations of the registered voter samples are within the ± 3.44 percent margin of error. The margin of error for likely voters is ± 3.72 percentage points. The poll further finds that likely voters trust Trump more on crucial issues, including immigration and inflation. On immigration, voters trust Trump over Harris by a 55 percent to 39 percent margin. They also believe Trump is better suited to handle inflation, at 47 percent to 44 percent.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are tied in the swing state of Nevada, according to a Noble Predictive Insights poll published Tuesday.\n\n\nThe post Poll: Donald Trump, Kamala Harris Locked in Dead Heat in Nevada appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/24/poll-donald-trump-kamala-harris-locked-in-dead-heat-in-nevada/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-Tied-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:21:20","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":257295024,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Tells Chiefs Fans Blaming Taylor Swift for Travis Kelce’s Performance to ‘Grow Up’","text":"The Kansas City Chiefs are 3-0 so far this NFL season, but some fans are still disappointed with tight end Travis Kelce‘s performance at the Atlanta Falcons game Sunday (Sept. 22). With some of them finding a way to blame it on his superstar girlfriend, however, Whoopi Goldberg is speaking up in Taylor Swift‘s defense. On the latest episode of The View Tuesday (Sept. 24), the talk show host cut right to the chase. “They apparently forgot that they won a Super Bowl last year with [Kelce], and [he and Swift] were just as tight then as they are now,” she said. “Grow up, y’all. Stop putting this on her. Your team is fine, your team is doing well. Shut up.” Though Kelce indeed had a quiet game on Sunday night, notching four receptions for 30 yards and no touchdowns in a nail-biting finish against the Falcons, the Chiefs were still able to win 22-17. Swift was not in attendance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Sunday, but she has been present at Kansas City’s first two home games of the season. “She wasn’t even at the game,” pointed out cohost Sunny Hostin. “Is she supposed to play the game too? “I also love how we’re acting like Taylor Swift is like a magic 8 ball,” added cohost Alyssa Farah. “She can’t magically affect his game.” The Sister Act star also shared her personal theory as to why Swift is experiencing backlash: her recent endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I’m blaming MAGA,” Goldberg said before subtly bringing up Republican opponent Donald Trump. “They’re mad that she is not supporting You Know Who.” Despite the team insisting that Swift’s presence in the Chiefs universe has only been positive, Sunday’s game is hardly the first time football fans have pointed fingers her way. In January, retired Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre suggested that the 14-time Grammy winner would be seen as a “distraction” if Kansas City didn’t win this year’s Super Bowl (they did the following month), and the NFL received so much negativity for its inclusion of Swift in game-day coverage that the league made a statement defending itself last year.

ABC News‘ World News Tonight continued its winning streak as the most-watched evening newscast for the eighth straight season, and even as the number one show in all of broadcast and cable, with and without sports, for 24 of the 52 weeks, per ABC. But year-over-year numbers are down across the board for all the networks, likely reflecting the audience declines overall in linear TV. For the 2023-24 season, World News Tonight averaged 7.72 million viewers, down 5% from a season earlier, while NBC Nightly News averaged 6.44 million, down 4%; and CBS Evening News averaged 4.65 million, down 4%. In the 25-54 demo, World News Tonight averaged 1.07 million, down 17%, while NBC Nightly News was at 955,000, down 14%; and CBS Evening News was at 665,000, down 12%. NBC Nightly News showed audience gains in the third quarter, boosted by its coverage of the Olympics. For the three month period, World News Tonight averaged 7.31 million, down 4% from the same period a year earlier; NBC Nightly News averaged 6.2 million, up 1%; and CBS Evening News averaged 4.34 million, down 2%. In the 25-54 demo, World News Tonight averaged 995,000, down 13%, compared to NBC Nightly News with 961,000, down 5%, and CBS Evening News with 608,000, down 9%. NBC Nightly News did score a ratings win in the adults 18-49 category in the third quarter, edging out World News Tonight with an average of 689,000 viewers. The ABC broadcast averaged 678,000, and CBS Evening News averaged 404,000. Year over year, NBC News says that it has narrowed the gap with ABC News in the demos and by 10% in total viewers. For the week of Sept. 16, World News Tonight averaged 7.18 million viewers, down 4% from the same period a year earlier, compared to NBC Nightly News with 5.61 million viewers, down 9% and CBS Evening News at 4.47 million viewers, from 4.46 million a year earlier. The week was the first full one following the end of Disney blackout on DirecTV systems. It also was the first week after the Sept. 10 presidential debate, which was followed by claims on the right that the World News Tonight audience has suffered amid a backlash over co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. President Donald Trump and his allies claimed bias when the moderators fact checked some of his wildest claims. But the 4% year-over-year decline also is in line with the year-over-year overall erosion of the evening news audience. The figures are from Nielsen via ABC News.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNetwork news divisions still count the end of the third week of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8216;World News Tonight&#8217; Maintains Highest Ratings for the Season, Yet All Networks Experience Decrease in Audience Numbers Compared to Last Year first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/world-news-tonight-maintains-highest-ratings-for-the-season-yet-all-networks-experience-decrease-in-audience-numbers-compared-to-last-year/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-‘World-News-Tonight-Again-Tops-Season-Ratings.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:17:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":257295004,"title":"Senate Democrat in must-win state comes out against Kamala Harris’ plan to end filibuster","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris is promising to end the filibuster in order to pass legislation codifying Roe v.

Semafor reported Tuesday that Tester has made it clear he would oppose Harris' efforts to do away with the filibuster outright if he wins another six-year term this November. The three-term Democrat clarified that while he wants to keep the filibuster, he would prefer changes to how it's wielded. “My stance is this: We need to change the filibuster into a talking filibuster,” Tester told Semafor. “We should not eliminate the filibuster.” READ MORE: GOP Senate candidate's account of military service 'does not match his own words': report Currently, legislation in the Senate is often stalled due to the filibuster, which happens when one member invokes a \"cloture\" vote. When cloture is invoked, 60 votes are needed in order to move a bill to the floor for an actual up-or-down vote. And because the Senate is so closely divided, this means cloture is often used to sink legislation unless it's overwhelmingly popular with both parties. According to Tester, changing the process to a \"talking\" filibuster would be more fair, as it would require any senator wishing to obstruct a vote to physically stand on the floor and speak continuously. This process is still occasionally used: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) became famous in 2010 for a talking filibuster in a failed attempt to block an extension of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. “I don’t want to make this thing like the House. We shouldn’t allow one person to stop this,” Tester said. “Make them talk. If they quit talking, vote.” Tester's promise to oppose eliminating the filibuster could mean he becomes another centrist thorn in the side of a Democratic administration, as Sens. Joe Manchin (I-West Virginia) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Arizona) were for President Joe Biden. Thanks to their efforts to keep the filibuster intact, Biden was unable to pass his landmark \"Build Back Better\" bill that would have created universal pre-K education, subsidized child care, allowed for three weeks of paid family leave and allowed Medicare to also cover dental and vision care, among others.

It was a hearing billed as outlining the plan’s “devastating impact on hardworking American taxpayers” and dealing with a wide range of the plan’s proposals — which are extensive in scope and deal with everything from energy policy to education. But the vast majority of the hearing’s time centered around one issue: abortion access, and the dangerous circumstances which abortion bans across conservatives states around the country can leave women facing. It’s hard to fault Democrats for fixating on that part of the plan, given the shocking stories that have emerged from woment stuck waiting for their conditions to worsen before doctors would treat them, afraid of running afoul of legislation banning abortion care except in life-threatening circumstances. But the party could run the risk of overshadowing efforts to highlight other aspects of the plan, like how it represents a path to undoing decades of regulation and policies dealing with the environment and could bring to a halt the US’s efforts to fight climate change. There’s also the blueprint for eroding the independence of the Justice Department, which has alarmed constitutional law and ethics watchdogs. Still, the party’s strategy is inarguably working: An NBC News poll released on Sunday indicates that the “Project 2025” brand is in the absolute furthest depths of unpopularity. More than half of those surveyed — registered voters from a nationwide sample of 1,000 — have a negative view of the policy project, while just 4 percent viewed it positively. “Just six pages into the more than 900 pages of Trump Project 2025 it says, quote, ‘The Dobbs decision is just the beginning,’” Rep Ayanna Pressley warned at the hearing, which was only attended by Democratic members on the party’s Policy & Steering Committee, party leaders and the “Stop Project 2025 Task Force”. On Tuesday, several women who had been denied care until the last possible moment shared those same painful stories the Democrats have been highlighting for weeks. One was Gracie Ladd, who described having to leave her home state of Wisconsin to seek abortion care in Chicago because only one hospital in her entire home state would even consider the procedure necessary to keep her from delivering a baby who would have died in minutes if he was even born alive at all. Ladd said she was told by multiple doctors that her son Connor would have been born in agonizing pain. “I’m angry because in my state, there's no way that I wouldn't be labeled a murderer for making the compassionate choice for my son,” Ladd told the Democratic members. “I'm angry that I had to drive to Chicago to receive abortion care two days in a row with a medical team I had never met, a medical team I did not feel comfortable with ... angry that although I was privileged enough to be able to take time off of work find childcare for my living son and I could travel to Chicago two days in a row, not all women can. What are their options? What do they do in this situation? “But mostly I'm angry that the people who were not even in that ultrasound room with me on the day that I received the worst news of my life want to try to tell me what I can and cannot do when it comes to the medical choice for my body and my son.” Her harrowing tale is one of many that Democrats have centered in recent weeks, which have forced the Trump campaign into a clear defensive position. Donald Trump himself remains content to continue espousing his role in the overturning of Roe vs Wade, but has been forced to repeatedly fight back against efforts from his own party to expand the fight against abortion rights and stake out positions in favor of exceptions to state-level bans upon which he would previously have avoided commenting entirely. Trump has also sought to repair his image with women by embracing a plan to fund in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments through either government subsidies or through a private insurance mandate — both prospects that have been unappealing to conservatives in his party. But in general the ex-president has done little to repair the gender gap that is forming between him and Kamala Harris, and much of his response to criticism of conservative policies outlined in Project 2025 has been to deny his involvement or connections to the plan entirely. NBC’s poll — if accurate — shows Harris up more than 20 points among women nationally. A victory on those margins would be proof of a massive divide growing in American society among the gender lines, though one more pronounced among older and whiter communities.","summary":"Democrats stick the knife in as new poll indicates just 4% of registered voters see Project 2025 in positive light","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/project-2025-democrats-hearing-abortion-b2618400.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/24/23/GettyImages-2170792306.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Xc45yv1I-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:11:03","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":257294530,"title":"Iranian Leader Expresses Desire for Constructive Global Engagement to UN","text":"TANZANIA – Iran’s new president signaled to world leaders Tuesday that he wants to open a “constructive” chapter in his country’s international relations — but he made clear that everyone else, including the United States, needs to do their part. In his first speech at the U.N. General Assembly’s annual gathering of world leaders, Masoud Pezeshkian struck a somewhat more measured tone than his predecessors often have in recent years. “I aim to lay a strong foundation for my country’s entry into a new era, positioning it to play an effective and constructive role in the evolving global order,” said Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon who ran as a reformer. He took office in July. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, opened the door last month to renewed negotiations with the United States over his country’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, telling Iran’s civilian government there was “no harm” in engaging with its “enemy.” The United States, under former President Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 from Iran’s deal with several Western nations to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for getting sanctions lifted. It remains unclear just how much room Pezeshkian will have to maneuver, particularly as tensions remain high in the wider Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war and as the U.S. prepares for a presidential election in November. Pezeshkian, like Iranian presidents before him, had sharp words Tuesday for Israel. He accused the nation of “atrocities,” “colonialism,” “crimes against humanity” and “desperate barbarism” as it fights Hamas in Gaza and exchanges fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran backs both militant groups. Israel’s heavy bombardment of Lebanon in recent days “cannot go unanswered,” he said. He added that consequences would be borne by governments he described as thwarting efforts to end the “catastrophe” in the Middle East while calling themselves champions of human rights, an apparent reference to the United States and allied Western powers. Washington has been attempting, with Egypt and Qatar, to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal. But it has been elusive, and now the developments in Lebanon stand to complicate the efforts further. Directly addressing the American people, Pezeshkian listed a number of Iranian grievances — from sanctions to the 2020 killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Trump-era U.S. drone strike — and then urged “all states pursuing a counterproductive strategy towards Iran” to “learn from history.” “We have the opportunity to transcend these limitations and enter into a new era. This era will commence with the acknowledgement of Iran’s security concerns and cooperation on mutual challenges,” he said, appealing anew for sanctions relief. “I hope that this message from Iran is carefully heard today,” the new president concluded. There was no immediate response from the U.S. or Israel. ___ Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed. See more of AP’s coverage of the U.N.

Ryan Wesley Routh, who authorities say staked out Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him, has tonight been indicted on an attempted assassination charge, having initially been charged with two federal firearms offences. The upgraded charges are contained in a five-count indictment and show that the United States Justice Department believe he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said. Court records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith's team. The attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. They alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his September 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed \"assassination attempt on Donald Trump\" and offered $150,000 for anyone who could \"finish the job.\" That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest. The person opened the letter, took a photograph of the front page of the letter, addressed \"Dear World,\" and contacted law enforcement after the attempted assassination. Prosecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues in August, September and October at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present. The charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges in the indictment include assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and the two original firearms charges he faced last week. The potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump's Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man's face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing. The agent fired in the direction of Routh, who sped away and was stopped by law enforcement in a neighbouring county. Routh did not fire any rounds and did not have Trump in his line of sight, officials have said, but he left behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope and a plastic bag containing food. The arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart a potential attack in Florida. The initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. In the US it is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offences later as the investigation develops. The FBI had said at the outset that it was investigating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt, but the absence of an immediate charge to that effect opened the door for Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis to announce his own state-level investigation that he said could produce more serious charges. Trump, seeking to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the investigation and the Justice Department more broadly, complained Monday - before the attempted assassination charge was brought - that federal prosecutors were \"mishandling and downplaying\" the case by bringing charges that were a \"slap on the wrist.\" Asked at an unrelated press conference about Trump's criticism Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department \"would spare no resources to ensure accountability\" in the case.\"All of our top priority should be ensuring that accountability occurs in this case and that those who run for office and their families are safe and protected,\" Garland said. The Justice Department also said Monday that authorities who searched Routh's car found six mobile phones, including one that showed a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico. A notebook found in his car was filled with criticism of the Russian and Chinese governments and notes about how to join the war on behalf of Ukraine. In addition, prosecutors have cited a book authored by Routh last year in which he lambasted Trump's approach to foreign policy, including in Ukraine. In the book, he wrote that Iran was \"free to assassinate Trump\" for having left the nuclear deal.","summary":"This is a breaking news story","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/breaking-donald-trump-gunman-ryan-33745246","image":"https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article33718998.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_Photo-of-Suspected-Trump-Shooter-West-Palm-Beach-Florida-16-Sep-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:06:06","author":"Joseph Wilkes","authors":["Joseph Wilkes"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.435},{"id":257294622,"title":"Prosecutors Charge Suspected Trump Gunman With Attempted Assassination","text":"Prosecutors on Tuesday charged a man suspected of trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate.

Meanwhile, cellphone records for two of Routh’s phones found in the vehicle he was using showed that between Aug. 18 and Sept. 15, his phone accessed cell towers near Trump’s golf course and Mar-a-Lago. Court documents that were filed in the case showed that a witness told law enforcement that Routh had dropped off a box to the witness, which included a note from Routh stating, “This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed you.” Routh was charged with felony crimes in 2002 for possession of a weapon of mass destruction. If convicted, Routh could face life imprisonment, the DOJ said. In the incident earlier this month, a U.S. Secret Service agent patrolling the golf course ahead of Trump opened fire after discovering the gun poking through the fence, causing Routh to flee, prosecutors said.

The two presidential hopefuls have set their town halls for early October.

The in-person audiences for both televised town halls will largely be comprised of undecided Hispanic voters who will have the opportunity to ask the candidates questions. “Noticias Univision serves as a two-way bridge: we bring every voice to our community while conveying the concerns of Latinos to those in power,” Daniel Coronell, president of Noticias Univision, said on Tuesday. “There are more than 36 million Hispanics eligible to vote in the U.S., making them the largest minority in the country, with the power to influence the outcome of the race for the White House and the future of the nation.” Anchor Enrique Acevedo will moderate both town halls. They’ll both air with Spanish-language translation on Univision and stream on ViX’s Noticias 24/7 channel and will also be available in English on Noticias Univision’s YouTube channel. Plus, this might be the last time voters get anything close to resembling a real debate before Election Night. Although Harris agreed to a second debate hosted by CNN that would take place Oct. 23, Trump has continued to refuse the invitation. “Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump, and she has accepted CNN’s invitation to a debate,” Harris’ spokesperson Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a previous statement. “Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules and ratings.” Trump’s stance on not appearing for a second debate with Harris hasn’t changed since it was unanimously agreed — by every news outlet but Trump himself — that he lost the first one. He claimed at a North Carolina rally on Saturday that Harris “wants to do a debate right before the election with CNN because she’s losing badly.”","summary":"Both candidates’ events will be hosted by TelevisaUnivision just days apart\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Set Competing TV Town Halls for October appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/kamala-harris-donald-trump-town-halls-televisa-univision/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala-Harris-and-Donald-Trump.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:05:51","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.087},{"id":257294602,"title":"Ryan Routh charged with attempted assassination of Trump","text":"A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him has been indicted on charges that he attempted to assassinate a major presidential candidate.

Russia must be forced into peace","text":"UNITED NATIONS >> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that the war between Russia and Ukraine cannot be calmed by talks alone, but that Russia must be forced into peace. Zelensky has sought the support of Western leaders for what he calls a “victory plan” to end the war that began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022. Zelensky said the war would end one day but not because “someone got tired of the war” or through a trade with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a reference to proposals that Ukraine cede some territory seized by Russia to settle the conflict. “This war can’t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,” Zelensky said, thanking nations who have provided Ukraine support. “Putin has broken so many international norms and rules that he won’t stop on his own, Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed, forcing Russia into peace, as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter,” Zelensky said. Ukraine faces an uncertain future. A victory by former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 U.S. election could prompt a reset of Washington’s policy on Ukraine, which relies heavily on U.S. military and financial support. Opinion polls show a tight race. Zelensky has said that if his plan is backed by the West, it will have a broad impact on Moscow, including a psychological one that could help compel Putin to end the war diplomatically. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia spoke up at the meeting to reject the council hosting Zelensky. “Western countries could not refrain from poisoning the atmosphere once again, trying to fill the air time with the hackneyed Ukrainian issue,” Nebenzia said of the meeting. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 15-member council that Russia’s war in Ukraine was a clear violation of the founding U.N. Charter. “I strongly condemn all attacks on civilians and civilian facilities — wherever they occur and whoever is responsible. They all must stop immediately,” he said. “And I remain deeply concerned about the safety, humanitarian needs and basic human rights of people residing in occupied areas.”","summary":"UNITED NATIONS >> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that the war between Russia and Ukraine cannot be calmed by talks alone, but that Russia must be forced into peace.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/24/breaking-news/ukraines-zelensky-tells-u-n-russia-must-be-forced-into-peace/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-24T221738Z_809946878_RC2A7AA5IRRY_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-UN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:03:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":257294140,"title":"Black-pilled right sees the real threats to Trump’s campaign","text":"A provocative commentary by Cortney Weil appearing at Blaze Media last week warned against “black-pilling.” Weil associated this activity with a misguided right whose members are underestimating Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected.

Although Weil warns against pessimism, she doesn’t quite prove that it’s misplaced. She is just upset to hear defeatist attitudes coming from the ranks, even if they’re justified. Moreover, Weil indiscriminately throws together two groups that are spreading this gloom, both of which she identifies with the right. As someone who most emphatically favors the right, I can’t figure out how I’m in the same camp as National Review’s Jim Geraghty. Like others at his magazine, Geraghty earns his bread by attacking Trump while fronting for the now displaced Republican establishment. It is naïve to believe we are not living through a government-driven cultural revolution, one that the media, the culture industry, and American schools are pushing nonstop. Also, unlike Isaac Schorr, who is published in the moderately conservative New York Post, I have not condemned Trump for naming JD Vance as his running mate. I’m delighted that the former president made that choice. In fact, I would be happy to vote for Vance for any office. Weil unfortunately failed to make an important distinction. The honest right expresses pessimism, while those who profit from their association with the old Republican establishment ridicule Trump. These two groups do not overlap, and they certainly don't question Trump's chances of re-election for the same reasons. Although a distributor of black pills, I am nonetheless rooting for Trump and Vance. I even placed a highly visible sign for them on my front lawn and sent several contributions to their campaign. I would be amazed if they won, for all the reasons other pessimistic right-wingers have highlighted. I believe Democrats cheat, which is why they introduce less secure forms of voting and try to give the vote to illegal aliens they deliberately bring into this country to boost their party’s numbers. The left also controls most vital institutions in the United States, especially government administration, the mass media, and educational institutions. Considering the insanely radical positions of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, which they held until only recently, this election shouldn’t even be close. I’m struck by the absence of a mass outcry that Harris has deliberately avoided interviews and policy questions. In a normal society, I would also expect to find very widespread revulsion for the elementary school gibberish in which she speaks. But this is not the case. Kamala’s popularity has been growing, or is at least staying the same, no matter how hard she runs away from questions and no matter how frenetically the media shields her. Further, the inflation of abortion rights into a leading electoral issue should cause one to doubt the Fox News bromide that American voters are reasonable. Since the Dobbs decision that supposedly stripped women of their “reproductive rights,” more abortions have been performed in America than before. That Kamala Harris is now pinning her race on abortion as her “key issue” and is achieving success by doing so should lead us to question the rationality of about half the American electorate. The fact that the Democratic candidates are tied and possibly ahead in a race against a former president who presided over an excellent economy, well-protected borders, and safe streets indicates how powerful the ubiquitous left has become. This is not a temporary blip in our political and cultural situation. It reflects long-established trends in our national life which go back at least as far as the 1960s. It is naïve to believe we are not living through a government-driven cultural revolution, one that the media, the culture industry, and American schools are pushing nonstop. This transformation has influenced our politics profoundly, which makes me hesitate to designate Trump and Vance as the likely victors in the presidential election. Even if “our guys” prevail and their party does better than expected in congressional races, the battle against an all-pervasive left remains. That left may even accelerate the warfare launched during Trump’s first term. Why would anyone think the left’s attempt to wear down its opposition would stop simply because the Republicans won some elections? Trump’s victory would likely lead to well-planned riots and the further weaponization of the administrative state. Meanwhile, the media would be openly calling for Trump’s removal from office by any means. And oh yes, our adversaries would have ample financial resources to achieve their ends thanks to America’s woke capitalist class. Although the other side may be obnoxious, let’s not underestimate their will to gain power nor their resourcefulness in going after what they want. If pointing that out means serving black pills, then I’ll gladly plead guilty.","summary":"A provocative commentary by Cortney Weil appearing at Blaze Media last week warned against “black-pilling.” Weil associated this activity with a misguided right whose members are underestimating Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected.

Many public institutions have been forced to evacuate and vital local resources were diverted to investigate the barrage of threats to the community.” The Haitian Bridge Alliance are seeking arrest warrants for the following charges: Disrupting public service — by causing widespread bomb and other threats that resulted in massive disruptions to the public services in Springfield, Ohio; Making false alarms — by knowingly causing alarm in the Springfield community by continuing to repeat lies that state and local officials have said were false; Committing telecommunications harassment — by spreading claims they know to be false during the presidential debate, campaign rallies, nationally televised interviews and social media; Committing aggravated menacing in violation — by knowingly making intimidating statements with the intent to abuse, threaten or harass the recipients, including Trump’s threat to deport immigrants who are here legally to Venezuela, a land they have never known; Committing aggravated menacing — by knowingly causing others to falsely believe that members of Springfield’s Haitian community would cause serious physical harm to the person or property of others in Springfield; and Violating the prohibition against complicity — by conspiring with one another and spreading vicious lies that caused innocent parties to be parties to their various crimes. “Like those who falsely shout ‘fire!’ in a crowded theater, Trump and Vance do not color within the lines of the First Amendment,” the document continued. “They commit criminal acts.” The charges filed to the Clark County Municipal Court who are now required to have a hearing on the matter before the affidavit can be dismissed. Representatives for the Trump-Vance presidential campaign did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Trump and Vance have jointly popularized conspiracy theories over the last month that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are kidnapping and eating their neighbors’ pets. “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats,” Trump said during his Sept. 10 debate with Kamala Harris. Such claims have been debunked by local Springfield officials, but Vance and Trump continued to parrot the accusations on television and at campaign events. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Vance not only continued the narrative but took credit for popularizing the story: “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes.”","summary":"\"Trump and Vance do not color within the lines of the First Amendment,\" the filing states\n\n\nThe post Haitian Nonprofit Criminally Charges Trump and Vance, Citing ‘Unrelenting Lies’ About Springfield That Led to 33 Bomb Threats appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-vance-criminal-charges-haitian-nonprofit-springfield-harassment/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-15T115450.388.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 22:59:39","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":257295888,"title":"Man who staked out Trump at Florida golf course charged with attempting an assassination","text":"WASHINGTON - A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him was indicted Tuesday on an attempted assassination charge. The information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App Ryan Wesley Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses. The upgraded charges contained in a five-count indictment reflect the Justice Department's assessment that he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said. Court records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith's team. The attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. They alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his Sept. 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed “assassination attempt on Donald Trump” and offered $150,000 for anyone who could “finish the job.” That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest. The person opened the letter, took a photograph of the front page of the letter, addressed “Dear World,” and contacted law enforcement after the attempted assassination. Prosecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues in August, September and October at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present. Sign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips The charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges in the indictment include assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and the two original firearms charges he faced last week. The potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump’s Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man's face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing. The agent fired in the direction of Routh, who sped away and was stopped by law enforcement in a neighboring county. In this image released by the Martin County, Fla., Sheriff’s Office, law enforcement officers arrest Ryan Routh, the man suspected in the apparent assassination attempt of Donald Trump, Sunday, Sept. 15, 2024. (Martin County Sheriff’s Office via AP) Routh did not fire any rounds and did not have Trump in his line of sight, officials have said, but he left behind a digital camera, a backpack, a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope and a plastic bag containing food. The arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart a potential attack in Florida. The initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. It is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offenses later as the investigation develops. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective The FBI had said at the outset that it was investigating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt, but the absence of an immediate charge to that effect opened the door for Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to announce his own state-level investigation that he said could produce more serious charges. Trump, seeking to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the investigation and the Justice Department more broadly, complained Monday — before the attempted assassination charge was brought — that federal prosecutors were “mishandling and downplaying” the case by bringing charges that were a “slap on the wrist.” Asked at an unrelated press conference about Trump’s criticism Monday, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department “would spare no resources to ensure accountability” in the case. “All of our top priority should be ensuring that accountability occurs in this case and that those who run for office and their families are safe and protected,” Garland said. The Justice Department also said Monday that authorities who searched Routh's car found six cellphones, including one that showed a Google search of how to travel from Palm Beach County to Mexico. A notebook found in his car was filled with criticism of the Russian and Chinese governments and notes about how to join the war on behalf of Ukraine. In addition, prosecutors have cited a book authored by Routh last year in which he lambasted Trump’s approach to foreign policy, including in Ukraine. In the book, he wrote that Iran was “free to assassinate Trump” for having left the nuclear deal.

In one of multiple last-ditch efforts to shore up a Trump victory, leaders in the national GOP attempted to change the way that Nebraska allocates its Electoral College votes. Currently, the state is a rare example of a “hybrid” system, where different parts of the state can award electoral votes to a candidate based on how locals vote. The state reliably votes Republican, but the Omaha area represents a “blue dot” that sometimes gives an electoral vote to Democrats—a vote that may prove decisive for Kamala Harris in a close race. Trump’s allies tried to foreclose this option. In Nebraska last week, Senator Lindsey Graham spoke with lawmakers and advocated changing the process so the state would give all of its electoral votes to a single candidate—most likely Trump, considering the makeup of the state. Yesterday, Republican State Senator Mike McDonnell, on whom the future of the change hinged, announced that he would not support the measure: “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” he said in a statement. McDonnell’s decision, which he suggested was final, effectively halts the initiative. Had it not been for this lawmaker breaking with the wishes of fellow Republicans both in and out of state, Trump and his allies could have succeeded in rolling out a substantive change at this late point in the race. Such Republican machinations in this cycle are not isolated to Nebraska—and Trump’s allies are finding more traction altering election rules in other states. The “sheer volume of litigation we’re seeing just two months before Election Day … is far from the norm,” Megan Bellamy, the vice president of law and policy for Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan voting organization, told me via email, citing examples of Republican-led litigation related to voting lists in Arizona and North Carolina and mail ballots in Pennsylvania (all swing states). Last Friday, a controversial rule was passed in Georgia—the state in which Trump is facing an indictment for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election—that would require election workers to hand-count ballots after the polls close, a process usually reserved for a recount. As my colleague Elaine Godfrey explained last week, Donald Trump sees the “new far-right majority” on Georgia’s state board as an extension of his own campaign, referring to them as his “pitbulls” for victory. States generally have the authority to administer federal elections as they wish, and officials tinkering with state election law for a variety of reasons is nothing new. In the months leading up to the 2020 election, many states made quick-turn changes to voting rules in an attempt to adapt to pandemic restrictions. The current election season has seen a series of changes from both parties: States whose legislatures are led by Democrats have, by and large, altered rules to make registering and voting easier, and those led by Republicans in various states have added restrictions, including ID laws. Some of the GOP’s latest attempts to change rules in swing states may face legal action. But even for those lawmakers whose efforts prove legal, the reasons not to make last-minute changes to the voting process are both obvious and persuasive: Such moves can make a political party look cynical, confuse voters, and undermine trust. Even rules intended to make the process of voting easier can create uncertainty for voters unfamiliar with the new steps, Jacob Neiheisel, a political-science professor at the University at Buffalo, told me. But “winning” has become more important for Trump’s “core constituency than any kind of appearance of fairness,” Neiheisel said. And much of Trump’s base is already primed to distrust elections: Polling from 2023 showed that nearly 70 percent of surveyed Republicans believed that Joe Biden’s 2020 win was fraudulent. If there’s a chance that changing the rules leads to victory, then the way MAGA Republicans see it, these gambits are worthwhile, Neiheisel suggested. Last-minute changes could also introduce errors or confusion that give pretext to Republicans already setting the stage to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the race if it doesn’t go their way. The new hand-counting policy in Georgia, for example, is “absolutely inducing more potential failure points,” Neiheisel told me. If, say, overtired election workers make minor errors in their hand-counts on Election Night, this could give ammunition to those who seek to deny the results of the election (even if such errors had no bearing on the final outcome). Some election workers and local politicians have attempted to serve as a guardrail against late-stage alterations to the law. But their efforts are not always enough. Trump and his motivated allies are trying to squeeze in changes even as, for many Americans, the election has already begun. Voters abroad and in the military were sent ballots last week, and early in-person voting started in certain states this month. The weeks ahead are a crucial time for candidates to make their most persuasive appeals to voters—but also, it seems, for those determined to bend the outcome to their will.

While attending Bankman-Fried’s trial in Manhattan federal court last fall, I watched parts of Ellison’s testimony, which she delivered as part of a plea deal. As I wrote then in The Daily, on the stand, Ellison calmly described harebrained schemes, shoddy recordkeeping, and fraught power dynamics as typical parts of the FTX workplace. The judge, sentencing her today for her role in the $8 billion fraud, reportedly said that, although he recognized that she was remorseful and that Bankman-Fried—himself at the start of a 25-year prison sentence—was her “kryptonite,” he could not give her a “‘get out of jail free’ card.” — Lora Isabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.

Ryan Wesley Routh, aged 58, faced a court hearing where he was denied bail. Prosecutors pointed to a letter promising $150,000 to “complete the job” as grounds for his continued detention until trial. Originally accused of two federal firearms violations, Routh now confronts more serious charges as authorities believe he conspired to assassinate Trump. Allegedly, Routh was caught aiming a rifle through the bushes surrounding Trump’s golf course in West Palm Beach while the former president was playing there. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention. On September 15, 2024, the former president was taking part in a round at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, when shots were heard. It came after agents spotted someone they suspected of aiming the weapon from nearby bushes. The would-be assassin, who managed to get within 400-500 yards of Trump, attempted to flee the scene in an SUV but was caught by officials and taken into custody.

No shots were fired at the former president, but the Secret Service agent fired at the suspect, who fled and was later arrested. Months ago, according to a court filing, Routh had left a handwritten letter with a man that said: \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you.

The gangs are turning neighborhoods into hellholes. Blame insane “sanctuary” laws. The word “sanctuary” sounds charitable, but don’t be fooled. It doesn’t mean welcoming the downtrodden, but actually bars police from sharing arrest information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement so that the agency can take custody of illegal immigrants arrested for violent crimes and deport them. Sanctuary laws, in effect, shield criminals who don’t belong in the United States from removal. Eleven states and some 600 towns and cities, mostly controlled by Democrats, have them. Because of these laws, migrant lawbreakers go through a revolving-door justice system — and end up back on the streets to strike again. Americans have a choice: On Saturday, presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to work with Congress to “end all sanctuary cities . . . across our country.” Or we can choose Vice President Kamala Harris — who has apparently taken a vow of silence on questions of policy. But her record shows that San Franciscans died because of her stance on migrant crime when she presided as the city’s top prosecutor. In 2008 Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, murdered a man and his two sons. Prior to the triple murder, Ramos had a history of juvenile arrests for assault and attempted robbery. Had San Francisco police cooperated with federal immigration authorities, Ramos might have been deported, instead of free to kill. Similarly Rony Aguilera, who came to the US illegally from Honduras, murdered Ivan Miranda in 2008. Aguilera had had several earlier run-ins with police, but he remained in San Francisco, ready to unleash violence. The media have painted a heroic picture of Harris’ career in law enforcement, making claims that she “cracked down on violent offenders” as San Francisco’s district attorney and as California’s attorney general. But the coverage conveniently omits any mention of Ramos, Aguilera and their victims. As a US senator, Harris in 2017 voted against a bill that would have increased penalties for criminals who illegally enter after being deported and commit more crimes. The bill went down to defeat. Two years later, when Harris launched her first campaign for president, she declared that local law enforcement “should not act as federal immigration agents” in response to an American Civil Liberties Union candidates’ questionnaire. As attorney general, she told the ACLU, she had instructed California law-enforcement agencies that “they did not have to comply with ICE detainers” — that is, she encouraged them to ignore federal requests to hold migrant suspects for deportation. These same policies are now causing migrant crime to explode in multiple jurisdictions. Six Colorado counties being menaced by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua are suing to overturn state sanctuary laws that prevent local police from cooperating with ICE to send gang members packing. New York’s sanctuary laws have enabled the same gang to set up headquarters in migrant shelters across the five boroughs and terrorize the public without fear of deportation. Crime victims can thank their own woke politicians. Mayor Adams has called for amending the city’s sanctuary laws — but the far-left City Council isn’t budging. Last week, House Republicans offered a bill to withhold federal aid for migrants from sanctuary jurisdictions. Outrageously, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) opposed it, claiming it would “scapegoat immigrants.” That’s partisan blather: Police estimate that as many as 75% of those arrested for assault and robbery in Midtown Manhattan — Nadler’s district — are recently arrived migrants. On Saturday, Trump pledged to “hunt down and capture every single gang member . . . that is being illegally harbored.” A tall order, but the place to start is allowing local police to cooperate with ICE. That means sanctuary laws must be overturned nationwide. Trump tried to make that happen by executive order in 2017, when he cut federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions. But the order was hit with a slew of legal challenges from blue-state politicians — and courts including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only Congress, not the president, can impose terms on how federal money is spent. If Trump wins in November, he plans to maneuver around those legal roadblocks by asking Congress to pass a law like the one Nadler is railing against. The upcoming elections — for president and for the House and Senate — will determine whether that strategy can succeed. One thing is certain: If Kamala wins, so do the gangs. As Border Czar she let them in, and as president she’d shield them from deportation. Under a Harris presidency, plan to bolt your doors and keep up your guard as you walk around your neighborhood — until it’s no longer walkable at all.

Suspect Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was denied bail at a court hearing on Monday - hours after prosecutors cited a letter offering $150,000 to \"finish the job\" as evidence of why he should be kept locked up pending trial. Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses but the upgraded charges reflect the Justice Department's assessment that he plotted to kill Trump.

Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention. On September 15, 2024, the former president was taking part in a round at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, when shots were heard. It came after agents spotted someone they suspected of aiming the weapon from nearby bushes.

The only problem – they were visuals from the country of Georgia. The Telegraph first reported that the campaign confused the Georgias and used a stock image that depicted the views in Upper Svanetic, in the Caucasus mountain range of northwestern Georgia – the one in Europe. ‘ATTENTION Georgia: I am humbly asking you to stop what you’re doing and check your voter registration status,’ a sponsored Trump post read. ‘Only a handful of votes will decide this election. We can stop inflation, secure our borders, lower taxes, and make America Great Again!’ The ad then said ‘register to vote for Trump’ over a picturesque mountain scene. While the state of Georgia includes portions of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the terrain has a different look. The ad snafu came as Trump returned to Georgia Tuesday, making an economics-themed address in downtown Savannah, a more Democratic-leaning part of the state. The former president was still able to fill the Johnny Mercer Theatre Civic Center with his MAGA faithful. During his 82-minute address, Trump boasted that his economic plan involved stealing jobs from other countries. ‘Under my leadership, we are going to take other countries’ jobs,’ Trump said. ‘Your only worry will be which job to take,’ he promised his supporters to loud cheers. Trump said he would entice companies to produce products in the U.S. by threatening them with tariffs if they refused. ‘I will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burden and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet,’ he said. ‘But only if you make your product here in America.’ The Harris campaign had rolled out billionaire Mark Cuban in the hours ahead of Trump’s economic speech who told reporters over Zoom that the Republican ‘says things off the top of his head that tend to often be ridiculous, if not insane.’ Cuban then proceeded to explain why several of Trump’s proposed economic policies wouldn’t work. At his Savannah stop, Trump talked about how he wanted German car companies to become American companies – but that talk eventually segued to his detest of electric cars – though he carved out a compliment for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who endorsed him. ‘Elon Musk is great. He makes an excellent car. And he endorsed me at a level you wouldn’t believe,’ Trump said. From there, the ex-president warned about the cars of the future – hydrogen-powered vehicles. ‘The new thing – and I’m sure Elon will get it if it’s any good – but it’s got one little problem: it explodes,’ Trump said. ‘Hydrogen. ‘They say the new thing is hydrogen cars. But they’re having a problem. If it explodes you end up about seven blocks away and you’re dead.’ Trump talked about how he wouldn’t allow the Japanese company Nippon to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which is currently under review by a U.S. national security panel. And then from there, he spoke a bit about the state of the 2024 race. Trump boasted that he was holding more events than Harris – and that he won the Philadelphia debate against Harris earlier this month. ‘We’re definitely outworking the opposition,’ the 78-year-old former president said. ‘She was so bad,’ he added of Harris’ debate performance, despite most polls showing that she was the clear winner. ‘We absolutely destroyed her,’ Trump claimed. ‘Throughout his remarks, he pushed that Harris wasn’t quite right. ‘We talk about cognitive problems. She’s got bigger cognitive problems than he does,’ he said at one point. ‘If you saw her with Oprah the other day, or if you saw some of these interviews, there’s something going on up there. We just had four years of that. We can’t have another four years. Not going to happen,’ Trump said at another. The ex-president also explained how Winfrey, who hosted a Hollywood-filled special for Harris in Michigan last week and spoke before the Democratic National Convention, ‘loved’ him before he entered politics. Trump told supporters how Winfrey called his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago ‘the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen’ and how the longtime talk show host convinced the real estate developer to hold a funeral at the property for their friend, the late CBS CEO Roger King in 2007. ‘She loved the key lime pie,’ Trump said of Winfrey’s time spent at Mar-a-Lago. The ex-president also falsely claimed that Harris made up that she worked at a McDonald’s as a student. ‘She lied about McDonald’s. She said, “I was a worker at McDonald’s and I stood over the French fries,”‘ Trump said. ‘I’m going to a McDonald’s over the next two weeks and I’m going to stand over the French fries because I’m going to see what her job really wasn’t like.’ ‘She never worked there, it was a lie,’ he told the crowd. He spent a lengthy amount of time recalling the two attempts on his life. Trump credited God for being responsible for saving him in Butler, Pennsylvania and said of West Palm Beach, ‘I’m telling you God was watching there too.’ The ex-president also heralded the immigration chart he was looking at in Butler when shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks took his shot. ‘I sleep with that chart every night. I kiss it. I love it,’ he said. The audience cheered as the chart was displayed.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign depicted Georgia&#8217;s beautiful mountain ranges in a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Advertising mistake: Trump campaign mistakes crucial swing state for a nation first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/advertising-mistake-trump-campaign-mistakes-crucial-swing-state-for-a-nation/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Trump-campaign-confuses-key-swing-state-for.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 22:39:16","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.15},{"id":257292848,"title":"Ryan Wesley Routh faces new charge of attempted assassination of Trump after initial gun rap: report","text":"Ryan Wesley Routh was charged by prosecutors on Tuesday with attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate after the alleged gunman stalked out former president Donald Trump’s Florida golf course earlier this month, according to a report.

More than $369 billion in climate and clean energy and not a single Republican voted for it.” But not all of his remarks were focused on the climate. Biden took multiple shots at former President Donald Trump, contending that “there was no real plan in place to do anything about [the climate]. As the government, we were doing nothing” when Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris came into office. Biden took another dig at Trump later. “All this historic climate change is in stark contrast to my predecessor,” Biden said. “He says he’d repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. He’d let our factories shut down. He moved the world backwards. His denial of climate change condemns our future generations to a more dangerous world.” Billionaire and former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg introduced Biden. “I think it’s fair to say no president has done more to push our country forward on climate change, starting on Joe’s first day in office when he brought the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement,” Bloomberg said. “He has wisely put fighting climate change at the center of his work, strengthening the economy, showing how the two go hand in hand.” Bloomberg was in turn introduced by actress Jane Fonda, who praised him for taking on the coal industry and “f***ing fossil gas.” “Mike’s superpower is bringing people together from different sectors and different fields to solve some of the world’s biggest problems,” Fonda said. During his presidency, Biden said he’d flown over wildfires that in total covered more land than the state of Maryland and toured communities hit by tornadoes and floods that cost billions of dollars in damage. He emphasized that he doesn’t see a conflict between boosting the economy and combatting climate change, saying that “when I think climate, I think jobs … good union paying jobs.” The Inflation Reduction Act had created more than 330,000 clean energy jobs, Biden claimed. The bill includes tax credits for solar panels and energy-efficient appliances, and Biden said private companies have invested nearly $1 trillion in clean energy projects since he took office. “This year, we’ll add more new electric capacity than we have in two decades, and 96% of that will be clean energy,” Biden said. “We’ve quadrupled the development of electric vehicles since I took office. We’re deploying a fleet of clean school buses that will not pollute the air. Our postal service is going fully electric.” Trump has sharply criticized Biden’s electric vehicle push on the campaign trail, saying the initiative will put autoworkers out of jobs in order to make cars that blue-collar workers cannot afford. Republicans have also criticized the Biden administration’s electric school buses. A House committee report found that electric school buses cost nearly four times as much as diesel-powered ones and have a failure rate of up to 20%. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Despite the objections, Biden said he was proud of his administration’s work on clean energy and said he sees more progress ahead. “I’ve been doing this a long time, 51 years in elective office,” Biden said. “I give my word as a Biden, I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future. And Michael [Bloomberg], let me go back to you. Your initiatives, your commitment, your vision, your dedication have literally changed the world.

Warren Jones Crazybull was indicted on Aug. 20 on one count of threats against a former president. He pleaded not guilty on Aug. 22. Federal court documents allege that on July 31, Crazybull called Mar-A-Lago, a resort in Palm Beach, Florida, owned by Trump, and threatened to kill the former president. Crazybull reportedly called the resort at least nine times and, during one of the calls, allegedly said, “Find Trump. … I am coming down to Bedminster tomorrow. I am going to down him personally and kill him.” The Mar-A-Lago employee who answered the call recorded the alleged threats using a personal cell phone and sent it to the United States Secret Service. Using the caller ID function, investigators identified the man as Crazybull. Secret Service learned he was also known as Warren Jones and went by multiple aliases, including “Warren Von Crazybull-Jones,” “Warren V Jones,” “Warren Crazybull Jones,” and “Warren Von Jones.” Investigators said they found his personal Facebook under the name “Tracy Jones” and discovered posts that also threatened Trump. Court documents say Crazybull reportedly posted a “self-produced narrative that contains threats to Mr. Trump.” Another post allegedly stated, “I start driving to the home of this multi person rapist PIG TRUMP to take him down single combat.” Crazybull also appeared to mention former President John. F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in November 1963. “I’m leaving Sandpoint at 12:00 a.m #Trump2024. I’m coming for you JOHN JOHN KENNEDY JR, DONALD J TRUMP… and take you Down to the fu***** GROUND.” Law enforcement tracked Crazybull’s phone and determined he was in Idaho at the time the threats were posted online. On Aug. 1, he traveled to Missoula, Montana, where he was detained by the U.S. Marshals Service. While speaking to law enforcement, Crazybull allegedly said he was chief of the Rosebud tribe, and that he “blames former Presidents Trump and John F. Kennedy for broken treaties that resulted in the loss of his land.” Crazybull claimed he had posted the threats online in order to get law enforcement’s attention, and repeatedly stated he “would not let Trump become president again.” He then said he would not attempt to kill Trump. Federal court documents say investigators found Crazybull’s thought processes to be “racing and confused” and described his demeanor as “paranoid.” Crazybull is being held in the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office without a bond and is scheduled for a jury trial on Oct. 28. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Though Crazybull has been charged with these crimes, it does not necessarily mean he committed them. Everyone is presumed innocent until they are proven guilty.

The polling found that more Americans identified as Republicans as opposed to Democrats, and the margin had swung significantly to the Republican side since the last presidential election. 'If we have a polling shift like we've seen in prior years from now until the final result, Donald Trump would actually win.' More Americans had described themselves as Democrats over Republicans since 2004, but the most recent poll shows that 48% say they are Republicans while only 45% say they are Democrats. This represents a large swing from 2020 when President Joe Biden won the presidency and 48% of respondents said they were Democrats as opposed to the 43% who said they were Republicans. That means a total net swing of eight percentage points over just the last four years in favor of Republicans. And that is especially bad for Democrats because Biden won by a very slim margin in the electoral college despite having a 5% positive net margin in partisan affiliation. \"Party affiliation and voting are strongly predictive of individuals’ vote choices, with the vast majority of identifiers and leaners voting for the candidate of their preferred party,\" explained Jeffrey Jones the senior editor for Gallup. \"In years when the advantage was narrower — 2004 and 2016, for example — Republicans won in the electoral college if not also the popular vote,\" he added. The findings also corroborate cautionary messages from pollsters like CNN's Harry Enten who say that Democrats need a large margin in polling to overcome the shift towards former President Donald Trump in the last two elections. \"The bottom line is this,\" said Enten. \"If you're a Kamala Harris fan and you wanna rip open the champagne bottle, pop that cork, do not do it. Donald Trump is very much in this race. If we have a polling shift like we've seen in prior years from now until the final result, Donald Trump would actually win.\" Like Blaze News?
