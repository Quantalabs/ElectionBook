Following the sale, Evolve would shift to an asset-light model focused on loan origination and digital services.\n\nFor Dolla Financial, the acquisition would expand its microcredit footprint and strengthen its lending platform.\n\n“We believe it will have a positive impact on our loan book by improving balance, scale, and growth potential,” said Dolla Financial Group Chief Executive Kenroy Kerr.\n\nSVL will retain a 15 per cent equity stake in Dolla Financial, preserving exposure to the portfolio’s future performance.\n\n“This transaction reflects disciplined capital allocation and a clear focus on shareholder value,” said Gary Peart, executive chairman of Supreme Ventures. “We are strengthening the group’s financial position while preserving long-term upside.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Finance sale Supreme Ventures \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n St Ann police apprehend robbery suspect \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — A man suspected of involvement in a robbery in the St Ann Police Division was apprehended on Tuesday during an intelligence-led op... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fitz-Henley pays tribute to late journalist Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — State Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, Senator Abka Fitz-Henley, has paid tribute to late journalist Donald Oliver.

He was 40 years old.\n\nIn a statement, Senator Fitz-Henley said he was “shocked and saddened at news of the passing of Donald Oliver,” praising Oliver’s character and approach to journalism.\n\n“Donald was an outstanding journalist and a decent human being whose approach to his work reflected that he did not operate with ill-intent, stunned as a matter of fact,” he said.\n\nThe state minister highlighted Oliver’s skill as a communicator, noting that his journalism was “competent” and that his commentary “exhilarated audiences.” He added that Oliver was particularly effective in using his voice to bring events to life for listeners and viewers.\n\n“He was excellent at using his voice, including adjusting the cadence and modulation, to convey to audiences exactly what was happening at an event he was covering, whether sports or otherwise,” Fitz-Henley said, while emphasising that Oliver was not limited to sports journalism but was “a versatile professional.”\n\nFitz-Henley also recalled Oliver’s recent work covering national issues, noting that just weeks ago, Oliver travelled to St Elizabeth to report on the impact of Hurricane Melissa.\n\n“Only a few weeks ago, Donald interviewed MP Floyd Green and I about the impact of Hurricane Melissa in St Elizabeth after he journeyed to the parish to bring attention to the plight of those affected,” he said.\n\nAccording to the senator, Oliver was also known for his supportive attitude toward colleagues, free of professional jealousy.\n\n“Donald never exhibited the scourge of professional jealousy or badmind which sometimes exist in vocations, including media,” Fitz-Henley said. “He was always willing to offer a positive and useful word of advise to colleagues in a bid to see them better their craft.”\n\nFitz-Henley extended condolences to Oliver’s family, friends and colleagues, describing him as “a Jamaican of substance who was excellent at his craft.”\n\n“An innings well-played, my friend,” he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Abka Fitz-Henley death Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n CASE rape suspect killed in police operation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n PORTLAND, Jamaica — A man who was being sought by police in connection with a reported sexual assault at the College of Agriculture, Science and Educa... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Observer Online’s top social media personalities of 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n In 2025, social media continued to shape conversations across Jamaica, launch trends and transform ordinary people into digital powerhouses.

He was reportedly instructed to drop the weapon but refused and advanced toward the cops in what was described as a chopping position. The police then discharged their firearms, hitting Humes, said McCarthy.\n\nHe was transported to the Port Antonio Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe police further stated that Humes had been linked to other reported rape incidents at the CASE campus, dating back to 2021 and 2022, which were before the courts. However, in those matters, one complainant migrated overseas, while another reportedly became disillusioned as the case progressed, after psychiatric issues involving the suspect were raised and a court-ordered evaluation was conducted.\n\nThe Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) has launched an investigation into the fatal shooting of Humes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: death Police operation Rape suspect \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Observer Online’s top social media personalities of 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n In 2025, social media continued to shape conversations across Jamaica, launch trends and transform ordinary people into digital powerhouses.

From comedy to lifestyle content, these creators didn’t just rack up views, they connected with audiences in authentic ways that helped define the online culture of the year.\n\nHere is Observer Online’s top Jamaican social media influencers of 2025.\n\nKarlando “Bad Sekki” Bailey\n\nKarlando “Bad Sekki” Bailey (Photo via Instagram)\n\nKarlando Bailey, better known as Bad Sekki, is without a doubt the top social media personality for 2025.\n\nA security officer turned online sensation, Bailey has honed his craft, and his growing social media following reflects his success.\n\nRenowned for his light-hearted TikTok videos capturing viral moments, trends and popular topics, the comedian has amassed over 295,000 followers and 47.5 million likes for his content.\n\nA standout moment this year was Bad Sekki’s viral TikTok election, in which he led the For Jamaican People (FJP) party to victory against the Jamaica National Party (JNP) led by fellow content creator Reuben “Ganja Clauze” Hussey. This milestone provided both creators with the opportunity to meet Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Minister of National Security Dr Horace Chang, Minister of Culture Olivia Grange, and Speaker of the House Juliet Holness.\n\nFurther showcasing his versatility, the comedian shared his personal story with fans on platforms such as Sim Soul Sessions, hosted by veteran broadcaster Simone Clarke, The Fix hosted by Arianne “Ari” Hammond, Naro Hart and Javi Morgan, and Toxic Talk hosted by Jhaedee “Jaii Frais” Richards.\n\nBad Sekki’s talent has also caught the attention of corporate Jamaica, earning him a role in a Supreme Ventures commercial. His growth this year demonstrates that his appeal extends far beyond TikTok.\n\nKemar “Candy” Jones\n\nKemar “Candy” Jones\n\nMi dear…Nobody does viral slang quite like Candy. With over 213,000 TikTok followers, Candy has carved out a distinct lane in 2025, earning a reputation for being quick-witted and sharp-tongued.\n\nMany of the year’s most popular slang phrases can be traced directly back to this breakout star. While “Mi dear” remains Candy’s most recognisable catchphrase, the TikToker also sent Jamaicans into a frenzy with lines like “Paaaay dead gyal”, “Worries in the dance, worries tonight”, and “Hair are demons”, among others.\n\nEven a court case, one in which the TikToker was ultimately cleared of assault charges, did little to slow Candy’s momentum. With fans proudly calling themselves “Candyoholics”, Candy has undeniably left a lasting mark on Jamaican popular culture this year, cementing a place on this list.\n\nAdonique “Mr Nose” Cole & Melanie “Ms Petal” Welsh\n\nAdonique “Mr Nose” Cole and Melanie “Ms Petal” Welsh. (Photos via Instagram)\n\nBudding actors Adonique “Mr Nose” Cole and Melanie “Ms Petal” Welsh proved in 2025 that great chemistry and sharp humour can turn everyday situations into viral gold. The dynamic duo became fan favourites through their wildly popular “Nosey Landlord” comedy series, where Cole plays the overly inquisitive Mr Nose opposite Welsh’s unapologetically problematic tenant, Ms Petal.\n\nThe skits, which took off on TikTok, resonated with audiences for their relatable storytelling, spontaneous delivery and distinctly Jamaican flavour. What started as short-form comedy quickly evolved into a must-watch series, cementing the pair as standout entertainers on the platform throughout the year.\n\nWhile the Mr Nose and Ms Petal universe has taken on a life of its own, Cole’s journey is especially inspiring. Earlier in the year, he shared his story of being rejected by the Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts due to financial concerns, which makes his success all the more meaningful.\n\nWith a steadily growing online following, several interview appearances and a shared passion for the performing arts, the duo are now setting their sights on long-term on-screen careers, leaving audiences eager to see what they deliver next.\n\nJhaedee “Jaii Frais” Richards\n\nJhaedee “Jaii Frais” Richards (Photo via Instagram)\n\nJhaedee Richards, known online as Jaii Frais, continued to grow his presence in 2025 through consistent, engaging content. Renowned for capitalising on viral moments via his Toxic Talk and Let’s Be Honest podcasts, the content creator maintained strong audience interest throughout the year.\n\nIn May 2025, he was nominated for the Prime Minister’s Youth Award for New Media, though he ultimately was not among the recipients. Richards later drew public attention after openly addressing being overlooked for the award, sparking online conversation and backlash in some cases. However, this did not slow his momentum.\n\nOver the course of the year, his platforms featured several high-profile guests, including People’s National Party President Mark Golding and Jamaica Labour Party campaign chairman Dr Christopher Tufton, and trending personalities like Bad Sekki, Rosalee, Jakes, Akeam, Dyema and Chad Walker.\n\nWith his continued consistency, Jaii Frais is likely to remain a familiar name moving into 2026.\n\nHakeem “Uncle Tries” Bryan\n\nHakeem “Uncle Tries” Bryan (Photo via Instagram)\n\nHakeem “Uncle Tries” Bryan may have started out trying food, but his resume significantly expanded this year as “Uncle” tried awards, pilates, farming, and even netball!\n\nBryan’s consistent creation of interesting and family-friendly content rooted in, but not limited to, food reviews, paid off in 2025. The creator found himself in a wide range of spaces, from attending the Jamaica Observer Table Talk Food Awards to collaborating with Yardmas Jouvert, Suzuki, Red Stripe, and the Jamaica Public Service.\n\nDespite the expansion of his content, Uncle has stayed true to his brand, continuing to spotlight new and upcoming restaurants and food spots while sharing reviews online.\n\nLauded by his followers for the care put into his editing as well as his interesting and varied content, Bryan is a standout creator this year.\n\nReuben “Ganja Clauze” Hussey\n\nReuben “Ganja Clauze” Hussey (Photo via X)\n\nReuben “Ganja Clauze” Hussey continued to stand out in 2025 with his witty, self-aware take on life from an “uptown” Jamaican perspective. Known for blending humour with honest social commentary, the content creator has built a loyal following by turning everyday observations into comical moments.\n\nThis year, Ganja Clauze earned his spot on the list for his central role in one of social media’s most talked-about viral moments— the TikTok elections parody. As the face of the fictional JNP, he went head-to-head with the FJP party led by Karlando “Bad Sekki” Bailey, transforming Jamaica’s political landscape into a comedic spectacle online.\n\nThe mock elections captivated audiences, with Jamaicans tuning in daily for live streams, campaign videos, interviews and manifesto reveals. The parody unfolded across 15 ‘parishes’, including Portmore, and even featured a leaders’ debate hosted by podcaster Jhaedee “Jaii Frais” Richards.\n\nAlthough the JNP ultimately lost the mock election, the moment propelled Ganja Clauze into mainstream conversations. The parody also led to multiple media interviews and an invitation to attend Prime Minister Andrew Holness’ swearing-in ceremony at King’s House, where he met the prime minister in person.\n\nClauze also trended this year after cutting his beard, shocking social media users and prompting a wave of trolling online.\n\nAll things considered, 2025 has been a standout year for Ganja Clauze.\n\nJuliet “Julie Mango” Bodley\n\nJuliet “Julie Mango” Bodley (Photo via Instagram)\n\nComedian, emcee and social media influencer Juliet “Julie Mango” Bodley consistently delighted her online community throughout the year with comedic skits that showcased Jamaican culture, habits and traditions.\n\nFrom depictions of Jamaican parents to popular sayings and the memorable character of the Jamaican man “Everton”, her skits celebrate the uniqueness and authenticity of Jamaican life. Beyond entertainment, she has also used her platform as a space for mental health advocacy, educating her followers on a topic that is often overlooked.\n\nThis year, she took her influence a step further by delivering her first TEDx talk at TEDx Queen Village in New York.\n\nJoan McKenzie\n\nJoan McKenzie (Photo via Instagram)\n\nKnown for her iconic skits that capture Jamaican culture and everyday experiences, actress, producer and educator Joan McKenzie has earned a spot on our list of top social media personalities for 2025.\n\nWith her signature wigs and memorable characters such as “Miss Gladys” and “Princess”, McKenzie has entertained her online followers throughout the year with skits that reflect authentic Jamaican culture and family dynamics. In doing so, she has amassed a strong following across multiple social media platforms.\n\nEarlier this year, Joan also took a bold step by participating in the Miss Clarendon Festival Queen 2025 competition, where she placed second runner-up and walked away with awards for best performance and most popular on social media.\n\nRushane “RushCam” Campbell\n\nRushane “RushCam” Campbell (Photo via Instagram)\n\nRushane “RushCam” Campbell is undeniably one of the social media personalities who truly levelled up this year. From viral moments to meaningful conversations, RushCam struck a rare balance between entertainment and substance, keeping audiences laughing while also giving them plenty to think about.\n\nHis podcast No NDA quickly became a go-to, known for its unfiltered discussions and candid guests. Each episode delivered memorable moments, whether through sharp commentary, honest storytelling or funny interactions. A fan favourite with audiences has been the recurring appearances of his mother, Ruth Ann Byfield, whose quick wit, warmth and vibrant personality consistently stole the show and added a unique, refreshing dynamic to the podcast.\n\nBeyond digital spaces, RushCam’s presence extended into major brand moments. He hosted the Fenty launch at Fontana Pharmacy in Kingston, further cementing his growing influence and versatility as a media personality.\n\nHe also sparked an important conversation during his appearance on the SimSoul Show, where he openly discussed navigating complex mother–child relationships. The discussion was made even more impactful with his mother joining him, offering viewers honesty, vulnerability and perspective rarely seen so publicly.\n\nIf this year is any indication, the best is truly yet to come for RushCam.\n\nJoel Youngsang & Chris “Seelaing” Laing\n\nJoel Youngsang (left) and Chris “Seelaing” Laing. (Photo via Instagram)\n\nJoel Youngsang and Chris “Seelaing” Laing remained a staple of Jamaican social media comedy in 2025, delivering skits that blended sharp humour with everyday local experiences. The popular digital creators are best known for their frequent collaborations, producing content that resonates across platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.\n\nThe duo first gained widespread recognition for their fan-favourite series, “How Jamaicans Name Roads”. Over the years, they have continued to partner on other series such as their “Super Mario” inspired skits, which showcased their ability to put a uniquely Jamaican spin on familiar concepts. Their relatable storytelling and natural on-screen chemistry have made them go-to creators for both entertainment and brand promotions.\n\nBeyond comedy, Youngsang and Laing have also carved out a strong presence through partnerships with various Jamaican brands, seamlessly integrating promotional content without losing the authenticity that audiences appreciate.

By removing these drugs from our nation’s streets, we are disrupting the financial lifeline of organised crime syndicates to the tune of more than J$1 billion,” he said.\n\nIn addition FNID says it has achieved an 88 per cent conviction rate so far this year.\n\n“Our impact is not just measured in the volume of narcotics seized, but in our conviction rate. We are sending a clear message to traffickers that our investigations are precise and our evidence robust,” added Henry.\n\nPolice detailed that on December 22, at approximately 6:10 pm, FNID personnel conducted a security check at the Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA).\n\nDuring the check-in process for a flight destined for London Gatwick Airport in England, a suitcase belonging to 40-year-old Ashraf Uddin, a British national, was searched, and six parcels containing cocaine weighing 17 pounds were found concealed in a blanket. The estimated street value of this seizure is J$4.6 million.\n\nUddin was taken into custody and charged with possession of cocaine, dealing in cocaine, attempting to export cocaine and conspiracy to export cocaine.\n\nEarlier that evening, about 6:00 pm, FNID teams intercepted a vehicle in Claremont, St Ann.\n\nA search of the vehicle was carried out, and rectangular parcels containing seven pounds of cocaine were found.\n\nThe driver, 30-year-old Jemar Briscoe, was arrested. He was later charged on Saturday, December 27, with possession of cocaine, dealing in cocaine, trafficking cocaine and conspiracy. That seizure had an estimated street value of J$1.9 million.\n\nSimultaneously, on December 22, FNID personnel conducted another operation at a premises in Irons Mountain, Claremont.\n\nDuring the operation, 35-year-old Shanette Briscoe, a shop operator, was arrested after police discovered a quantity of ganja in her bedroom. She was charged with possession of ganja and dealing in ganja.\n\nAbout 3:00 pm on Friday, December 26, members of the St Mary Police Division intercepted a Toyota Voxy motor car on the Quebec main road, with three men aboard.\n\nA search of the vehicle was carried out, during which three parcels containing eight pounds of cocaine were seized.\n\nFNID personnel were alerted, and all three men were arrested on reasonable suspicion.\n\nTheir identities are being withheld pending further investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Drugs FNID policework \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Clean-up of Black River progressing steadily \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n ST JAMES, Jamaica — Phase two of the clean-up of Black River in St Elizabeth is now underway, with the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWM... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Performers cancel concerts at Kennedy center after Trump renaming \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-A prominent jazz group and a dance company have canceled shows at Washington's premier performing arts center to prote... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JFF mourns passing of sports journalist Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) has expressed condolences to the family and friends of sports broadcaster Donald Oliver, as ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n No claim that Harding involved in or benefited from alleged SSL fraud — attorney \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jacqueline Samuels-Brown, the defence attorney for former CEO of Stocks & Securities Limited (SSL) Zachary Harding, is maintaining... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 countries warn of ‘catastrophic’ Gaza situation \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The foreign ministers of 10 nations on Tuesday expressed \"serious concerns\" about a \"renewed deterioration of the human... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ gang steals cash, gold from German bank over Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n BERLIN, Germany (AFP)—Robbers used a large drill to break into a German bank's vault room during the extended Christmas break and steal cash, gold and... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PAJ mourns passing of distinguished sports journalist Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Press Association of Jamaica (PAJ) is mourning the passing of sports journalist and broadcaster Donald Oliver.

The party warned that it reserved the right to initiate legal action against the writers and the publication if an immediate public apology was not issued.\n\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Response Regarding The Economist Article:\nThe so-called analysis published in The Economist is nothing more than recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective…\n— PTI (@PTIofficial) November 15, 2025\n\n“We have seen this narrative play out before—half-truths, innuendo, and selective outrage packaged as ‘objective analysis,’” the statement said, adding that the report glossed over alleged rigging in the February elections, recent 10-year jail sentences handed to PTI supporters in “fabricated cases,” and what it described as systematic persecution.\n\nThe party said it was “striking” that the article focused on Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi while remaining silent on events of the past three years and seven months. It reiterated that the Al Qadir Trust case, cited in the report, was ongoing and had not been “fixed,” contrary to the implication made in the article.\n\n“Imran Khan’s trials are neither open nor fair,” the statement added, accusing authorities of conducting proceedings inside prison and denying him access to family, friends, and legal counsel despite court orders. It said co-writer Bushra Taskeen’s alleged bias in favour of the PML-N cast further doubt on the article’s objectivity.\n\nPTI said it “reserved the right to take legal action” against all those involved if a full public apology was not issued for what it called a “reckless and defamatory attack” on the party leader.\n\nImran Khan’s marriage to his spiritual adviser shocked the country. Now she could help decide whether he returns to office or stays in prison https://t.co/eL9EZlwF7M\n— The Economist (@TheEconomist) November 14, 2025\n\nEpstein labelled Imran ‘greater threat to peace’ after PTI’s 2018 victory, emails reveal\n\nIn a related development, disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein described former prime minister Imran Khan as a major “threat to peace” in 2018—just days after PTI won Pakistan’s general elections—according to newly released emails made public by US House Democrats on the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe latest tranche of emails, released Wednesday, shows Epstein discussing the now-incarcerated PTI founder in a July 31, 2018 exchange with an unidentified individual. Epstein, charged in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors before dying by suicide in custody the same year at age 66, made the remarks while discussing international politics and alleged foreign interventions.\n\nIn a 4:04am message about Russia, US election meddling, and global power plays, Epstein wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been “kind so far” and quipped about “how the US involves itself in others’ elections.”\n\nMinutes later, he paired Imran and Putin in the same thread:\n\n“[Putin] hasn’t pointed out assassinations to overthrow [governments] … coup funding … Imran [Khan] in Pakistan is a much greater threat to peace than [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, Khomeini, [China’s President] Xi, or Putin.”\n\n“The populist in Pakistan???” the other person asked.\n\n“Really bad news,” Epstein replied.\n\nWhen pressed further — “The cricket player? — How could he be worse that the Islamist?” — Epstein responded:\n\n“Makes Donald look like Einstein. Incapable of truth. Devout Islamist [sic].”\n\nHe went on to reference Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal and Imran’s past marriages:\n\n“Many nuclear weapons. (not Erdogan or Khomeni). He was married to two friends of mine, one daughter of Jimmy Goldsmith. Super wealthy takeoverguy. Forced her to convert. Wacko.”\n\nEpstein added, “It follows your prediction around cults of personality. He is a cricket captain. Not a chess player, but he’s good at rousing the crowd.”\n\nThe thread then went silent for 40 minutes before shifting to another topic.\n\nOxford-educated Imran, celebrated as one of the greatest all-rounders in cricket history, had long been known for his London social life before gradually toning down his lifestyle after 1992. As the Epstein emails circulated online, users resurfaced a 1990 photograph of Imran with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell—now serving a 20-year sentence for aiding Epstein in abusing underage girls.\n\nEpstein’s far-reaching network\n\nThe emails also reveal Epstein’s extensive connections with powerful global figures, ranging from a senior adviser to then US president Donald Trump to Britain’s ex-prince Andrew.\n\nOne email suggests Trump “knew about the girls,” a claim the former US president denies.\n\nThe US House of Representatives is expected next week to vote on compelling the release of evidence gathered on Epstein over the years, including names of men suspected of participating in his alleged trafficking ring.\n\nTrump has dismissed the transparency push as a “hoax,” even as he calls for scrutiny of Epstein’s links to others, including former US president Bill Clinton.\n\nDemocrats have already released emails spanning from 2009 to 2019—the year Epstein died in detention awaiting trial.","summary":"I have been absent for a while, but now I remember why I used to love this blog.

Inflows","text":"India has imposed a safeguard duty on certain steel imports for a period of three years, signalling a tougher stance against what it has described as a surge in low-priced shipments that threaten domestic manufacturers, particularly from China.\nAccording to a notification issued by the finance ministry and published in the official government gazette on Tuesday, the import levy will range between 11 per cent and 12 per cent over the three-year period.\nThe duty will be set at 12 per cent in the first year, ease to 11.5 per cent in the second year, and further reduce to 11 per cent in the third year.\nThe tariff measure, locally referred to as a safeguard duty, will apply to imports from several countries, including China, Vietnam and Nepal.\nHowever, imports from certain developing countries have been exempted from the levy.\nThe order also clarified that speciality steel products, such as stainless steel, will not fall under the ambit of the safeguard duty.\nThe move follows repeated concerns raised by the federal steel ministry, which has said it does not want India’s domestic steel industry to suffer due to an influx of cheap and sub-standard imports.\nEarlier this year, the government had imposed a temporary safeguard duty of 12 per cent for 200 days in April to provide immediate relief to local producers.\nThe Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), which investigates trade defence cases, recommended the three-year duty after concluding that imports had witnessed a “recent, sudden, sharp and significant increase.”\nSuch a surge, the DGTR said, was causing and also threatening to cause serious injury to domestic manufacturers, according to the finance ministry order.\nIndia’s decision comes amid heightened global trade tensions surrounding steel, particularly Chinese exports.\nUS President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel imports have added to trade friction globally, prompting several countries to introduce protective measures.\nNations such as South Korea and Vietnam have already imposed anti-dumping duties on steel imports earlier this year, Reuters reported.\nCHINA TO CUT IMPORT TARIFFS ON 935 ITEMS\nMeanwhile, in a contrasting move, China has announced it will lower import tariffs on 935 items from January 1, 2026, applying provisional rates that are below the most-favoured-nation tariff levels, according to an official announcement made on Monday.\nThe decision was taken by the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council and is aimed at responding to criticism that China focuses heavily on exports while importing comparatively less, contributing to a persistent trade surplus.\nThe commission said the lower tariffs are intended to improve coordination between domestic and international markets and to better utilise resources from both, while expanding the supply of high-quality goods.\nTariff reductions will apply to select key components and advanced materials to support high-level technological self-reliance, as well as to certain resources to promote green development.\nChina will also reduce tariffs on some medical products, including artificial blood vessels, to enhance public welfare.\nAdditionally, the country plans to optimise tariff headings and national subheading notes in 2026.\nNew national subheadings will be introduced for products such as intelligent bionic robots and bio-aviation kerosene to support technological progress and sectors like the circular economy.\nOfficial data showed that China’s foreign trade reached 41.21 trillion yuan (around USD 5.82 trillion), marking a 3.6 per cent year-on-year increase.\nExports accounted for about USD 3.46 trillion, while imports stood at USD 2.37 trillion, according to figures released by the General Administration of Customs.\nThe commission also said China will continue applying preferential tariff rates under 24 free trade agreements with 34 trading partners in 2026 and will maintain zero-tariff treatment on all tariff lines for 43 least-developed countries that have diplomatic relations with Beijing.\nALSO READ | Australia to Remove Tariffs on All Indian Exports from

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST JAMES, Jamaica — Phase two of the clean-up of Black River in St Elizabeth is now underway, with the National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) deploying additional resources to accelerate debris removal following Hurricane Melissa.\n\nDuring clean-up activities in the town on Monday, Executive Director of the NSWMA, Audley Gordon, said the renewed push follows initial post-hurricane operations that focused on critical facilities.\n\n“We are in phase two of our clean-up of the Black River space. In phase one, right after the hurricane, we came in…and we did an excellent job cleaning up the hospital compound, the health centre and the environs,” he said.\n\nHe noted that more than 200 trips of debris were removed from the area during that initial phase but acknowledged that limited capacity constrained wider operations across the town. That situation, he said, has since changed.\n\n“Thanks to the Government of Jamaica, we got 10 brand-new trucks…to assist in this effort. With improved capacity, we are now committed to pushing ahead with a full clean-up of Black River,” he emphasised.\n\nGordon indicated that crews will remain in the town for as long as is necessary to complete the work.\n\n“We will continue in this space until it’s clean. Whether it takes us two weeks, a month, I’m not giving any definitive time…it will be removed, one trip at a time,” he assured.\n\nMeanwhile, Regional Operations Manager for SPM Waste Management Limited, Sheldon Smith, said the clean-up represents a major operational challenge, but reaffirmed the team’s commitment.\n\n“It has been a big task…here in Black River. We are here today working hard…we are not relenting and we are up to the task,” he assured.\n\nHe appealed for patience from residents, noting that steady progress will yield long-term benefits.\n\n“There’s a little mountain to climb, but as we reach the top, there is a plateau and things will get better. We will have a better Black River,” Smith said.\n\nFor his part, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Mining and Member of Parliament for the area, Floyd Green, said debris removal remains critical to Black River’s recovery following Hurricane Melissa.\n\n“For the town to get back to some semblance of normalcy, debris has to be removed,” Green said.\n\n“This is part of a national clean-up effort happening right across the hard-hit parishes,” he added. “It is going to be a dual phase going into the new year where we focus on not only the central towns but also on the communities.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Black River clean-up hurricane relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Performers cancel concerts at Kennedy center after Trump renaming \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP)-A prominent jazz group and a dance company have canceled shows at Washington's premier performing arts center to prote... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n JFF mourns passing of sports journalist Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) has expressed condolences to the family and friends of sports broadcaster Donald Oliver, as ... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n No claim that Harding involved in or benefited from alleged SSL fraud — attorney \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Jacqueline Samuels-Brown, the defence attorney for former CEO of Stocks & Securities Limited (SSL) Zachary Harding, is maintaining... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10 countries warn of ‘catastrophic’ Gaza situation \n\n\n\n\n Dana Malcolm | Observer Online Reporter | Malcolmd@jamaicaobserver.com \n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n LONDON, United Kingdom (AFP) — The foreign ministers of 10 nations on Tuesday expressed \"serious concerns\" about a \"renewed deterioration of the human... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Ocean’s Eleven’ gang steals cash, gold from German bank over Christmas \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n BERLIN, Germany (AFP)—Robbers used a large drill to break into a German bank's vault room during the extended Christmas break and steal cash, gold and... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n PAJ mourns passing of distinguished sports journalist Donald Oliver \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 30, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — The Press Association of Jamaica (PAJ) is mourning the passing of sports journalist and broadcaster Donald Oliver.

She recounted how she tested positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 2010.\n\nAccording to her, she was planning to get married when the church she attended with her husband instructed her to undergo some tests.\n\nShe said, “After the test, I was told I have HIV. The church then tried not to let me go ahead with the marriage, but my husband insisted that he was going to get married to me, which he did.”\n\nFollowing her diagnosis, Awotuyi, who is a caterer, was referred to the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos, from where she began the journey of managing her HIV status.\n\nAt that time, she noted, support systems for people living with the virus were far stronger.\n\nHowever, that sense of assurance, she said, began to fade following the global funding disruptions for HIV treatment and prevention programmes.\n\nOn January 20, President Donald Trump approved a 90-day suspension of foreign aid, a move that halted all funding disbursed through the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nUSAID distributes funds for the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund to fight AIDS.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, issued a waiver for lifesaving medicines and medical services, offering a reprieve for a worldwide HIV treatment programme. This waiver allows for the continuous distribution of HIV medications (ARVs) and medical services supported by PEPFAR in Nigeria.\n\nThe disruption\n\nDespite the waiver, the disruptions caused by the sanction have taken a huge toll on the services of the international partners who are in charge of implementation.\n\n“At first, I was scared when I heard the announcement. The next thing that came to my mind was the thought of how possible it would be for me to afford buying the drugs at such a costly amount,” Awotuyi added.\n\nUSAID funds international implementing partners, including NGOs, global health organisations and consortia, to support HIV and other health programmes.\n\nThese partners engage a mix of full-time professionals and contract or ad-hoc staff who play key roles in service delivery as well as patient follow-up and data management. The implementing partners work in collaboration with government health institutions and accredited healthcare facilities where patients access care.\n\nDrug distribution is carried out through national systems in Nigeria, via the Federal Ministry of Health, the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, state agencies and designated treatment centres, with USAID-supported partners providing logistics, technical support, monitoring and service delivery assistance.\n\nHowever, since the announcement, the disruption that followed has affected the pattern of service rendered by the health facilities.\n\n Brief pause in antiretroviral drug supply\n\nThe first visible sign of strain in Nigeria’s HIV response was a brief but unsettling pause in the supply of antiretroviral drugs. There was no public announcement, but patients who needed refills at the time sensed something was wrong.\n\nBy coincidence, Rebecca’s medication was running out when she contacted the facility where she receives treatment to ask when she could pick up her next supply. She was told to wait.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, she said, “I registered with the Centre for Population Health Initiatives, and shortly after the news of the funding cuts broke, I realised my drugs were almost finished. When I called to ask when I could come for my refill, they told me the centre hadn’t opened and that drugs were not being dispensed.\n\n“The person I spoke with said they were trying to manage their stock because of the suspension of funding. About a month later, I was asked to come in. Instead of the usual six-month supply, I was given drugs for just three months.”\n\nDuring the hiatus, some patients who still had enough medication were forced to share their drugs with others who needed them urgently.\n\nRising costs, longer journeys\n\nBeyond the rationing of drugs, patients now face additional challenges triggered by the disruption, particularly the cost of transportation, consultations and services that were once free.\n\nSeveral patients told our correspondent that the current reality is markedly different from the past, when testing, consultations and drug collection were largely subsidised.\n\n“Nothing is free anymore,” said Kafayat, 42, who was diagnosed with HIV in 2015. “To see a doctor now, you pay N2,000. To collect drugs for three months, it’s N3,000. If you’re doing the six-month tests, that’s N5,000.”\n\nAlthough she noted that not all partner facilities charge patients, Kafayat said many centres have begun doing so as funding gradually declines.\n\n“I live in Sango, but I collect my drugs at a facility in Yaba,” she said. “Most times, I send my husband because he works around there. Other times, I have to borrow transport money. I need these drugs to survive.”\n\nRelocating to a closer facility is not always an option, she added, because patients’ records are already tied to specific centres.\n\n“Our data has been captured there. To move, you need a referral letter, and many of us fear we won’t get the same quality of care elsewhere,” she explained. “Some people can’t even afford the transport or the fees.”\n\nUNAIDS warns of global consequences\n\nThe United Nations agency for combating AIDS (UNAIDS) has warned that global funding disruptions for HIV treatment and prevention programmes are leaving millions without access to care.\n\nIn a report released after the United States halted funding following President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, UNAIDS said the global HIV response “immediately entered crisis mode.” The situation, it noted, has been worsened by intensifying economic and financial pressures on low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThe funding shortfalls, the agency said, are already having profound and lasting consequences.\n\n“People living with HIV have died due to service disruptions; millions at high risk of infection have lost access to effective prevention tools; more than two million adolescent girls and young women have been deprived of essential health services; and community-led organisations have been devastated, with many forced to close,” the report stated.\n\nGovernment steps in\n\nNo fewer than two million Nigerians living with HIV risk disruption in access to life-saving treatment as funding for HIV programmes continues to shrink, despite the Federal Government’s approval of an emergency intervention.\n\nOn Monday, February 3, the Federal Executive Council approved the sum of nearly N4.8bn for the procurement of 150,000 HIV treatment packs in a move aimed at cushioning the impact of dwindling donor support for HIV care in the country.\n\nSpeaking after the FEC meeting, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Prof. Muhammad Ali Pate, said the approval underscored the Federal Government’s commitment to ensuring uninterrupted access to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV.\n\nAccording to him, the intervention was designed to provide immediate relief while signalling Nigeria’s resolve to transition to a more sustainable, domestically funded health financing model.\n\n“This is about ensuring that no Nigerian loses access to treatment during this period of adjustment,” Pate said.\n\nHe added that the FEC also approved the establishment of an inter-ministerial committee to develop a long-term sustainability plan for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria interventions. The committee, he said, would draw members from the ministries of finance, budget and national planning, defence, environment, as well as the Nigeria Governors’ Forum.\n\nDespite the intervention, health experts and civil society groups have warned that the N4.8bn allocation is grossly inadequate when weighed against the scale of Nigeria’s HIV burden.\n\nFindings show that the 150,000 treatment packs approved by the FEC would only cater to a fraction of those on antiretroviral therapy, raising concerns that many patients could face treatment interruptions if additional funding is not urgently mobilised. According to UNICEF, Nigeria records 190,950 new HIV infections annually, the second-highest number in the world, underscoring the urgency of maintaining uninterrupted treatment and prevention services.\n\n Silent deaths\n\nViral load in HIV refers to the amount of the virus present in a person’s blood and is one of the most important tests in HIV care because it shows how active the virus is and how well treatment is working, with results measured as the number of HIV copies per millilitre of blood.\n\nMeanwhile, where a high viral load indicates rapid viral multiplication and strain on the immune system, a low viral load shows the virus is under control. A consistent use of antiretroviral therapy can reduce the viral load to levels so low that standard tests cannot detect the virus.\n\nAnother HIV patient, who preferred to be called Chika, explained how her viral load increased as a result of her unstable approach to treatment due to funds.\n\nShe claimed to have stopped going for treatment after finding herbal alternatives to treat herself. \n\n“I noticed that my health later began to deteriorate. This triggered other ailments in my body. I knew someone who died two months ago as a result of this. Her own case triggered her diabetes. So I had to quickly find my way back to the health facility for treatment, and by the time I did, my viral load was already high,” Chika explained.\n\nThe lack of funding had also pushed some people to ignorantly compromise their immune system while looking for a medical facility that provides free drugs and services.\n\nAnother team lead of an HIV support group, who gave his name as Charles, disclosed that people living with HIV were placed on different drugs depending on the level of their status.\n\nHe explained that while the majority were on first-line treatment, others were placed on second-line drugs, which he described as meant for more serious cases and also more expensive.\n\nAccording to him, some patients on second-line treatment were often forced to withdraw because they could no longer afford to pay for certain services required at medical facilities.\n\nHe said, “Out of the fear of relapse, they decide to look for another medical facility and on getting there, they pretend as if they have not gotten drugs before, because if they tell them they had been on drugs before, they may likely send them back to go and bring their transfer letter. So they end up introducing themselves as a new client and the facility receive them and place them on the first line. Meanwhile, there is no how the facility will detect, because these are people that were not captured at the former facility. Some people may be lucky while others get their immune system compromised in the process and they die. We have recorded some deaths this year as a result of this. Their deaths may have seemed natural, but these are the contributing factors.”\n\nBonike is another leader of one of the existing support groups of PLWHIV in Lagos State.\n\nAccording to her, the impact of the situation has been devastating as patients are gradually defaulting on treatment, not because they want to, but because they simply cannot afford the costs.\n\nSpeaking on intervention efforts, she said, “There was a time some bodies intervened, but most of the facilities said there was nothing they could do about it as the funders were no longer responding to their demands and that they would have to pay their staff members. The Network of People Living With HIV had also engaged with them, but they insisted, saying the funders were withdrawing. Now, when you want to do a test and you initially knew it was N4,500, by the time you get there, they may say it is N6,000. That is the level it has gotten to.”\n\n Burden of ad-hoc staff\n\nSince the announcement of funding cuts by former US President Donald Trump, nearly half of Nigeria’s ad-hoc HIV programme staff have lost their jobs, leaving those who remain to cover the workload of multiple colleagues. In some cases, one staff member now performs the work of five.\n\nMost ad-hoc staff are themselves living with HIV, a factor that informed their recruitment, as it allowed them to relate directly with patients.\n\nOne such worker, who asked to be called Blessing, has been involved with a partner initiative supporting healthcare facilities for nearly a decade. She was among the fortunate half recalled to work, though this came at a high cost.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, she recounted the ordeal, “At first, when the announcement was made, we were all told to go home and pray. I am under the AIDS Prevention Initiative of Nigeria. We stayed at home for about three months. Later, we were asked to submit our academic credentials, and only some of us were reabsorbed, making up about 50 per cent of the workforce now. Many of my colleagues who were laid off are still struggling. Even today, layoffs continue. I am just praying I am not affected again.”\n\nBlessing described the enormous demands now placed on her:\n\n“I now enrol new clients, track those who miss therapy or drug appointments—managing almost ten registers—handle tuberculosis cases, and manage all appointments. I am doing the work of multiple people, and it is exhausting.”\n\nAnother ad-hoc staffer, Ajose, who is also living with the virus, echoed the strain.\n\n“Sometimes I wake up at 4:30 am just to cover the workload for the day,” she said. “Supervisors check the registers, and if they find too many defaulters, they blame you for being incapable, without considering the extreme multitasking required due to staff shortages.”\n\nAjose described how she and colleagues have had to improvise to keep patients on therapy, often visiting clients’ homes to collect blood samples and deliver drugs.\n\n“This is not convenient at all. We push ourselves out of passion for the job and commitment to client safety, but also to avoid losing our positions. In truth, we are crying in silence,” she said.\n\nShe added that the status of ad-hoc staff was only formally recognised after oversight from international partners:\n\n“There was a period when international supervisors came for an inspection. They noticed we were being referred to as volunteers. That’s when they instructed partners to officially classify us as ad-hoc staff.”\n\n Travails of mentor mothers\n\nMentor mothers are HIV-positive women engaged by international partners to support pregnant women living with the virus. Their role is unique: having given birth to HIV-negative children themselves, they counsel expectant mothers, offering hope that their babies too can remain uninfected.\n\nBut the recent funding crisis has put these women under immense pressure, affecting both their work and personal livelihoods.\n\n“Since the funding cuts, our salaries have dropped from over N100,000 to about N58,000 per month,” lamented one mentor mother, Mrs Oladunjoye. “Each mentor mother cares for up to 50 pregnant women. We cannot complain too loudly because others are waiting to take the job. And above all, we dare not allow any baby to be born positive. That is our priority.”\n\nThe financial strain also affects the pregnant women under their care. Another mentor mother, Racheal, described the challenges of monitoring babies in the crucial first days after birth:\n\n“There is a test called the dried blood spot, which must be done within 72 hours of birth. Often, mothers cannot afford transport to the facility, so we go to their homes to collect the samples. Despite repeated counselling, some mothers resort to herbal remedies, which can be unsafe. Babies must take a prescribed syrup for 41 days, but when traditional birth attendants are involved, there is a real risk of contamination and improper care,” she said.\n\nHIV support services disrupted\n\nJones Ihemenam, Executive Director of Rhoda’s Haven, a network supporting women living with HIV/AIDS, said the funding disruption has led to the immediate suspension of key programmes targeting vulnerable populations.\n\nBefore the cuts, interventions were structured around the global 95-95-95 HIV targets: identifying HIV-positive individuals, retaining them in care, and achieving viral suppression through sustained access to antiretroviral therapy.\n\nIhemenam highlighted the fragile link between treatment and economic security:\n\n“Drugs do not work without food. Many of our clients, including children and adolescents, struggle to eat properly. When they lack food or money for transport, they stop taking their medications.”\n\nHe explained that community-based support had previously included transport stipends, food assistance, and emergency nutrition for malnourished children. With funding frozen, these critical services have largely collapsed.\n\nSupport for orphans and vulnerable children was organised around four pillars: healthy, safe, schooled, and stable.\n\nHealthy for nutrition, access to drugs, and guidance on preparing balanced meals; Safe for birth registration, identity, and protection from gender-based violence; Schooled for ensuring children remain in school and Stable for livelihood support for families, allowing them to afford transport, food, and emergencies.\n\n“These interventions have been severely curtailed, leaving communities dependent mainly on underfunded basic health services,” Ihemenam said.\n\nHe warned of the wider public health implications:\n\n“When viral loads are suppressed, HIV is untransmittable. But when people drop out of care, the risk of spreading the virus increases. We are facing that danger now. Government, donors, and individuals must step in to support grassroots organisations. This is an SOS. The more people we keep virally suppressed, the safer the community becomes.”\n\nRecent national survey data show that Nigeria’s HIV prevalence among adults aged 15–49 stands at about 1.4 per cent, with over two million people currently living with the virus.\n\nNigeria has recorded measurable progress towards the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which aim to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. However, significant gaps persist, particularly in diagnosis and prevention services for children, adolescents and key populations. One major concern is the continued underutilisation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services, despite their availability.\n\nExperts raise alarm over funding gaps\n\nA researcher in HIV and Tuberculosis Management at Ebonyi State University, Professor Lawrence Ogbonnaya, warned that Nigeria faces a widening funding gap that could severely undermine its HIV response.\n\nHe said unless the shortfall is urgently addressed, patients may soon struggle to access even basic medications and essential support services.\n\n“Previously, HIV patients benefited from free testing, nutritional support, microcredit schemes, transport assistance to clinics, and outreach services,” Ogbonnaya said. “Health facilities received funding to employ workers, and treatment support specialists were deployed to track patients who defaulted and return them to care.”\n\nAccording to him, recent funding cuts have led to the suspension of many of these interventions. “If Nigeria does not fill this gap, patients will suffer greatly. The support systems that kept people healthy and adherent to treatment are disappearing,” he warned.\n\nA retired Chief Research Fellow at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba, Lagos, Dr Dan Onwujekwe, said despite being given ample time to plan for the reality, Nigeria had been caught unprepared following recent policy shifts under the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\n“We ought to have known that we would get to this stage. I think we have been too dependent on external aid, foreign aid, for running these health programmes. I believe that we were given enough time to prepare for it. Unfortunately, we have been caught as if we are unprepared. I am surprised that we have to lay off ad-hoc workers. Some of those ad-hoc staff we are referring to are actually people with HIV who have been treated, who have been on treatment, and who have been recruited as peer counsellors and trained for the job and are doing it very well. So, for them to be laid off is unfortunate because they are actually doing the work with passion.”\n\nWhen contacted for reaction, the spokesperson for the National Agency for the Control of Aids, Toyin Aderibigbe, said she was on leave. She, however, requested our correspondent to send his inquiry via a mail she provided. The agency had yet to provide a response to the inquiry as of the time this report was filed.","summary":"Nigeria faces a severe HIV care crisis as global funding disruptions leave two million people without access to free drugs, tests, and support services.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/two-million-nigerians-face-hiv-care-crisis-as-n4-8bn-funding-dries-up/","url":"https://punchng.com/two-million-nigerians-face-hiv-care-crisis-as-n4-8bn-funding-dries-up/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/31004813/pate--1200x630.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 01:12:24","author":"Dayo Oyewo,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Dayo Oyewo","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":-0.002},{"id":390205814,"title":"2025: Religion, Trump’s CPC designation, Christmas strikes redefine Nigeria-US ties","text":"The sound of United States Tomahawk missiles over parts of North-West in Nigeria during the 2025 Christmas season marked one of the most consequential moments in Nigeria–US relations in decades.\n\nThe airstrikes, confirmed by both governments as coordinated operations against Islamic State-linked fighters, capped a year in which security concerns, diplomatic pressure and competing narratives steadily pushed bilateral relations into unfamiliar territory.\n\nWhile the US presented the strikes as decisive counter-terrorism action, Nigeria framed them as the product of strategic security cooperation within an evolving partnership. The military operation, however, came against the backdrop of mounting diplomatic tension triggered by President Donald Trump’s decision to redesignate Nigeria as a “Country of Particular Concern” over alleged violations of religious freedom.\n\nThat decision, announced in October, reshaped diplomatic engagements between both countries throughout 2025 and placed Nigeria’s internal security crisis under intensified global scrutiny.\n\nA Diplomatic Shift with Far-Reaching Consequences\n\nTrump announced Nigeria’s CPC redesignation on October 31 via his Truth Social platform, accusing the Federal Government of failing to protect Christian communities amid persistent violence.\n\n“Thousands of Christians are being killed. When Christians, or any group, are slaughtered like is happening in Nigeria, something must be done,” Trump wrote, blaming “radical Islamists” for the killings.\n\nThe declaration quickly reverberated across the US. A US lawmaker, Riley Moore, described the situation as “systematic persecution,” while another lawmaker, Ted Cruz, claimed, “Officials in Nigeria are ignoring and even facilitating the mass murder of Christians by Islamist Jihadists.”\n\nWithin 24 hours, Trump escalated his rhetoric, warning of possible aid suspension and military action should the killings continue. The comments unsettled officials in Nigeria, even as security cooperation between both countries continued behind the scenes.\n\nUnderstanding the CPC Designation\n\nUnder the US International Religious Freedom Act, a CPC designation represents the US’s most severe classification for countries accused of tolerating or enabling serious violations of religious freedom. The designation allows for sanctions, restrictions on assistance and diplomatic downgrades.\n\nFor Nigeria, the redesignation is not just a diplomatic setback; it is a challenge to national image and sovereignty. It raises fundamental questions: Who defines Nigeria’s religious freedom reality — its own government, foreign powers, or advocacy groups abroad?\n\nThis is the second time in five years that Nigeria has been placed on the CPC list. The first came in December 2020, during Trump’s earlier administration, citing systematic and ongoing violations of religious freedom. The Joe Biden administration removed Nigeria from the list in November 2021.\n\nIn December 2023, the US Department of State designated twelve countries as “Countries of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. The list includes Burma (Myanmar), China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.\n\nIn its 2024 annual report, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended expanding the list to seventeen countries, adding Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, India, Nigeria, and Vietnam to the twelve already designated by the State Department.\n\nThe State Department has not announced any new CPC designations since December 2023.\n\nThe new designation signalled the US’s belief that conditions have worsened and that the FG has not done enough to protect minority faith communities.\n\nStrained Ties, Visa issues, Continued Engagement\n\nDespite the heightened rhetoric, Nigeria–US relations in 2025 reflected strain rather than rupture.\n\nEarlier in the year, the US tightened immigration policies affecting Nigerians, reducing the validity of most non-immigrant visas to single-entry permits lasting three months.\n\nIn December, Washington announced a partial suspension of visa issuance to Nigerians from January 1, 2026, under Presidential Proclamation 10998, aimed at strengthening the US border and national security. Nigeria was listed among 19 affected countries.\n\nThe restrictions cover non-immigrant B-1/B-2 visitor visas, as well as F, M and J student and exchange visitor visas, and extend to immigrant visas with limited exceptions. US officials stressed that the measures would not apply to all travellers, outlining exemptions for lawful permanent residents, dual nationals using unaffected passports, certain persecuted minorities, and participants in major international sporting events.\n\nEven so, cooperation endured. In September, it was reported that the US provided $32.5m in humanitarian assistance through the World Food Programme, supporting more than 760,000 Nigerians. Security collaboration continued through intelligence sharing and a $346m arms package.\n\nIn December, both countries signed a five-year bilateral health agreement committing nearly $2.1bn in US funding to programmes targeting HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, maternal and child health, and polio. Nigeria, in turn, is expected to increase its domestic health spending by almost $3bn over the life of the agreement.\n\nThe Violence Driving International Attention \n\nThe CPC redesignation was rooted in Nigeria’s worsening insecurity, particularly in the Middle Belt.\n\nAmnesty International reported at least 100 deaths in Benue State in June 2025 alone. It also revealed that between 2023 and mid-2025, more than 10,000 people were killed across seven states, with Benue and Plateau recording the highest casualties.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission documented 2,266 conflict-related deaths and 857 abductions in the first half of 2025.\n\nWhile rights groups cite repeated attacks on Christian-dominated communities as evidence of religious persecution, FG maintained that the violence is driven by terrorism, criminality and communal tensions rather than faith-based targeting.\n\nNigeria Pushes Back\n\nPresident Tinubu rejected the CPC designation, describing it as a misrepresentation of Nigeria’s reality.\n\n“Nigeria is a democracy with constitutional guarantees of religious liberty,” he said, stressing that the country does not sanction religious persecution.\n\nEngagement with the US nevertheless continued. In November, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu met US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon to discuss counter-terrorism and regional stability. The US House Subcommittee on Africa also convened hearings on Nigeria’s security challenges.\n\nRibadu later met with a US delegation in Abuja. Moore, who was part of the delegates who visited Benue State and held discussions with Tiv and Catholic leaders, described the engagement as “productive.”\n\nChristmas, Terrorism and the Turn to Force\n\nThe most decisive development came during the Christmas period. Trump announced the strikes on Thursday night via Truth Social.\n\n“Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS terrorist scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even centuries! I have previously warned these terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he wrote.\n\nAlthough Trump did not name specific locations, the US Africa Command later confirmed that the strikes occurred in Sokoto State.\n\nOn Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the airstrikes, adding that Nigeria remained engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the US, in addressing terrorism and violent extremism. The ministry stated that the cooperation had led to precision airstrikes on terrorist targets in the North-West.\n\nAlso, in a statement signed by the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris, FG clarified that the strikes targeted terrorist staging grounds.\n\nIt said the operation was conducted “in close coordination with the Government of the United States of America” and targeted “two major Islamic State terrorist enclaves located within the Bauni forest axis of Tangaza Local Government Area, Sokoto State.”\n\n“Intelligence confirmed that these locations were being used as assembly and staging grounds by foreign ISIS elements infiltrating Nigeria from the Sahel region,” the statement said.\n\nAccording to the government, the strikes were executed between 12:12am and 1:30am on December 26, following presidential approval and under Nigeria’s security command structure.\n\nIt disclosed that 16 GPS-guided munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned platforms launched from maritime locations in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nDebris from the operation fell in parts of Sokoto and Kwara states, but authorities confirmed that no civilian casualties occurred.\n\nA Defining Year\n\nRepresentative Moore contrasted previous Christmas violence with the 2025 operation.\n\n“For the past two Christmases, Christians were murdered in Nigeria. This year, terrorists were hit with 12 Tomahawk missiles,” he wrote.\n\nThe strikes followed earlier Christmas tragedies, including the killing of at least 140 people in Plateau State on Christmas Eve 2023 and 33 deaths in Benue on Christmas Day 2024.\n\nBy the end of 2025, Trump’s CPC redesignation and the subsequent military action had become defining features of Nigeria–US relations.\n\nWhat remains unresolved is whether the CPC designation and the military cooperation it preceded will translate into improved security for vulnerable communities or further strain bilateral relations.","summary":"Explore the defining moments of Nigeria-US relations in 2025, from Trump&#8217;s CPC designation over religious freedom to coordinated Christmas airstrikes.\n\nRead More: https://punchng.com/2025-religion-trumps-cpc-designation-christmas-strikes-redefine-nigeria-us-ties/","url":"https://punchng.com/2025-religion-trumps-cpc-designation-christmas-strikes-redefine-nigeria-us-ties/","image":"https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/05101209/IMG_4813.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 01:09:23","author":"Gift Habib,Punch Newspapers","authors":["Gift Habib","Punch Newspapers"],"language":"en","source_country":"ng","sentiment":0.045},{"id":390206740,"title":"It was a year of deferred accountability. Opposition must see its opportunity","text":"The year that will soon recede into the annals of history will be remembered as a time when the machinery of state revealed a startling fragility in its core functions of governance, security and democratic accountability. From the still-smouldering valleys of Manipur to the grave national security incidents, the fading year laid bare a governance model that is intrinsically reactive and divorced from the fundamental covenant of constitutionalism. The tragedy of Manipur stands as an open wound in the nation’s conscience. The resignation of the state government and the subsequent imposition of President’s Rule in February were not solutions but a tacit acceptance of failure. They do not mask the stark reality of ethnic cleavages that deepen even as democracy is in suspended animation. Nothing illustrates the negation of constitutional guarantees better than the repetitive pattern of violence around Christmas, now going back almost a decade. In the realm of national security, 2025 delivered jarring shocks that should have precipitated profound introspection. The horrific Pahalgam terror attack was not merely a security dereliction but also pointed to intelligence and governance failures. The kinetic responses between May 7 and 10 demonstrated military prowess but seemingly missed the strategic forest for the tactical trees. The fundamental question — is conventional retaliation sufficient to establish lasting deterrence against a nuclear-armed adversary committed to asymmetric warfare — remains unanswered even today. The parliamentary debate that followed unfortunately turned into a political point-scoring exercise that failed to address another critical dilemma. Why does India, with a defence budget nearly nine times that of Pakistan and immense diplomatic heft, still find itself trapped in a provocation-and-response cycle? The blast near the Red Fort in Delhi underscored once again the danger of homegrown radicalisation. It highlighted the urgent need for robust parliamentary oversight over intelligence agencies. This pattern of unforced errors stained India’s foreign policy canvas as well. The much-anticipated upgrade in India-US relations under President Donald Trump dissolved into a diplomatic flux. It exposed the limitations of a dogmatic foreign office apparatus trying to surmount the political agenda of a US administration that seeks to upend eight decades of carefully crafted efforts to establish a rules-based order by its own governments. Closer to home, the “Neighbourhood First” policy is stretched taut. The aftermath of Sheikh Hasina’s ouster in Bangladesh continues to create strategic unease, while the Gen-Z protests in Sri Lanka and now Nepal underline how unfulfilled aspirations can be weaponised by leveraging the reach of social media. The much-touted thaw with China remains a chimera of resumed flights and visas, deliberately dissimulating the unresolved border incursions and an ever-widening debilitating trade deficit that the government has no credible plan of addressing. On the domestic front, the government’s economic and social policy appeared unmoored and driven by electoral panic rather than visionary planning. The income tax and GST cuts were not presented as part of a coherent fiscal philosophy but as reactive measures, the former a populist reaction to the 2024 electoral setback and the latter a hasty response to external trade pressures like the Trump administration’s arbitrary tariffs. The sudden announcement of a caste census marked a clear ideological U-turn devoid of genuine commitment to error-proof data collection, especially that of sub-castes and lineage markers, along with key economic indicators necessary for taking social emancipation to the next level. The subordination of the state to politics has manifested most alarmingly in the deliberate weakening of democratic institutions and norms. The new process for appointing Election Commissioners, having removed the Chief Justice from the selection panel, has produced a Commission that embarked on the legally dubious and democratically dangerous path of the Special Intensive Revision, a mass disenfranchisement campaign masquerading as an electoral roll clean-up exercise. The passage of the SHANTI Act for the nuclear sector is a case study of the dangerous ethos of passing legislation without rigorous parliamentary scrutiny. By capping the liability of operators at a paltry Rs 3,000 crore and completely exempting foreign suppliers, thereby privatising profit and socialising liability, the government has jeopardised public safety for opaque objectives. Replacing the MGNREGA, putting Mahatma Gandhi and Lord Ram at odds, is not just anti-Gandhian but fundamentally regressive. The National Sports Governance law and the Higher Education Bill are unabashed power grabs by the Centre, symptomatic of a deep distrust of federalism and institutional autonomy. The Digital Personal Data Protection Rules of 2025 complete this Orwellian picture, handing the digital souls of citizens to the state with minimal safeguards. Policy has been wholly subsumed by politics, with every decision assessed primarily through the prism of immediate electoral utility. This is not governance, it is a delusion that views the citizenry as subjects to be managed, not as sovereigns to be served. This disturbing theme of accountability deferred also echoed across the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, belying all boasts of monumental achievement. The railways, the lifeline of India, saw a year of avoidable tragedies. This systemic rot extended beyond the tracks. Bridges, symbols of connection, collapsed. These were not acts of God but failures of maintenance and oversight. The tragedy reached the skies in June with the crash of Air India Flight 171 in Ahmedabad, a catastrophe that claimed precious lives and raised grave questions about aviation safety and regulatory oversight that are sought to be deflected or at worst buried, seemingly to protect global corporate interests. The spectre of duopolies has become entrenched in every sector of the Indian economy. Nothing demonstrates this better than IndiGo’s brazen defiance of FDTL norms. Each catastrophe was met with a familiar script. Expressions of anguish, announcements of ex-gratia, and promises of inquiries, but the ministers concerned remained insensitive without as much as a statement accepting moral responsibility. This pointed to a pervasive culture of prioritising optics over accountability. This grim panorama, however, is also a clarion call for the Opposition. At 230 seats, the INDIA bloc collectively holds not just the right, but the solemn duty, to offer a united alternative. The agenda is painfully clear — rural distress, staggering unemployment, corrosive inflation, and deliberate subversion of the social welfare safety net. The Opposition must move beyond fragmented rhythms and forge a united, policy-driven front leveraging issues that resonate across the spectrum. It must articulate clear alternatives on national security, federalism, economic regeneration and institutional integrity.

The picture is complicated  - Guyana Inquirer – Daily Guyana News","text":"As the United States economy heads into 2026, the report card emerging on its performance is complicated.\n\nBy many measures, the world’s largest economy appears to be in a strong position.\n\nAfter a tumultuous year marked by President Donald Trump’s return to the White House and his swing towards tariffs and protectionism, recent growth has outpaced the expectations of most analysts.\n\nIn a speech this month, Trump hailed his economic record, insisting that the US was on the cusp of an economic boom the “likes of which the world has never seen”.\n\nYet nestled within the economic data are signs of weakness that hint at risks down the track. And crucially, Americans are widely pessimistic about their material condition.\n\nHere are some of the key metrics of the US economy as 2025 draws to a close:\n\nAfter a modest expansion in the first half of 2025, gross domestic product (GDP) growth blasted past expectations in the July-September quarter to reach an annualised 4.3 percent.\n\nThat was the strongest performance in two years. It was also well ahead of the US’s fellow developed countries.\n\nDuring the third quarter, the eurozone’s and the United Kingdom’s economies grew just 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, on an annualised basis.\n\nJapan, the world’s fourth largest economy, contracted 2.3 percent during the period.\n\nWhile robust, the growth of the US economy has been largely driven by multibillion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence led by a handful of tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nBy some estimates, AI-related spending accounted for about 40 percent of all growth in 2025.\n\nThat means a lot rests on AI delivering on its as yet unproven potential to transform the economy.\n\nWhile many analysts believe AI will usher in a fourth industrial revolution, others are concerned the tech has been vastly overhyped.\n\nCampbell Harvey, an economist at Duke University, said 2026 could be the year that AI and decentralised financial technologies begin to deliver substantial gains to productivity.\n\n“We are at the cusp of technologies like AI being able to very substantially increase productivity,” Harvey told Al Jazeera.\n\n“This means higher growth. We have not seen realisations of this higher growth yet from AI.”\n\nWhile the US economy is strong on paper, Americans are broadly unhappy with the state of their finances. In fact, consumer sentiment is near record lows.\n\nThe University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment stood at 53.3 in December, up slightly from the previous month, compared to 50 in June 2022 when inflation was at a four-decade high.\n\nYet Americans are continuing to spend.\n\nConsumer spending grew 3.5 percent during the July-September quarter, the fastest pace since the final quarter of 2024.\n\nThe splurge has shown no signs of slowing down either. Mastercard’s annual report on the Christmas season showed spending up 3.9 percent compared with last year.\n\nThe reason for the disconnect between spending and sentiment? The diverging fortunes of wealthy Americans and those of more modest means.\n\nThe top 10 percent of earners now account for roughly half of spending, the highest proportion since officials began compiling data in 1989, according to Moody’s Analytics.\n\nHarvey said he would give the economy an overall rating of six out of 10.\n\n“Many believe that the US is stuck in the 2 percent real GDP growth regime. The third quarter showed that higher growth is possible. I think many are too pessimistic. We need more ambition,” he said.\n\nRolf J Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany, said he would rate the economy a six “at best”, noting that the International Monetary Fund had forecast a 2.7 percent growth rate at the start of Trump’s tenure.\n\n“The current strength is visibly lower, around 2 percent only,” Langhammer told Al Jazeera.\n\nUS stock market\n\nAfter wild swings earlier in the year during Trump’s back-and-forth tariff announcements, stocks are finishing out 2025 on a high note.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is up nearly 18 percent, easily beating the average annual return of 10.5 percent.\n\nWhile most Americans own stocks, the gains have disproportionately benefitted wealthier households.\n\nStock ownership ranges from as high as 87 percent in households earning at least $100,000 per year to as low as 28 percent of households earning less than $50,000, according to Gallup.\n\nDespite fears that Trump’s tariffs would fuel inflation, prices have grown at a moderate pace – though still above the US Federal Reserve’s target of 2 percent.\n\nYear-on-year inflation came to 2.7 percent in November, down from 3 percent in September.\n\nWhile inflation is way down from its recent peak of 9.1 percent in June 2022, when then-President Joe Biden faced a similarly glum public mood over the economy, Americans are still feeling the pinch.\n\nIn a PBS News/NPR/Marist poll conducted this month, 70 percent of respondents said the cost of living in their area was unaffordable.\n\nSome economists have also cautioned that the full impact of tariffs may have been delayed by companies that stockpiled imports in anticipation of higher costs.\n\nLanghammer said the jury was out on whether living costs would remain stable in the coming year.\n\n“Front-loading of imports is fading out, and the effects of tariffs on inflation are likely to become more visible in 2026 in addition to the weak dollar,” Langhammer said, noting that the average effective tariff rate, 17 percent, was about five times higher than before Trump took office.\n\nHowever, Harvey said he believed the tariffs have had a minimal economic impact.\n\n“The US trade sector is very small compared to other countries. Measuring trade intensity as the sum of exports plus imports divided by GDP, the US ranks as one of the least trade-intensive countries in the world,” he said.\n\n“Another way of looking at this is to look at the size of imports relative to GDP, and you’ll see that it’s about 14 percent. This is why I believe that the economic impacts of tariffs are less important than the attention they get in the media.”\n\nDespite Trump’s pledge to restore the manufacturing glory of the US, unemployment has risen steadily since the start of his second term in January.\n\nThe official jobless rate climbed to a four-year high of 4.6 percent in November, up from 4 percent in January.\n\nWhile Trump has attributed the rise to cuts in government jobs undertaken by billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), those layoffs account for only a small proportion of the total number of jobless people.\n\nWhereas DOGE cut about 300,000 federal employees, one million more Americans were classified as unemployed in November compared with January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/is-the-us-economy-strong-heading-into-2026-the-picture-is-complicated/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/12/AP24085714406003-1767057909_2d6800-1767074372-HTMUag.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 01:06:04","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","source_country":"gy","sentiment":0.089},{"id":390205560,"title":"CIA officials livid as Trump throws agency under the bus: 'Near-universal dismay'","text":"The CIA reportedly has a bone to pick with President Donald Trump after he let slip details of a secret strike on a dock in Venezuela.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that some CIA officials expressed unhappiness that Trump publicly discussed an operation typically meant to be kept secret with no obvious ties to the U.S. government.\n\nTrump this week indicated the U.S. carried out a strike on a dock facility along Venezuela's shoreline as his administration ramps up pressure on alleged drug trafficking in the country.\n\n“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump said during a meeting in Florida with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area and that is no longer around.”\n\nHe added: “I know exactly who it was, but I don’t want to say who it was.

Hours later, Kyiv expressed disappointment over the statement, saying “no such attack happened”. Ukraine Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, in a post on X, said, “Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged ‘attack on Putin’s residence’. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened.” “We were disappointed and concerned to see the statements by Emirati, Indian and Pakistani sides expressing their concerns regarding the attack that never happened. It is even more surprising given that all three states failed to issue any official statements when a real Russian missile struck the real Ukrainian government building on September 7, 2025,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine of attacking the Presidential residence in the Novgorod region overnight with 91 long-range attack drones, and said Russia would retaliate. He said no one was injured and although Moscow was not quitting talks on ending the war in Ukraine, its negotiating position was being reviewed following the attack, which he described as “state terrorism”. Lavrov did not provide any evidence for the accusation. He said Russia had already identified targets in Ukraine. For India, the last four years of war have led to a diplomatic tightrope walk – it has not condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has usually abstained during UN resolutions on the conflict. It has, however, visited both Moscow and Kyiv, and has kept its channels of communication with Putin and Zelenskyy. Delhi hosted Putin early December and is planning to host the Ukrainian President soon. It has also passed on messages between Russia and Ukraine.","url":"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pm-concerned-over-targeting-of-putin-home-ukraine-says-disappointed-10447521/","image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/12/Putin-modi-4col.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:58:14","author":"Shubhajit Roy","authors":["Shubhajit Roy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":390205856,"title":"Iran’s govt offers dialogue as protests spread to universities","text":"DUBAI: Protests over Iran’s soaring cost of living spread to several universities on Tuesday, with students joining shopkeepers and bazaar merchants, semi-official media reported, as the government offered dialogue with demonstrators.\n\nIran’s rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years and which is facing US sanctions and threats of Israeli strikes.\n\nPresident Masoud Pezeshkian said in a social media post late on Monday that he had asked the interior minister to listen to “legitimate demands” of protesters.

According to CNN, the strike was executed by the CIA and targeted a remote dock that US agencies believe was being used by the criminal gang Tren de Aragua to store drugs and transfer them onto boats for onward trafficking. No casualties were reported, as the site was reportedly empty at the time of the strike.The operation was not publicly disclosed earlier and marks a significant escalation in Washington’s actions against Venezuela. CNN cited two sources that US Special Operations Forces had provided intelligence inputs for the strike, though this claim was rejected by the US Special Operations Command.Colonel Allie Weiskopf, spokesperson for US Special Operations Command, said, “Special Operations did not support this operation to include intel support, ” CNN quoted. Last week on Friday, US President Donald Trump indirectly confirmed the strike during a media interview, although he did not provide details at the time. Earlier on Monday, while hosting Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at his Mar-a-lago club in Florida, Trump said the US had struck a dock area used for loading boats involved in drug trafficking but declined to clarify whether the military or the CIA carried out the operation.He said there was “a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs.”“So we hit all the boats, and now we hit the area, it’s an implementation area, that’s where they implement, and that is no longer around,” Trump added.When asked if the US military carried out the Venezuela operation, Trump declined to clarify. “I don’t want to say that,” he said, CNN reported.“I know exactly who it was, but I don’t want to say who it was. But you know, it was along the shore.”Trump first disclosed the operation during a recent interview, where he said the US struck “a big plant, or a big facility,” adding, We knocked that out,” CNN quoted.The drone strike comes amid growing pressure by the US on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Washington has stepped up actions aimed at weakening Maduro’s government, including repeated threats of direct strikes inside the country.In recent months, the US has destroyed more than 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean as part of what it calls a counter-narcotics campaign. These operations were conducted in international waters. The latest strike marks a shift, as it was carried out on Venezuelan soil, CNN reported. Trump has also ordered a blockade on oil tankers linked to Venezuela, particularly those under US sanctions, further tightening economic pressure on Caracas.

For Bhanu (name changed), an AI engineer in Bengaluru, plans to move to the US are stalled as companies reduce dependence on H-1B visas. Their stories underscore widespread uncertainty among tens of hundreds of skilled professionals amid tightening immigration rules in the US under President Donald Trump, with experts warning of more restrictions in the coming years. Indians, the biggest H-1B beneficiaries - accounting for 71% of such visas issued in 2024, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services - are the worst affected by rising visa denial rates and higher scrutiny. Some are mulling moving back to India. In 2025, the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on fresh H-1B visas and started social media vetting of applicants among other measures. This resulted in mass cancellations of visa interviews, which are being rescheduled to over a year, putting the lives of many Indians in limbo. More recently, the US Department of State amended the H-1B regulations, where selection will be wage-based in place of random lottery, starting February 27.Year of Fear \"The biggest change is the pervasive climate of fear and uncertainty,\" said Joel Yanovich, attorney at Murthy Law Firm. \"My clients aren't just worried about complex cases, they are scared to travel for holidays or file simple, routine extensions.\" He explained that they are also seeing a marked departure from consistent adjudications. \"This friction is felt most acutely at consular posts abroad, where delays, cancellations, and the 'black hole' of administrative processing have become the new standard for skilled workers,\" Yanovich said. As a result, people are beginning to look for alternatives, including returning to India. \"Many foreigners are making a Plan B and a Plan C, just in case the US does not work out for them,\" said Duden Freeman, a former US diplomat and consular manager and founder of Visas 101. \"I know, for many Indians, the possibility of returning to India is something they are weighing carefully and are more and more open to.\"Returning to India Anand Joshi, cofounder of ExH1B, a platform that helps US skilled workers relocate to India, told ET that they are seeing increasing interest from Indian H-1B holders to return to India.","summary":"The price of American dream, both financial and emotional, has never been higher","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/h-1b-visa-holders-take-stock-of-a-year-of-fear-and-loathing/articleshow/126258374.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-1200,height-900,imgsize-355966,resizemode-75,msid-126258374/tech/technology/h-1b-visa-holders-take-stock-of-a-year-of-fear-and-loathing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:30:00","author":"Swathi Moorthy","authors":["Swathi Moorthy"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.318},{"id":390205562,"title":"White House official hit with demand over 'bungled' and possibly illegal Epstein dump","text":"Two Democratic leaders in the US Senate revealed Tuesday that they’re demanding answers from the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, about her access to federal files on deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and whether she’s involved in their “bungled and potentially illegal partial release.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein—at least until a reported falling out in 2004.

Biggest Gavin Newsom stories in 2025","text":"Gov. Gavin Newsom will soon embark on his final year in office, as he termed out in 2026 and cannot run again for governor. He said he will then announce his decision whether to run for president, as expected. But before then, he must rectify an $18 billion budget deficit and faces the possibility of voters passing a tax on billionaires, which he opposes.\n\nHere is The Bee’s look at the biggest stories involving Newsom in 2025:\n\nProposition 50\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump began pressing red states to find ways to ensure the GOP held on to its congressional majority in 2026.\n\nNewsom publicly mulled a counter challenge in the form of Proposition 50, but initially presented it as a lark. “Maybe we’ll do it here in California,” he said on his podcast in early July. After Trump successfully persuaded Texas Republicans to convene a special legislative session and adopt new districts, Newsom tapped his veteran strategists and operatives to launch the “Yes on 50” campaign.\n\nFour months and hundreds of millions of dollars later, Prop. 50’s successful passage helped smooth the path for California Democrats to net another five seats in Congress and shored up Newsom’s national image as a serious 2028 presidential contender.\n\nLos Angeles wildfires\n\nWhen devastating wildfires broke out in January and devastated Los Angeles, Newsom promised to work with Trump, offering him an “open hand, not a closed fist.” Trump embraced the governor on the tarmac after landing at LAX to survey the damage, while taking to social media to falsely blame the infernos on Newsom’s leadership and the state’s environmental protections.\n\nNearly a year later, California is still waiting to be reimbursed for $40 billion in wildfire aid that Newsom asked for after the Palisades and Eaton fires burned thousands of homes and claimed dozens of lives.\n\nNewsom traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier this month, but did not meet with Trump after he said the White House rebuffed his request for face time with the president.\n\nThe Pentagon seizes the National Guard\n\nAttorney General Rob Bonta has sued the federal administration at a steady clip since Trump retook the White House in January. Newsom has weighed in on a few, but it really seized his attention when the Pentagon took control of the California National Guard to suppress anti-ICE protests in June.\n\nEarlier this month, a San Francisco federal court ruled that the White House acted illegally when it seized control of troops to protect federal immigration agents carrying out deportation raids.\n\nThe case arguably also marked a turning point in Newsom and Trump’s relationship, ending Newsom’s promise to work with the president and offer an “open hand.”\n\nNewsom trolls Trump\n\nWhen Trump began blaming Newsom for the wildfires in Southern California, Newsom responded with a fact-checking website. It did little to stem the tide of disinformation proliferating on Twitter, TikTok, YouTube and other sites.\n\nBut when the Pentagon took control of the National Guard in June to suppress protests in Los Angeles, Newsom’s chronically online office was ready. Since then, the stewards behind @GavinNewsom and @govpressoffice have posted a steady supply of memes mocking MAGA royalty from Kid Rock to Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe shift from staid press releases and fact-checking queries to posts mocking Trump’s posting cadence has inspired other Democrats to start incorporating their own “brain rot” online strategies into their press shops.","url":"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article314067054.html","image":"https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/souh5f/picture313493966/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/2249826576.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:25:14","author":"Lia Russell","authors":["Lia Russell"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.26},{"id":390172968,"title":"No claim that Harding involved in or benefited from alleged SSL fraud — attorney","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZachary Harding \n\n Latest News, News \n\nDecember 30, 2025\n\n\n\n\n No claim that Harding involved in or benefited from alleged SSL fraud — attorney \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Jacqueline Samuels-Brown, the defence attorney for former CEO of Stocks & Securities Limited (SSL) Zachary Harding, is maintaining her client’s innocence in the alleged defrauding of more than 200 client accounts including that of legendary sprinter Usain Bolt.\n\nAccording to Samuels-Brown in a media statement Tuesday, based on the questioning and information provided by investigators, there was no allegation that her client was the beneficiary of or involved in any way with any misappropriation of funds or theft of money from Bolt’s account or that of any other SSL clients’ accounts.\n\nHarding is among three former directors of the shuttered SSL who have been charged with offences including fraudulently inducing persons to invest money, a breach of section 28 of the Larceny Act; failure to register company carrying on business in Jamaica (Companies Act, section 363); carrying on securities business without dealer’s licence (Securities Act, section 7); failure to apply to the commission to be registered for securities issued (Securities Act, section 26); and breach of section 22A of the Banking Services Act.\n\nThe other two are SSL founder Hugh Croskery and his daughter, Sarah Meany.\n\nREAD: Three former SSL directors slapped with multiple charges\n\nIn her statement, Samuels-Brown said official records from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) will confirm that during his tenure, “Harding prioritised legal and regulatory compliance.”\n\nSamuels-Brown said her client maintained open communication with regulators, adhered to their directives and acted under the guidance of reputable legal counsel and independent external auditors. She said he also proactively engaged the FSC, implemented clear corrective plans and worked under their ongoing oversight to address long-standing issues that existed before his involvement with SSL.\n\n“As these matters are now before the court, we will not comment further on any specific evidentiary details and await the dispensation of justice through the courts. In the interim, we strongly caution against the continuation of spreading misinformation,” the attorney said, adding “This in no way helps in achieving fair resolution and justice. We urge all parties to allow the justice system to function based on facts, rather than unverified assertions and assumptions.”\n\nShe also noted that her client was not arrested in any pre-dawn raid as has been reported by some media outlets.\n\nSee full statement:\n\n“On the afternoon of December 27, 2025, Mr Zachary Harding voluntarily attended the offices of the Financial Investigations Division (FID), accompanied by his attorney-at-law, Jacqueline Samuels-Brown, KC.\n\nSince the issues at Stocks & Securities Limited (SSL) first came to light in 2023, Mr Harding communicated with the police through his attorney, assuring them of his availability and willingness to assist with any investigations. His attendance at the FID was in keeping with that position, as he has always acted in compliance with the law and with the highest level of integrity.\n\nDespite certain media reports, Mr Harding was not arrested in any “pre-dawn raid”. The proceedings and question and answer session mark the first time in three years that Mr Harding has been interviewed by any investigative body.\n\nIn light of recent developments, we wish to clarify the following critical points: Based on the questioning and information provided by investigators, there was no allegation that Mr Harding was the beneficiary of, or involved in any way with any misappropriation of funds or theft of money from Usain Bolt’s account or that of any other SSL clients’ accounts. Official records from the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) will confirm that during his tenure, Mr Harding prioritised legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nHe maintained open communication with regulators, adhered to their directives and acted under the guidance of reputable legal counsel and independent external auditors.

The talks at Trump's Mar-a-lago club on Sunday aimed to flesh out the final stages of a Russian-Ukrainian peace deal almost four years after the conflict began. Trump and Zelensky seemed to reach a sticking point and the issue of land was raised. \"I think the land you're talking about, some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you're better off making a deal.\" The US's sympathy towards Russia seems to be taken as a victory in Moscow. State media labelled the summit as a win for Putin, with broadcaster Vladimir Solovyov saying that Moscow is delighted with how the meeting went. He claimed it was all part of his country's plan, speaking on his evening show. \"We have achieved a knockout victory, we prepared on a grandmaster's level on all the main points and it worked.\" \"Everything was extremely precise, and of course Zelensky started to melt, he melted down.\" Solovyov claimed that a call between Washington and Moscow occurred shortly before Zelensky landed, which \"completely destroyed Zelensky’s plans\". The broadcaster's statements provide insight into the optimism within the Kremlin that this deal be useful to Russia, but needs to be taken with a grain of salt. Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine , a non-profit that delivers humanitarian aid to war-torn Ukrainians, raised concerns over Trump's approach. \"This treats Putin as a co-partner whose approval is needed, signalling to Kyiv that peace will come on Moscow's terms – not international law,\" Boyechko said. Concerns rose at the joint press conference. Trump said Putin \"wants to see the war end\" and was \"very generous\" towards Ukraine succeeding. The US President even pledged Russian help with reconstruction via cheap energy and electricity. This is not the first time tensions sparked between Trump and Zelensky.

But in several media interviews after the strikes, he pushed back on the framing of the country’s security issues as being about religion.\n\nReferring to his discussion with Rubio, he said it was agreed that statements by the two governments “would show clearly that it is a strike against terrorism … and that it is not to do with religion, but is to do with protecting Nigerians and innocent lives.”\n\n“When you try to reduce it to just say, ‘Oh, no, it’s Muslims killing Christians in Nigeria,’ you see how you can get it completely wrong. It’s a regional conflict,” he added.\n\nTrump had placed Nigeria as a country of particular concern over what he described as the mass killing of Christians.

We are implementing the America First Global Health Strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Ivory Coast committed to eventually providing up to $292m to health funding by 2030, Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugre Mambe said.\n\nThe deal is the largest of the more than a dozen other arrangements the Trump administration has reached so far under the new strategy.\n\nDeep USAID cuts earlier this year have disrupted public health services across the world, with Africa particularly hard-hit.\n\nThat has sparked concerns about the potential increase of the spread of HIV on the continent, declines in maternal and child healthcare, spikes in Malaria cases, and reduced early detection of new infectious diseases.\n\nWhile the Ivory Coast deal and other new bilateral agreements seek to address these areas, public health experts have been wary about the administration’s approach.\n\nAn analysis by the Center for Global Development earlier this month said that the new strategy outlines several potentially beneficial changes to foreign health assistance delivery.\n\nHowever, these changes “carry tremendous risks to service delivery and hard-won public health gains”, senior analyst Jocilyn Estes and policy fellow Janeen Madan Keller wrote.\n\nThe pair identified several potential areas of risk, including public health priorities possibly being shaped by “transactional pressures”, questions over oversight, and a lack of clarity on how services will be protected if a partner country is unable to meet its commitments.\n\nThe experts further questioned what the strategy would mean for aid in areas where there is no “credible or stable government”.\n\n“Operationalising a reconfigured approach to US global health assistance – particularly direct government assistance – at this scale and speed is unprecedented”, they wrote, adding that “each potential point of failure risks lives”.","url":"https://stkittsgazette.com/us-and-ivory-coast-sign-480m-deal-as-part-of-america-first-aid-strategy/","image":"https://stkittsgazette.com/app/uploads/2025/12/ap_69544708d9c18-1767130888-BauRJi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:06:18","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kn","sentiment":0.054},{"id":390201296,"title":"India Imposes Tariff On Steel Products For 3 Years To Curb Cheap Imports","text":"India has imposed a three-year import tariff of between 11% and 12% on some steel products, according to a finance ministry order published on Tuesday, as the government aims to curb cheap shipments from China.The levy, locally known as a safeguard duty, will be imposed at 12% in the first year followed by 11.5% in the second year and then 11% in the third year.The measure, which was published on the official government gazette, excludes imports from certain developing countries, though China, Vietnam, and Nepal will be subject to the levy.

With a favorable map, a three-seat majority, and Vice President JD Vance as the tie-breaker, Democrats would need to net four seats to flip the chamber—an undeniably steep climb.\n\nThe challenge is obvious: Democrats must defend an open seat in Michigan and a toss-up seat in Georgia while also trying to unseat at least three Republicans, which would require wins in states President Donald Trump carried in 2024. \n\nYet, oddly enough, the mood in Democratic circles is optimistic. Party strategists point to a strong recruiting class, recent statewide wins, and the possibility that the political environment could shift further in their favor.\n\nTime isn’t exactly on anyone’s side. The 2026 general election may feel distant, but the fight for Senate control is less than a year away. With that in mind, here’s a rundown of the races that we think will define the battle for the majority.\n\nGeorgia (D)\n\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff remains Democrats’ most endangered incumbent, and Republicans are gearing up to pour tens of millions into defeating him.\n\nBut the GOP’s path got messier the moment Gov. Brian Kemp decided not to run, leaving a vacuum that quickly filled with Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nAnd Kemp has only complicated things since then, throwing his weight behind Dooley instead of either lawmaker—and triggering what’s expected to be a volatile primary.\n\n“Primaries tend to get competitive,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in November, regarding the brewing intraparty fight. “But we still think in Georgia, once the dust settles there and the smoke clears, that that’s gonna be a really good opportunity for us.”\n\nOssoff, meanwhile, is sitting on a formidable war chest and charting his own path. He voted against the deal to reopen the government, a move that suggests he’s betting on keeping progressive voters firmly in his corner heading into what’s likely to be one of the most expensive races of the cycle.\n\nFew primaries have exploded as quickly as the emerging Democratic fight in Maine, where the party is aiming to unseat Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nGov. Janet Mills entered the race in October, after months of behind-the-scenes recruiting by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But her path to the nomination isn’t guaranteed. Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran backed by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, has stormed the contest, quickly capturing attention and momentum.\n\nThe question now is whether Platner’s surge can last—or if it will fizzle under scrutiny. His campaign has faced blowback over a tattoo he had resembling a Nazi symbol, which he has since had covered up, as well as a series of offensive posts on Reddit.\n\nWhile that may leave Mills as the steadier option for Democrats, she comes with her own complications. She is 77 years old and running for a six-year term at a time when many in the party are calling for generational change.\n\nStill, Maine’s political landscape offers Democrats reason for cautious optimism. Collins’ approval ratings have slipped since her previous reelection, and the state favored former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 percentage points in 2024.\n\nEven so, Collins remains a formidable incumbent, making this a challenging—and closely watched—race for Democrats in 2026.\n\nNorth Carolina (Open R)\n\nRepublicans are bracing to defend an open Senate seat in North Carolina after Sen. Thom Tillis announced his retirement in June, citing clashes with Trump over the president’s tax and spending law. And Tillis’ exit has given Democrats a real opening.\n\nInto that breach steps former Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrats’ top recruit for 2026. Cooper formally launched his campaign in July, and his statewide track record is impeccable, winning all six of the previous statewide contests he’s run in. And so far, polls acknowledge that Cooper, with his far higher name recognition, is the early favorite.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has entered the fray. Endorsed by Trump, Whatley is unlikely to face a costly primary, though he may face other obstacles. He is not as well-known as Cooper, and he lacks a distinctive political brand, which could easily hamper his candidacy in a year not expected to favor Republicans.\n\nThat said, the Tar Heel State remains competitive. Trump carried it in all three of the most recent presidential elections. But with Tillis gone and Cooper in the race, the GOP’s grip on the seat is showing early signs of slipping.\n\nNew Hampshire (Open D)\n\nDemocrats face a key defensive battle after three-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she would retire. The seat opens the door to a familiar lineup of candidates in a state that has leaned Democratic in recent presidential cycles.\n\nIn a quirky twist, the GOP primary pits two former senators against each other: John E. Sununu, who lost this seat to Shaheen in 2008, and Scott Brown, who previously served in Massachusetts. \n\nSununu has consolidated support within the party, reflecting the broader effort to coalesce around a single candidate. A November poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center suggests he is the GOP’s strongest option for the general election.\n\nStill, challenges remain. A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state since the 2000 election. And whoever wins the Republican primary will likely face Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, a candidate with deep family roots in the state and a record of winning tough races. Polls currently show Pappas holding a slight edge against Sununu and a large one against Brown. If elected, Pappas would become the first out gay man in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who is popular, will also be up for reelection in 2026, which could complicate Democrats’ path to victory. \n\nIn an open race, anything is possible.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrats have secured the recruit they wanted most: former Sen. Sherrod Brown.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Brown survived two grueling reelection fights even as Ohio drifted rightward at the presidential level. In 2018, he beat GOP Rep. Jim Renacci by nearly 7 points in a state that Trump had carried two years earlier and would carry again two years later. But Brown’s run ended last cycle, when he lost to now-Sen. Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown is attempting a comeback against Sen. Jon Husted, whom Republican Gov. Mike DeWine appointed to fill Vance’s seat after he became vice president. Both Brown and Husted are cruising through their primaries, setting up what is sure to be an expensive showdown in the general election.\n\nHusted, armed with Trump’s endorsement, hauled in $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2025—“the highest amount ever raised by a Republican candidate at this stage of a U.S. Senate race in Ohio,” his team boasted. But Brown’s fundraising dwarfed it: He pulled in a massive $8 million in just six weeks.\n\nWhoever wins in 2026 will serve only the remaining two years of Vance’s term and will also have to face voters in 2028 for a full six-year term.\n\nMichigan (Open D)\n\nMichigan is once again shaping up as a major battleground. The state narrowly backed Trump in 2024, and its Senate seat is now open after Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced he would not run again.\n\nDemocrats are bracing for a competitive primary that spans the party’s ideological range. Four-term Rep. Haley Stevens is seen as the establishment favorite, while state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and progressive organizer Abdul El-Sayed are pitching themselves as candidates who can break out of that mold.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have consolidated support early. Trump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers for his second Senate run, after losing a razor-thin race to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin in 2024. Rogers, an Army veteran, is pro-tariff and doesn’t want the government negotiating drug prices to make them cheaper.\n\nHowever, despite Trump winning Michigan twice, that success hasn’t translated downballot. Michigan has been a Senate mirage for the GOP, which hasn’t won a seat there in more than three decades.\n\nFor now, Michigan is one of the true toss-ups on the map—an open question in a state that rarely makes anything easy.","summary":"The 2026 Senate midterms should be Republicans’ to lose.

The commission, which Congress chartered, reviews development on federal land in the Washington area.\n\nThe ballroom proposal, which Trump has said would cost US$400 million and be larger than the existing White House structure, has become a flashpoint. Preservation groups have taken the plan to court, while Democratic lawmakers argue it represents an abuse of presidential power and are probing which donors may be backing the project.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe commission is chaired by Will Scharf, a White House aide and former personal lawyer to Trump. To date, it has declined to review the demolition of the former East Wing, preparatory work at the site, or the project's potential effects on historic properties — a position that critics say clears the way for the most significant alteration to the White House complex in decades.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit chartered by Congress, is suing to stop construction. It argues that the proposed 90,000-square-foot (8,360-square-metre) ballroom would overwhelm the rest of the White House, which covers about 55,000 square feet.\n\nEarlier this month, a judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order halting work on the project. In the ruling, the judge cited the fact that the ballroom's size, scale, and other specifications have not yet been finalized.

That process will examine issues such as sightlines, public space, and landscaping, and will allow members of the public to submit comments or testify during hearings.\n\nFor now, the January presentation is expected to provide the clearest picture yet of a project that has already sparked legal battles, political scrutiny, and debate over how far a sitting president can go in reshaping one of the nation's most historic buildings.","url":"https://www.unitedkingdomnews.net/news/278776930/plans-for-trump-s-usd400-million-white-house-ballroom-head-to-review","image":"https://image.chitra.live/api/v1/wps/1ed76e6/d3ec7f1e-16da-46c6-996f-9786e7d20383/2/white-house-600x315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:00:00","author":"Will Scharf","authors":["Will Scharf"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":390196304,"title":"Russian state media claims Trump-Zelensky talks as 'knockout victory' for Moscow","text":"Russian state media has claimed a victory over Ukraine after a meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to flesh out the final stage of the Russian-Ukrainian peace deal. The meeting at Trump's Mar-a-lago estate on Sunday and was billed as a push towards ending the nearly four-year conflict with Russia . The leaders seemed to reach a sticking point with some \"thorny issues\" still to be ironed out. Land was a talking point for the parties. \"I think the land you're talking about, some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you're better off making a deal.\" America's Russian sympathy seems to be taken as a victory in Moscow as state media labelled the summit as a win for Putin. Russian broadcaster Vladimir Solovyov said Moscow is delighted with how the meeting went and claimed it was all part of his country's plan. \"We have achieved a knockout victory, we prepared on a grandmaster's level on all the main points and it worked,\" Solovyov said, speaking on his evening show. \"Everything was extremely precise, and of course Zelensky started to melt, he melted down.\" Solovyov claimed that a call between Washington and Moscow took place shortly before the Ukrainian president landed. He said Trump's call with Moscow \"completely destroyed Zelensky’s plans,\" arguing that he didn’t even need to get off the plane. The broadcaster's statements need to be taken with a grain of salt, but do provide insight into the optimism within the Kremlin for this deal to be beneficial to Russia. Many in Kyiv are concerned following the talk. CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine Yuriy Boyechko said Trump's approach as dangerously detached from reality. \"This treats Putin as a co-partner whose approval is needed, signalling to Kyiv that peace will come on Moscow's terms – not international law,\" said the founder of the non-profit that delivers humanitarian aid to war-torn Ukrainians Concerns escalated at the joint press conference. Trump said Putin \"wants to see the war end\" and was \"very generous\" towards Ukraine succeeding. The US President even pledged Russian help with reconstruction via cheap energy and electricity. Tensions rose between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office in February this year. The Ukrainian leader joined Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance to sign a deal on sharing his country's mineral resources. However, Zelensky left empty-handed after a shouting match in which Trump said he was being \"disrespectful\" for pushing for security guarantees.","summary":"Russian broadcaster Vladimir Solovyov said Moscow is delighted with how a meeting between United States President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodimir Zelensky went and claimed it was all part of his country's plan","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-state-media-claims-trump-36476752","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36475077.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/3_President-Donald-Trump-Hosts-Visiting-Ukrainian-President-Zelensky-At-Mar-a-Lago.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 23:48:28","author":"Oliver Radcliffe,Tannur Anders","authors":["Oliver Radcliffe","Tannur Anders"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":390205570,"title":"Trump suffers setback in bid to strip protected status from hundreds","text":"President Donald Trump was handed another court loss on Tuesday after a federal judge temporarily halted his bid to strip 300 South Sudanese nationals of protected status, according to a new report. \n\nThe Associated Press reported on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Massachusetts issued an order prohibiting the administration from deporting the nationals, which she argued would cause them \"irreparable harm.\" \n\n“These significant and far-reaching consequences not only deserve, but require, a full and careful consideration of the merits by the Court,” Kelley wrote. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials blasted the judge's order. \n\n“Yet another lawless and activist order from the federal judiciary who continues to usurp the President’s constitutional authority,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X. \"Under the previous administration Temporary Protected Status was abused to allow violent terrorists, criminals, and national security threats into our nation.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump was handed another court loss on Tuesday after a federal judge temporarily halted his bid to strip 300 South Sudanese nationals of protected status, according to a new report. \n\nThe Associated Press reported on Tuesday that U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Massachusetts issued an order prohibiting the administration from deporting the nationals, which she argued would cause them \"irreparable harm.\" \n\n“These significant and far-reaching consequences not only deserve, but require, a full and careful consideration of the merits by the Court,” Kelley wrote. \n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials blasted the judge's order. \n\n“Yet another lawless and activist order from the federal judiciary who continues to usurp the President’s constitutional authority,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X.  \"Under the previous administration Temporary Protected Status was abused to allow violent terrorists, criminals, and national security threats into our nation.\"\n\nRead the entir","url":"https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674838367/","image":"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-christmas.jpg?id=62632883&width=1200&height=1200&coordinates=333%2C0%2C334%2C0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 23:48:27","author":"Robert Davis","authors":["Robert Davis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.235},{"id":390199012,"title":"Trump administration says it's freezing child care funds to Minnesota after series of fraud schemes","text":"President Donald Trump's administration announced on Tuesday that it’s freezing child care funds to Minnesota after a series of fraud schemes in recent years.Acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Jim O’Neill announced on the social platform X that the step is in response to “blatant fraud that appears to be rampant in Minnesota and across the country.”“We have turned off the money spigot and we are finding the fraud,” he said.RELATED STORY | Federal fraud raids in Minnesota largely target Somali American suspectsO’Neill said all payments through the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, will require “justification and a receipt or photo evidence” before money is sent.
