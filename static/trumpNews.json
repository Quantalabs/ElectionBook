The buzz started quietly, but when an anonymous Reddit user—claiming to be an experienced radar operator with ties to a major US agency—linked the mysterious drones to secretive military operations, the story took a thrilling, and rather unsettling, turn.Radar operator's cryptic reportThe Reddit post, which quickly went viral, was a detailed report from someone identifying as a 25-year veteran radar operator for a large agency. The anonymous user dropped a bombshell: the drones were part of a covert operation led by the US Space Force. The post described military drills that included \"full lockout\" scenarios—where military control temporarily overrides civilian communications and radar. According to the user, these drills are scheduled to continue intermittently until Christmas Eve.But that’s not all. The report also claims that unannounced satellite launches have been occurring since October, raising eyebrows about the secrecy surrounding these activities. Some suggested that a secret \"big show\" could be planned for the public in the coming weeks. Add to that the eerie rumor of a CNN crew filming a mysterious, unreleased article after allegedly being spotted near one of the satellite launches, and the situation grows even more bizarre.Conspiracy theories take flightAs if the story weren’t strange enough, the online conspiracy theorists jumped in. One user linked the sightings to Project Blue Beam, an infamous theory dating back to the 1990s. According to proponents, this project allegedly involves governments using advanced holographic technology to simulate a celestial event or even an alien invasion—creating a perfect pretext for a one-world government.— JavaChop (@JavaChop) “Look for videos of drones transforming from balls of light to planes,” one commenter warned, suggesting that the drones could be part of a covert plan to simulate something much larger. Speculation about the government orchestrating such an event swirled, with some hinting that a new world order might be on the horizon.— pillsabung (@pillsabung) — JavaChop (@JavaChop) — JavaChop (@JavaChop) What is Project Blue Beam?Project Blue Beam was first proposed by conspiracy theorist Serge Monast in the 1990s, alleging that a global conspiracy was aiming to control humanity through staged \"miracles\" and celestial phenomena. The theory outlines four goals:Abolishing traditional religions to create a single world religion.Replacing national identities with a unified global identity.Breaking down traditional family structures to foster collective allegiance to a global authority.Using “miraculous” events, including simulated extraterrestrial encounters, to manipulate the masses.Though widely dismissed by critics as unsubstantiated paranoia, Project Blue Beam continues to be a focal point for those suspicious of government secrecy and military activities.Silence from authoritiesSo far, the federal government and military agencies have remained tight-lipped about the recent drone sightings and alleged training exercises. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) nor any military branch has issued an official statement, leaving room for the conspiracy theories to flourish unchecked.Trump weighs in US President-elect Donald Trump has also weighed in on the mystery. Taking to his Truth Social account, Trump voiced his concerns over the drones, calling for swift government action: \"Mystery drone sightings all over the country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge? I don’t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!! DJT.\"The President-elect's comments have only added fuel to the fire, escalating the already-heightened public interest in the situation. Are these drones part of a routine military exercise, or is something bigger—something far more extraordinary—at play?","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-jerseys-drone-mystery-military-drills-or-is-it-project-blue-beam-in-action/articleshow/116304567.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116304592/116304592.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 01:15:03","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.074},{"id":273042020,"title":"Trump slams Biden administration on unexplained drones mystery: 'Shoot them down or ...

The unusual thing seen in the skies of New Jersey and around the country has become the town's new buzz, and now the President-elect has also commented on it. Taking his Truth Social account, Trump said, \"Mystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government’s knowledge. I don’t think so!

Dawn Fantasia, the objects are \"six feet in diameter\" and operate in coordination with lights off.Yesterday, White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed the case of the possibility of an Iranian \"mothership\" being responsible and said that the Coast Guard has confirmed that there is no evidence of any foreign-based involvement from coastal vessels.In a presser, Kirby said, \"We have no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or a public safety threat or have a foreign nexus. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI are investigating these sightings, and they’re working closely with state and local law enforcement to provide resources, using numerous detection methods to better understand their origin.\"Earlier, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh stated, \"There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there's no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\"She further noted there is \"no evidence\" suggesting foreign adversary involvement.While the Pentagon denies foreign involvement, the FBI has expressed concern about their limited knowledge. During a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, FBI Assistant Director Robert Wheeler acknowledged uncertainty about potential risks.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-slams-biden-administration-on-unexplained-drones-mystery-shoot-them-down-or-/articleshow/116304097.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116304315/116304315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 01:15:03","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.42},{"id":273041652,"title":"Court Refuses To Pause TikTok Ban As Case Heads To Supreme Court","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nA federal appeals court refused Friday to put its ruling upholding the federal ban on TikTok on hold while the company appeals to the Supreme Court, giving TikTok only weeks to secure a favorable ruling from the Supreme Court before the ban takes effect January 19.\n\nTalia Cadet, TikTok creator and advocate, uses a phone outside of the U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. ...

Circuit declined to pause its ruling upholding the federal government’s law requiring TikTok to divest from Chinese parent company ByteDance or else be banned from U.S. app stores, after TikTok asked for the court to halt the ruling while the company requested the Supreme Court to take up the case.\n\nTikTok argued it was necessary to pause the ruling in order to give the Supreme Court time to rule on the case without being “hasty,” also arguing that not pausing the law and letting it take effect on Jan. 19 as scheduled would irreparably harm the company and its 170 million U.S. users.\n\nTemporarily stopping the law from taking effect would also allow the incoming Trump administration to weigh in on the legal dispute, TikTok argued, as reports suggest Trump wants to “halt” the ban—though it’s still unclear how he would do so.\n\nThe federal government opposed the law being paused, arguing that both sides asked the D.C. Circuit to rule by early December specifically so there would be time to appeal a ruling to the Supreme Court—eliminating the need for additional time.\n\nIn Friday's ruling, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Appeals Court affirmed the initial decision that said protecting Americans from foreign security threats outweighs TikTok's First Amendment rights.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nIf the Supreme Court will take up the case. ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company, has not yet filed its appeal and it’s unclear if the justices will agree to take up the case at all, let alone if they will issue a decision by the Jan. 19 deadline.\n\nWhat Happens If The Tiktok Ban Takes Effect?\n\nIf the federal law banning TikTok takes effect—either on January 19 or later—it would prohibit companies like Apple and Google that control U.S. app stores from allowing TikTok on their stores, and block internet service providers like Oracle, which hosts TikTok’s user data, from enabling TikTok’s “distribution, maintenance, or updating.” That means that in addition to Americans no longer being able to download or update the TikTok app, companies could no longer “provid[e] the services that enable the TikTok platform to function, effectively shutting down TikTok in the United States,” TikTok said in a court filing. TikTok could also try to divest from ByteDance, which would allow it to keep operating, and President Joe Biden or President-elect Donald Trump could grant a 90-day extension under the law if TikTok shows it has started that divestment process. TikTok has so far refused to divest, however, claiming in its lawsuit that doing so is “not possible technologically, commercially, or legally.”\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nIf the TikTok ban takes effect and Oracle stops hosting the app’s U.S. user data, that could mean all the personal data would be , which Forbes in 2023 was what happened when the app shut down operations in India. That transfer would potentially make the data more available to the Chinese government, which is specifically what Oracle taking over hosting of the company’s U.S. data was specifically designed to avoid.\n\nCan Trump Stop The Tiktok Ban?\n\nTikTok has claimed that if Trump weighs into the lawsuit over the TikTok ban and says he opposes banning the app, it could negate the app’s need to have the Supreme Court review the ruling. But it’s not yet clear how Trump could singlehandedly save the app in a foolproof way. Former DOJ official Alan Rozenshtein wrote in an op-ed for Lawfare that Trump could lobby Congress to repeal the ban—which is unlikely, given the legislation’s bipartisan support—or direct his Justice Department not to enforce the ban. That might not be enough to sway Apple, Google and Oracle to just ignore the law and leave TikTok up, however, as they would face harsh financial penalties if Trump ever changed his mind. Trump could also simply declare that TikTok is in compliance with the law and has adequately divested from ByteDance—whether it actually has or not—Rozenshtein noted, though that would likely still leave room for lawsuits challenging that declaration. Trump’s administration could also try and negotiate with TikTok on a deal that would allow Trump to say the company is in compliance, Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, told the Associated Press, after the Biden administration previously rejected TikTok’s proposal for an agreement. It also remains to be seen if Trump could try and get TikTok to divest from ByteDance entirely, as James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told NPR that China may be more willing to approve a sale of TikTok to an American owner if Trump backs off his threat of high tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange.\n\nKey Background\n\nBiden signed the law requiring TikTok to divest in April, following widespread concerns from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about national security issues involving the popular app. The government’s evidence for why it is necessary to ban TikTok was redacted from court filings and not released publicly, but Forbes has reported on numerous concerns involving the app, including including TikTok spying on journalists, tracking “sensitive” words, promoting Chinese propaganda criticizing U.S. politicians and mishandling user data. TikTok has denied all allegations of wrongdoing or blamed allegations on individual bad actors, and has long denied any links to the Chinese government. The social media company and creators on the app filed lawsuits against the ban days after it was signed into law, and the D.C. Circuit issued its ruling upholding the law on December 6. While TikTok argued the law violated the First Amendment rights of the company and its users, panel of appeals court judges ruled that it didn’t—because people can still say whatever they want on TikTok if it just divests from ByteDance—and the federal government was justified in banning it. By allowing TikTok to still operate as long as it divests from ByteDance, the law is actually the least restrictive way of handling the government’s concerns about the company, the judges ruled.\n\nFurther Reading\nForbesHow To Save Your Favorite TikTok Videos—Ahead Of Possible Ban Next MonthBy Mary Whitfill RoeloffsForbesTikTok Asks To Pause Ban Until Supreme Court—And Trump—Weigh InBy Alison DurkeeForbesTikTok Ban Upheld In CourtBy Alison DurkeeForbesWhy A Powerful U.S. Court Thinks The TikTok Ban Doesn’t Violate The 1st AmendmentBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesCloud Companies Like Oracle, Amazon And Microsoft Would Lose Millions To A TikTok BanBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesApple And Google Scramble To Face Their Role As TikTok Ban EnforcersBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesCongress Warns Apple And Google They Must Ban TikTok In JanuaryBy Emily Baker-WhiteForbesIf TikTok Is Banned, Americans’ Data Could End Up Back In ChinaBy Emily Baker-White\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

next year.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken unveiled the “significant package of urgently needed weapons and equipment” on Thursday, which will include High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, ammunition, drones and armoured vehicles.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s election victory last month could lead to drastic cuts in US military aid for Ukraine, a prospect that has led the current administration to rush through billions of dollars in already authorised assistance before he takes office.\n\nThe new assistance followed closely on the heels of a $988m security assistance package and a $725m weapons package announced earlier this month.\n\nAfter Thursday’s package, Biden will still have access to about $5.6bn of Presidential Drawdown Authority to rush weapons from US stocks to the front lines without congressional approval.\n\nNational Security spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that Biden would “continue to provide additional packages right up to the end of this administration”.\n\nThe aid comes at a critical stage of the war, with Moscow’s troops closing in on the key city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region after a months-long push.\n\nUkraine’s military said in recent days that Russian troops destroyed or captured several Ukrainian positions near the city.\n\nThe fall of Pokrovsk, an important logistics centre for the Ukrainian military, would be one of Ukraine’s biggest military losses in months.\n\nIn parallel, Ukraine’s air force reported on Friday that Russia had launched a massive barrage of missiles and drones at its energy facilities during the morning rush hour, with power company Yasno reporting that around a half of its 3.5 million consumers were left without power.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry, cited by Russian state news agency Interfax, said on Friday that it had carried out the large-scale assault – the 12th this year targeting the power grid – in retaliation for this week’s Ukrainian attack on a military airfield in the southern Rostov region using long-range Army Tactical Missile System missiles supplied by the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday that he had discussed with French President Emmanuel Macron the possibility of stationing foreign troops in Ukraine in case of a ceasefire.\n\nDuring a visit to Warsaw, Macron called for a path out of Russia’s war in Ukraine taking into account the interests of both Kyiv and the European Union, saying the former’s sovereignty and the latter’s security were at stake.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Thursday said, “We need peace in Ukraine in order to have peacekeeping missions.\n\n“For that we need Russia to stop shelling, which they are not doing,” she added, before a meeting of foreign ministers in Berlin. “Before that, we have nothing to talk

three years on December 13 at a time when the decentralized network is benefiting from significant visibility and rising adoption.\n\nThe digital asset climbed to $30.94, according to Binance data from TradingView.\n\nThe cryptocurrency experienced some very impressive gains in the months leading up to this local zenith, after trading below $10.00 as recently as September, additional figures provided by Binance and reported by TradingView reveal.\n\nJacob Joseph, senior research analyst for CCData, shed some light on this compelling appreciation.\n\n“The Chainlink token has seen a remarkable rise in the last month, rising 286% since the US elections to reach a multi-year high of $30.9 today,” he said via emailed comments.\n\n“The token's recent surge in price action appears to be driven by the shift in sentiment, spurred by Donald Trump's DeFi project, World Liberty Financial, accumulating nearly 80,000 LINK tokens and integrating the Chainlink standard into their platform,” Joseph clarified.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nMicrosoft Warns 400 Million Windows Users—Do Not Update Your PC\n\niOS 18.2—Update Now Warning Issued To All iPhone Users\n\nThe Game Awards 2024 Live

digital assets by institutional players,” he stated.\n\n“Chainlink oracles have been leveraged by central banks, financial institutions, and payment networks like SWIFT in their blockchain experiments. As the leading provider of oracle solutions, Chainlink is best positioned to capitalise on the age of tokenisation, which the likes of Larry Fink have hailed as the future of financial markets,” said Joseph.\n\nthe TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O also weighed in, offering some thoughts on key developments that have coincided with the LINK token’s recent strength.\n\n“Chainink has been making long term utility moves while meme coins have taken the spotlight,” she stated through email.\n\n“On 11/14/2024 World Liberty Finance, the Web3 platform President Elect Trump is advising for announced it would be adopting the Chainlink model utilizing their oracles to fuel and secure DeFi,” the prominent crypto analyst noted.\n\n“On 12/12/2024 Look On Chain posted via X, that World Liberty Finance bought 41,335 at $24.20, shortly after we saw LINK run to ~$31.

TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to “save” the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign.\n\nAttorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.\n\nThe statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing’s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government’s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.\n\nIn the request filed last week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a “modest delay” in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could “determine its position” on the matter.\n\nIf the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.\n\nThe Justice Department had opposed TikTok’s request for a pause, saying in a court filing last week that the parties had already proposed a schedule that was “designed for the precise purpose” of allowing Supreme Court review of the law before it took effect.\n\nThe appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said.","summary":"Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of

until Supreme Court review","text":"A federal appeals court on Friday left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States, rejecting a request made by the company to halt enforcement until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge of the statute. \n\nAttorneys for TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. \n\nIt’s unclear if the nation's highest court will take up the case, though some legal experts have said they expect the justices to weigh in due to the types of novel questions it raises about social media, national security and the First Amendment. TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to “save” the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign. \n\nAttorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law. \n\nThe statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing’s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government’s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.\n\nIn the request filed last week, attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had asked for a “modest delay” in enforcement of the law so that the Supreme Court could review the case and the incoming Trump administration could “determine its position” on the matter.\n\nIf the law is not overturned, the two companies have said that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump takes office again. More than 170 million American users would be affected, the companies have said.\n\nThe Justice Department had opposed TikTok’s request for a pause, saying in a court filing last week that the parties had already proposed a schedule that was “designed for the precise purpose” of allowing Supreme Court review of the law before it took effect.\n\nThe appeals court issued its Dec. 6 ruling on the matter in line with that schedule, the Justice Department filing said.","summary":"A federal appeals court has left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-tiktok-supreme-court-donald-trump-bytedance-b2664283.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/06/15/TikTok_46845.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:57:35","author":"Haleluya Hadero","authors":["Haleluya Hadero"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.374},{"id":273042046,"title":"Ông Trump được chọn là nhân vật của năm","text":"Tổng thống đắc cử Mỹ Donald Trump có lần thứ 2 được tạp chí Time chọn là nhân vật của năm.\n\nTạp chí Time ngày 12.12 công bố Tổng thống đắc cử Mỹ Trump là nhân vật của năm.

Mr. Trump’s re-election, and subsequent return to office, have triggered curiosity and “nervousness” in many countries. However, in South Asia, he is likely to offer a distinct continuity. His ideology and foreign policy goals will continue to push for increased cooperation, collaboration, and consultation with India in South Asia even as his leadership style, decision-making nature, and management of great power politics will provide new opportunities and challenges.\r\n\nFactors in U.S.-India ties\r\n\nIndia and the United States have enjoyed an upward trajectory in their relationship since the beginning of the millennium. Acknowledging its leadership in the region, the U.S. even labelled India as a net-security provider in 2009. The Biden administration (2021-24) has emulated a similar outlook. With China’s increasing aggressiveness and assertiveness, India and the U.S. have strengthened their engagements and cooperation in South Asia. Through its Indo-Pacific strategy, the U.S. wants to supplement India’s regional leadership to counter China and maintain the values-based order. Its cooperation with India on the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) projects in Nepal and helping Sri Lanka out of its economic crisis, indicate this growing cooperation. Besides, Mr. Biden’s passive relations with Pakistan after withdrawing from Afghanistan helped India and the U.S. foster a mutual vision for the region.\r\n\nThe relationship has not been free of dissonance and divergences. New Delhi’s primary objective of cooperating with the U.S. is to push back against China and offer alternative development partnerships. However, the Biden administration has selectively scrutinised some countries on democracy and human rights under the pretext of upholding a values-based order and pushing back China. While India supported the Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh and pragmatically engaged with Myanmar’s junta, the U.S. pressured both regimes, including imposing targeted sanctions. This pressure nudged them closer to China. Similarly, sanctioning Indian firms for collaborating with Russia and accusations of corruption against the Adani Group has faltered two Indian projects in Sri Lanka, leaving India to face the brunt and consequences of the decisions.\r\n\nThere could be less irritants\r\n\nHowever, Mr. Trump’s return is likely to assuage these irritants. As in his first term, Mr. Trump has continued to hint at burden sharing, reciprocity, nationalism, and competing against China in his foreign policy. If Mr. Trump walks the talk, he will prioritise pushing back against China while giving less importance to human rights, democracy, and nation-building. He would also want India to take the lead in the region while the U.S. would supplement the same. This would leave less space for divergences and enhance collaborative policies between both countries. Another potential irritant between both countries was concerning their policies on Afghanistan and Pakistan. During his first term, Mr. Trump punished and cooperated with Pakistan and urged India to take an active role in finding a sustainable solution in Afghanistan. With the U.S.’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and Pakistan’s little strategic importance, this issue is of little dissonance now.\r\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump promoted capacity building, development assistance, defence agreements, and cooperation with the South Asian countries. This nature of assistance would continue, given his ambitions to counter China and supplement India. Mr. Trump’s little focus on democracy, nation-building, and human rights (like in his first term) would also benefit Sri Lanka, where a new government is still looking for economic assistance and exploring a lasting solution to the Tamil issue.\r\n\nThis approach could benefit Myanmar and the Taliban too, although it is unclear to what extent Washington would like to engage them. However, Bangladesh, which is undergoing a political transition under the new regime, will face challenges and a potential reduction in assistance.\r\n\nChina and the region\r\n\nMr. Trump’s confrontational approach to China will also put South Asian countries under more pressure. Given his erratic decisions, Washington will likely be less tolerant of South Asian countries’ agency and consistent playing of one great power against the other. Besides, the region’s consistent politicisation and ambiguity over investments, defence cooperation, and agreements will likely invite more pressure from the U.S. to seek reciprocity. However, his promise of bringing peace between Russia and Ukraine and resolving the crisis in West Asia (if successful) will help weakened South Asian economies to overcome their food and fuel inflationary pressures.\r\n\nAs the world braces for Trump 2.0, South Asia will not be immune to the broader structural shifts. Yet, the region is likely to see more continuity. With India and the U.S. likely to increase their cooperation in South Asia and bridge their divergences, Mr. Trump’s ideology, leadership style, and management of great power politics will have opportunities and challenges for the region. How South Asian countries will cope with the new administration, even as they balance China and India, is yet to be seen.\r\n\nHarsh V.

Be warned, once you detach from regular people in America, you will pay a price.'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's campaign, of course, went on to suffer a landslide defeat to Donald Trump when the American people took to the polls on November 5. \n\nHarris had branded herself as a forward-thinking leadership who could work across the aisle to address the American people's concerns, such as the cost of living. \n\nHowever, she underperformed in key demographics such as the black and Latino votes. \n\nMeanwhile, in the NBA, 'load management,' a trend popularized by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in 2010s, sees teams rest their stars during the regular season to keep them fresh for the playoffs. \n\nBefore the start of the season, Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid said he planned on never playing the second game of consecutive nights. Meanwhile, other NBA stars such as Kawhi Leonard, have routinely sat out games despite being healthy. \n\nWhile the league has tried to combat the trend by adding games-played incentives to contracts and barring players who haven’t played enough games from being eligible for major awards, it has sent a message to fans that the NBA and its players don't care about the regular season. \n\nIt comes as a blow to fans, especially those who fork out as much as $140 only to see their favorite players ride the bench. \n\nCowherd went on to liken the NBA to the NFL, highlighting the elements Commissioner Roger Goodell has successfully navigated in recent years in order to prosper in comparison to the floundering basketball league.\n\n'[The NFL] has got a connectability to the American Midwest and the regular people. If you look at the markets that are winning in his league, tiny Baltimore, Buffalo, Green Bay, Kansas City... connectability,' he added. \n\nDemocratsAmazonNBA\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNBA ratings are tanking because they made the same mistake as the Democrats did, Colin Cowherd claims\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Despite signing a 11-year, $76 billion TV deal this summer, the NBA's ratings have taken a severe hit over the past decade with figures plummeting even further this season.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nba/article-14191867/NBA-ratings-tanking-mistake-Democrats-Colin-Cowherd.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/12/14/00/93139257-0-image-a-26_1734137008578.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:54:59","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.486},{"id":273038570,"title":"Ukraine, Syria key focus of Biden talks with G7","text":"WASHINGTON — \n\nU.S. President Joe Biden met virtually with G7 leaders Friday to secure support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion, less than six weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, a skeptic of aid to Ukraine, is set to take office.\n\nThe talks followed Washington’s $20 billion disbursement earlier this week to a new World Bank fund that will provide economic support for Ukraine. The money is part of a new $50 billion loan for Kyiv from the Group of Seven democracies that will be paid back with interest income earned from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in G7 countries.\n\nEarlier this week Biden approved a new security assistance package for Ukraine that will provide Kyiv with additional air defense, artillery, drones, and armored vehicles — the 72nd such drawdown package announced by Washington since Russia’s invasion.\n\n“As the president made clear, we’re going to continue to provide additional packages right up until the end of this administration,” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said during a news briefing Thursday.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Biden will hand over power to Trump, who has been critical of using American taxpayers’ money to help Kyiv. Without providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war — a statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to capitulate.\n\n“We are likely to see the G7 redouble support for Ukraine in part because of concerns that President Trump may reduce support,” said William Courtney, adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corp, to VOA in an interview.\n\nAdditional sanctions on Russia appear to be in the works, Courtney told VOA.\n\nSyria aftermath\n\nG7 leaders also focused on fast-moving events related to the momentous transition of power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nOn Thursday , the leaders said in a statement they \"stand ready to support a transition process that leads to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance\" in Syria.\n\nSupport for the new government is conditional upon “respect for the rule of law, universal human rights, including women's rights, the protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic minorities, transparency and accountability,” the leaders’ statement said.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that toppled Assad, is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. Its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head. The U.S. and other G7 countries have signaled that HTS’ delisting from their terror list would be dependent upon how inclusive the new government would be.\n\nIn recent years, Jolani has distanced himself from extremist ideology. Since the rebels’ victory, he has sought to assure his non-sectarian stance to Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, which include Christians, Kurds, Druze and the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates.\n\nTrump has also signaled that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the Syrian conflict. “This is not our fight,\" Trump said on social media in response to Assad’s ouster. \"Let it play out. Do not get involved!”\n\nIt’s unclear whether a new U.S. administration would be able to maintain a hands-off approach that Trump said he wants. There are approximately 900 American troops stationed in Syria, and Washington has close ties with all of Syria’s neighbors including allies Turkey and Israel. Both are already making military maneuvers to secure their interests.\n\nTwo days after the Syrian rebels took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, Israel launched airstrikes across the country, further weakening what remains of the Assad regime’s military, once a stalwart-ally of Israel’s archnemesis, Iran. Since then, Israeli troops have advanced deeper into the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone separating the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syrian territory.\n\nThe United Nations said Israel’s actions violate the country’s 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Syria. The U.S. said it is in line with Israel’s right to self-defense, to avoid weapons falling into extremists’ hands amid a vacuum in power.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian Kurds near the northern border with Turkey have been displaced amid clashes between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Ankara-backed rebels. The U.S. brokered a ceasefire deal between the groups on Wednesday but it is unclear whether the fragile truce will hold.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are currently in the region for talks, hoping to ensure a smooth transition in Damascus and making a last-ditch diplomatic push to achieve a deal to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nKim Lewis contributed to this

Officials believe information procured could then be used to target others.\n\nMark Warner, the outgoing Democratic chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told the Washington Post that the infiltration was the “worst telecom hack in our nation’s history – by far”, adding: “The American people need to know.\n\n“This is an ongoing effort by China to infiltrate telecom systems around the world, to exfiltrate huge amounts of data.”\n\nSo far, however, the issue has gained little public traction, being overshadowed by last month’s election and Trump’s efforts to name members of his nascent administration following his victory.\n\nIt has elicited several meetings on Capitol Hill as Congress members and senators come to terms with yet another security breach in a year that has seen two failed assassination attempts against Trump and an apparently successful hack of his campaign by Iran, which was also engaged in a separate plot to kill him, according to security officials.\n\nSenators from both main parties were briefed about the scale of the problem by the FBI, CISA and Federal Communications Commission officials this month in a closed-door session that triggered expressions of anger.\n\n“The extent and depth and breadth of Chinese hacking is absolutely mind-boggling – that we would permit as much as has happened in just the last year is terrifying,” said Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic senator for Connecticut.\n\nFlorida senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state and a noted hawk on China, said: “It’s the most disturbing and widespread incursion into our telecommunications systems in the history of the world, not just the country, because of how massive our telecommunications systems is. This is as bad as it gets.”\n\nHis fellow Florida Republican, Rick Scott, blamed the agencies for failing to prevent the hack. “There’s no accountability in anybody sitting up there,” he told reporters. “They have not told us why they didn’t catch it, what they’ve done to prevent it.”\n\nJosh Hawley, a GOP senator for Missouri, called the hack “breathtaking”.\n\n“I think the American people need to know the extent of the breach here. I think they will be shocked at the extent of it,” he said. “I think they need to know about their text messages, their voicemail, their phone calls. It’s very bad, it’s very, very bad, and it is ongoing.”\n\nWhile the hack has yet to capture the popular imagination, news of its scale is certain to further complicate America’s tangled relationship with China, which Trump has threatened with tariffs while also signalling a wish for warmer ties with a highly unusual invitation to its president, Xi Jinping, to attend next month’s presidential inauguration.\n\nBrendan Carr, Trump’s nominee as head of the Federal Communications Commission, has pledged to work “with national security agencies through the transition and next year in an effort to root out the threat and secure our networks”.\n\n“Cybersecurity is going to be an incredibly important issue,” he told the Washington Post. “National security is going to be a top priority.”","summary":"Ongoing infiltration by Salt Typhoon group has hit US telecoms companies and Trump, Vance and Harris\n\nDemocrats and Republicans have come together in a rare moment of unity to condemn an espionage-driven Chinese infiltration of the US telecommunications system that has been called the worst hack in American history.\n\nCarried out by a group called Salt Typhoon that is believed to be linked to China’s communist regime, it has resulted in the infiltration of dozens of US telecoms companies and the data of senior political figures – including the president-elect, Donald Trump; the incoming vice-president, JD Vance; and Kamala Harris, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate – being stolen.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/13/democrats-republicans-condemn-salt-typhoon-hack","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef3dbaa3668a61d8873da74567a49247053f9dc8/0_0_4200_2522/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:35:17","author":"Robert Tait","authors":["Robert Tait"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.145},{"id":273035984,"title":"Trump ordered to sit for deposition in defamation suit against ABC News","text":"Washington — President-elect Donald Trump has been ordered by a federal judge to sit for a deposition next week in his defamation lawsuit against ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Americans abuzz over mysterious New Jersey sightings","text":"By MIKE CATALINI and HALLIE GOLDEN\n\nCHATHAM, N.J. — That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It’s unclear if it’s drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.\n\nCropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.\n\nThis week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what’s behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey’s new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.\n\nNEW YORK: Unidentified drones spotted flying at locations across NYC, including LaGuardia Airport\n\nBut perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies — none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they’re looking into what’s happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.\n\nSome theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump’s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.\n\nIn the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.\n\nThe Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones — let’s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.\n\nOne video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it’s otherworldly. “Straight up orbs,” the person says. Others weigh in to say it’s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)\n\nTrisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she’s glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.\n\n“I find myself — instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house — checking it,” she said.\n\nShe doesn’t buy what the governor said, that the drones aren’t a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose “a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”\n\n“How can you say it’s not posing a threat if you don’t know what it is?” she said. “I think that’s why so many people are uneasy.”\n\nThen there’s the notion that people could misunderstand what they’re seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.\n\nAustin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they’re looking at.\n\nNonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.\n\n“It represents the United States of America in 2024,” Austin said. “We’ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.”\n\nFederal officials echo Austin’s view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.\n\nThat’s not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.\n\nFor Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it’s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.\n\n“My main goal is I don’t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,” he said.\n\n“Whether or not it’s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I’m saying is it’s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,” he added.\n\nGolden reported form Seattle.","summary":"the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2024/12/13/drones-planes-or-ufos-americans-abuzz-over-mysterious-new-jersey-sightings/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Drone_Flights_New_Jersey_Buzz_22376.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:23:00","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":273033560,"title":"Biden takes credit for Syria&#x27;s demise in White House speech","text":"On Sunday, hours after news broke of the fall of the Assad regime, President Joe Biden delivered a nine-minute address on the situation in Syria. After praising Assad’s fall as “a fundamental act of justice” and “a moment of historic opportunity,” Biden went on to credit his administration for bringing the situation about.“For years, the main backers of Assad have been Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia, but over the last week, their support collapsed, all three of them, because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office.” While it is true that the current weakness of Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia in the region led to the toppling of Assad, Biden taking credit for this complex turn of events is disingenuous, to say the least. A more accurate assessment would be that the weakness of both Iran and Hezbollah is in spite of Biden’s policies, not because of them. Sanctions on IranAs president, Donald Trump placed crippling sanctions on Iran, making it almost impossible for them to sell their oil and petrochemical products. As a result, when Trump left office, the Iranian regime was nearly bankrupt and on the verge of collapse, with reportedly only $4 billion in cash reserves.Hamas, Hezbollah, and the other Iranian proxies were underfunded. Trump also ordered the assassination of Qasem Soleimani and pulled the US out of the disastrous nuclear deal that threatened the region and granted significant economic benefits to Tehran. The Islamic regime was never weaker.

(credit: BRANDON BELL/REUTERS/POOL)Immediately upon entering the White House, the Biden administration began working to undo these policies. They ceased enforcement of sanctions on the Iranian oil and petrochemical industry, leading Iran to sign a 25-year output deal with the Chinese Communist Party.l Profits from oil sales to China alone have accounted for an estimated over $100 billion since Biden took office. This total does not include tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief provided to Tehran under Biden. IT WAS revealed a few days ago that the Biden administration granted Iran an additional $10 billion in sanctions relief just days after the November 5 election. The administration also began negotiating with Iran to restart the nuclear deal. Flush with cash, the mullahs in Tehran were once again able to afford the luxury of funding Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and the rest of their global terror network. Ironically, it can be argued that Biden's administration policies did, in fact, lead to the weakening of Iran and Hezbollah, but not in the manner Biden suggests. After all, it is worth asking if Hamas and Hezbollah would have attacked Israel in the first place, had the Trump policies remained in place. More recently, since October 7, the Biden administration has repeatedly gone to great lengths to prevent the destruction of Hamas and Hezbollah.The demands on Israel not to enter Rafah and to allow vast quantities of humanitarian aid to be delivered into the hands of Hamas, the repeated calls for Israel not to invade Lebanon, and to limit the scope and scale of retaliatory strikes against Iran were all designed to prevent the defeat of Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. For Biden to now take credit for the weakening of Iran and Hezbollah is gaslighting at its finest. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now US military presence in SyriaLater in the speech, Biden spoke about how the US “maintained our military presence in Syria... ensuring that ISIS can never establish a safe haven there again.” He added that the US plans to help establish an “independent sovereign Syria with a new constitution and new government that serves all Syrians.” He also pledged US resources to rebuild the war-torn country.Listening to Biden makes one wonder if he is aware of just who the rebels who replaced Assad are. The rebel leader and presumptive ruler of Syria, Mohammad al-Julani, literally came up through the ranks of ISIS and Al-Qaeda, even serving for a time as personal assistant to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Julani’s group, Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) – which began as the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda, was officially added by the US State Department to the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in 2018, which also put a $10 million bounty on Julani’s head. For Biden to boast that his administration took steps to prevent ISIS from ever establishing itself in Syria while the country has been taken over by a jihadist who came up through the ranks of ISIS and Al-Qaeda is the height of absurdity. And hoping that these Sharia-seeking jihadists have any plans to set up a free and democratic society with a constitution is the height of delusion. Rather than taking credit for the downfall of Assad, Biden ought to apologize for fomenting so much death, chaos, and instability across the Middle East.

It just so happens that Tesla — whose CEO, Elon Musk, spent roughly a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump and down-ballot Republicans — reports far more of these accidents than other automakers.\n\n Tesla’s so-called “Full Self-Driving” feature, along with a more limited system called “Autopilot,” are at the core of Musk’s long-standing promise to make human drivers obsolete with cars that can autonomously (and safely) drive themselves anywhere, in any conditions. To that end, he has also teased a two-seat “Cybercab” without a steering wheel. But the company keeps failing to deliver on Musk’s optimistic predictions of when it might produce a car with such capabilities, and the existing FSD and Autopilot software must be supervised by an actual person, as it remains prone to dangerous mistakes. \n\n NHTSA has opened multiple investigations into the technology thanks to the information Tesla has been compelled to share with the regulator, including a probe launched two months ago to analyze whether FSD is reliable in fog, glaring sun, or other conditions of reduced roadway visibility. In one of the crashes that prompted this latest investigation, a pedestrian was struck and killed by a Tesla in Arizona. A previous NHTSA investigation concluded that FSD and Autopilot do not adequately ensure that drivers remain attentive. The results for the latest probe have not yet been made public. \n\n A standing general order from the agency requires all automakers to report certain collisions of vehicles with advanced driver-assistance systems. Tesla’s FSD and Autopilot are classified as Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, which means that crashes must be disclosed if these features were in use within 30 seconds of the crash and the accident “involved a vulnerable road user or resulted in a fatality, a vehicle tow-away, an air bag deployment, or any individual being transported to a hospital for medical treatment.” Through Oct. 15 of this year, Tesla has reported more than 1,500 crashes meeting these criteria. In a distant second is Honda, with more than 100 crashes. Tesla also accounts for 40 of the 45 fatal crashes reported to NHTSA under the rule.\n\n Now, a part of the Trump transition staff assigned to automotive policy is seeking to end that data collection — calling it “excessive,” per Reuters’ report — which would sharply curtail the regulator’s efforts to assess the safety of Tesla’s products. It’s not clear whether Musk or the company directly influenced this recommendation, but Tesla is known to oppose the requirement, which produces data that runs counter to its claims about engineering “the safest cars in the world.” Musk, for his part, has reportedly yelled and screamed at NHTSA officials over their investigations into Tesla’s driver-assistance software, at one point even threatening to sue the agency. \n\n Getting rid of NHTSA’s crash report requirement isn’t the only favor an incoming Trump administration could do for Tesla and the world’s richest man. The automaker is also currently the subject of a years-long Justice Department probe into how it has marketed FSD and Autopilot. If the DOJ finds that it deceived customers into believing the tech allowed vehicles to autonomously drive themselves, it could face charges of securities and wire fraud.

He needs to cut it out because we will fight that vigorously and its going to be a problem,” she told The Post.\n\n“Our mayor is completely out of touch with our own laws, what he can and cannot do,” she added, “and he is making the wrong call.”\n\nAyala recounted a case from before the ICE Rikers office closed in 2015 in which a youngster wrongly picked up for a murder was still threatened with deportation by the feds.\n\n“They released him and handed him over to ICE, and they take this kid — who has no connection to his home country, doesn’t even speak Spanish — but they were threatening to deport him,” she said. “This will only happen more.”\n\nFrequent Adams foil Councilman Lincoln Restler (D-Brooklyn) said a legal challenge will surely follow any attempt by the mayor to reopen the ICE office.\n\nHe also pointedly threw Adams’ own criminal indictment back in his face.\n\n“The last thing New York City needs is ICE in schools, shelters and jails advancing their mass deportation schemes,” he said. “It’s clear Mayor Adams is more interested in securing a pardon from the incoming Trump administration than protecting immigrant New Yorkers and upholding our sanctuary city laws.”\n\nAdams said he’ll direct his team to explore ways to reopen the ICE office at the lockup using an executive order, Homan said.\n\n“He would like us to [reopen the ICE office], but he said he’s got to talk to his legal staff about what’s the possibility of him doing that through executive order,” Homan said of Adams.\n\nEven if the ICE post on Rikers was reopened, agents would still be handcuffed with little power to snatch suspected migrant criminals under the de Blasio-era law. \n\nThe law bars federal immigration authorities from having offices on city Department of Correction grounds “for the purpose of investigating possible violations of civil immigration law.” \n\nA mayor can, using an executive order, greenlight a federal office on DOE property — but only “for purposes unrelated to the enforcement of civil immigration laws,” it states.\n\nHizzoner’s vow followed a push — first by Councilmember Bob Holden (D-Queens), then by ICE honchos — to reopen the immigration office on Rikers Island.\n\nRestoring the Rikers office would allow ICE officers to keep foreign-born criminal offenders behind bars before deportation, they argued. \n\nThe ICE office — assuming the mayor can reopen it — would only be able to handle cases where immigrants are held on a criminal detainer after a conviction.\n\nCouncilwoman Sandy Nurse (D-Brooklyn), who chairs the criminal justice committee overseeing Rikers, didn’t hold back on her disgust at the idea of reviving the ICE office.\n\n“Eric Adams is rolling out the red carpet for the Trump administration and its Project 2025 agenda, beginning with Trump’s destructive plan to tear apart families and abandon our immigrant community,” she said. \n\n“ICE already has the cooperation of the city as it relates to convicted individuals. This mayor is using the GOP’s fear-mongering tactics to serve his own interests and to escape his own dirty dealings. Perhaps he should just switch parties.”\n\nAdvocates with the New York Civil Liberties Union pointed to their statement likewise condemning the mayor’s willingness to help “Trump’s deportation machine.”\n\n“Adams is manufacturing a fake, sensationalist public safety crisis,” said Donna Lieberman, the NYCLU’s executive director. “In reality, as city data shows and the Mayor has bragged, public safety is actually improving, even with the increase in new arrivals.\n\n“Adams flirting with the idea of undermining well-established law is political posturing that caters to Trump’s cruelty.”\n\nThe stance that Adams is advancing Trump’s immigration agenda was echoed by Homan and sources familiar with their conversation.\n\n“They agreed if New York City changed, then the rest of the country will follow,” one source said.\n\nHoman went further, hinting that his sit-down with Adams paved the way for potential future meetings with mayors of sanctuary cities.\n\nThe incoming czar has been involved in a nasty spat with Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, who recently pledged to shield migrants in his sanctuary city from Trump’s mass deportation — and even said he’s willing to go to be arrested.\n\n“He’s willing to go to jail, I’m willing to put him in jail,” Homan told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.\n\nBehind-the-scenes, Homan told Adams that he was willing to use a federal statute that allows the feds prosecute any person or municipality that protects undocumented people against defiant sanctuary city mayors, sources told The Post.\n\nAfter the Adams’ olive branch, Homan said similar meetings with blue-city mayors could be in the offing.\n\n“I’m not gonna give them credit and call them out until I actually have a sit-down,” he said. “When we start talking and we actually set a meeting up, then I’ll talk about it, but until then I’m not gonna give them credit for talking about something they haven’t done yet.”\n\nHoman’s revelation about the ICE office came after Adams — in a combative news conference held after the highly-anticipated sit-down — declared he was eyeing an executive order to roll back some sanctuary city policies to keep New York City from becoming a “safe haven” for violent criminal migrants.\n\nBut the mayor largely kept silent on details aside from saying he’d aim to untangle laws and policies that restrict how the Big Apple can work with ICE.\n\n“I believed him yesterday and we left with the agreement that my staff will work with his staff on the details to get some of this stuff done, especially him writing the executive orders,” Homan told The Post.","summary":"Mayor Eric Adams told incoming border czar Tom Homan he wants to reopen the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office on Rikers Island &#8212; sparking swift outrage from immigration advocates and setting up an almost-certainly fierce fight with the City Council.

As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order said. TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19. The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then. But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers. TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when a panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\" TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app. Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok. But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though they won't be able to update it.","summary":"TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-ban-appeals-court-denies-delay/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/25/63461e9a-836c-40f8-835b-324b90b63ef3/thumbnail/1200x630g8/545c0c2c4cbf6f1231171b5e38e05baf/gettyimages-2151439676.jpg?v=564e83c5974b3893ba1bcac5fe5947af","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3387805_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:05:19","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":273036470,"title":"Cooper to meet Italian counterpart as Channel crossings continue","text":"The Home Secretary will travel to Italy for talks on irregular migration this weekend as hundreds of people continue to cross the Channel in small boats.\n\nYvette Cooper is set to meet her Italian counterpart, Matteo Piandetosi, along with the UN refugee agency’s representative to the country, Chiara Cardoletti, at the end of a week of diplomacy on migration.\n\nShe is also expected to attend the Atreju festival, an annual event organised by Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party, where she will speak alongside Mr Piandetosi on tackling migration across Europe.\n\nPrevious speakers at the event have included former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Hungarian prime minister Victor Orban and, in 2023, Rishi Sunak.\n\nMs Cooper’s trip to Rome comes as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats this year exceeded 34,500, a 19% increase on the same point in 2023.\n\nSome 609 people made the journey on Thursday, making it the busiest December day for crossings on record.\n\nThe visit also follows a meeting of the so-called Calais Group in London, where ministers and police from the UK, Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands agreed a plan to tackle people smuggling gangs in 2025.\n\nSeparately, the UK and Germany set out a joint plan earlier in the week on how to tackle people smugglers, with Berlin pledging to make it a clear criminal offence to “facilitate the smuggling of migrants to the UK”.\n\nMinisters have committed to reducing the number of crossings by “smashing the gangs” operating the cross-Channel route.","summary":"Yvette Cooper is also expected to address the right-wing Atreju gathering organised by the Italian prime minister’s party.","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/yvette-cooper-home-secretary-italian-channel-steve-bannon-b1199977.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/12/14/00/22ae631b67195a68031572acc8160248Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzM0MTk5NjMz-2.78102075.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:01:00","author":"Christopher McKeon","authors":["Christopher McKeon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.539},{"id":273031250,"title":"The billionaire with a hotline to Musk who says he'll raise enough money for Reform to make Farage Prime Minister","text":"At a discreet lunch in the swish French restaurant Saint Jacques in London's St James's, the billionaire property developer Nick Candy's mobile telephone buzzed repeatedly with incoming messages.\n\nCandy was in demand as the fine Pomerol from Bordeaux flowed in a private room at the restaurant, where the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was holding court with an assortment of potential donors to the party. \n\nHours earlier it had been announced that Candy was defecting from the Tories to become treasurer of Reform.\n\nOne message on the telephone made Candy smile in particular. It was from Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. \n\nHe had read about Candy jumping ship to Reform after 15 years in the Conservative Party and, as Candy told me later: 'He wanted to know how and when he could give financial support to Reform. He's an admirer of Nigel and the work he's doing.'\n\nCandy may not be as rich as Musk, but he isn't short of a bob or two. He started his property empire with the purchase of a one-bedroom flat in West London, which he bought aged 22 with a £6,000 loan from his grandmother, and is now, at 51, said to be a billionaire.\n\nHis defection is a serious blow to the Conservatives and their new leader Kemi Badenoch. Not just because he's given more than £300,000 to the Tories, but because he has an open line to some of the wealthiest businessmen in the country. \n\nHe is telling anyone and everyone that more of them are planning to switch to Reform.\n\nRobin Birley, the owner of the exclusive 5 Hertford Street private members' club in Belgravia, has quietly given Reform £50,000. \n\nIt's another psychological hit to the Tories as his club has, for the past decade, been the after-hours epicentre of successive leaders of the Tory Party, from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss. Birley's half-brother Lord ('Zac') Goldsmith is a Tory grandee.\n\nPoliticians and commentators are moving over too. Last month, former Tory MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns defected to Reform and will stand on the party's ticket in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral election. Suella Braverman, a former Home Secretary who ran for the Tory leadership in 2019, is rumoured to be next. Her husband Rael joined Reform this week.\n\nTim Montgomerie, the high-profile founder of ConservativeHome, the news and analysis website, and a former adviser to Boris Johnson, defected last month after 33 years as a Conservative Party member.\n\nBut Candy's switch is a far more serious breakthrough for Reform in terms of its ability to boost the party's coffers, although it has been a long time in coming.\n\nCandy has rubbed shoulders with Farage for years. It was the Reform leader who introduced him to Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, several years ago. He was also a guest at the party in London to celebrate Farage coming third in ITV's I'm A Celebrity . . . in December 2023.\n\nCandy's wife Holly Valance, an actress and singer who sprang to fame in TV soap Neighbours and with whom he has two children, is a vocal supporter of Farage. She too met Trump with Farage at Mar-a-Lago and has since become an increasingly influential figure on Britain's hard-Right.\n\nIn the summer, she hosted a pre-US election fundraising event for Trump, whose eldest son Donald Trump Jr was the star guest, at the Candys' mansion in Chelsea. The £1.6 million it generated was the largest sum raised outside the US for the President-elect.\n\nAs Reform's new Treasurer, Candy has his work cut out. At the end of last year, the party was in debt to the tune of £1.1 million. Some of the money owed was in the form of loans from wealthy supporters such as the businessman Richard Tice, who is now one of the party's five MPs. Tice was Leader of Reform until Farage's surprise last-minute announcement that he was going to stand in the July 4 General Election and was taking over the party leadership.\n\nThe £1.1 million debt will be cleared by the end of the year, pledges Candy. Much of the money he raises after that will be used to try to 'professionalise' the party and create a better candidate-selection process – Farage has admitted that Reform was badly damaged at the last election by candidates who were, in his words, at best 'loopy' and at worst 'extremely racist'.\n\nTo prevent a repetition of this at the next election, the party will introduce a more exhaustive vetting procedure. It has also set a target of opening a branch in all of Britain's 650 constituencies and plans to invest in state-of-the-art IT equipment to link the new constituency branches to the party HQ as communication currently is almost non-existent.\n\nThe party is hiring regional organisers to co-ordinate campaigning. They will not come cheap. Candy will also appoint a team of deputy treasurers to beef up the fundraising effort.\n\n'I will raise the biggest amount that has ever been generated for a British political party,' Candy boasted this week. When I asked him how much, he said it would be north of £40 million.\n\n'I've had millions of pounds of pledges from people who have never donated to a political party in this country. But it's not just about billionaires and millionaires. We need the people that have got £1, £5, £10, £25 to be a member of Reform.'\n\nWith membership rising above 100,000, Reform may need a new HQ as well – an upgrade from the rented three-bedroom flat in Catherine Place, Westminster, in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament, that currently serves as its offices.\n\nIt is beginning to feel as if Reform UK could get its act together to become a highly professional outfit – and if it succeeds in doing so, it could be catastrophic for the Conservatives.\n\nYet the Tory treasurers don't appear unduly worried. One told me the other night: 'Nick Candy talks a great talk. Let's see if he can actually deliver on what he promises.' A Tory donor told me much the same: 'The test of Nick is what he actually raises, not what he says he can raise. After all, he was never in the big league of Tory donors.'\n\nThe likes of Lord Bamford, the owner of JCB which has an annual turnover of more than £6.5 billion, are expected to continue supporting the Tories under its new leader Kemi Badenoch. He's given millions in the past.\n\nLord Spencer, dubbed the most successful treasurer in Conservative Party history after he raised tens of millions from 2006 to 2010, has been seen at recent Tory fundraising events. A billionaire, he made his fortune from founding the financial, energy and commodities markets broker ICAP.\n\nOne senior Tory source said: 'Most of the party's big supporters want to give Kemi a fighting chance. It's still very early days. She's been the leader for only a matter of weeks and has to be given time to make her mark. Money is starting to come in.'\n\nA critical juncture for both Reform and the Tories will be next May's local elections. It will be the first big test for Badenoch since the General Election, in which the Tories sank to their worst ever defeat.\n\nThe five seats Reform won at the election all came from the Tories. Reform came second in 98 seats, 89 of which were won by Labour. Farage is confident that if the Tories fare badly and Reform make gains there will be more defections by Tory MPs.\n\n'Every 100 years or so there is a major sea-change in politics. We could now be on the cusp of it,' said one senior Reform figure. 'The polls show that voters don't like Labour or the Tories.'\n\nEven if Candy does bring in £40 million, there is one issue which he may not be able to resolve. While polls consistently show that Farage is the most popular party leader, his leadership style is not universally loved within Reform itself. A senior party source told me: 'Nigel is not a team player. He never has been. The leadership strategy is clear. You either fit in with what Nigel is doing or you can push off. So far, it's proving successful.'\n\nBut there are strains within the party's group of five MPs, not least between Farage and Rupert Lowe, the Reform member for Great Yarmouth, who is a successful businessman in his own right and is often irritated that decisions are handed down from on high. 'It's fair to say there are tensions there,' said the source. 'But Rupert gets that the party is doing well in the polls because of Nigel, not him.'\n\nThe party also has to reform its constitution – it is currently registered as a private company at Companies House and Farage is the major shareholder. A team of lawyers is working with the Electoral Commission to turn it into a conventional political party, but the process is time-consuming and expensive.\n\nCandy's property empire stretches from the Cotswolds to Beverly Hills and he sold his penthouse at One Hyde Park in London's Knightsbridge for £175 million in a deal that gave it the tag of the most expensive piece of real estate in the world.\n\nGiven that he is used to handling stratospheric sums of money, he sees little difficulty in dealing with existing donors.\n\nThey include financier Jeremy Hosking, who has donated £2.6 million to Reform since 2019, and the businessman Chris Harborne, who has given around £10 million to Reform and its predecessor, the Brexit Party.\n\nHarborne, who made his fortune in aviation fuel, is a major shareholder in QinetiQ, the multinational defence technology company, with a £150 million investment.\n\nHe gave £1 million to former Tory leader Boris Johnson after he stood down as prime minister. The donation in November 2022 was made to Boris's private office.\n\nCandy is also a big fan of Boris and believes he was 'badly treated' by the Tory MPs who ousted him from Downing Street. One Reform source told me: 'If Boris was still leader I think Nick Candy would still be in the Tory Party.'\n\nOnly time will tell us if the Conservatives will rue the day he left for Reform.","summary":"One message on the telephone made Candy smile in particular.

At times, he even prioritized influencers’ podcasts over his audience.\n\nTrump’s aim was clear: avoid accountability for the 2021 insurrection. Over four years and with billions of campaign dollars, he could afford to buy influence wherever possible. Yet Kamala Harris’s short, strong campaign nearly overcame the odds. Her near-success shows that genuine public service still resonates — but it’s a warning: Democracy must not be left to those who game the system.\n\nMary Kennedy\nSanta Clara","summary":"Mercury News Letters to the Editor for Dec. 15, 2024","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/12/13/letters-1965/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SJM-L-RESERVOIR-0317-1.jpg?w=1024&h=634","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:00:09","author":"Letters To The Editor","authors":["Letters To The Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.276},{"id":273038180,"title":"South Korean businesses based in China eye Trump tariffs nervously","text":"As US president-elect Donald Trump threatens to increase tariffs on imports from China, small foreign businesses operating factories in the country are deeply concerned about the potential fallout.\nMany see no easy way out because relocating operations or restructuring supply chains remain costly and complex challenges.\nAmong them is a medium-sized South Korean make-up brush manufacturer that has operated a factory in northern China since 1997 and exports its products around the world. It worries that Trump’s threatened tariffs might see most buyers shift their sourcing out of China or ask it to share the tariff costs or reduce product prices accordingly.\nOffshoring is not a viable option either, said director Miyun Byun, who asked that the name of the company not be disclosed due to concerns about the sensitivity of the situation.\n“If we were to relocate to another country, we would likely struggle to establish stable operations before the end of President Trump’s term,” she said.\nLike many other labour-intensive industries, the global make-up brush supply chain has become highly concentrated in China over a number of decades, particularly in Cangzhou, a city in Hebei province that has become a major producer of make-up brushes.\n\nSome companies in similar industries have expanded to countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia and Myanmar, but Byun said no make-up brush manufacturers have made such moves and the challenges in doing so remain significant.\nPolitical instability, a lack of infrastructure and broken supply chains – no raw materials or facilities – create very difficult conditions in low-income countries in South and Southeast Asia, despite their low labour costs, Byun said.\nWith labour costs in high-income nations excessively high, China remains the dominant country for cosmetic brush manufacturing, and “it will be not easy for any of our competitors to move production out of China under the current circumstances”, she added.\nSmall foreign players operating in China could feel as if they are swimming against the tide, said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of Gavekal Dragonomics, a China-focused economic research firm.\n“If you’re big, you can handle the compliance and the trade war stuff, you can move things around, but I don’t think there is a good solution for the smaller players other than that they just have to hunker down or they just have to go figure out how to operate in Vietnam,” Kroeber said.\nSmaller and mid-sized American companies operating China might have channels such as trade associations that could lobby the White House if there are unforeseen repercussions in the United States, he said, but “if they’re non-American companies, good luck, because Trump does not care about them”.\n“Chinese companies have been aggressively relocating because they know they need to internationalise as it’s going to be harder for them to export out of China,” Kroeber said. “They’re going like crazy in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Mexico, and they are big enough that they can say this is part of a long-term stretch.\n“[The small foreign companies] just have to follow the lead of the Chinese companies and say ‘this is coming, we have to just roll with the tide’.”\nPark Kihwan, who runs a small South Korean company that sources clothing materials from China, said his business could be affected if Trump’s tariffs extend to raw materials and lead to increased costs, and if the tariffs apply to countries trading with China, that would also present challenges to end sellers like himself. He also asked that the name of his company not be disclosed.\nMany of Park’s peers have been relocating from China to countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nBut he said that “the reality is that technological advancements have followed a progression from Japan to South Korea and then to China, where the infrastructure has only recently matured”.\nWith the current unpredictability, the only viable strategy is to adapt and respond when the situation unfolds\nPark Kihwan, Korean businessman\n“Moving operations to third countries like Myanmar still requires time,” Park said. “With advanced technologies just beginning to take root in China, … Southeast Asian countries are not yet ready to replicate these capabilities.”\nPolitical instability in countries such as Myanmar or Bangladesh also made introducing new technologies risky.\n“Some businesses are moving to third countries due to pressures from the US, and there are certainly restrictions influenced by the US,” Park said. “However, with the current unpredictability, the only viable strategy is to adapt and respond when the situation unfolds.\n“For now, it is not feasible to abandon China, which remains one of the few stable markets.”","summary":"Relocating operations or restructuring supply chains remain costly and complex challenges.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3290700/south-korean-businesses-based-china-eye-trump-tariffs-nervously","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/12/13/d89c2d71-d925-4888-be2d-dec400d4595e_374e3df0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-14 00:00:09","author":"Luna Sun","authors":["Luna Sun"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.107},{"id":273037204,"title":"Veteran who stormed the Capitol tried to join Russian Army, feds say","text":"A Dallas man who tried to fly overseas to join the Russian military and fight against Ukraine was sentenced on Friday to six months in prison for violating the terms of his probation for storming the U.S. Capitol four years ago.\n\nKevin Loftus, a 56-year-old veteran of the U.S. Army, was stopped from boarding an Oct. 28 flight from Dallas to Tbilisi, Georgia, by way of Istanbul, Turkey, when Turkish Airlines identified a “security flag” associated with him, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nLoftus didn’t have the court’s permission to travel internationally or to drive from Texas to Iowa, where the FBI arrested him three days after his flight plans fell apart, prosecutors said.\n\nLoftus told the FBI that he had hoped to secure a 90-day visa to travel to Russia, where he intended to apply for temporary residency.

Under current law, the drug is approved to abort an unborn child up to 10 weeks’ gestation, at which point the child has a fetal heartbeat, early brain activity, and partially developed eyes, lips and nostrils.\n\nMifepristone kills the child by blocking the hormone progesterone, which cuts off the child’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. A second pill, misoprostol, is taken between 24 to 48 hours after mifepristone to induce contractions meant to expel the child’s body from the mother, essentially inducing labor.\n\nChemical abortions account for about half of the abortions in the United States every year.\n\nBefore Trump committed to maintaining access to the abortion pill, the president-elect went back and forth with the Time reporter, stating that the issue is complex “because you have other people that, you know, they feel strongly both ways, really strongly both ways, and those are the things that are dividing up the country.”\n\nThe pledge is a blow to pro-life activists who had urged Trump to use the FDA’s power to enforce a Comstock Act prohibition on the delivery of “obscene” and “vile” products through the mail — which includes the delivery of anything designed to produce an abortion. \n\nTrump, who moderated his position on abortion during the 2024 presidential election, has said the states should determine their own policies on abortion. He said during the campaign that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected.\n\nAlternatively, Trump has praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to restrict abortion and has vowed to free pro-life activists who have been imprisoned for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. He has also said he would consider a ban on federal funding for pro-abortion groups internationally and has vowed to protect religious freedom.","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/trump-commits-to-keeping-abortion-pill-available","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20241213171256_4d17f49838f956a12033c75988af40b3d2e6f4f37164c98cffe2191eec29c59d.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:59:36","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.216},{"id":273033120,"title":"Trump reportedly considering military action against Iran","text":"Trump reportedly considering military action against Iran\n The Wall Street Journal reported that President-elect Donald Trump and his allies are reportedly considering military action against Iran after he takes office.

As the individual most closely associated with uncovering the astounding abuses of power now known as \u001cRussiagate,\u001d Patel\u0019s nomination was always destined to terrify the Washington think tank-media complex that had sought to perpetuate the myth of President Trump\u0019s supposed collusion with Moscow.\n\nFar more pernicious than discredited conspiracy theorists objecting to the nomination of the man who debunked their serial misinformation is the emerging Beltway line that Patel is \u001cunqualified\u001d to serve as director of the FBI. In a town that venerates credentials, it is remarkable that even the most anti-Trump commentators would insist upon Patel\u0019s supposed lack of qualifications to lead the United States\u0019 chief federal law enforcement agency. An objective evaluation of Patel\u0019s service, and the backgrounds of previous FBI Directors, points to only one conclusion: Kash Patel has the most significant and serious national security background of anyone ever nominated to serve as director of the FBI.\n\nSince J. Edgar Hoover became the bureau\u0019s first director in 1935, the top job at the FBI has nearly always gone to an individual with a mix of federal prosecutorial, judicial branch, and senior Justice Department service. While these backgrounds made sense for much of the 20th century, when the FBI\u0019s principal role remained that of a domestic law enforcement agency, they are woefully inadequate for the threats of the 21st century.\n\nSince Sept. 11, 2001, and over the last decade of Great Power competition with China and Russia, the FBI has become the nation\u0019s front line in counterterrorism, counterespionage, and domestic security matters. The approach required of the FBI to meet these challenges, which will only grow and expand in the years ahead, differs substantially from the traditional bureau mindset historically applied to kidnappings and bank robberies. A director who has operated at the highest level of the national security apparatus, and understands these 21st century threats from a prism beyond that of an assistant attorney general or U.S. attorney, is essential for American security.\n\nKash Patel will be just such a director. While Patel has significant courtroom experience as both a prosecutor and a public defender, it is his time working at the highest levels of the U.S. national security bureaucracy that uniquely prepares him to lead the bureau at this moment. Patel served with distinction as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, where he was the principal White House official responsible for overseeing the U.S. government\u0019s counterterrorism agenda. This goes far beyond the vantage point of a traditional FBI director, who may have encountered the government\u0019s approach to counterterrorism as a prosecutor, judge, or Justice Department official. By contrast, Patel worked each day with, and helped set the direction for, the men and women actually executing America\u0019s counterterrorism efforts. With access to the most sensitive intelligence the country possesses, and responsibility for advising the president in real time on operations of extraordinary sensitivity and consequence, Patel lived and breathed the threats that will define the coming decades.\n\nAs chief of staff of the Department of Defense, Patel occupied one of the United States\u0019 most unsung but consequential positions. As the right-hand man to the acting secretary of defense, Patel was involved in every aspect of running the largest and most complex bureaucracy on earth. From Special Operations missions to conventional force deployments to intelligence on adversary threats and intentions, Patel acquired an understanding of the U.S. military\u0019s capabilities and requirements that no other FBI director has ever enjoyed. It is experience that will serve him well in a threat environment where the line between overseas battlefields and the home front is intentionally blurred by adversaries.\n\nHaving worked closely with Kash Patel during his time at both the NSC and the Pentagon, I can say with confidence that Donald Trump could not have picked an individual more suited by experience and dedication to lead today\u0019s FBI. As he has done with other appointments, President-elect Trump is jettisoning the Beltway cookie-cutter definition of what constitutes appropriate qualifications and instead asking: What are the actual skills, experiences, and qualities needed to keep America safe and prosperous in the 21st century? In Kash Patel, the president and the American people have our man.","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/12/13/kash_patel_is_uniquely_qualified_to_lead_fbi_152086.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:58:06","author":"Alexander B.

At least that's my interpretation of Andreessen's comments in a wide-ranging interview with The Free Press cofounder Bari Weiss.\n\n\"My concern is that the censorship and political control of AI is a thousand times more dangerous than censorship and political control of social media -- maybe a million times more dangerous,\" Andreessen, a prime innovator of artificial intelligence, told Weiss. \"The thing with AI is, I think AI is going to be the control layer for everything in the future -- how the health care system works, how the education system works, how the government works. So that if AI is woke, biased, censored, politically controlled, you are in a hyper-Orwellian, China-style, social credit system nightmare.\"\n\nLike fellow tech titan Elon Musk, Andreessen has come to see the Democrats as \"the ones who are trying to silence free speech.\" However, unlike many Trump supporters, he does not fasten upon the obvious partisan example: Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2020 campaign enlistment of 51 current or former intelligence officials to depict Hunter Biden's laptop as bearing \"the hallmarks of Russian disinformation.\"\n\nThat Democratic disinformation operation suppressed facts about Biden family corruption during the campaign year, but not forever, as President Joe Biden's pardon of his son showed.\n\nAndreessen is concerned less about transitory partisan finagling and more about possibly permanent suppressions of truth. An example he cites is the claim that \"the COVID lab leak hypothesis was 'misinformation' and broadly censored on social media.\"\n\nI have written often about the lab leak hypothesis and how denigration of it was concocted by former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and former National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins.\n\nStarting in February 2020, they conspired to get colleagues who considered the lab leak likely to write a paper disparaging that theory and endorsing the idea that the virus came from a live animal market. No evidence of such transmission has been found, and presumably, Fauci and Collins' control over millions of dollars in research funding helped persuade the authors to change their minds. After publication, Fauci airily referred the article to the press as if he had nothing to do with it.\n\nEstablishment press outfits were happy to play along, characterizing the lab leak theory as \"already debunked\" (The Washington Post) or a \"fringe theory\" (The New York Times). The latter outlet's lead COVID-19 reporter offhandedly referred to its \"racist roots.\" Facebook and pre-Musk Twitter, now X, followed the cues and suppressed the lab leak theory even as they suppressed criticism of masking protocols and school closures.\n\nBy March 2023, the Energy Department joined the FBI in concluding that the virus likely resulted from a lab leak. They were bolstered by multiple articles by former Times science writer Nicholas Wade, and by Matt Ridley and Alina Chan's book, \"Viral.\"\n\nFinally, this month, a detailed report by the House Oversight Committee not only endorses the lab leak theory as the most likely explanation of the virus but also, as Ridley wrote in The Telegraph, \"lays out in gobsmacking detail just how much senior officials allegedly have schemed to prevent information emerging.\"\n\nWhat they were covering up, it becomes plain now, is that Fauci was commissioning the Wuhan laboratory to conduct gain-of-function research, making the virus more contagious to humans, presumably to develop means of defense. The report explains in painstaking detail how Fauci, in testimony before Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), used a misleading definition when he vehemently denied authorizing gain-of-function research.\n\nOne can argue the attempted coverup by Fauci and others ultimately failed. One can argue further that, unlike the Hunter Biden laptop coverup, this was not necessarily a partisan operation: It began during the Trump presidency and was uncovered in part by actions of the Biden administration.\n\nHowever, one must also add that the scientists who led the coverup retained the capacity to shape pandemic policy, pressing successfully for measures that proved to be harmful or unnecessary, such as school closures, masking for children, and vaccine requirements for those with natural immunity from previous infection.\n\nAnother thing one must add: The press and social media billionaires who went along with the scientists' speech suppression acted on the assumption that they were frustrating the intentions of Trump and his supporters, whom they continued -- and continue -- to regard as something like Hitler and Nazis. Any evidence in favor of things the Trump side was for, the media outlets felt an obligation to suppress.\n\nFor Andreessen, the key moment came after Jon Stewart went on Stephen Colbert's show for an eight-minute segment in which he pointed out that it \"literally cannot be a coincidence that you have the Wuhan institute of bat viruses,\" as he told Weiss.\n\nAfter that, he said, \"I was in a discussion at one of the big internet companies, where the discussion was like, 'Did you see the Jon Stewart thing? Ha ha. That was really funny. I guess we should stop censoring the lab leak theory now. Ha ha.' And literally, they stop censoring it that day.\"\n\nSo his theory seems to be that if you want free expression and exchange of ideas in an AI world, it's better to install a president such as Trump, whom the great establishments of government, journalism and academe will strive to rebut, rather than a Democrat whose comforting presence will leave them inclined to accept any convenient untruth.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2024/12/13/free_speech_why_a_tech_titan_backed_trump_152082.html","image":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/social_media_assets/site_logos/rcp.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:58:06","author":"Michael Barone","authors":["Michael Barone"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":273031132,"title":"Andreessen: AI Has Been A Censorship Machine From Day One, This Is 100% Intentional","text":"Back to Videos\n\n Andreessen: AI Has Been A Censorship Machine From Day One, This Is 100% Intentional\n\n | \n\n Posted By Tim Hains\n On Date December 12, 2024\n \n\nInvestor and software engineer Marc Andreessen told Bari Weiss on her \"Honestly\" podcast (full video here) about the danger of built-in bias in AI systems. \n\n\"The censorship and political control of AI is like a thousand times more dangerous than censorship and political control of social media. Maybe a million times more dangerous. Social media censorship and political control are very dangerous, but at least it's only like people talking to each other and communicating,\" he said. \"The thing with AI is, I think AI is gonna be the control layer for everything in the future.\"\n\n\"It's gonna be the control layer for how the education system works. It's gonna be the control layer for how the government works,\" he said. \"So in the future, when you deal with a healthcare system or with the education system or with the government, you're gonna be dealing with an AI.\"\n\n\"So if that AI is -- call it what you want -- woke, biased, censored, politically controlled, you are in a hyper Orwellian China-style social credit system nightmare.\"\n\n\"This goes directly to Elon's argument, which is at the core of this, what you have to do is you have to train the AI to lie,\" he said. \"If you wanted to create the ultimate dystopian world, you'd have a world where everything is controlled by an AI that's been programmed to lie. It's hard to imagine things getting worse than that.\"\n\nMARC ANDREESSEN: [Sam Altman] was a co-founder, but Elon was a co-founder. So just for full credit and context, Elon was the original funder/donor of Open.AI and sort of the central founder. \n\nHe and Sam worked together. But Elon was definitely either a -- or the -- founder and was certainly a magnet for the early talent as well as the funder. So Elon has been involved there from the beginning. \n\nThe umbrella thing that I think has been happening is social media went on this arc that I've described from like 2013 to today, where it became a censorship machine. AI has gone on a hyper-accelerated version of that arc. It took time for social media to become a censorship machine. It happened on AI right from the beginning. It happened on AI right from the beginning because AI companies learned from the experience of the social media companies and they just said, \"Well, if we're gonna end up building a censorship machine over a decade, we might as well just do it upfront.\"\n\nBARI WEISS: Now, Marc, are you saying it's intentional or it's just learning off of information? \n\nMARC ANDREESSEN: It's 100% intentional. Yeah. That's how you get black George Washington at Google because there's an override in the system that basically says everybody has to be black, and boom. Right? Like they're squads, they're large sets of people in these companies that determine these policies and write them down and encode them into these systems. \n\nSo overwhelmingly what people experience is intentional. Like there's just no question about that. And they have these groups with this very Orwellian name called \"trust and safety,\" right? You know, mistrust and no safety, you know, that do this. \n\nAnd in a lot of these companies, it's common to have as many people on the trust and safety side deciding on all these policies as it is to have engineers building these systems. And then actually what happens is you're an AI company and you know, you need to build this kind of machine, this kind of censorship machine. And so you go hire the people out of social media who built a machine at social media. So it's literally, in a lot of cases, it's actually the same people doing it in AI. \n\nSo these companies were born woke, they were born as censorship machines. They exhibit all of that behavior. These big companies are doing it for the same reason the social media companies did. They're doing it because either they've already gotten pressured or they know they're going to get pressured. And so you might as well just do it. \n\nMost of the people who work at these companies agree with that side of things. And so they think that they need it. I was in a discussion with a professor who is at one of the big companies and I was like, you know, it's crazy to have these ais give you these patronizing moral lectures all the time when, when you ask questions. And this professor said, well, you know, my undergrads actually really like that. Like that's how they expect technology to work, right? And I'm like screaming inside my own head, being like, what the hell? \n\nIt's baked into the culture. A lot of these people are newly arrived from these universities. They're fully indoctrinated and so they're very sheltered, isolated people. The kind of people who spend all their time in a computer lab. So they haven't had a reason to think this stuff out more broadly. \n\nSo it's the same thing. My concern with the censorship and political control of AI is a thousand times more dangerous than censorship and political control of social media. Maybe a million times more dangerous. Social media censorship and political control are very dangerous, but at least it's only like people talking to each other and communicating. The thing with AI is, I think AI is gonna be the control layer for everything in the future, right? So I think AI is gonna be the control layer for how the healthcare system works. I think it's gonna be the control layer for how the education system works. It's gonna be the control layer for how the government works, right? \n\nAnd so in the future, when you deal with a healthcare system or with the education system or with the government, you're gonna be dealing with an AI. And so if that AI is, call it what you want, woke, biased, censored, politically controlled, you are in like a hyper Orwellian China-style social credit system nightmare. Absolute nightmare. \n\nThis goes directly to Elon's argument, which is at the core of this, what you have to do is you have to train the AI to lie. \n\nIf you wanted to create the ultimate dystopian world, you'd have a world where everything is controlled by an AI that's been programmed to lie. It's hard to imagine things getting worse than that. This hasn't rolled all the way out yet because AI is still new and it's not being put in control of everything, but like, this is where things are headed. \n\nSo it's vitally important that this not happen. My hope is that the culture changes, the case studies, and all the stuff we talked about that this new administration might do, my hope is that this all gets kind of peeled back and thrown out into the sunlight, and people writ large come to really understand this and people don't stand for it. And this doesn't happen. But like, this has to be fought. This will happen by default unless people fight it. \n\n Recommended\n\n \n\n Andreessen: America Needs To Find Out What Their Government Has Been Doing With Censorship And De-Banking\n\n December 11, 2024\n\n Speaking with Bari Weiss for an episode of her \"Honestly\" podcast, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen spoke about the first major \"de-censorship\" moment he remembers, Jon Stewart legitimizing the Covid \"lab leak\" theory with a well-crafted joke on national TV, and says that there needs to be a...\n \n Marc AndreessencensorshipBari Weissdebanking\n \n\n \n\n Andreessen: Lawyers Tell Me There's A Good Case That This Organized De-Banking Activity Is Criminally Illegal\n\n December 11, 2024\n\n Speaking with Bari Weiss for an episode of her \"Honestly\" podcast, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen spoke about the thought process that went into supporting Donald Trump after supporting Democrats for decades and his thoughts about the culture war inside Silicon Valley:\n\nBARI WEISS: One of the...\n \n Marc AndreessendebankingBari Weiss\n \n\nRelated Topics: Marc Andreessen, Artificial Intelligence, AI, Censorship\n\n Show comments\n Hide Comments \n\n Send Tips\n\n Follow Us\n\n Latest Political Videos","url":"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2024/12/12/andreessen_ai_has_been_a_censorship_machine_from_day_one_this_is_100_intentional.html","image":"https://assets.realclear.com/images/67/672336_5_.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:58:06","author":"Tim Hains","authors":["Tim Hains"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.255},{"id":273030958,"title":"Donald Trump Jr. says he and ex Kimberly Guilfoyle share ‘special bond’: We ‘will never stop caring for each other’","text":"Donald Trump Jr. says he and Kimberly Guilfoyle will “never stop caring for each other.”\n\nThe President-elect’s son exclusively told Page Six in a statement on Friday — after we exclusively reported that the couple has parted ways — “Kimberly and I will never stop caring for each other and will always keep a special bond.”\n\nHe added of Guilfoyle, who is now headed to Greece as US ambassador under Donald Trump, “I could not be more proud of her and the important role she’ll continue to play in my father‘s administration.”\n\nTrump Jr. also defended Guilfoyle from some of the hits she’s allegedly taken in the media. And while she may not be marrying into the family, she still seems to be firmly part of the Trump universe. \n\n“Anyone taking baseless and petty fake news cheap shots at her in the tabloids are just embarrassing themselves,” Don Jr. continued of Guilfoyle. \n\n“She’s been an undefeated prosecutor, national TV news star, a leader of the MAGA movement and close advisor to the president. The people of Greece are getting an absolute star and now the whole world will see it more than ever.”\n\nDon Jr. also stated, “Since the very beginning, no one on Team Trump has worked harder than Kimberly to help elect and reelect my father — and no one deserves this ambassadorship more than she does.”\n\nWe reported on Tuesday that Don Jr., 46, and Guilfoyle, 55, have ended their engagement of four years. \n\nIn his statement to us, Don Jr. did not specifically confirm the split. \n\nOn Tuesday, the Daily Mail published images of Don Jr. and Palm Beach socialite Bettina Anderson, 38, holding hands in public after a dinner at Buccan to celebrate her birthday. \n\nA source inside the restaurant also told Page Six that Don Jr. and Anderson were “kissing” and holding hands in front of fellow diners.\n\nThe next night Trump Jr. and Anderson — a regular on the Palm Beach social circuit — were spotted together at private club Mar-a-Lago, and were even greeted by Donald Trump.\n\nA source told us that the couple mingled with the intimate crowd in the club’s buffet line, and they sat on a stage in a VIP area with velvet ropes. An insider said, “they are clearly in love,” but that they “remained discreet.”\n\nDon Jr. and Guilfoyle started dating in 2018, and got engaged in 2020. \n\nWhile Guilfoyle has not addressed the split, she posted of the ambassadorship on X: “I’m honored to accept President Trump’s nomination to serve as the next Ambassador to Greece and I look forward to earning the support of the U.S. Senate. President Trump’s historic victory is bringing hope and optimism to the American people and to freedom-loving allies across the world.”\n\nThe ambassadorship includes a residence, Jefferson House, in the affluent Kolonaki district of Athens.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson were first photographed together in September looking “cozy” at Honor Bar in Palm Beach, though sources insisted to Page Six at the time that the Trump scion was still “100 percent” with Guilfoyle. \n\nAnderson was also spotted sitting behind Don Jr. and the former Fox News host at the Republican National Convention in mid-July — though a source told us that the socialite was there because she’s friends with Don Jr.’s ex-wife, Vanessa.","summary":"\"Kimberly and I will never stop caring for each other and will always keep a special bond,\" the President-elect's son told Page Six exclusively.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/12/13/gossip/donald-trump-jr-says-he-and-ex-kimberly-guilfoyle-share-special-bond-we-will-never-stop-caring-for-each-other/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/95304183.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/7mA2yado-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:57:59","author":"Mara Siegler","authors":["Mara Siegler"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.333},{"id":273032290,"title":"An Invitation, A Rejection, Now What? Trump And Xi Jinping Play Mindgames","text":"Sun Tzu, A Chinese military general, strategist, and philosopher who lived approximately in the 5th Century BC, is best known for his famous book 'The Art Of War'. In it, he wrote a proverb well-known to the world even today - \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer\". US President-elect Donald Trump seems to have taken a leaf out of Sun Tzu's book when he invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to his inaugural ceremony in Washington DC scheduled for January 20th.President Xi, who perhaps is also familiar with Sun Tzu works, read right through Donald Trump's invite and has politely declined it, as per the latest reports.Donald Trump's unprecedented decision to invite the Chinese President astonished officials in Washington and many others beyond. \"A foreign leader has never attended the inauguration of a US President,\" said the US State Department after hours of looking up official records dating back to 1874.\"It is, however, common for Ambassadors and other diplomats to attend the President's swearing-in ceremony,\" the US State Department added.Amid all the hustle and bustle at the White House - and chaos behind the scenes - Donald Trump's spokesperson Karoline Leavitt decided to give an interview to Fox News. Confirming the invite to Xi Jinping, Ms Leavitt said \"This is an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just allies but our adversaries and our competitors too.\"(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(\"script\");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, \"//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js\");She also said that an invite for Donald Trump's oath taking ceremony was sent to several other foreign leaders besides just Xi Jinping, but did not reveal who they were. It is not known yet if these \"other invites\" were sent on the same day as the one extended to Xi Jinping, or after Washington learnt about the Chinese President's decision not to attend.Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, officials in Beijing have remained tight-lipped over the issue. President Xi though, had as recently Tuesday, warned Washington about the expected tariff, trade, and tech wars once Trump becomes President. Expecting economic trouble in the weeks and months ahead, President Xi held a crucial meeting with heads of 10 major international organisations, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Beijing.\"There will be no winners,\" he cautioned the United States in his speech at that meeting while he spoke about tariff hikes, tech-bans, and trade clampdowns that Donald Trump has vowed to impose on China during his election campaign.With such war of words and aggressive posturing by both Trump and Xi, the former's decision to invite the Chinese President for his inauguration ceremony does indeed seem both misplaced and rather unusual.Donald Trump has blown hot and cold in his views about Xi Jinping - calling him \"a great guy\" on one occasion, and describing him as his nemesis on another. An invite sent, as one would, to an ally on the one hand, and calling China \"the greatest threat\" on the other.Speaking about President Xi in his pre-election podcast with Joe Rogan, Trump had said, \"He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy, whether you like it or not.\" But in two other interviews he called Xi Jinping the \"biggest threat to the world\" and labelled China as the \"threat of the century\".Donald Trump has also appointed Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State and Mike Walz as his National Security Adviser - both staunch critics of China who have kept a hawk's eye on every move Beijing makes - so much so, that the Chinese government has placed sanctions on Marco Rubio, and in 2020 had banned him from ever entering the country again - something Beijing would need to reconsider when he takes office as Secretary of State.Weeks before the Trump Administration takes over, NSA-designate Mike Waltz has already urged President-elect Trump to \"urgently end the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East in order to counter the greater threat from the Chinese Communist Party\".All eyes are now on what will be Trump's next move after the invitation snub, and what will be Xi Jinping's counter. The endgame is far from sight.&nbsp","summary":"Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly declined US President-elect Donald Trump's invitation to attend the latter's swearing-in ceremony in Washington DC on January 20th.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/an-invitation-a-rejection-now-what-donald-trump-and-xi-jinping-play-mindgames-7244133","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-12/jrnqgumo_trump-xi_625x300_26_December_19.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:56:21","author":"Abhishek Chakraborty","authors":["Abhishek Chakraborty"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.288},{"id":273032232,"title":"As Trump prepares to take office, ports and dockworkers are facing down a new strike","text":"When dockworkers walked the picket line in October, the strike lasted for 3 days.And if a new contract between their 45,000 member union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance isn't signed by mid-January — a longer strike could send inflation going in the wrong direction.Just months after a strike at Gulf and East Coast ports ended, operators and union members are now at an impasse — once again — over automation.Port operators say they need more technology to increase port efficiency, improve safety and to control costs.But union members say no, because some workers will lose their jobs.A new strike could come if an agreement isn't reached by January 15.And if that happens inflation could increase, when goods aren't flowing in an out of ports as quickly.Thursday union leaders met with President-elect Donald trump at Mar-a-Lago and walked away with his support.Writing about automation on Truth social, Trump said \"the amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt, and harm it causes for American workers,\" and that foreign countries \"...shouldn't be looking for every last penny knowing how many families are hurt.\"RELATED STORY | Billions of dollars of U.S. economic activity halted as port workers enter day two of their strikeProfessor Todd Belt of George Washington University called it Trump striking a different path than he did during his first term.\"During the first Trump term you had Donald Trump, surrounded by a lot of people who were suggested to him by incumbent Republicans who had really a Republican orthodoxy on free trade. Donald trump now is going to be surrounded by a lot of people who support his ideas of interventionism and tariffs, as well as other trade policies that will protect working people at the expense of, of course, inflation,\" Belt said.The International Longshoremen's Association has until Jan. 15 to negotiate a new contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies.At the heart of the dispute is whether ports can install automated gates, cranes and container-moving trucks that could make it faster to unload and load ships. The union argues that automation would lead to fewer jobs, even though higher levels of productivity could do more to boost the salaries of remaining workers.The Maritime Alliance said in a statement that the contract goes beyond ports to \"supporting American consumers and giving American businesses access to the global marketplace — from farmers, to manufacturers, to small businesses, and innovative start-ups looking for new markets to sell their products.\"\"To achieve this, we need modern technology that is proven to improve worker safety, boost port efficiency, increase port capacity, and strengthen our supply chains,\" said the alliance, adding that it looks forward to working with Trump.In October, the union representing 45,000 dockworkers went on strike for three days, raising the risk that a prolonged shutdown could push up inflation by making it difficult to unload container ships and export American products overseas.The issue pits an incoming president who won November's election on the promise of bringing down prices against commitments to support blue-collar workers along with the kinds of advanced technology that drew him support from Silicon Valley elite such as billionaire Elon Musk.Trump sought to portray the dispute as being between U.S. workers and foreign companies, but advanced ports are also key for staying globally competitive. China is opening a $1.3 billion port in Peru that could accommodate ships too large for the Panama Canal.There is a risk that shippers could move to other ports, which could also lead to job losses. Mexico is constructing a port that is highly automated, while Dubai, Singapore and Rotterdam already have more advanced ports.\"For the great privilege of accessing our markets, these foreign companies should hire our incredible American Workers, instead of laying them off, and sending those profits back to foreign countries,\" Trump posted. \"It is time to put AMERICA FIRST!\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"Just months after a strike at Gulf and East Coast ports ended, operators and union dockworkers are once again at an impasse over automation.

First Lady Melania Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance were also on hand to mark the occasion.\n\nThe jubilation however was short-lived as stocks fell across the board. The PPI (producer price index), which monitors wholesale prices, jumped to 0.4 percent in November, well above expectations of 0.2 percent, fueling concerns inflation is not yet beat.\n\n\"I think the trajectory of disinflation is promising and concerning at the same time,\" Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments, rold CNBC Thursday. \"We continue to grind below 3 percent, but progress seems to be slowing as we try to get things towards the Fed's target of 2 percent.\"\n\nThe Standard and Poor's 500 (^GSPC) slipped by 32.94 points, closing at 6,051.25, a decline of 0.54 percent. Market participants cited hesitation ahead of key inflation figures and upcoming corporate guidance as reasons for the broad-based pullback.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 234.44 points to end at 43,914.12, down 0.53 percent. Blue chips and cyclical names felt the pressure as traders weighed the potential impact of rising interest rates and tightening credit conditions on economic growth.\n\nThe tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC) fared no better, shedding 132.05 points to close at 19,902.84, a drop of 0.66 percent. Growth-oriented stocks bore the brunt of the day's losses, reflecting investor unease over earnings volatility and valuation pressures.\n\nShares in Trump Media, majority-owned by the president-elect bucked the trend to drop just 3 cents, to close Thursday at $36.20, down 0.08 percent. Even with the 3 cents drop, Trump Media's capitalization registered at $7.885 billion.\n\nGlobal Currency Markets See Broad Dollar Strength on Thursday, Particularly against the Swiss Franc\n\nThe U.S. dollar strengthened against most major counterparts in Thursday's foreign exchange trading, as ongoing global economic uncertainties and diverging central bank policies continued to underscore the greenback's safe-haven appeal. Investors weighed signs of a resilient U.S. economy against simmering inflation concerns, leaving many risk-sensitive currencies on the back foot. The US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) inched up 0.05 points to 106.76, a 0.05 percent gain.\n\nThe Euro/US dollar (EURUSD) pair slipped to 1.0464, declining by 0.29 percent.\n\nIn Asia, the US dollar/Japanese yen (USDJPY) advanced to 152.64, rising by 0.13 percent. A modest gain of 0.20 yen highlighted the yen's vulnerability amid expectations that the Bank of Japan would maintain its dovish stance for longer than other major central banks. A rate cut this month is looking increasingly doubtful.\n\nCommodity-linked currencies also retreated. The US dollar/Canadian dollar (USDCAD) climbed to 1.4214, up 0.40 percent, as weaker oil prices and subdued Canadian data weighed on the loonie.\n\nSimilarly, the Australian dollar/US dollar (AUDUSD) fell 0.09 percent to 0.6362, and the New Zealand dollar/US dollar (NZDUSD) dipped 0.35 percent to 0.5762, both impacted by global growth concerns and softening risk sentiment.\n\nSterling was not immune to the dollar's broad gains. The British pound/US dollar (GBPUSD) pair sank to 1.2669, down by 0.63 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the US dollar/Swiss franc (USDCHF) pairing climbed a substantial 0.91 percent to 0.8918. The sharp weakness in the Swiss franc following a 50 basis points interest rate cut by the SNB on Thursday.\n\nOverall, Thursday's trading session reinforced the U.S. dollar's preeminence, as currencies worldwide struggled to find a footing amid a complex global backdrop.\n\nGlobal Markets See Mixed Performance as Investors Digest Economic Signals\n\nEquity markets worldwide posted a mixed set of results at Thursday's close, as investors weighed signs of economic resilience against persistent concerns over inflation and policy shifts. European benchmarks struggled to find firm direction, while selected Asian and emerging markets pushed higher.\n\nNorth of the U.S. border, Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index (^GSPTSE) followed suit, declining 246.99 points to finish at 25,410.71, down 0.96 percent.

Possible trade wars in US President-elect Donald Trump's second term and complicated interest-rate outlooks may spill over into subpar economic growth, hurting demand from investors and consumers, the industry association said in its 2025 outlook report released on Thursday.\"All eyes are on the US. Trump's second term may provide a boost to the local economy but could equally elicit a fair degree of nervousness for investors around the world, it said.Bullion's rally in the early part of 2024 was driven by large purchases by central banks, especially the People's Bank of China and others in emerging markets. It got a further boost from the Federal Reserve's recent monetary easing and haven demand during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions including wars in West Asia and Ukraine. However, gains have stalled due to a rally in the dollar following Trump's election win.Some banks are still bullish on the prospects of the precious metal, currently trading near $2,700 an ounce, next year. Goldman Sachs Group is forecasting it will get to $3,000 by the end of 2025, while UBS AG sees $2,900. China's actions in the gold market will be closely watched. So far, investors there have provided price support, while consumers have stayed on the sidelines, but \"these dynamics hang on the direct (and indirect) effects of trade, stimulus and perceptions of risk,\" the WGC said.The yellow metal will rise if the world sees \"significantly lower interest rates, or a deterioration in geopolitics or financial market conditions,\" the council said. Lower rates typically benefit gold as it pays no interest.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/gold-rally-may-slow-down-in-2025-wgc/articleshow/116303894.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116303961/116303961.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:47:04","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.074},{"id":273029212,"title":"'Toy type': Drone crash in New Jersey backyard fuels mystery over recent sightings","text":"A hobby drone crashed into a Pequannock Township homeowner’s backyard in Morris County, New Jersey, on Thursday night, sparking heightened concerns in a state already rattled by unexplained aerial phenomena. The Pequannock Police Department confirmed that the device, which fell around 8:45 pm, was “a hobby or toy type of drone” and not a military-grade or commercial craft, as reported by the New York Post.This incident adds to a wave of drone-related anxiety, partly fuelled by recent reports of large drones hovering near the highly secure Picatinny Arsenal. The facility, which develops military weaponry, has seen multiple sightings, raising concerns about potential espionage by foreign adversaries.Mayor Ryan Herd of Pequannock Township visited the crash site, emphasising his worries about unauthorised drones invading private property. Speaking to the New York Post, Herd stated, “Drones are flying over our houses, which is our private property. My family is here.” He urged residents to refrain from chasing or attempting to down drones, warning of potential catastrophic accidents.Adding to the tension, another report surfaced later that evening about a drone allegedly hitting a powerline in Randolph Township. However, the Morris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed the report was unfounded.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently imposed temporary drone flight restrictions over key locations in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal and the Bedminster golf course owned by President-elect Donald Trump. These measures followed reports of unusual drone activity in the region.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy addressed the growing concerns earlier this week, describing the aircraft as “very sophisticated.” He assured residents the devices posed no immediate public threat but encouraged federal authorities to investigate. Murphy warned against shooting drones out of the sky but supported efforts to capture them for study.White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby revealed that federal investigators have been unable to confirm any of the over 3,000 reports of car-sized drones patrolling the skies. Meanwhile, Pentagon officials stated they do not believe these drones are linked to foreign entities.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/toy-type-drone-crash-in-new-jersey-backyard-fuels-mystery-over-recent-sightings/articleshow/116301680.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-116301725/116301725.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-12-13 23:47:04","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.334}]}
