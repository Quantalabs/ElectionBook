The anniversary issue, dated December 28. And this penultimate issue brings you a cover story which is a year younger than THE WEEK, the Man of the Year special. This year's spotlight is on Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla. He was interviewed by Principal Correspondent Abhinav Singh and Senior Correspondent Nirmal Jovial, supported by Photo Editor Bhanu Prakash Chandra and Assistant Video Editor Uthara Dinesh. The article is a fine balance of his journey from Lucknow to space, with snapshots of the personal, including how he courted Kamna. There are also sketches about the love of their life, six-year-old Kiash. I am sure quite a few of our readers from the armed forces can relate to what Kamna said about waiting for that one call every Sunday from a phone booth near the National Defence Academy. Forces wives will also see themselves in her decision to give up her career in dentistry to follow him from posting to posting, even as far as Moscow in winter. Elsewhere in this issue, Senior Assistant News Editor Ajish P. Joy takes a relook at the Guantnamo Bay cover we carried in 2013. This was done against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's decision to turn it into a holding camp for undocumented immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union is fighting the move tooth and nail. Very few terror-accused remain in Guantnamo Bay today. A senior editor of your favourite magazine felt that Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney's poem 'Blackberry-Picking' describes most years, if not all. The poem begins with a desire for more, whetted by the taste of a ripe blackberry: '…just one, a glossy purple clot/ Among others, red, green, hard as a knot./…its flesh was sweet/Like thickened wine….' And then leaves you with the feeling that you cannot keep memories, relationships or the taste of a blackberry fresh forever. Time will ensure that everything fades. The editor read the poem for the first time after reading Special Correspondent Anjuly Mathai's article about Caroline Casey, a blind Irish woman who fell in love with an Indian elephant, Kanchi. Casey rode Kanchi across the southern states, crossing the Western Ghats. Once, while crossing over to Coorg, Karnataka, from Kannur, Kerala, they spent an unforgettable night in a village. Unforgettable for many reasons. A cobra terrorised Kanchi, and she roused the whole village. And among the people who gathered was a boy who adored Heaney. Casey was carrying a copy of the Irish poet's anthology, which contained the boy's favourite poem—'Blackberry-Picking'. She read Heaney to the boy and the villagers, by the flickering light of a bonfire. Heaney in the Ghats, by firelight. If that is not magical, then what is? The editor said that he first read Heaney after former US president Joe Biden kept quoting him. Biden, too, has Irish roots. His favourite lines: 'History says, Don't hope On this side of the grave… But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme.' Time might grind hope down to dust, yes. But time also offers hope, I feel. And, healing.","url":"https://www.theweek.in/columns/philip-mathew/2025/12/13/shubhanshu-shukla-the-week-man-of-the-year-heaney-guantanamo.html","image":"/content/dam/week/week/opinion/columns/philip-mathew/images/2025/12/13/3-Shubhankshu-Shukla-new.jpg.transform/schema-1x1/image.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 05:48:00","author":"Philip Mathew","authors":["Philip Mathew"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.383},{"id":387823546,"title":"U.S. Forces Halt Second Merchant Ship Near Venezuela","text":"Washington: US forces on Saturday stopped a vessel off the coast of Venezuela for the second time in less than two weeks as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro.The move, which was confirmed by two US officials familiar with matter, comes days after Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of the South American country and follows the December 10 seizure by American forces of an oil tanker off Venezuela's coast.The officials were not authorized to discuss publicly the ongoing military operation and spoke on condition of anonymity.

It all comes as Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Maduro and warned that the longtime Venezuelan leader's days in power are numbered.Trump this week demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from US oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a blockade against oil tankers travelling to or from the South American country that face American sanctions.Trump cited the lost US investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against Maduro, suggesting the Republican administration's moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking. Some sanctioned tankers already are diverting away from Venezuela.\"We're not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn't be going through, Trump told reporters.

This is the second vessel intercepted in the Caribbean by the Donald Trump administration, which last week seized the Skipper and confiscated the crude oil it was carrying. According to The New York Times , which cites a US official and two sources in the Venezuelan oil industry, the detained ship is called Centuries and is not on the list of tankers sanctioned by the United States. However, the newspaper indicates that the ship belongs to a China-based oil company that transports Venezuelan crude to refineries in the Asian giant.\n\nThe U.S. military provided support in the operation with helicopters that transported Coast Guard personnel to the ship, according to NBC News. So far, Trump has not commented on the matter. The president has intensified his pressure on Venezuela in recent weeks, and recently ordered a total blockade of the entry and exit of oil tankers sanctioned by the US government to the country. Furthermore, the Republican stated last Wednesday that the Caribbean country took away oil rights from US companies. “Remember that they took away all our energy rights. They took all our oil not so long ago. We want it back. They took it from us illegally,” the president told the press.","summary":"The United States intercepted a&#160;Panamanian-flagged oil tanker&#160;on Saturday in international waters of the Caribbean Sea,...\n\n\nThe post A Panamanian-Flagged Oil Tanker was Intercepted Near Venezuela by the United States appeared first on Newsroom Panama.","url":"https://newsroompanama.com/2025/12/20/a-panamanian-flagged-oil-tanker-was-intercepted-near-venezuela-by-the-united-states/","image":"https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-detained-ship-is-called-Centuries.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 00:34:53","author":"Newsroom Panama","authors":["Newsroom Panama"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"pa","sentiment":-0.634},{"id":387818588,"title":"Top Republican Elise Stefanik ditches NY Governor bid and Congress after 'being repeatedly humiliated by Trump'","text":"Elise Stefanik, once seen as one of the MAGA movement's biggest rising stars, retired from Congress and dropped out of the New York governor's race in one fell swoop Friday.\n\nAlthough Donald Trump said in a message following the news that he was 'with her all the way,' a series of humiliations at the president's hands are being blamed for her downfall.\n\nThe second Trump term saw huge promise for Stefanik, who won re-election alongside the president by 25 points in 2024. \n\nShe wasn't set to hold down her seat for very long, however, as Trump had initially nominated her to be the US Ambassador to the United Nations on the back of her work eviscerating Ivy League presidents in Congressional hearings on campus antisemitism.\n\nHowever, in early March, Trump pulled the nomination as Republicans' majority in the House of Representatives fell in danger, even after Stefanik embarked on a farewell tour in her district to thank the constituents she represented in Congress. \n\nStefanik had already gone before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee one day after Trump was sworn into office on January 21 for her confirmation hearing. \n\nShe was expected to fly through the confirmation process with some bipartisan support. But the full vote was never scheduled. \n\nIt appeared Stefanik had found her next move, however, when she announced a run for governor in early November against Democrat Kathy Hochul, who she had deemed 'the worst governor in America.' \n\nHowever, the New York congresswoman lost momentum after Trump's surprisingly friendly meeting at the White House with socialist Big Apple Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nStefanik had gone as far as calling Mamdani a 'jihadist,' something Trump was asked about by the press. \n\n'No, I don't. She's out there campaigning, you know. You say things sometimes in a campaign,' he said, adding that Mamdani was 'a very rational person.'\n\nIn December, Stefanik faced further controversy after a public slamming of Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. \n\nShe had grown frustrated with the route the party was taking after a series of electoral beatdowns by Democrats in November and early December.\n\nStefanik, who served as chair of the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2025, called out Johnson for being 'a political novice' in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.\n\nShe also described Tuesday's results as 'House Republicans underperforming for the first time in the Trump era.'\n\nLess than a week later, Stefanik saw her final insult come at the hands of Trump after Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman announced he would challenge her in the Republican Primary.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. \n\nPresident Trump declined to say if he would endorse Stefanik or Blakeman.\n\nThe President added: 'He's great and she's great. They're both great people.'\n\nLess than two weeks later, Stefanik suspended her campaign for New York governor and said she will not seek reelection to Congress, bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Blakeman. \n\nBut she said, 'It is not an effective use of our time' to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n'I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don´t further focus on my young son´s safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age,' she said.\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a 'fantastic person and congresswoman.'\n\n'Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!' Trump wrote.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump announced he was officially endorsing Blakeman for governor of his former home state.\n\nThe endorsement, while not unexpected, could help ensure that Blakeman doesn't face a serious contender in his push to win the GOP primary and a chance at a likely faceoff against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\n'Bruce is MAGA all the way, and has been with me from the very beginning,' Trump said in a post announcing the endorsement on his Truth Social platform. \n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County, has gained attention for championing a policy that bans transgender athletes from using county sports facilities. \n\nHe has also created a volunteer law enforcement unit that his critics have labeled as a militia and directed county detectives to work alongside federal authorities in Trump´s immigration crackdown.","summary":"Elise Stefanik, once a rising star in the MAGA movement, retired from Congress and dropped out of the New York governor's race in one fell swoop Friday.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15401897/Elise-Stefanik-Trump-congress-governor.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/20/23/104913135-0-image-a-4_1766272347952.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-21 00:26:56","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Elise Stefanik withdrew from the race. Trump announced the endorsement in a lengthy post on Truth Social, calling Blakeman \"highly respected and very popular\" and praising his record on immigration enforcement, public safety and economic issues. \"Highly Respected and very popular Nassau County Executive, Bruce Blakeman, is running to be the next Governor of New York,\" Trump wrote. INSIDE STEFANIK’S EXIT AND HOW THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT THAT NEVER CAME WAS 'BIGGEST PIECE' OF THE 'PUZZLE' The endorsement follows Fox News Digital exclusive reporting that Stefanik’s surprise decision not to run was driven in part by concerns over Trump’s lack of a clear commitment to backing her in the New York governor’s race, according to sources. \"Bruce is MAGA all the way, and has been with me from the very beginning,\" Trump added. In his post, Trump praised Blakeman’s work with federal immigration authorities and local law enforcement, framing the race around border security and crime, issues Republicans have emphasized in historically blue states. \"As Nassau County Executive, he is working tirelessly with the Brave Heroes of ICE, Border Patrol, and Law Enforcement to Keep Our Border SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Safeguard our Community, and Ensure LAW AND ORDER,\" Trump wrote. EXCLUSIVE: STEFANIK STEAMROLLS TOP CONSERVATIVE OPPONENT AS GOP LEADERS HAND HER COMMANDING EDGE IN NY PRIMARY Blakeman welcomed Trump’s endorsement, aligning himself closely with the president’s policy agenda. \"I am blessed and grateful to have the endorsement of President Donald J. Trump,\" Blakeman said in a statement obtained by Fox News. \"President Trump is driving down gasoline prices and slashing the cost of prescription drugs. Securing our borders has made America safer. President Trump loves New York and we will be partners in making New York safe and affordable.\" Trump said Blakeman would continue that agenda statewide if elected. AS NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAMDANI, NEIGHBORING COUNTY DOUBLES DOWN ON TRUMP-STYLE LEADERSHIP WITH BLAKEMAN’S WIN \"As your next Governor, Bruce will continue to fight hard to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes, and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,\" Trump wrote. Blakeman currently serves as Nassau County Executive, leading New York’s largest suburban county. He has positioned himself as a tough-on-crime executive and a vocal critic of New York’s immigration and criminal justice policies. Trump framed the endorsement as part of a broader effort to reclaim what he described as a state in decline under Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul's leadership. \"Bruce Blakeman is a FANTASTIC guy, will win the big November Election and, without hesitation, has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Governor of the ONCE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK (IT CAN BE GREAT AGAIN!),\" Trump wrote. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The endorsement follows Stefanik’s announcement Friday that she would not enter the race, a decision that immediately reshaped the gubernatorial playing field. Stefanik, a close Trump ally and member of House GOP leadership, had been widely viewed as the top candidate heading into 2026. The campaign for Elise Stefanik for Governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Newsweek has contacted the U.S. State Department and Ecuador’s foreign ministry for further comment.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nEcuadorian voters recently rejected a referendum to allow permanent foreign military bases, reaffirming the ban on foreign bases like the one the U.S. previously operated in Manta. The vote came after Ecuador’s president sought U.S. military assistance and supported the opening of U.S. military bases in the ports of Manta and Salinas following Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s visit to the Manta military base in November. \n\nU.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, pictured above is greeted by Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa at Ulpiano Paez Air Base in Salinas, Ecuador, on November 6, 2025.\n\nThe latest move comes amid tensions over the U.S.’ expanded military presence in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific under President Donald Trump’s intensified anti-drug campaign and potential military action against Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro. Ecuador and the U.S have activated a temporary operation at the Manta air base, which Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa described as “part of a long-term bilateral security strategy,” on his X account. The move comes as Ecuador faces an unprecedented surge in drug-related violence, with homicide rates rising sharply over the past three years and criminal groups expanding their control over coastal trafficking routes.\n\nIn an operation earlier this month, U.S. Special Forces under Southern Command assisted Ecuador’s 4th Army Division in a counter‑narcotics action in Esmeraldas on December 3, seizing 1.4 tons of cocaine with a value of about $98 million. Manta, a strategic Pacific port city, previously hosted a U.S. forward operating location until 2009, when Ecuador banned foreign military bases. Several U.S. allies, including El Salvador and the Dominican Republic, have backed U.S. operations, granting American forces access to local bases and airports. Washington has also expanded its regional footprint by reopening Puerto Rico’s Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and sending additional forces to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other governments, such as that of Colombia have been more critical, and tensions between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro have also emerged.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ecuador on Wednesday: “The operation will enhance the capacity of the Ecuadorian military forces to combat narco-terrorists, including strengthening intelligence gathering and anti-drug trafficking capabilities, and is designed to protect the United States and Ecuador from the threats we share.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nIf the U.S. strikes Venezuela, Latin America’s readiness to challenge U.S. military force will be tested, according to a recent assessment by the Council on Foreign Relations, which added that the region is currently “highly fragmented,” with nations primarily pursuing their own agendas.\n\nRussia Issues ‘Fatal Mistake’ Warning to Trump Admin Over Venezuela\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry issued a new warning to the Trump administration on Thursday amid escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela. “We note continuous and deliberate attempts to escalate tensions with our ally Venezuela. Unilateral decisions creating a threat to international shipping are particularly alarming,” the ministry said in a statement, per Russia’s Tass news agency. “Hopefully, the Trump administration, known for pursuing a rational and practical policy course, will stop short of making a fatal mistake and refrain from escalating things down a path that may cause unpredictable consequences for the entire Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Tuesday that the U.S. had imposed a “total and complete” blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, saying that the country had taken what was rightfully the U.S.’s oil, land, and other assets. Russia has been a longtime ally of Venezuela, as has Iran, and the country has the world’s largest oil reserves, meaning Trump’s actions in the region will have a global impact.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nMoscow’s message comes after Trump said on Tuesday that the U.S. military build-up around Venezuela would continue to grow until it returns the “oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.” Concern has been growing in the U.S. and around the world that Trump is on the verge of declaring war with Venezuela after months of targeted deadly strikes on alleged drug smuggling vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean led up to a Venezuelan oil tanker being seized by the U.S. On Wednesday, another lethal strike was carried out in international waters in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, according to the U.S. Southern Command, killing four alleged smugglers. In all, 98 people have been killed by U.S. forces. \n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, pictured above, has insisted the operations are lawful. He has framed them as “lethal, kinetic strikes” intended to destroy “narco-boats” and kill “narco-terrorists,” while asserting that every trafficker killed was tied to a designated terrorist organization. Speaking about the blockade on Wednesday, Trump cited the lost U.S. investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against leader Nicolás Maduro, suggesting his administration’s moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking.\n\nSome sanctioned tankers are already diverting away from Venezuela. Russia’s Foreign Ministry affirmed Thursday its solidarity with Venezuelans, and the Maduro administration’s efforts to protect the country’s national interests and sovereignty. Iran has shared similar messages of solidarity, as the U.S. has moved military resources closer to the South American nation.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump, speaking about the blockade on Wednesday: “We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through. You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it—they illegally took it.” Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, speaking on Wednesday: “It is simply a warmongering and colonialist pretense, and we have said so many times, and now everyone sees the truth. The truth has been revealed. The aim in Venezuela is a regime change to impose a puppet government that wouldn’t last 47 hours, that would hand over the Constitution, sovereignty, and all the wealth, turning Venezuela into a colony. It will simply never happen.” Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X on Wednesday: “Congress authorizes any military action into Venezuela, not the president. I’ll keep holding the Administration accountable for their actions.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nWhile U.S. forces have been maneuvered into the waters around Venezuela, and the blockade continues on Venezuelan oil tankers, Trump has yet to announce full-scale military action against the country.","summary":"U.S. Air Force personnel have joined forces with their Ecuadorian counterparts at a base in...\n\n\nThe post Update: US Military Gains Access to South America Air Base appeared first on Newsroom Panama.","url":"https://newsroompanama.com/2025/12/20/update-us-military-gains-access-to-south-america-air-base/","image":"https://newsroompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MANTA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:47:24","author":"Newsroom Panama","authors":["Newsroom Panama"],"language":"en","source_country":"pa","sentiment":0.051},{"id":387818974,"title":"US, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye urge restraint in Gaza as Israeli attacks continue  - Guyana Inquirer – Daily","text":"The United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye have urged the parties to the Gaza ceasefire to honour their commitments and show restraint, the chief US envoy says after talks in the US city of Miami.\n\nSenior officials from the four mediator countries met Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump’s special envoy, on Friday to review the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which took effect on October 10, according to a joint statement released on Saturday.\n\nThe meeting was held against the backdrop of ongoing Israeli attacks on the enclave. The Palestinian Civil Defence in Gaza said that six people were killed on Friday when an Israeli strike hit a school housing displaced people, raising the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the deal took effect to about 400.\n\n“We reaffirm our full commitment to the entirety of the President’s [Trump’s] 20-point peace plan and call on all parties to uphold their obligations, exercise restraint, and cooperate with monitoring arrangements,” Witkoff said in a statement posted on X.\n\nFirst phase of truce\n\nSaturday’s statement cited progress yielded in the first stage of the peace agreement, including expanded humanitarian assistance, the return of captives’ bodies, partial force withdrawals and a reduction in hostilities.\n\nIt called for “the near-term establishment and operationalisation” of a transitional administration, which is due to happen in the second phase of the agreement, and said that consultations would continue in the coming weeks over its implementation.\n\nUnder the truce deal’s terms, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, an interim authority is to govern the Palestinian territory instead of Hamas, and an international stabilisation force is to be deployed.\n\nOn Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed hope that countries would contribute troops for the stabilisation force, but also urged the disarmament of Hamas, warning the process would unravel unless that happened.\n\nA meeting was also held between Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, and Turkish intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin in Istanbul on Saturday.\n\nIn a statement from Hamas after the meeting, the group said it was committed to abiding by the ceasefire agreement, despite Israeli violations.\n\n“The delegation stressed the urgent need to halt these continuous violations,” the statement added.\n\n“The delegation also reviewed the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip with the onset of winter, emphasising the critical priority of urgently bringing in tents, caravans, and heavy equipment to save our people from death by cold and drowning, given the destruction of infrastructure and homes.”\n\nWinter storms have been worsening the conditions for hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza, as aid agencies warn that Israeli restrictions are preventing lifesaving assistance from reaching people across the besieged enclave.\n\nBodies recovered, Israeli strikes continue\n\nOn Saturday, an Israeli air strike targeted two people in northern Gaza, according to a statement from the military, which alleged that they “posed an immediate threat” to Israeli troops after crossing the so-called yellow line, which separates areas under Israeli army control from those where Palestinians are permitted to move.\n\nNo details were yet available on whether the two people were killed or injured.\n\nGaza’s Civil Defence on Saturday also said it recovered the bodies of 94 Palestinians from the rubble in the enclave.\n\nThe bodies were retrieved in central Gaza City and transferred to the forensic department at Al-Shifa Medical Complex to arrange their burial in the Martyrs’ Cemetery in the central city of Deir el-Balah, according to a statement from the Civil Defence.\n\nThousands of Palestinians are believed to still be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings in Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli army has killed more than 70,700 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, and injured more than 171,000 others since it began its genocidal war on the enclave in October 2023.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/us-egypt-qatar-turkiye-urge-restraint-in-gaza-as-israeli-attacks-continue/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/12/afp_694714dfc902-1766266079-C7YUu0.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:39:01","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":387809302,"title":"Putin envoy touts ‘constructive’ talks in Miami","text":"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, has described talks in Miami with senior US interlocutors as “constructive,” signaling continued momentum in backchannel diplomacy aimed at exploring a potential settlement to the Ukraine conflict.\n\nDmitriev is holding talks with senior US officials, including President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, according to sources familiar with the meetings. The discussions reportedly revolve around a US peace plan that would require Ukraine to relinquish parts of Russia’s Donbass region that it still controls, freeze the front lines in Russia’s Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, agree to neutrality, and reduce the size of its armed forces. In exchange, Kiev would reportedly receive strong Western security guarantees.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. We will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Dmitriev said in a brief comment to journalists around 5pm local time on Friday, without providing further details.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Dmitriev publicly criticized what he described as coordinated media attacks timed to undermine the negotiations. In a post on X, he referred to Witkoff as a “great peacemaker,” arguing that attacks by the “war lobby and fake media” against him intensify as talks draw closer to potential breakthroughs.\n\nThe Miami talks come as several European powers push to insert themselves into the US-led diplomatic track.

In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. \n\nThe Justice Department did not say why the files were removed or whether their disappearance was intentional. A spokesperson for the department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOnline, the unexplained missing files fueled speculation about what was taken down and why the public was not notified, compounding long-standing intrigue about Epstein and the powerful figures who surrounded him. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee pointed to the missing image featuring a Trump photo in a post on X, writing: “What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.”\n\nThe episode deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department’s much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein’s crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.\n\nScant new insight in the initial disclosures\n\nSome of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department’s initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.\n\nMissing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions — records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.\n\nThe gaps go further. \n\nThe records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability\n\nAmong the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department’s decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.\n\nThe releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein’s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.\n\nThere was a series of never-before-seen photos of former President Bill Clinton but fleetingly few of Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.\n\nDespite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors’ names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.\n\nThat approach angered some Epstein accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the law forced the department to act. Instead of marking the end of a yearslong battle for transparency, the document release Friday was merely the beginning of an indefinite wait for a complete picture of Epstein’s crimes and the steps taken to investigate them.\n\n“I feel like again the DOJ, the justice system is failing us,” said Marina Lacerda, who alleges Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York City mansion when she was 14.\n\nMany of the long-anticipated records were redacted or lacked context\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York brought sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019, but he killed himself in jail after his arrest.\n\nThe documents just made public were a sliver of potentially millions of pages records in the department’s possession. In one example, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, though many duplicated material already turned over by the FBI.\n\nMany of the records released so far had been made public in court filings, congressional releases or freedom of information requests, though, for the first time, they were all in one place and available for the public to search for free.\n\nOnes that were new were often lacking necessary context or heavily blacked out. A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY,” likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019 or Maxwell in 2021, was entirely blacked out.\n\nTrump’s Republican allies seized on the Clinton images, including photos of the Democrat with singers Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and even Epstein with TV newscaster Walter Cronkite. But none of the photos had captions and was no explanation given for why any of them were together.\n\nThe meatiest records released so far showed that federal prosecutors had what appeared to be a strong case against Epstein in 2007 yet never charged him.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings, released publicly for the first time, included testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein. The youngest was 14 and in ninth grade.\n\nOne had told investigators about being sexually assaulted by Epstein when she initially resisted his advances during a massage.\n\nAnother, then 21, testified before the grand jury about how Epstein had hired her when she was 16 to perform a sexual massage and how she had gone on to recruit other girls to do the same.\n\n“For every girl that I brought to the table he would give me $200,” she said. They were mostly people she knew from high school, she said. “I also told them that if they are under age, just lie about it and tell him that you are 18.”\n\nThe documents also contain a transcript of an interview Justice Department lawyers did more than a decade later with the U.S. attorney who oversaw the case, Alexander Acosta, about his ultimate decision not to bring federal charges.\n\nAcosta, who was labor secretary during Trump’s first term, cited concerns about whether a jury would believe Epstein’s accusers.\n\nHe also said the Justice Department might have been more reluctant to make a federal prosecution out of a case that straddled the legal border between sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, something more commonly handled by state prosecutors.\n\n“I’m not saying it was the right view,” Acosta added. He also said that the public today would likely view the survivors differently.\n\n“There’s been a lot of changes in victim shaming,” Acosta said.\n\nJennifer Freeman, an attorney representing Epstein accuser Maria Farmer, on Saturday said her client feels vindicated after the document release. Farmer sought for years documents backing up her claim that Epstein and Maxwell were in possession of child sexual abuse images.\n\n“It’s a triumph and a tragedy,” she said. “It looks like the government did absolutely nothing. Horrible things have happened and if they investigated in even the smallest way, they could have stopped him.”\n\nAssociated Press journalists Ali Swenson, Christopher L. Keller, Kristin M. Hall, Aaron Kessler and Mike Catalini contributed to this report.","summary":"At least 16 files have disappeared from the DOJ webpage for documents related to Jeffrey Epstein  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/release-epstein-files-justice-department-trump-9290fcaad1cb6fcb1cbc1befabc01994","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/7d676c2/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3600x2554+0+0/resize/1486x1054!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F78%2F54%2Fc8c0ee6fff96fb3a482d898c70e0%2Fffeb8cdd42424abcb3c7566cfdcbd9de","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:21:00","author":"David B.

Over 1,800 photographs were taken inside the massive nine-story residence over two separate days.\n\nThe mural of the young boy was painted by Jorge Alvarez, a Cuban-American artist based in Miami, Florida. Epstein spent a lot of time socializing in Palm Beach, roughly 65 miles north of Miami.\n\nAlvarez did not respond to a Daily Mail request for comment.\n\nAlvarez painted the 83 inch by 126 inch mural titled 'Coming of Age Ceremony' in 1995. Currently, the painting is in the possession of Collective Hudson Auction House in Kingston, a town in upstate New York about 100 miles north of the city.\n\nCollective Hudson held an auction on September 21, 2025, but no one bought the painting. Its estimated value is anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\nDozens of paintings were sold that day and there were only a few that buyers passed on.\n\nThe trove of photos of Epstein's townhouse revealed other interested tidbits about how he was living right up until he was busted a second time for sex crimes.\n\nHis initials were posted in golden letters right outside his front door, so anyone walking by could see he lived there.\n\nNear the entryway was a wraparound desk with seven computer monitors.\n\nA February 2024 lawsuit filed by two of Epstein's accusers claimed Epstein's 'New York mansion had a room in which men that Epstein hired monitored what was happening in the home.'\n\nA review of the photos taken throughout the home confirms what was previously known about Epstein's personality.\n\nHe was deeply obsessed with sex and women's bodies, given that countless rooms featured paintings or photographs of nude women in suggestive poses.\n\nOther bizarre decorative choices included a bronze statue of a young boy wearing a sideways ballcap and a statue of a young-looking woman in a bridal dress clinging onto a rope.\n\nOne of the home's many bathrooms had a photo of two young boys grabbing the front of their underwear and looking down at their private parts. \n\nAnother room had a taxidermized tiger lying on the floor.\n\nThe FBI's exploration of the house also revealed an unsigned note that expressed support for Epstein and referred to the girls he trafficked as 'runaways'.\n\n'Watch out for people coming at you,' a portion of the note read. 'I will be pulling for you Mr. Epstein. I really am!!'\n\nThe DOJ released thousands of documents from Epstein investigative files on Friday, the deadline set out by a law that was signed last month by President Donald Trump.\n\nGiven that authorities have already acknowledged there are millions of pages of documents in their possession related to Epstein, Democratic lawmakers were quick to accuse the DOJ of violating the governing the files' release.\n\nThe law, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, states that the Attorney General must make 'all unclassified records' available in a searchable format 30 days after its enactment.\n\n'The Justice Department's document dump this afternoon does not comply with Thomas Massie's and my Epstein Transparency Act. \n\n'They released one document from a New York grand jury of 119 pages. Totally blacked out,' Ro Khanna, the California Democratic congressman who co-authored the law, said in a video posted to social media on Friday evening.\n\n'It is an incomplete release, with too many redactions. Thomas Massie and I are exploring all options. It can be the impeachment of people at Justice, inherent contempt or referring for prosecution those who are obstructing justice,' Khanna added.\n\nMassie, the other author of the law, said much the same as Khanna, calling out Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy, Todd Blanche, for failing 'to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.'\n\nMassie implied that Bondi, Blanche and others at the DOJ could be convicted of obstruction under a future presidential administration.\n\nAhead of the release, Blanche said during a Fox News interview that he expected to release 'several hundred thousand documents' on Friday.\n\n'I expect that we’re going to release more documents over the next couple of weeks, so today several hundred thousand and then over the next couple weeks, I expect several hundred thousand more,' he added.\n\nThe most explosive photos to come out have been pictures of former President Bill Clinton with Epstein, which has prompted some accuse the DOJ of selectively releasing damaging information about liberals.\n\nIn one photo, Clinton was seen swimming in a pool with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's sex trafficking accomplice and former girlfriend. \n\nThe president, who has also been featured in photographs released by House Democrats, has so far remained silent on the release.\n\nHe has previously admitted to a friendship with the disgraced financier but has long maintained he severed ties before Epstein's sex crime conviction.\n\nTrump has not been accused of any illegal activity and when the White House was reached for comment, an automatic reply from spokeswoman Abigail Jackson was sent back.\n\nThe lengthy statement said the Trump administration is 'transparent' on the Epstein issue and also hurled accusations at Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett, a non-voting member of the House of Representatives from the US Virgin Islands.\n\n'The Trump Administration is the most transparent in history. By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,' the statement from Jackson began. \n\n'And while President Trump is delivering on his promises, Democrats like Hakeem Jeffries and Stacey Plaskett have yet to explain why they were soliciting money and meetings from Epstein after he was a convicted sex offender. The American people deserve answers,' Jackson concluded.","summary":"The creepy mural, proudly displayed in a bedroom, showed a boy prancing around naked as demonic-looking figures in the background looked on.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15401485/jeffrey-epstein-files-young-boy-mural-new-york-mansion.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/20/16/104904451-0-image-m-14_1766247885452.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:17:33","author":"Brittany Chain,Editor,James Cirrone","authors":["Brittany Chain","Editor","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.014},{"id":387811762,"title":"U.S. seizes another oil tanker off Venezuelan coast","text":"The United States has seized ‌an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed today, a move that comes just days after President Donald Trump announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\n\nThis would mark the second time in recent weeks that the United States has seized a tanker near Venezuela and comes amid a large U.S. military build-up in the region.\n\nNoem confirmed the Coast Guard seized a tanker that ‍was last docked in Venezuela.\n\n“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” she said in a statement posted to social media. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”\n\nThree U.S. officials earlier today had told Reuters that the vessel had been seized.\n\nThe Coast Guard and Pentagon referred questions to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request ​for comment. Venezuela’s oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nBritish maritime risk ​management company Vanguard said the vessel was believed to be the Panama-flagged Centuries, which was intercepted east of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nJeremy Paner, a partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Hughes Hubbard and a former OFAC investigator, said the vessel has not been sanctioned by the U.S.\n\n“The seizure of a vessel that is not sanctioned by the U.S. marks a further increase in Trump’s pressure on ‍Venezuela,” Paner said. “It also runs counter to Trump’s statement that the U.S. would impose a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers.”\n\nTrump on Tuesday ​said he was ordering “A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and ⁠out of, Venezuela.”\n\nIn the days since U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, there has been an effective embargo in place, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure.\n\nSince the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply.\n\nWhile many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil ⁠and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly the U.S.’ Chevron, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels a day, analysts have said.\n\nFor now, the oil market is well supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.\n\nSince the U.S. imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, traders and refiners buying Venezuelan oil have resorted to a “shadow fleet” of ⁠tankers that disguise their location and to vessels sanctioned for transporting Iranian or Russian oil.\n\nThe dark or shadow fleet is considered exposed to possible punitive ‍measures from the U.S., shipping analysts have said.

Here's everything you need to know.","text":"The United States is reviewing the social media accounts of some visa applicants&comma; adding another hurdle for workers and other visitors to clear under the Trump administration.It&apos;s also adding a hurdle for embassies processing those visa applications.The State Department said in June that certain visa applicants would have their online activity vetted as part of its screening process. Six months later&comma; the department expanded the list of visas that were subject to \"online presence reviews.\"The new rule has complicated the visa application process&comma; causing significant delays for approvals.They have also rattled some companies&comma; including Google and Apple&comma; whose legal counsels have advised staffers requiring a visa stamp to re-enter the US not to leave the country due to extended processing times resulting from the new requirements.Consular offices began conducting online presence reviews for H-1B applicants on December 15&comma; but they&apos;re not the only ones affected.Here is what you need to know.Earlier this month&comma; a State Department spokesperson told Business Insider that the US is requiring H-1B visa applicants and their dependents to make their social media accounts public so consular officers can review their activity.The H-1B visa program enables companies to temporarily employ foreign skilled workers in specialized roles. Data collected from the Department of Labor showed that almost 50% of H-1B applications are in \"professional&comma; scientific&comma; and technical\" fields. They are commonly relied on in the tech industry.The State Department said international students and exchange visitors are also subject to \"online presence\" reviews&comma; specifically for F&comma; M&comma; and J non-immigrant visa applicants.In its memo&comma; Google&apos;s legal counsel told staffers that lengthy processing delays were affecting H-1B&comma; H-4&comma; F&comma; J&comma; and M visa holders.Federal agencies under President Donald Trump are enforcing stricter and more restrictive immigration policies.In January&comma; Trump issued an executive order aimed at enhancing immigration screening. It was meant to protect American citizens from those the administration says \"intend to commit terrorist attacks&comma; threaten our national security&comma; espouse hateful ideology&comma; or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\"Trump expanded upon that executive order in June and then again this week. Combined&comma; those subsequent orders partially or fully restrict entry for citizens from 25 countries.In September&comma; the Trump administration also began charging a $100&comma;000 fee for new H-1B applications.It cast the fee as a corrective. Trump said that the H-1B system had strayed from its original purpose of filling high-skilled worker shortages and was instead being \"deliberately exploited to replace&comma; rather than supplement&comma; American workers with lower-paid&comma; lower-skilled labor.\"In its announcement about the social media checks on December 3&comma; the State Department said the changes were meant to increase national security.\"A US visa is a privilege&comma; not a right&comma;\" a spokesperson for the State Department told Business Insider at the time. \"In every visa case&comma; we will take the time necessary to ensure an applicant does not pose a risk to the safety and security of the United States.\"It might be tempting to delete your social media accounts&comma; but it&apos;s not that simple.The law firm Davis Wright Tremaine advised in a post on its website that visa applicants should review their social media to ensure there is no information that might contradict the details submitted in their applications. The law firm Duane Morris advised against deleting posts or profiles. If an immigration official notices&comma; it could be seen as evasive.Perhaps the most important thing a visa applicant can do is stay in the US during the process.Shaun Foster&comma; an immigration attorney who owns the firm PampaninFoster based in Cambridge&comma; Mass.&comma; told Business Insider in a LinkedIn message that he is encouraging clients on H-1B visas to play it safe.\"We&apos;ve continued to emphasize generally to stay in the US&comma; and to keep moving forward in working toward your immigration goals from within the US&comma;\" he wrote. \"We&apos;re much better positioned&comma; as immigration counsel&comma; to more strongly assist and guide people from within the US. There&apos;s less control when you start integrating international consular elements.\"Lawyers for Google and Apple have already advised some employees on visas not to travel outside the US due to delays at embassies stemming from the increased scrutiny.\"Please be aware that some US Embassies and Consulates are experiencing significant visa stamping appointment delays&comma; currently reported as up to 12 months&comma;\" Google&apos;s legal counsel wrote in a memo sent on Thursday to employees on visas.Fragomen&comma; a law firm that represents Apple&comma; similarly said in a memo sent last week to some visa holders at the company that they should refrain from travel.\"Given the recent updates and the possibility of unpredictable&comma; extended delays when returning to the US&comma; we strongly recommend that employees without a valid H-1B visa stamp avoid international travel for now&comma;\" the memo said.Both memos were seen by Business Insider.Those companies and many others are still smarting after Trump imposed the $100&comma;000 fee on new H-1B visa applicants in September.After that order&comma; which initially didn&apos;t specify that it only applied to new applicants&comma; human resources teams at companies like Google&comma; Amazon&comma; Microsoft&comma; Meta&comma; Salesforce&comma; JPMorgan&comma; and Zoom sent warnings to staffers advising them not to leave the US if they&apos;re on an H-1B visa.In one case&comma; dozens of H-1B holders on an Emirates flight out of San Francisco began deplaning as soon as they received the news alert. The widespread panic in corporate America forced the Trump administration to clarify that the fee would only apply to new visa applicants&comma; not existing visa holders.","summary":"The Department of Homeland Security is now reviewing the social media of some visa applicants, causing delays in processing for some foreign workers.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-visa-requirements-social-media-review-what-to-know-h1b-2025-12","image":"https://i.insider.com/6946cfa704eda4732f2deec1?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:09:52","author":"Lakshmi Varanasi,Lauren Edmonds","authors":["Lakshmi Varanasi","Lauren Edmonds"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":387800176,"title":"Google, Apple Reportedly Warns Staff With U.S. Visas Against International Travel Due To Embassy Delays","text":"Dec 19 (Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google and Apple have advised some employees on U.S. work visas to avoid international travel due to delays of up to 12 months for visa stamping appointments at embassies, Business Insider reported on Friday citing internal memos.\n\nImmigration law firms representing the companies said the delays stem from new social media screening requirements, warning that staff risk being stranded outside the U.S. if appointments are postponed, the report said.\n\nThe advisory applies to holders of H-1B, H-4, F, J and M visas, according to Google’s memo, which said some U.S. embassies and consulates face appointment delays of up to a year, according to the report.\n\nGoogle and Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump this month announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, including screening social media accounts.\n\nThe H-1B visa program, widely used by the U.S. technology sector to hire skilled workers from India and China, has been under the spotlight after the Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee for new applications this year.\n\nIn September, Google’s parent company Alphabet had strongly advised its employees to avoid international travel and urged H-1B visa holders to remain in the U.S., according to an email seen by Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Ruchika Khanna in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Rajveer Singh Pardesi in Bengaluru; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman, William Mallard and Diane Craft)","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/google-apple-reportedly-warns-staff-visas-against-international-travel-embassy-delays_n_694729bce4b00a59b4a6e728?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69472c53190000f5817f4b60.jpeg?cache=CU2z4lzrNW&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 23:09:38","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.629},{"id":387818608,"title":"New Melania film features a 'priceless' Renoir painting on the wall of her office... but the actual artwork is in a gallery in London","text":"As America's First Lady sits in her gilded Trump Tower office, the decor is undeniably ostentatious – marble columns, gold statues and a Louis XIV desk – while on the wall hangs what appears to be a masterpiece by Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nTitled La Loge, or The Theatre Box, it features a fashionable couple attending a show in Paris and is considered a priceless work which exemplifies the Impressionist artist's dazzling technique.\n\nBut if viewers of a new film about Melania Trump are fooled into thinking the artwork is genuine, true aficionados will not be.

(AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he’s endorsing Nassau County’s Republican executive for governor in next fall’s New York race, just a day after the president’s longtime ally Rep. Elise Stefanik announced she was suspending her candidacy.\n\nThe endorsement, while not unexpected, could help ensure that Bruce Blakeman, who leads the suburban county on Long Island, doesn’t face a serious contender in his push to win the GOP primary and a chance at a likely faceoff against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\n“Bruce is MAGA all the way, and has been with me from the very beginning,” Trump said in a post announcing the endorsement on his Truth Social platform.\n\nStefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for governor and will not seek reelection to Congress.\n\nThe race between Stefanik and Blake had been expected to be competitive. Stefanik in announcing her decision said she wanted to avoid an “unnecessary and protracted Republican primary.”\n\nStefanik has been a steadfast ally of Trump, who nominated her to serve as his ambassador to the United Nations only to withdraw it because of concerns about potentially further eroding the GOP’s narrow majority in the House.\n\nStefanik announced her decision just days after Blakeman formally announced his candidacy. \n\nTrump on Monday, amid reports Blakeman would jump into the race, declined to take a side in the primary race when asked about Blakeman and Stefanik, instead telling reporters, “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County, has gained attention for championing a policy that bans transgender athletes from using county sports facilities. He has also created a volunteer law enforcement unit that his critics have labeled as a militia and directed county detectives to work alongside federal authorities in Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe Hochul campaign suggested that Trump’s embrace of Blakeman should be a turnoff to the state’s voters.\n\n“Donald Trump endorsed Bruce Blakeman for one reason: he’ll put Trump first, New York last, and leave families to foot the bill,” said Hochul campaign communications director Sarafina Chitika.","summary":"Trump endorses county executive for NY governor, days after longtime ally Stefanik suspends campaign  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-new-york-governor-blakeman-endorsement-8175abd3faf929c57f49356fa7c3ccdb","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/fe7322b/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2543x1695+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F9b%2Fad%2Fa25b1b686b0a0f6927703f59aef0%2F9a29912998574e7880b345ec59ead91b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 22:47:00","author":"Aamer Madhani","authors":["Aamer Madhani"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.065},{"id":387797784,"title":"Vivek Ramaswamy turns to conservative youth to shape the movement’s next phase, analyzes 2026 races","text":"Ohio gubernatorial candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy warned conservatives not to take any political races for granted, including his own – and commented on what AmericaFest means for the future of the right as it draws in thousands of voters and activists, including youth.

We'll do those things. But the direct way we can help people is put more money in people's pockets by bringing down the property tax burden, by taking the income tax rate down to zero, so people are actually able to have more money to afford things, not just waiting for costs to come down,\" he said.

Venezuela's oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe Venezuelan government called the tanker interception a \"serious act of international piracy.\"\n\nVenezuela \"denounces and rejects the theft and hijacking of a new private vessel transporting oil, as well as the forced disappearance of its crew, committed by military personnel of the United States of America in international waters,\" the statement said.\n\nCaracas said the actions will be reported to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral organizations and governments.\n\nBritish maritime risk management company Vanguard said the vessel was believed to be the Panama-flagged Centuries, which was intercepted east of Barbados in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nJeremy Paner, a partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Hughes Hubbard and a former OFAC investigator, said the vessel has not been sanctioned by the U.S.\n\nAd Break Coming Up \n\n NEXT StayNext\n\nOffEnglish \n\n 180p288p360p480p540p576p720pHD1080pHDAuto (180p) \n\nAbout ConnatixV77500197 \nAbout ConnatixV77500197 \n\nContinue watchingafter the adVisit Advertiser websiteGO TO PAGE\n\n\"The seizure of a vessel that is not sanctioned by the U.S. marks a further increase in Trump’s pressure on Venezuela,\" Paner said. \"It also runs counter to Trump’s statement that the U.S. would impose a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers.\"\n\nTRUMP CALLS FOR 'COMPLETE BLOCKADE'\n\nTrump on Tuesday said he was ordering \"A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela.\"\n\nIn the days since U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week, there has been an effective embargo in place, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure.\n\nSince the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply.\n\nWhile many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country's oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned, and some companies, particularly the U.S.' Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorized ships.\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels per day, analysts have said.\n\nFor now, the oil market is well supplied and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload. If the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.\n\nSince the U.S. imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela in 2019, traders and refiners buying Venezuelan oil have resorted to a \"shadow fleet\" of tankers that disguise their location and to vessels sanctioned for transporting Iranian or Russian oil.\n\nThe dark or shadow fleet is considered exposed to possible punitive measures from the U.S., shipping analysts have said.\n\nCenturies, which loaded in Venezuela under the false name \"Crag\" and is part of the dark fleet, was carrying some 1.8 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China, according to internal documents from state oil company PDVSA, the oil's seller.\n\nThe vessel departed Venezuelan waters on Wednesday after being briefly escorted by the Venezuelan navy, according to company sources and satellite images obtained by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nThe crude was bought by Satau Tijana Oil Trading, one of many intermediaries involved in PDVSA's sales to Chinese independent refiners, the documents showed.\n\nAs of this week, of more than 70 oil tankers in Venezuelan waters that are part of the shadow fleet, around 38 are under sanctions by the U.S. Treasury, according to data from TankerTrackers.com. Of those, at least 15 are loaded with crude and fuel, it added.\n\nTrump's pressure campaign on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near Venezuela, which have killed at least 100 people.\n\nTrump has also said that U.S. land strikes on the South American country will soon start.\n\nVenezuela's Maduro has alleged that the U.S. military build-up is aimed at overthrowing him and gaining control of the OPEC nation's oil resources, which are the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nReporting by Idrees Ali, Phil Stewart, Marianna Parraga, Timothy Gardner and Lucinda Elliott; Additional writing by Nolan McCaskill; Editing by Alison Williams, Sergio Non, Franklin Paul, Nick Zieminski and Diane Craft\n\nPurchase Licensing Rights\n\nIdrees AliThomson ReutersNational security correspondent focusing on the Pentagon in Washington D.C.

She also posted on social media an unclassified video of a U.S helicopter landing personnel on a vessel called Centuries.\n\nA crude oil tanker flying under the flag of Panama operates under the name and was recently spotted near the Venezuelan coast, according to MarineTraffic, a project that tracks the movement of vessels around the globe using publicly available data. It was not immediately clear if the vessel was under U.S. sanctions.\n\n“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem wrote on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”\n\nThe action was a “consented boarding,” with the tanker stopping voluntarily and allowing U.S. forces to board it, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nPentagon and White House officials did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.\n\nTrump following the first tanker seizure, of a vessel named the Skipper, this month vowed that the U.S. would carry out a blockade of Venezuela. It all comes as Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Maduro and warned that the longtime Venezuelan leader’s days in power are numbered.\n\nAnd the president this week demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country that face American sanctions.\n\nTrump cited the lost U.S. investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against Maduro, suggesting the Republican administration’s moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking. Some sanctioned tankers already are diverting away from Venezuela.\n\n“We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it — they illegally took it.”\n\nU.S. oil companies dominated Venezuela’s petroleum industry until the country’s leaders moved to nationalize the sector, first in the 1970s and again in the 21st century under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Compensation offered by Venezuela was deemed insufficient, and in 2014 an international arbitration panel ordered the country’s socialist government to pay $1.6 billion to ExxonMobil.\n\nThe targeting of tankers comes as Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.\n\nThe strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Coast Guard, sometimes with help from the Navy, had typically interdicted boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea, searched for illicit cargo, and arrested the people aboard for prosecution.\n\nThe administration has justified the strikes as necessary, asserting it is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels aimed at halting the flow of narcotics into the United States. Maduro faces federal charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. in recent months has sent a fleet of warships to the region, the largest buildup of forces in generations, and Trump has stated repeatedly that land attacks are coming soon.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from power.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle.”\n\nMadhani reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2025 The Associated Press.

Instead of marking the end of a yearslong battle for transparency, the document release Friday was merely the beginning of an indefinite wait for a complete picture of Epstein’s crimes and the steps taken to investigate them.\n\n“I feel like again the DOJ, the justice system is failing us,” said Marina Lacerda, who alleges Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York City mansion when she was 14.\n\nMany of the long-anticipated records were redacted or lacked context\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York brought sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019, but he killed himself in jail after his arrest.\n\nThe documents just made public were a sliver of potentially millions of pages records in the department’s possession. In one example, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, though many duplicated material already turned over by the FBI.\n\nMany of the records released so far had been made public in court filings, congressional releases or freedom of information requests, though, for the first time, they were all in one place and available for the public to search for free.\n\nOnes that were new were often lacking necessary context or heavily blacked out. A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY,” likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019 or Maxwell in 2021, was entirely blacked out.\n\nTrump’s Republican allies seized on the Clinton images, including photos of the Democrat with singers Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and even Epstein with TV newscaster Walter Cronkite. But none of the photos had captions and was no explanation given for why any of them were together.\n\nThe meatiest records released so far showed that federal prosecutors had what appeared to be a strong case against Epstein in 2007 yet never charged him.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings, released publicly for the first time, included testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein.

It was very successful. We hit every site flawlessly and we are restoring peace through strength all over the world.’\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth later posted on social media: ‘This is not the beginning of a war – it is a declaration of vengeance. Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue. As we said directly following the savage attack, if you target Americans – anywhere in the world – you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.’\n\nTwo National Guard members and an interpreter were killed in an attack on December 13 on a convoy in the town of Palmyra. Three American soldiers were also wounded.\n\nSyria’s interior ministry said the killer was a member of its own security forces. IS said the convoy attack was a decisive moment that was intended to dispel doubt among its supporters.\n\nMilitary analysts say the Palmyra killings have forced the Syrian government to increase co-operation with its partners.\n\nThat includes, not just the US, but neighbouring Jordan and Kurdish-led Syrian fighters.\n\nSyria’s government is led by rebels who toppled Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war.

Duffy was set to speak this weekend at AmericaFest (AmFest), and also touched on his special friendship with Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk, who was murdered Sept. 10 during an event in Utah. \"First off, President [Donald] Trump has been a remarkable leader. What he cares about is making government work better, making sure he's implementing the right policies for the American people: Not the rich, not the powerful, but average, everyday Americans,\" Duffy said when asked about the Department of Transportation's (DOT) crackdown on the trucking crisis. Duffy sprang into action earlier this year after an Indian national who authorities said was issued a CDL by California allegedly killed a carload of people after he attempted an illegal U-Turn on Florida’s Turnpike. FLORIDA CFO ROLLS OUT NEW PUSH TO BLOCK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM TAPPING STATE SYSTEMS: ‘LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST’ Duffy expanded his efforts, warning Pennsylvania’s PennDOT and other agencies after illegal immigrants captured out-of-state were found to have non-domiciled CDLs issued by blue-state agencies. In PennDOT’s case, an agency official told Fox News Digital a Philadelphia resident named in the sweep had not drawn any red flags in a federal database it used to verify him. \"As you've seen, Homeland Security focused on the border and illegal migrants in the country. What we found at DOT is a different set of problems,\" Duffy said, adding that too many states have offered licenses to ineligible foreigners. \"They're not qualified to get a license. And under [former President] Joe Biden's tenure; [former Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg's tenure; millions of people have come into the country. And it seems like states across the country have offered commercial driver licenses to many of those people,\" he said. AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLED MY DAUGHTER. KATIE AND ILLINOIS ARE BOTH GETTING JUSTICE \"The problem is that you endanger the safety of everyday Americans who use our roadways. And so what we've done at DOT is say, ‘Listen, unless you comply with our rules, we are going to take money away from your state.’\" He added that DOT has therefore pressed for compliance from problem states, sharing that California has since revoked 17,000 problematic non-domiciled CDL licenses. On the other side of the country, Duffy said that more than half of the non-domiciled CDLs issued by NYSDOT were \"issued illegally.\" ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CAUGHT AND RELEASED BY BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOW CHARGED IN WASHINGTON VEHICULAR HOMICIDE Those New York drivers, he said, may not even be legally present in the U.S., or they may have had a work permit for a few months, but wrongfully parlayed that into a truck or school bus-driving license with a seven-year expiry date. \"So we are going to use every resource, every tool that we have at DOT, to make sure that we have the right people on our road that are well qualified, well licensed. That are proficient in the English language to make sure we're maximizing safety.\" He noted that while many people are focused on non-domiciled CDL-holders driving big-rigs, many are also qualified to therefore drive school buses, potentially putting children in danger.

We 100% under Donald Trump's leadership will,\" he said. Speaking about his friendship with Kirk, Duffy said AmFest shows the impact he had on America’s youth, and drawing them into the conservative movement.

He didn't really like. He didn't favor [redacted] for instance, 23, he thought she was kind of too old,' the unidentified woman testified.\n\n'The more you did is the more you make. Basically, the more clothes that come off, the more you let him touch you, the more you just let him have his way with you is the more that you would make, otherwise, you would be demoted down to bringing girls over and just making money that way.'\n\nAnother document pertaining to Epstein's 2019 trial, featured graphic retellings of how young girl were groomed.\n\nAn unidentified FBI agent testified that a 14-year-old girl visited Epstein's mansion in Palm Beach, Florida after being promised she could make $300 by giving him a massage.\n\nBut when she arrived, she detailed how she was asked to strip to her underwear and carry out sexualized acts on Epstein as he lay on a massage table, the agent said.\n\nThe girl reportedly detailed how the walls of the room were covered in sketches or paintings of naked women.\n\nThe latest disclosure comes after a judge ruled on December 9 that the DOJ was allowed release grand jury materials from Maxwell's sex trafficking investigation.\n\nBecause grand jury proceedings are secret by their very nature, it was unclear whether the DOJ would be able to release these documents as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act that was signed by President Donald Trump last month.\n\nUS District Judge Paul Engelmayer said the grand jury materials had to be released because of that law, but he said mechanisms needed to be put in place to protect victims from disclosures that could 'identify them or otherwise invade their privacy'.\n\nThe files dumped on Saturday afternoon were far less redacted than what was released on Friday.\n\nDemocrats, including Congressman Ro Khanna, one of the authors of the law compelling the release of the Epstein files, were particularly furious with one document in Friday's release that contained 119 pages of grand jury testimony was entirely blacked out.\n\nBy contrast, the documents released on Saturday were much more transparent.\n\nOne of the disclosures shows a series of notes left for Epstein throughout 2005 with messages like 'has girl for tonight' and 'she can be here tomorrow from 2pm to whenever'.\n\nOne note left for the disgraced financier conveyed the message that a girl he was seeing 'would like to speak to you. I belive (sic) about college'.\n\nIn a grand jury hearing on November 19, 2019, for the federal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, an FBI agent talked at length about a girl who met Epstein and Maxwell while at summer camp in 1994 at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan.\n\nThe girl was 13 going on 14, the agent explained, and the sex trafficking duo interrupted her while she was talking to her friends at a picnic table to ask about her classes and teachers at the art education camp.\n\nEventually, Epstein talked his way into the girl's mother's home, where he explained that he 'gives scholarships' and 'likes to mentor people', according to the agent's testimony.\n\nThe girl then began regularly spending time with Maxwell and Epstein and the Palm Beach home, the agent said. The girl told the FBI that they treated her to movies and shopping, which she described as 'grooming'.\n\nOnce Epstein came to learn that the girl, still underage, wanted to become an actress and a model, he said he 'was best friends with the owner' of Victoria's Secret, per the document. \n\nHe then pulled her into his lap, exposed himself and sexually abused her, according to the agent.\n\nA review of the grand jury materials by the Daily Mail reveal he used this Victoria's Secret line with other young girls who expressed an interest modeling as a way to impress them and convey that he could make their dream career a reality.\n\nSimilar patterns of abuse emerge throughout the many grand jury documents, which also mention Maxwell.\n\nThe convicted sex offender was often topless around the underage girls Epstein would have in the pool area of the Palm Beach home, according to grand jury testimony.\n\nMaxwell was also accused of groping her victims while directing them on how to please Epstein during massage sessions.\n\nShe was also cast as Epstein's de facto enforcer with the girls he kept in his employ, though she kept them in line in a twisted, self-victimizing way, according to one transcript.\n\nMaxwell told one girl that she herself would 'get in trouble' if Epstein didn't get his daily massage from her, seemingly an attempt to guilt the girl into doing what she was told.\n\n In another testimony, an FBI agent recalled speaking to a 14-year-old girl who was introduced to Epstein and Maxwell through her 17-year-old boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend, identified as Shawn, had asked his then girlfriend if she wanted to 'massage and old man and she would be paid money in return for that,' the official recalled, per the filing. \n\nThe girl then agreed and went to Epstein's home in 2001 and was immediately introduced to Maxwell after entering through the side door, the documents stated.\n\nThe young girl was then taken to a massage room that had several nude photographs on its walls, including some of Maxwell. \n\nEpstein soon entered the room and the girl and Maxwell began massaging him before he turned over and 'they had sex,' the agent stated. \n\nThe teenager went to Epstein's home on several occasions, and soon started to bring other girls around after both he and Maxwell specifically 'asked if she could bring younger girls' and promised 'she could earn more money' if she did, the agent said. \n\nThe girls involved would each get paid $300, often in 'crisp $100 bills'. They would also receive gifts from financer, including flowers, Victoria's Secret underwear and a book called 'Massage for Dummies,' per the agent. \n\nThe girl told the agent the gifts would be shipped either through UPS of FedEx at her home in West Palm Beach. \n\n That same girl dropped out of school at the age of 14 and told officials she would use the money she got from Epstein and Maxwell to buy drugs that both she and her boyfriend used, the legal document said. \n\nThroughout the documents, many of the young girls described their relationship to Maxwell like that of 'sisters'.\n\nAccording to the agent, a teenage girl who was raised in England said: 'Maxwell treated her like they were sisters.\n\n'Her quote was \"like naughty school girls\" is how Maxwell treated with her,' the documents read. \n\nThe newly released files also shed light on Epstein and Maxwell's relationship and how the financer changed after his then girlfriend came into his life.\n\nAn unnamed male employee who worked for Epstein in Palm Beach in the early 1990s said the late pedophile was 'more pleasant to work with prior to Maxwell coming into the picture,' an FBI agent recalled after conducting an interview with him. \n\n'Once she came into the picture, he said things became more secretive. He wasn't allowed to be in the room with guests, wasn't allowed to talk with them, associate with them. It became a different environment,' the official stated.","summary":"The Department of Justice has released two more batches of the Epstein files, including grand jury transcripts from cases against Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15402261/more-epstein-files-ghislaine-maxwell-grand-jury.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/20/17/104907967-0-image-m-13_1766252131014.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/12/20/8780864416146738464/1024x576_MP4_8780864416146738464.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-20 22:05:07","author":"Editor,Emma Richter,James Cirrone","authors":["Editor","Emma Richter","James Cirrone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":387798578,"title":"Pentagon’s Taiwan war games reflect US anxiety over PLA power: defence experts","text":"A recently leaked Pentagon report has projected heavy US losses should it intervene in a Taiwan conflict, highlighting Washington’s growing anxiety over Beijing’s rapidly improving capabilities, according to defence experts.\nIn a classified assessment known as the Overmatch brief, the Pentagon has catalogued the People’s Liberation Army’s ability to destroy American fighter planes, large ships and satellites and identified the US military’s supply chain choke points, according to a December 8 opinion article by The New York Times.\nThe brief is a comprehensive review of US military power prepared by the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment and delivered most recently to top White House officials in the past year.\nIn war games described in the Overmatch brief, American warships such as the USS Gerald R. Ford, the US Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, were “often destroyed”, according to the article.\nIt added that China had amassed an arsenal of around 600 hypersonic weapons that were difficult to intercept and capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound.\n“China now has enough missiles to potentially destroy many of America’s advanced weapons before they come near Taiwan,” the article states, citing information from the Congressional Research Service and the Pentagon.\nThe report did not disclose whether the US was able to fend off PLA attacks in the war games, but the assessment painted an unfavourable picture for American forces.\nWhen a senior Biden national security official received the Overmatch brief in 2021, he turned pale as he realised that “every trick we had up our sleeve, the Chinese had redundancy after redundancy”, The New York Times said.\nFormer Taiwanese navy lieutenant commander Lu Li-shih said the war games featured in the Pentagon assessment appeared to be “reliable” and more accurate than similar ones conducted by US think tanks.\nIn 2023, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) developed a war game simulating a PLA amphibious invasion of Taiwan and ran it 24 times. In most scenarios, American, Taiwanese and Japanese forces defeated a conventional invasion and preserved Taiwan’s autonomy – though at a very high cost, according to CSIS.\n“China is developing area-denial capabilities, and the PLA is not without means to counter external interference, including various so-called carrier-killer weapons,” Lu said. “In addition, its own aircraft carriers could help keep the United States beyond the second island chain.”\n\nFu Qianshao, a Chinese military analyst, said the assessment reflected long-standing anxiety among US scholars and strategic circles. He added that Washington had fallen short due to strategic miscalculations and declining defence production capacity.\n“The anxiety is understandable because the facts are already clear,” Fu said. “If the US were to intervene militarily over Taiwan, it knows the likely outcome – fighting at China’s doorstep, where the PLA now holds the advantage after years of strengthening its A2/AD capabilities.”\nA2/AD – short for anti-access/area denial – refers to a military strategy designed to deter external intervention by restricting an adversary’s access to, and freedom of movement within, a contested area.\nOn September 3, the PLA unveiled an array of weapons systems during a military parade in Beijing, including next-generation anti-ship missiles believed to offer greater speed and precision than earlier models, further reinforcing China’s A2/AD posture.\nChang Yen-ting, a retired Taiwanese air force lieutenant general, said the strategic value of aircraft carriers was steadily declining. If the US deployed Ford-class carriers within the first island chain, they would face multiple attack vectors, he said, adding that PLA weapons such as DF-26 anti-ship missiles were their “natural enemies”, according to a report by Taiwan’s China Times.\nThe New York Times article came out days after Washington unveiled a revised National Security Strategy (NSS) on December 4. The new strategy document, issued by the administration of US President Donald Trump, departs from Biden’s explicit framing of China as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge”.\nInstead, the strategy adopts a more conciliatory tone, emphasising efforts to “rebalance America’s economic relationship with China”. It states that in the long term, maintaining American economic and technological pre-eminence is the surest way to deter and prevent a large-scale military conflict.\n“Deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority,” the document said, adding that the United States would maintain its long-standing declaratory policy opposing unilateral changes to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.\nDiao Daming, a professor at the school of international studies at Renmin University, said the narrative of the war game was ultimately driven by calculations to maximise institutional interests.\n“Against the backdrop of overall strategic retrenchment in the National Security Strategy, the military has a clear intention to safeguard its budgetary scale and levels of strategic resource investment,” Diao said.\nIn its approach to China, Diao added, this year’s NSS marked a shift from strategic rebalancing to economic rebalancing, and from a Cold War-style framing of existential confrontation to major power competition.\nThe strategy’s language on Taiwan, he said, reflected concern over – and responsiveness to – potential changes in the regional situation.","summary":"A recently leaked Pentagon report has projected heavy US losses should it intervene in a Taiwan conflict, highlighting Washington’s growing anxiety over Beijing’s rapidly improving capabilities, according to defence experts.\nIn a classified assessment known as the Overmatch brief, the Pentagon has catalogued the People’s Liberation Army’s ability to destroy American fighter planes, large ships and satellites and identified the US military’s supply chain choke points, according to a December 8...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3337188/pentagons-taiwan-war-games-reflect-us-anxiety-over-pla-power-defence-experts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/12/20/e3bbc857-c4a9-4490-bb0d-b9675d5c58fb_562ce146.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 22:00:14","author":"Amber Wang","authors":["Amber Wang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.084},{"id":387803766,"title":"Images removed from Epstein files less than a day after being posted","text":"At least 16 files have disappeared from the US Department of Justice's public webpage for documents related to Jeffrey Epstein — including a photograph showing President Donald Trump — less than a day after they were posted, with no explanation from the government and no notice to the public.\n\nThe missing files, which were available on Friday, local time, and no longer accessible the following day, included images of paintings depicting nude women and one showing a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers.\n\nIn that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Mr Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nSimilar images of the credenza with the drawer closed are still online.\n\nThe Justice Department did not say why the files were removed or whether their disappearance was intentional.

In one example, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, though many duplicated material already turned over by the FBI.\n\nMany of the records released so far had been made public in court filings, congressional releases or freedom of information requests, though, for the first time, they were all in one place and available for the public to search for free.\n\nOnes that were new were often lacking necessary context or heavily blacked out. A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY,” likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019 or Maxwell in 2021, was entirely blacked out.\n\nTrump’s Republican allies seized on the Clinton images, including photos of the Democrat with singers Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and even Epstein with TV newscaster Walter Cronkite. But none of the photos had captions and was no explanation given for why any of them were together.\n\nThe meatiest records released so far showed that federal prosecutors had what appeared to be a strong case against Epstein in 2007 yet never charged him.\n\nTranscripts of grand jury proceedings, released publicly for the first time, included testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein. The youngest was 14 and in ninth grade.\n\nOne had told investigators about being sexually assaulted by Epstein when she initially resisted his advances during a massage.\n\nAnother, then 21, testified before the grand jury about how Epstein had hired her when she was 16 to perform a sexual massage and how she had gone on to recruit other girls to do the same.\n\n“For every girl that I brought to the table he would give me $200,” she said. They were mostly people she knew from high school, she said. “I also told them that if they are under age, just lie about it and tell him that you are 18.”\n\nThe documents also contain a transcript of an interview Justice Department lawyers did more than a decade later with the U.S. attorney who oversaw the case, Alexander Acosta, about his ultimate decision not to bring federal charges.\n\nAcosta, who was labor secretary during Trump’s first term, cited concerns about whether a jury would believe Epstein’s accusers.\n\nHe also said the Justice Department might have been more reluctant to make a federal prosecution out of a case that straddled the legal border between sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, something more commonly handled by state prosecutors.\n\n“I’m not saying it was the right view,” Acosta added. He also said that the public today would likely view the survivors differently.\n\n“There’s been a lot of changes in victim shaming,” Acosta said.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Ali Swenson, Christopher L.

One official described the action as a “consented boarding,” with the tanker stopping voluntarily and allowing U.S. forces to board it.\n\nPentagon and White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump following the first tanker seizure this month vowed that the U.S. would carry out a blockade of Venezuela. It all comes as Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Maduro and warned that the longtime Venezuelan leader’s days in power are numbered.\n\nTrump this week demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country that face American sanctions.\n\nTrump cited the lost U.S. investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against Maduro, suggesting the Republican administration’s moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking. Some sanctioned tankers already are diverting away from Venezuela.\n\n\"We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it — they illegally took it.”\n\nU.S. oil companies dominated Venezuela’s petroleum industry until the country’s leaders moved to nationalize the sector, first in the 1970s and again in the 21st century under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Compensation offered by Venezuela was deemed insufficient, and in 2014 an international arbitration panel ordered the country’s socialist government to pay $1.6 billion to ExxonMobil.\n\nThe targeting of tankers comes as Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.\n\nThe strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Coast Guard, sometimes with help from the Navy, had typically interdicted boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea, searched for illicit cargo, and arrested the people aboard for prosecution.\n\nThe administration has justified the strikes as necessary, asserting it is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels aimed at halting the flow of narcotics into the United States. Maduro faces federal charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. in recent months has sent a fleet of warships to the region, the largest buildup of forces in generations, and Trump has stated repeatedly that land attacks are coming soon.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from power.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle.”","summary":"One official described the action as a “consented boarding,” with the tanker stopping voluntarily and allowing U.S. forces to board it.","url":"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/12/20/us-forces-stop-second-sanctioned-merchant-vessel-off-coast-of-venezuela-international-waters-us.html","image":"https://images05.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail_large/public/2025-12/ApNewsroom_Russia_Ukraine_War_Battlefield_Museum_58995.jpg?itok=VHThUZvf","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 21:42:21","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":387815558,"title":"US forces stop oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela as Trump follows up on promise to seize tankers - AP News","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. forces on Saturday stopped an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela for the second time in less than two weeks as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe pre-dawn operation comes days after Trump announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of the South American country and follows the Dec. 10 seizure by American forces of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the U.S. Coast Guard with help from the Defense Department stopped the oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela.

It all comes as Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Maduro and warned that the longtime Venezuelan leader’s days in power are numbered.\n\nAnd the president this week demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country that face American sanctions.\n\nTrump cited the lost U.S. investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against Maduro, suggesting the Republican administration’s moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking. Some sanctioned tankers already are diverting away from Venezuela.\n\n“We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it — they illegally took it.”\n\nU.S. oil companies dominated Venezuela’s petroleum industry until the country’s leaders moved to nationalize the sector, first in the 1970s and again in the 21st century under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez. Compensation offered by Venezuela was deemed insufficient, and in 2014, an international arbitration panel ordered the country’s socialist government to pay $1.6 billion to ExxonMobil.\n\nThe targeting of tankers comes as Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States and beyond. \n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. \n\nThe strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe Coast Guard, sometimes with help from the Navy, had typically interdicted boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea, searched for illicit cargo, and arrested the people aboard for prosecution.\n\nThe administration has justified the strikes as necessary, asserting it is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels aimed at halting the flow of narcotics into the United States. Maduro faces federal charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. in recent months has sent a fleet of warships to the region, the largest buildup of forces in generations, and Trump has stated repeatedly that land attacks are coming soon. \n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from power.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle.”\n\nMadhani reported from West Palm Beach, Florida.

However, unlike a tanker seized earlier this month, the vessel intercepted this weekend was not itself under US sanctions and was carrying Venezuelan crude bound for Asia, according to CNN.\n\nThe seizure took place in international waters and marks the second such interdiction in recent weeks. Since the first interdiction, several vessels have reportedly remained in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure, sharply reducing the country’s crude exports.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump accused Venezuela of “stealing” US oil assets and investments, saying Washington “wants it back” and warning that otherwise Caracas would feel the wrath of the “largest armada ever assembled in the history of South America.”\n\nThe growing US pressure campaign since September has included naval deployments, vessel seizures, and dozens of US strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela, which US officials say have killed more than 100 suspected cartel members.\n\nCaracas has denied any involvement in drug smuggling and condemned the seizures and blockade as illegal acts of piracy, warning that it will defend its sovereignty. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused Washington of pursuing regime change to gain control of the country’s vast oil reserves.\n\nRussia and China have also weighed in, urging restraint. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that escalating tensions could lead to “unforeseen developments,” while China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing opposes “unilateralism and bullying” and supports Venezuela’s sovereign right to trade freely.\n\nThe US has not ruled out further action, with Trump recently saying that even land strikes on Venezuela remain on the table.","summary":"The raid comes just days after President Donald Trump announced a “total” blockade of unilaterally sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/629828-us-seizes-venezuela-oil-tanker/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.12/article/694715e4203027239f415844.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-20 21:37:40","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.389}]}
