The 73-year-old joined two of her and the late rocker’s children, Jack and Kelly, for the Nov. 12 episode of their podcast, “The Osbournes.” During the emotional conversation, the TV personality began to tear up after she played a voicemail from the U.S. President, who had called to send her his condolences. “Ozzy was amazing. He was an amazing guy. I met him a few times and I want to tell you he was unique in every way and talented. So I just wanted to wish you the best,” Trump said in part. Afterwards, the trio also revealed other high-profile figures who checked in on them, including King Charles.","url":"https://www.accessonline.com/videos/sharon-osbourne-tearfully-reacts-to-voicemail-donald-trump-left-her-after-ozzys-death","image":"https://prod-accessonline-be.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/ozzzy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 02:00:00","author":"Access Contributor","authors":["Access Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":378786030,"title":"US Announces Trade Frameworks With Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala","text":"The Trump administration on Thursday announced that it had reached trade frameworks with Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador and Guatemala, to increase the ability of the US firms to sell industrial and agricultural products in these countries.\nThe White House also released statements on the frameworks, which have yet to be finalised and are expected to be signed within roughly two weeks. The development came in view of the effort by President Donald Trump to rewrite the rules of global commerce through the use of broad tariffs.\nThe frameworks touch on an array of subjects, including efforts to reduce non-tariff barriers and cut tariffs to 0% on American-made goods as well as commitments to not impose digital services taxes on US companies.\nAccording to the reports, there will be tariff relief on select products from these countries. For example, import licenses in these countries would be eliminated and streamlined, while nations would agree to resolve issues on intellectual property rights.\nTariffs Imposed On These Countries\nUnder the tariffs previously announced at the end of July by Trump, goods imported from Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala are taxed at 10 percent, as the US runs a trade surplus with each of those countries. Products from Ecuador, with which America runs a trade deficit, are taxed at 15 percent.\nGuatemala President Bernardo Arévalo called the framework “good news” and said his country would be in a position to attract new investments.\nHe said that 70 percent of the products Guatemala exports to the US will face zero tariffs under the framework, as exclusions are granted for goods the US is unable to make.

The launch was stalled for days over weather both on Earth and in space, but it was worth the wait: in the rocket's second-ever flight, Blue Origin managed to recover the booster for reuse. Ecstatic cheers rang out at the launch site in Florida's Cape Canaveral as the booster gracefully stuck its landing on a floating platform. Prior to Thursday, only Elon Musk's SpaceX had managed to accomplish such a maneuver with an orbital-class rocket. Blue Origin's accomplishment comes amid intensified rivalry between the two billionaire-owned private space companies, as the US space agency NASA recently opened up bids for its planned Moon mission. \"Damn that was exciting!\" said Jared Isaacman -- a Musk ally who President Donald Trump recently nominated again to head NASA -- on X, congratulating Blue Origin. A handful of figures at SpaceX also had praise for their rivals, including Musk himself: \"Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!\" he said on X. The launch was repeatedly delayed, on Sunday over weather on Earth, and on Wednesday over weather in space. The second postponement was over \"highly elevated solar activity\" that NASA was worried could impact or damage its spacecraft. And multiple glitches meant delays yet again on Thursday -- hold-ups Blue Origin did not explain. But at 3:55 pm (2055 GMT), New Glenn finally blasted off. The 322-foot (98-meter) rocket now has the task of sending NASA's ESCAPADE twin spacecraft to Mars, in a bid to study the Red Planet's climate history with the eventual hope of human exploration. Applause resounded once more as the spacecraft successfully deployed. Joseph Westlake, a NASA heliophysicist, explained during Thursday's webcast how the twin spacecraft named \"Blue\" and \"Gold\" will first finding a \"benign, safe parking orbit\" to make \"measurements about the space weather here on Earth.\" Then, once the planets have reached the ideal alignment in the fall of 2026, the spacecraft will get a boost from Earth's gravity and begin the journey to Mars, where they will arrive in 2027. This type of launch could allow for more frequent missions in the future, because they could proceed outside the window of direct alignment of Earth and Mars that happens approximately once every two years. 'Launch, land, repeat' New Glenn's inaugural flight in January also was marked a success, as its payload achieved orbit and successfully performed tests. But its first-stage booster, which was meant to be reusable, was lost during descent. Thursday's achievement signals that Blue Origin is on its way to reducing costs by reusing boosters rather than allowing them to plummet into the ocean. \"Launch, land, repeat -- it starts today,\" said Eddie Seyffert, among Blue Origin's webcast commentators. And it comes as US President Donald Trump's second term in the White House has seen the administration pile pressure on NASA to accelerate its progress to send a crewed mission to the Moon amid a race with China. George Nield -- a senior aerospace executive whose work promotes the commercial space industry, and who has flown with Blue Origin in the past -- told AFP this launch would be an \"indicator\" of the company's progress. It could show \"whether they can play increased roles in near-term lunar exploration,\" he said.","url":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/science/blue-origin-launches-nasa-mars-mission-nails-booster-landing-1916996","image":"https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2025/11/14/1978099-aa-5931080.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 01:09:48","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":378736996,"title":"Tourism sector on track for full operation by May 2026 — Bartlett","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTourism Minister Edmund Bartlett fields questions from the Jamaica Observer on Wednesday. (Photo: Philp Lemonte) \n\n Latest News, News \n\nNovember 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n Tourism sector on track for full operation by May 2026 — Bartlett \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKINGSTON, Jamaica — Minister of Tourism, Edmund Bartlett, says that the sector is on track for full operation by May 2026.\n\nSpeaking to the United States-based Fox News Network and a wider international audience on November 13, the minister underscored that the best way to support the nation’s reconstruction is to travel to Jamaica and experience its renowned warmth, beauty and resilience.\n\n“Jamaica has weathered many storms, and Hurricane Melissa certainly tested our strength, but we are well on our way to recovery,” said Bartlett.\n\n“The storm revealed what defines us most — resilience, unity, courage, and the positivity that characterises the Jamaican spirit. While the western parts of the island were hardest hit, much of the country remains open and welcoming to visitors,” he noted.\n\nThe minister highlighted the country’s swift recovery efforts, noting that both government and nonprofit organisations have mobilised to deliver food aid, clothing, tools, and other essentials to storm victims.\n\nHe praised the outpouring of international support — from neighbouring Caribbean nations to thousands of travellers who have donated and volunteered in the relief effort — and called for continued aid to sustain ongoing reconstruction.\n\nA central takeaway, Bartlett emphasised, is the invitation to tourists: “The best way to give back is to come back.”\n\nHe stressed that with two-thirds of Jamaica’s top tourist destinations already reopened, the industry is advancing towards full revival.\n\nResorts, attractions and local businesses in the affected zones are rebuilding rapidly, with a strong sense of community and shared purpose guiding the recovery, Bartlett added.\n\nIn discussing the road ahead, Bartlett provided concrete timelines.\n\nHe said that the target date for the start of the peak winter tourist season of December 15 is still on, with about 70 per cent of hotels already ready and 80 per cent prepared by January 2026.\n\nThe plan calls for full operational readiness across all departments by May 2026, a commitment he described as practical and grounded in collaboration with stakeholders.\n\n“The hospitality industry is in our DNA,” Bartlett added, pointing to Jamaica’s famed “Dunns River Falls” and other key attractions that continue to lure visitors.\n\nHe acknowledged that some excursions and experiences in western Jamaica may still be adjusting as the landscape recovers but noted that the country’s power and water were stabilising, with many communities returning to normalcy.\n\nHe praised the perseverance of residents in the affected regions, who are rebuilding homes, roofs and livelihoods while maintaining peaceful, respectful communities.\n\nAs Jamaica prepares to welcome back international travellers, Bartlett reiterated his gratitude for the global support received and invited visitors to “come back” to Jamaica now more than ever, a destination defined by recovery, hospitality and hope.\n\nHe is also imploring travellers seeking up-to-date information on Jamaica’s tourism status and opening dates, to visit the Jamaica Tourist Board’s official website and follow accredited channels for ongoing recovery updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Edmund Bartlett Hurricane Melissa

Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nProposition 50 in California means that Democrats might win as many as five additional seats in the House in 2026, in an explicit attempt to offset the new Texas congressional map.\n\nHowever, the California Republican Party and 19 registered voters sued the state in federal court on November 5, a day after the election was held.\n\nThey claimed California’s redistricting effort violates provisions of the US Constitution by unlawfully favouring Hispanic communities.\n\nThe Justice Department has echoed those concerns in its complaint. It argues that California’s map “manipulates district lines in the name of bolstering the voting power of Hispanic Californians because of their race”.\n\nIn response, Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Governor Newsom, said, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.”\n\nNewsom has emerged as a prominent Democratic critic of Trump, calling the president’s opposition to California’s ballot measure the “ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE”.\n\nNewsom has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028 once the 2026 midterm elections are over.\n\nCalifornia’s new district boundaries will apply for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nNormally, congressional districts in California are drawn by an independent commission, based on the results of a national census taken every 10 years.\n\nProposition 50 suspends that commission’s work for the next three national elections and instead adopts a map created by the state legislatures.\n\nIn theory, electoral maps should reflect the people who live in a given state. In reality, most boundaries are rejigged by the parties in power, in a process called gerrymandering. Legislatures in many states determine how the districts are drawn.\n\nCalifornia’s new congressional map aims to dilute Republican voters’ power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe Justice Department is asking a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.","url":"https://grenadachronicle.com/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps/","image":"https://grenadachronicle.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-11T220719Z_1486360491_RC2LUHAJ1AOK_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-COP30-US-GOVERNORS-1763073477-qCcuzO.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 01:00:14","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gd","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":378784120,"title":"‘Hope it won’t happen again’: US federal workers return post-shutdown","text":"Offices in Washington, many of which closed during the shutdown, are set to reopen on Friday.\nWASHINGTON: Roads and sidewalks in the US capital Washington were again clogged as thousands of federal employees returned to work Thursday following the record-breaking government shutdown – but some, like management analyst Lee Hardwick, never left.\nHardwick had to work the entire 43-day shutdown – unpaid.\n\"I'm pleased that my colleagues, the ones who haven't gotten paid, or the ones who haven't been working, that they actually at least get to come back to work,\" the 62-year-old told AFP.\nThe shutdown – a uniquely American phenomenon that happens when Congress cannot agree on a budget – impacted more than a million government employees.\nThose deemed essential, such as air traffic controllers, kept working.

The United States said on Thursday it will remove tariffs on some foods and other imports from Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador under framework agreements that will give U.S. firms greater access to those markets.\n\nThe agreements are expected to help lower prices for coffee, bananas and other foodstuffs, a senior Trump administration official told reporters, adding the administration expected U.S. retailers to pass on the positive effects to American consumers.\n\nThe framework deals with most of the four countries should be finalized within the next two weeks, the official said, with additional agreements seen as possible before the end of the year.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said the U.S. planned some \"substantial\" announcements in coming days that would lead to lower prices on coffee, bananas and other fruits, as part of a push by the Trump administration to drive down the cost of living for Americans.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira discussed a framework for a U.S.-Brazil trade relationship in a meeting this week, the U.S. State Department said on Thursday.\n\nBrazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter but its exports to the U.S. face crushing 50% duties imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. \n\nTrump has focused intensely on the issue of affordability after a string of defeats for Republican candidates in last week's elections, while insisting that any higher costs were triggered by policies enacted by former President Joe Biden, and not his own sweeping tariffs.\n\nDemocratic wins in New Jersey, New York and Virginia, driven in part by cost-of-living concerns, revealed growing angst among voters over high prices, which economists say has been fueled in part by import tariffs imposed by Trump on nearly every country.\n\nThe New York Times on Thursday reported the Trump administration was considering further tariff exemptions on imported food products such as beef and citrus to ease prices, including from countries that have not reached trade agreements with the U.S. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the story.\n\nU.S. officials were having \"quite constructive\" talks with other Central and South American countries, and could conclude more trade deals before the end of the year, the official said, adding that trade talks with Switzerland and Taiwan on Thursday had also been quite positive.\n\nOfficials in Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala and Ecuador welcomed the deals.\n\nThe framework agreements announced on Thursday would maintain 10% tariffs on most goods from El Salvador, Guatemala and Argentina, where the U.S. had modest trade surpluses, and 15% for imports from Ecuador, where the U.S. had a trade deficit.\n\nBut they will result in the removal of U.S. tariffs on a number of items that are not grown, mined or produced in the United States, the official said, listing as examples bananas and coffee from Ecuador.\n\nThe deals, similar to those announced with Asian countries in October, included commitments to refrain from digital services taxes on U.S. companies, along with the removal of tariffs on U.S. agricultural and industrial goods, the official said.\n\n\"With all of these deals, the ones in Asia, the ones we're announcing today, we maintain the tariffs, we give some tariff relief on certain products or goods, but at the same time, we open up foreign markets in ways that they have not been open before,\" the official said.\n\nArgentine Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno said the deal framework would \"create the conditions\" to boost U.S. investment in Argentina, thanking Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei for his \"conviction\" around the agreement.\n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele, another outspoken Trump ally, shared the announcement on X, captioning it \"friends.\" His ambassador in Washington, Milena Mayorga, celebrated the decision, adding that the two \"sister nations\" have \"rebuilt their relations on the basis of trust and self-determination.\"\n\nBukele's Guatemalan counterpart, Bernardo Arevalo, said the deal was good news for Guatemala's economy. The agreement \"places us as an even more competitive and more attractive country for investment,\" Arevalo said in a video on social media.\n\nThe government of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa, who has allied himself closely with the Trump administration on anti-narcotics and migration efforts, also cheered the deal, saying in a statement on social media that it would boost the country's export sector. Ecuador is a major exporter of bananas and shrimp, as well as oil.

California saw the anti-Democratic gerrymandering measure – Prop. 50 – approved with ease, New Jersey and Virginia both went for Dem governors, while New York City voted in the most far-left modern candidate that I can think of, democratic socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nBut let’s not forget Seattle, home to some of the nuttiest brands of politics you’ll ever see. Not to be left out, they voted for a lesser-known Marxist, Katie Wilson, to be their next mayor. She beat out incumbent Democrat Bruce Harrell, because I guess he wasn’t far enough left for the coffee enthusiasts.\n\nHe conceded the race Thursday, despite the fact that fewer than 2,000 votes separated the two. \n\nFrom the looks of it, it would seem that Mamdani and Katie Wilson would be great pals, because they both share Marxist fantasies even though the movement has historically failed virtually everywhere it’s been tried:\n\nREAD MORE: Seattle Is Screwed: Mayoral Debate Goes Off the Rails When Candidates Are Asked About Repeat Offenders\n\nHere's the Latest From the 'Just When You Thought It Couldn't Get Any Weirder in Seattle' Files\n\nHer resume is shockingly thin for someone about to be put in charge of a major city:\n\nWilson, perceived as the less experienced candidate, operates a small nonprofit called the Transit Riders Union. Her work has included advocating for policies around minimum wage increases, better access to public transit and affordable housing. Prior to her establishment of the Transit Riders Union in 2011, Wilson worked several jobs in various unrelated industries, including as a barista, boatyard worker, apartment manager, lab technician, baker, construction worker and legal assistant. Wilson has credited her parents with helping her run her campaign for mayor.\n\nHer parents certainly do help her out – in fact, they regularly send her funds, although she won’t say how much. No wonder she likes the socialist concept of Other People’s Money.\n\nHere’s one of her great ideas:\n\nHer platform sounds wonderful, but like Mamdani’s, one can’t help but wonder who’s going to pay for this utopia.\n\n“I want everyone in this great city of ours to have a roof over their head. I want universal child care and free K-8 summer care. I want world-class mass transit. I want great, safe public spaces where kids can run around with abandon. I want stable, affordable housing for renters. I want social housing. I want much more land and wealth to be owned and stewarded by communities instead of corporations,” she said.\n\nSo now we’ve got two democratic socialist mayors running major American cities.

A Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta heard the writ petition filed by Rachna Gangu and Venugopalan Govindan, who alleged their daughters died due to adverse effects of COVID vaccination.\n\nAir India crash investigation aimed at finding cause, not apportioning blame, says Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday (November 13, 2025) clarified that the ongoing investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) into the Air India Flight 171 crash at the Ahmedabad airport, killing 12 crew members and 229 passengers on June 12, was not meant to “apportion blame” but to unearth “what” caused the accident, and to safeguard against such tragedies in the future.\n\nCentre suspends over 4,000 fertiliser distributor licences on hoarding charges\n\nThe Union Department of Fertilisers has cancelled or suspended 4,298 licences and the registration of fertiliser distributors for black marketing, hoarding, and diversion of stocks. The Ministry had earlier issued 8,777 show cause notices to the erring traders, and 547 FIRs have so far been registered nationwide.\n\nCentre releases draft Seeds Bill; industry welcomes; farm outfits cautious\n\nAfter two failed attempts in the past by the United Progressive Alliance and National Democratic Alliance governments in 2004 and 2019, the Centre has brought in yet another draft Seeds Bill. The Union Agriculture Ministry said the draft is aligned with current agricultural and regulatory requirements. The proposed legislation is intended to replace the existing Seeds Act, 1966 and the Seeds (Control) Order, 1983.\n\nSupreme Court finds T.N. challenge to Mekedatu reservoir project ‘premature’\n\nThe Supreme Court on Thursday (November 13, 2025) termed Tamil Nadu’s application challenging the proposed construction of a reservoir by Karnataka at Mekedatu across the inter-state river Cauvery as “premature”. Declining to entertain Tamil Nadu’s plea for now, a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai said, the Detailed Project Report (DPR) on the reservoir, submitted by Karnataka, was only being considered by the experts in the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC).\n\nSupreme Court wants government to promote EVs amid high air pollution\n\nAmid worsening air pollution in the national capital, the Supreme Court on Thursday (November 13, 2025) observed that it may be high time to revisit the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 to promote electric vehicles and even launch a pilot project in metropolitan cities.\n\nIndia’s carbon emission rise slower in 2025, says report\n\nWhile global carbon emissions are expected to rise 38 billion tonnes, or by 1.1%, in 2025, the growth in India’s emissions is expected to increase by 1.4%, according to the Global Carbon Project, an authoritative tracker of global fossil fuel emissions. This is lower than in recent years – in 2024, India’s emissions grew by 4% to the previous year.\n\nTrump wants skilled overseas workers to ‘train Americans’ then ‘go back home’: U.S. Treasury Secretary\n\nA day after U.S. President Donald Trump defended the H-1B visa programme, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the “vision” is to bring in skilled overseas workers who train Americans and then go back home. “The President’s vision here is to bring in overseas workers, where these jobs went, who have the skills. Three, five, seven years to train the U.S. workers, then they can go home. The U.S. workers fully take over,” Bessent said in an interview to Fox News on Wednesday (November 12, 2025).","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/morning-digest-november-14-2025/article70277290.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rp934x/article70276447.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/PTI11_13_2025_000268B.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:50:32","author":"Rachna Gangu","authors":["Rachna Gangu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.487},{"id":378786002,"title":"Stay informed, daily","text":"World stocks are eyeing a return to record highs at the end of the longest government shutdown on record, while an increasingly squeezed Japanese yen hit a record low versus the euro and a nine-month trough against the dollar.\n\nEurope’s STOXX 600 made a steady start with a near one per cent jump from France’s CAC 40 nudging both indexes to all-time peaks and offsetting a more than four per cent dive from German engineering giant Siemens after it reported underwhelming earnings.\n\nUS stock futures meandered from slightly negative to 0.2 per cent firmer, although MSCI’s 47-country All World Index was firmly on course for its fourth consecutive daily gain as it edged to within 4 points of October’s all-time high.\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed the bill to end the government’s shutdown in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Delayed economic data is expected to start trickling out next week.\n\nOctober’s payrolls figures could be the first to land with the focus on whether they will back up private surveys that have shown softness in the job market.\n\n“We are waiting for the data fog to clear, but the one thing we can say from PriceStats data is that inflation is rolling over so it will be all about the jobs data, and that will be the driver of risk sentiment,” State Street Global Markets’ Michael Metcalfe, said.\n\nThere had been action in Asia overnight too, including in the currency markets where Japan’s yen came under renewed pressure after the new premier’s latest push for the central bank to go slow on rate rises.\n\nThe yen hit a record low of 179.49 ($A1.76) per euro and was near a nine-month trough on the dollar at 154.92 ($A1.52).\n\nThat was despite the country’s finance minister reminding traders just the previous day that the government was watching the currency closely. Japan’s Nikkei had closed up 0.4 per cent and the broad Topix set an all-time high as investors shifted portfolios from the frothiest artificial intelligence firms to buy exposure to other parts of the economy.\n\n“There is still a debate about whether the BoJ will tighten rates by year-end. Our inclination is that they will, but there is a strong market narrative that is proving hard to break that policy settings will encourage a weaker yen,” State Street’s Metcalfe added.\n\nElsewhere, gold hung on to recent gains and traded above $US4,200 ($A6,385) while benchmark government bonds were largely quiet with the US 10-year yield at 4.09 per cent and Germany’s 10-year yields at 2.65 per cent.\n\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng retreated slightly from a one-month high and the Shanghai Composite rose one per cent ahead of credit and retail sales data due later this week.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Index notched a record high overnight while the tech-heavy Nasdaq retreated. In London, the mining-heavy FTSE 100 drooped fractionally on Thursday after an all-time high the previous day. Europe’s tech stocks led sectoral gains, however, as ASML and Infineon showed signs of recovery from steep losses incurred last week.\n\nElsewhere in foreign exchange trade Britain’s pound briefly touched a session low after data showed its economy barely grew in Q3, while the Australian dollar ticked higher after a surge in employment figures bolstered a view that the rate-cutting cycle there may have run its course.\n\nBrent crude futures inched down to a three-week low of $US62.42 ($A94.89) a barrel after OPEC shifted its projection to forecast a small surplus to demand in the world oil market for 2026. They had slumped 3.8 per cent a day earlier.\n\n“Recent (price) weakness seems to be driven by OPEC’s revision of supply-demand balance in 2026 in its monthly report, which confirms the group is now acknowledging the possibility of a supply glut in 2026,” said Suvro Sarkar, DBS Bank’s energy sector team lead.","url":"https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/just-in/2025/11/14/stocks-eye-return-to-record-highs-as-us-shutdown-ends","image":"https://wp.solsticemedia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/investment-stocks-unsplash-1800x1200-52.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:47:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":378780546,"title":"Phil Mickelson shares take on being Republican Nominee in 2028: \"My views can be extreme\"","text":"Phil Mickelson says he doesn’t feel qualified to be the Republican nominee in 2028, calling his own political views “extreme.” The six-time major winner, who has never held public office but often shares his opinions on politics, was recently suggested by a social media user to run for president.The conversation started after Mickelson reacted to a viral video on X showing a military veteran in Georgia who shot and killed three teenagers after they broke into his home.

looks set for a big night on Thursday when the Latin Grammys, the biggest celebration of Spanish and Portuguese-language music, return to Las Vegas.\n\nThe reggaeton star has 12 nominations, including best album, best record and best song — categories in which he is also competing at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards in February.\n\nA triumph for “Debi Tirar Mas Fotos” (“I should have taken more photos”) would be another chapter in a year in which the 31-year-old — who’s real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio — has swept the entertainment world.\n\nA barnstorming residency in his native Puerto Rico has just ended, with a world tour set to kick off this month in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe reggaeton breakout made headlines when he said the tour would not include any dates on the United States (US) mainland because he was concerned his fans might be targeted by President Donald Trump’s immigration raids.\n\nThe one exception to his self-imposed ban will be the Super Bowl halftime show on February 8 in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe performance, which comes midway through the National Football League (NFL) final, is routinely one of the television events of the year, watched by well over 100 million people in the United States alone, with millions more tuning in around the world.\n\nOn Thursday night, Bad Bunny faces competition from Argentinian duo Ca7riel & Paco Amoroso, whose album “Papota” is also vying for the night’s biggest awards.\n\nThey are the first nominations for the explosive hip-hop duo, who recently opened several concerts in Latin America for Kendrick Lamar, a strong favorite for the 2026 Grammys.\n\nEdgar Barrera, who as a producer and songwriter has garnered more than 70 nominations at the Latin awards, is also competing for Song and Record of the Year for his work with Karol G on “Si antes te hubiera conocido” (If I Had Met You Before).\n\nThe album’s single “Tropicoqueta” also earned the Colombian singer a nomination for Best Tropical Song.\n\nKarol G is set to be one of the headliners at Coachella next year.\n\nBrazil’s Liniker, who in 2022 became the first transgender artist to win a Latin Grammy, is sitting on seven nominations for her album “Caju,” including the top three prizes.\n\nOther nominees for the award include Alejandro Sanz, Carin Leon, Gloria Estefan, Joaquina, Rauw Alejandro, Vicente García, and Natalia Lafourcade, who has a total eight nominations.\n\nThe Latin Grammys return to the MGM Grand Garden Arena after editions in Spain and Miami.\n\nThe show, which kicks off at 5 pm (0100 GMT

We have two things going on with them. Of course, we have a reciprocal trade negotiation, but we also have a Russian oil issue, where we’ve seen market improvement on that end. So I think that we, I’d like to say we can relax and take a break, but there’s still a lot to do, but a lot of positive progress going on already, and we may have more to come before the end of the year,” the official told ANI. The US administration is managing two parallel issues with India. The first involves reciprocal trade negotiations, which typically aim to balance tariffs and market access between countries. The second concerns what the official termed the “Russian oil issue,” though they noted “market improvement on that end.”The White House announced Thursday that it has finalised preliminary trade agreements with four Latin American nations – Argentina, El Salvador, Ecuador, and Guatemala.According to administration officials, these deals will offer tariff reductions on goods that cannot be grown naturally within US borders.The comments came as the official outlined America’s expanding trade engagement across multiple regions. Washington has been pursuing “quite constructive conversations” with Central and South American nations and has issued joint statements with Vietnam and Indonesia.The official also mentioned recent progress with Switzerland, suggesting a pattern in which the Trump administration seeks bilateral deals rather than multilateral agreements.As US President Donald Trump’s close associate Sergio Gor begins his role as ambassador to India, Trump faces another diplomatic test. Speaking at Gor’s swearing-in on Monday, US President Donald Trump indicated that tariff reductions on Indian imports could be forthcoming, pointing to potential progress on a trade deal. A reciprocal trade deal could address long-standing issues between the world’s largest and fifth-largest economies, including: US concerns over Indian tariffs on American goods, particularly motorcycles and agricultural products, India’s desire for restored preferential trade status and greater access to US markets, Technology transfer and intellectual property protections, and Services sector access, particularly for Indian IT professionals.The acknowledgement of progress comes after years of stop-start negotiations between Washington and New Delhi. Previous attempts at comprehensive trade agreements have stalled over disagreements on tariffs, data localisation, and e-commerce rules.Neither the Indian Ministry of Commerce nor the Ministry of External Affairs had issued statements on the American official’s comments at the time of publication.Trade between the US and India reached approximately USD 190 billion in 2024, with both nations expressing ambitions to significantly increase bilateral commerce.

It’s certainly the same for the 10 and the 20 [cent coins],” he said.\n\n“That is part of the service that has to provide to the Australian public. Our aim is about doing that as efficiently and as effectively as we certainly can.”\n\nHowever, two years earlier, then Royal Mint CEO Ross MacDiarmid predicted the “graceful death” of five and 10-cent coins “within the next decade”.\n\n“We’ve worked on the basis that somewhere in the next five to 10 years, the five-cent coin will probably just cease to be used,” he said in 2020.\n\nPart of the fate of the five-cent piece rests with Australia’s growing move toward a cashless economy, thanks to the rise in eftpos payments and digital wallets.\n\nLast year Dr Angel Zhong, associate professor of finance at RMIT University, said it was likely that cash payments will be as little as 1-2 per cent of all payments within a few years.\n\n“We’ve seen a lot of businesses starting to refuse cash as payment and legally that is allowed,” she said.\n\nZhong said there were legitimate concerns about moving away from monetary notes and coins to completely electronic payments.\n\n“For example, internet outages, infrastructure and privacy concerns, as well as cyber attacks,” she said.\n\n“There are also vulnerable groups, such as the older generations, who are not tech savvy, as well as those in rural areas.”\n\nTheo Foukkare, CEO of the Australian Association of Convenience Stores, told ABC Radio in January that 90 per cent of transactions are digital.\n\nBut he warned that, given that the rising cost of living, losing the five-cent coin would drive the overall price of products up by the same amount.\n\n“It might only sound like a little bit, but if you add over the year, when all your transactions had been rounded up, I think it’s actually going cost everyone in their hip pocket,” he said.\n\nThe five-cent piece, featuring its iconic echidna on the front, came into circulation with the advent of Australia’s decimal currency in 1966.\n\nThe first 30 million coins were struck at the British Royal Mint followed by an additional to 45.4 million at the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra.\n\nIn 2024, just 10 million of the coins were minted – the first featuring King Charles instead of Queen Elizabeth – after no five-cent pieces were produced in 2023.","url":"https://www.indailysa.com.au/news/just-in/2025/11/14/australia-five-cent-future","image":"https://wp.solsticemedia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/five-cent.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:40:42","author":"X/michael Stratford","authors":["X/michael Stratford"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":378736992,"title":"NWC damage from Melissa put at $10 billion – Samuda","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister of Water, Environment, and Climate Change Matthew Samuda, addressing the opening ceremony for the United Nations Environment Programme 18th Meeting of the Contracting Parties for the Cartagena Convention, held at Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston on Monday.

The disruptions, damage, indeed lost revenue, reduced collections and cost of relief and restoration will exceed $10 billion,” he said.\n\nSamuda shared that the Cabinet has been informed of all the issues that affect the NWC and has been presented with a restoration and relief plan. He explained that the plan includes clearing access to sites; temporary repairs to raw water transmission and distribution pipelines; installation of standpipes in communities with electric power; trucking of water; office building repairs; and the purchase and rental of standby generators. Samuda said the first phase of the restoration plan will cost $3.25 billion.\n\nHe also told the media briefing that the four companies that manufacture tanks in Jamaica have been asked to boost their operations to supply tanks for the most badly affected communities. \n\n“We will be procuring all of what they’re able to produce by December 31st for distribution in the most affected parishes …to assist with households which have been damaged and have no access to water so at least when the trucking comes they have appropriate storage,” said the minister.\n\nPresently, 76 per cent of NWC customers have had their water supply restored and Samuda hopes this will rise to 85 per cent over the next three days. He stressed that where water is not yet restored, there is a lack of electricity and emphasised that “the supply of water is inextricably linked to the supply of power”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: Hurricane Melissa Matthew Samuda National Water Commission NWC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WATCH: Fury over frogs in tank \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Councillor for the Beecher Town Division, the People's National Party's Ian Bell made it clear during Thursday’s monthly meeting o... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ANSA Chemicals Jamaica donates 69,800 litres of bleach to support sanitisation efforts after hurricane \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n In a continued effort to support public health and safety, ANSA Chemicals Jamaica has announced a donation of 69,800 litres of bleach to help with the... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Flow Foundation draws inspiration from resilient spirit of Hanover and Westmoreland residents \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n In the wake of the widespread devastation left by Hurricane Melissa, the indomitable Jamaican spirit stood proudly amidst the destruction, according t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US Death Row inmate granted clemency minutes before execution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- An Oklahoma man who was to be executed by lethal injection for a 2002 murder was granted clemency at the last minut... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexican car industry fears higher tariffs on China will drive its demise \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AFP) -- Mexico's car assembly industry, one of the biggest in the world, fears US President Donald Trump's tariff war will impede... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Banton doubles down on theft claim, accuses Vaz of victim shaming \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Reggae superstar Buju Banton has doubled down on allegations that his hurricane relief items were stolen at the port and has accused Daryl Vaz of atte... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Nothing was missing’: Vaz refutes Buju Banton’s claim of stolen hurricane relief items \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport Daryl Vaz has refuted allegations made by reggae superstar Buju Bant... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Selon une directive interne du Département d’État, transmise aux ambassades et consulats américains à travers le monde, les agents consulaires devront désormais tenir compte de l’état de santé des candidats à un visa d’immigration. Objectif affiché : éviter l’entrée de personnes susceptibles de devenir une « charge publique », c’est-à-dire dépendantes des aides sociales financées par les contribuables américains, a rapporté Le Figaro.\n\nLe document, selon Le Figaro, consulté par plusieurs médias anglophones dont The Times, établit une liste de pathologies pouvant justifier un refus de visa permanent. Parmi elles figurent les maladies cardiovasculaires, les troubles respiratoires, les cancers, le diabète, les pathologies métaboliques, ainsi que les troubles mentaux ou neurologiques. L’obésité y est également mentionnée explicitement. Cette orientation marque une nouvelle étape dans la politique migratoire sélective voulue par Donald Trump.\n\nLa directive invite les agents consulaires à estimer la capacité des demandeurs à financer eux-mêmes des soins de longue durée, sans recourir à l’aide publique. Si l’évaluation s’avère négative, la demande de visa pourrait être rejetée. Une exigence qui fait polémique, d’autant que les agents en poste ne disposent pas de formation médicale pour analyser des dossiers de santé complexes.\n\n« L’autosuffisance économique est un principe fondamental de la politique d’immigration américaine », souligne le document. La mesure s’inscrit dans la continuité d’un décret présidentiel intitulé Mettre fin à la subvention des frontières ouvertes par les contribuables. Déjà en 2019, la Maison-Blanche avait cherché à exclure des bénéficiaires de carte verte les étrangers ayant perçu des aides publiques pendant plus d’un an, une disposition annulée par Joe Biden mais relancée aujourd’hui sous une forme plus ciblée.\n\nLes États-Unis, où près de 40 % des adultes souffrent d’obésité, sont eux-mêmes au cœur d’une importante crise sanitaire. Pour les détracteurs de la mesure, Donald Trump instrumentalise cette réalité pour promouvoir une immigration basée sur la performance économique et l’autonomie individuelle. Ils dénoncent également une approche stigmatisante envers les personnes en surpoids ou atteintes de maladies chroniques.\n\nBien que la directive ne soit pas officiellement entrée en vigueur, plusieurs consulats américains l’appliqueraient déjà à titre expérimental, a indiqué Le Figaro.\n\nÀ lire aussi","url":"https://haitigazette.com/immigration-trump-veut-refuser-des-visas-aux-personnes-en-surpoids-ou-souffrant-de-maladies-chroniques/","image":"https://haitigazette.com/app/uploads/2025/11/Cover.J7-1200-x-630-px-322-bDUFhu.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:38:51","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ht","sentiment":0.19},{"id":378781548,"title":"Trump administration joins lawsuit against California’s redistricting maps  - Haiti Gazette – Daily Haiti News","text":"The administration of United States President Donald Trump has joined a lawsuit against California over the state’s redistricting effort, which was approved by a landslide in the November 4 election.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department of Justice said it would seek to overturn California’s new map of congressional districts, which was passed through a ballot initiative with approximately 64 percent support.\n\n“California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.\n\nShe accused California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, of attempting to stifle Republican voices in his state. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”\n\nThe ballot measure, known as Proposition 50, is poised to redraw the boundaries of electoral districts to favour the Democrats in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposition was designed as a counterattack against Trump’s gerrymandering in Republican states.\n\nIn Texas, for instance, the Trump White House urged the state legislature to pass new congressional districts that would allow the Republicans the opportunity to win five more seats in the House of Representatives in 2026.\n\nIn August, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the new Republican-backed map into law.\n\nRepublicans also expect to gain one seat each from new maps in Missouri and North Carolina, and potentially two more in Ohio. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nProposition 50 in California means that Democrats might win as many as five additional seats in the House in 2026, in an explicit attempt to offset the new Texas congressional map.\n\nHowever, the California Republican Party and 19 registered voters sued the state in federal court on November 5, a day after the election was held.\n\nThey claimed California’s redistricting effort violates provisions of the US Constitution by unlawfully favouring Hispanic communities.\n\nThe Justice Department has echoed those concerns in its complaint. It argues that California’s map “manipulates district lines in the name of bolstering the voting power of Hispanic Californians because of their race”.\n\nIn response, Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Governor Newsom, said, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.”\n\nNewsom has emerged as a prominent Democratic critic of Trump, calling the president’s opposition to California’s ballot measure the “ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE”.\n\nNewsom has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028 once the 2026 midterm elections are over.\n\nCalifornia’s new district boundaries will apply for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nNormally, congressional districts in California are drawn by an independent commission, based on the results of a national census taken every 10 years.\n\nProposition 50 suspends that commission’s work for the next three national elections and instead adopts a map created by the state legislatures.\n\nIn theory, electoral maps should reflect the people who live in a given state. In reality, most boundaries are rejigged by the parties in power, in a process called gerrymandering.

The network scrambled to respond and two of the network’s high profile leaders, director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, resigned in the wake of the controversy. “We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" a correction published on Thursday read, \"The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgement.\" The BBC's chair, Samir Shah, has also personally apologized to Trump in a letter. The BBC did not immediately respond to MSNBC's request for comment on the details of that letter. The network also said the program would not be broadcasted again in its original form on any BBC platforms, but refuses to pay damages. In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Trump called the speech \"beautiful\" and \"calming,\" and said that “they made it sound radical.\" The BBC’s legal team has argued there is no basis for defamation claim as the clip was not edited out of malice and that it was never intended for it to be viewed out of context, saying “Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.” It also refuted Trump's claim the video harmed him because he was re-elected.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/bbc-apology-trump-jan-6-speech-editing-rcna243820","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251113-tim-davie-bbc-es-e30d7f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:36:10","author":"Erum Salam","authors":["Erum Salam"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":378782006,"title":"Iran demands UN hold US, Israel accountable for June attacks on nuclear sites","text":"Iran has urged the United Nations to take punitive action against the United States and Israel, accusing both of responsibility for a series of military strikes in June that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.

The president’s remarks have been widely cited in Iranian state media as proof of American involvement in the operation, which Tehran says marked the beginning of a 12-day air war between the two sides.According to Iranian reports, the strikes killed more than 900 people, including several senior military officials. Araghchi said Trump’s statement reinforced Iran’s claim that the US was not merely supporting Israel but directly commanding its military actions.\"This is indeed without prejudice to the individual criminal responsibility of all those individuals, including within the Israeli regime, involved in commanding, ordering, committing, or aiding, abetting, and otherwise assisting in the commission of the war crimes,\" Araghchi wrote in his letter to the UN.Iran’s latest appeal to the UN comes even as officials from both Washington and Tehran have recently signalled openness to dialogue. Araghchi’s deputy said earlier this week that Iran remained interested in reaching a \"peaceful nuclear agreement\" with the United States.Trump said last month that Washington was prepared to negotiate \"when Tehran is ready,\" stressing that \"the hand of friendship and cooperation is open\".Despite these statements, tensions remain high following months of military confrontation and mutual accusations.

The paper said exemptions under consideration include beef and citrus imports, though sources cautioned that Trump had not made a final decision.Any shift on beef would be politically sensitive. Ranchers have complained that allowing more imports cuts against Trump’s repeated calls to boost domestic production. If enacted, the plan would amount to a notable retreat from one of Trump’s signature economic pillars — even as he continues to insist, wrongly, the Times noted.

Bessent added in a separate Fox interview that Americans should expect substantial announcements within days on foods the US doesn’t produce domestically, including coffee and bananas.Trump has recently floated the idea of a tariff dividend for Americans and acknowledged that consumers are paying something for the trade duties.- EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Nov 14, 2025Tune InMust Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/donald-trump-administration-readies-tariff-rollback-in-bid-to-lower-food-prices-report-2819417-2025-11-14","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/donald-trump-123619657-16x9_2.png?VersionId=N93ebDLCl7Ji.ORHSvziJbho2Le5DF24?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:32:36","author":"India Today World Desk","authors":["India Today World Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.067},{"id":378783622,"title":"‘NO BEARING’: Despite Trump Pardons, Democrat AGs to Prosecute Election Cases","text":"Despite President Donald Trump’s pardons on Sunday, Democrat attorneys general told The Daily Signal and publicly suggested they plan to continue their state prosecutions against contingent state electors from the 2020 election.\n\nDemocrats attorneys general–from Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin–brought criminal charges against the contingent Trump electors, who were in-waiting if courts or state legislatures found valid reason to reject the result of the closely-contested states that went to Joe Biden that year. \n\n“President Trump’s actions have no bearing on our decision-making or prosecution under Nevada state law,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford told The Daily Signal in a statement. \n\nFord brought forgery charges against six Trump contingent electors from 2020. A judge dismissed the original indictment in Clark County last year. However, Ford brought charges again, this time in Carson City, the state capital. \n\nIn Wisconsin, Attorney General Josh Kaul’s office charged Trump campaign associates that helped appoint the contingent electors. \n\n“The criminal case in Wisconsin remains ongoing,” Rylie Fletcher, senior communications specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, told The Daily Signal in an email.\n\nLate Sunday, Trump pardoned 77 people, including campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows for disputing the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. \n\nA spokesperson for Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes did not respond to inquiries sent Monday and again on Wednesday. However, Mayes gave hints in a local TV interview even before Trump’s pardons that she might continue the prosecution. She brought charges against 11 Trump electors.\n\nIn Georgia, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis also brought charges against five of the people who were going to be contingent electors. A spokesperson for Willis’s office did not respond to inquiries for this story. \n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel brought charges in 2023 against 16 alternate Trump electors, but a judge dismissed the case in September. \n\nPresidents can issue pardons for federal offenses, so the pardons for the state charges are symbolic, according to Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \n\n“A president can only constitutionally pardon federal prosecutions,” von Spakosky told The Daily Signal. “It could weaken the case of the prosecution. The defense could file motions that there is no longer a case and point to what the Justice Department has said.”\n\nThere wouldn’t likely be legal grounds for either the U.S. Justice Department to stop the prosecutions, nor legal action the states could take to challenge the pardons, said von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department lawyer.\n\nIn the pardon statement, U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin argues presidential election functions are federal even if the charges came under state law.\n\n“Notwithstanding that fact, these prosecutions are attempts by partisan state actors to shoehorn fanciful and concocted state law violations onto what are clearly federal constitutional obligations of the 2020 Trump campaign: the establishment of the contingent electors, the actions attendant to their roles as presidential electors, and their duties under established historical and legal precedent to exercise their responsibilities as electors—all of which are functions of federal—not state—law.” \n\nThe contingent electors, in theory, were supposed to step in if the Trump campaign could prove election fraud. The campaign assembled contingent electors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. The Democrat prosecutors in three of those states, as well as the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office, secured criminal charges against the contingent electors. \n\nThe charges typically involve forgery, impersonating a public official, attempting to file false documents, and conspiracy to commit election fraud.\n\n“These citizens and their supporters acted openly, in consultation with counsel, and while active litigation or other challenges were pending,” Martin wrote of the contingent electors. “At all times, they sought to uphold fundamental federal constitutional principles in advance of the election certification proceedings before Congress, while acting to ensure, not denigrate, the integrity of the election process.” \n\n“Although the contingent electors acted lawfully within established constitutional traditions, many of them are facing years in prison and massive financial and other hardships,” Martin later added. “At no time in our country’s history have contingent electors or those associated with them been prosecuted criminally for their actions taken to ensure the integrity of the electoral process.”\n\n“These citizens have not violated any law, but instead advanced core constitutional principles to challenge significant and provable irregularities in the election,” Martin argued. “They deserve immediate relief and freedom from this partisan oppression.”","summary":"Despite President Donald Trump’s pardons on Sunday, Democrat attorneys general told The Daily Signal and publicly suggested they plan to continue their state prosecutions against...

By 2023, this market was worth nearly $3 billion.\n\nThe unexpected federal legalization left states powerless to stop the spread of these products, and even those where pot is still illegal — a majority — were suddenly overrun with weed shops.\n\nFarm-bill legalization has led to “the rapid growth of an underregulated industry that threatens public health and safety and undermines law enforcement nationwide,” the state attorneys general wrote.\n\nThe biggest victims were, as always, kids.\n\nThe rate of poison-control center reports citing delta-8 products increased by 89% between 2021 and 2022, one study found — and children accounted for 30% of those cases, with the most common age being just two years old.\n\nNearly 40% of all the cases “experienced a serious medical outcome,” including 5% admitted to a “critical care unit.”\n\nIn Indiana, where pot is illegal, exposures to THC products rose 46% among children under age 5 between 2022 and 2024, while incidents among 6- to 12-year-olds rose 62%.\n\nIn short: The farm bill’s hemp rule was unintentional national pot legalization — imposing weed on states that didn’t want it, creating a totally unregulated industry and hurting kids in the process.\n\nThat’s why the new federal policy is so welcome.\n\nUnder the funding bill signed Wednesday, it is now illegal to grow hemp containing greater than 0.3% of any THC product — not just delta-9.\n\nThat means no more delta-8, delta-10, or THC-a. The uncontrolled market is closed for business.\n\nTo be clear, this doesn’t mean the end of the hemp industry. \n\nAs long as plants aren’t intoxicating, they’re still totally legal to grow.\n\nThat includes plants containing cannabidiol, aka CBD, the non-psychoactive molecule in pot that has become a widely used supplement.\n\nHigh-CBD hemp is still legal, and products derived from it are not prohibited.\n\nNonetheless, the legal pot industry is throwing a temper tantrum.\n\nThe Hemp Industry and Farmers of America, its main lobbying organization, howled that the measure is a “draconian hemp ban” that will “open up dangerous black markets” — even though the law still allows the hemp and CBD industries to thrive.\n\nTom Angell of the pro-legalization mouthpiece Marijuana Moment jeered that the president is now “Trump the Hemp Criminalizer (THC).”\n\nBut Trump made the right call for America’s kids.\n\nThat’s especially so because support for legalizing weed has seen a sharp drop for the first time in over a decade, according to recent Gallup polling.\n\nThe shift is driven by Republicans, a majority of whom now oppose legalization for only the second time since 2016, with support for legal weed declining among independents as well.\n\nRed or blue, almost nobody liked the topsy-turvy regime that the 2018 law forced on our communities.\n\nGood riddance — and good job to the president and Congress for getting it done.\n\nCharles Fain Lehman is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and senior editor of “City Journal.“","summary":"It’s a much-needed correction for states that had “farm-bill legalization” unwillingly thrust on them — and the many kids unwittingly harmed as a result.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/11/13/opinion/trumps-hemp-ban-ended-backdoor-legal-weed-despite-pot-industrys-howls/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/2025-decreto-sicurezza-law-banned-111529161.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:31:18","author":"Charles Fain Lehman","authors":["Charles Fain Lehman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.276},{"id":378780912,"title":"Letters: Waste and fraud have ruined the SNAP program","text":"Waste, fraud have\nruined SNAP program\n\nRe: “Hold the government accountable on SNAP” (Page A6, Nov. 12).\n\nSNAP fraud exceeds $10 billion a year. Total benefits in 2024 alone were nearly $100 billion. Currently, more than 12% of Americans (almost 42 million people) receive benefits — a 942.5% increase since 1970. California tops the list, paying out over $12 billion in October 2024. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins called the food stamps program “broken and corrupt.” \n\nWhy are people worried about 42 million people losing SNAP benefits, and not worried about why so many people are on SNAP in the first place? No American should ever struggle to buy groceries while others swipe a government card for theirs. We turned food stamps into foreign aid and pretended it was compassion.\n\nPause in SNAP\nis hardly critical\n\nRe: “$21M will be disbursed to SNAP recipients” (Page A1, Nov. 9).\n\nI am a bit puzzled that your Sunday article on pausing the SNAP program describes it as “a critical lifeline,” since that implies people will die in the short term if it’s not available. Isn’t that a little over the top since the USDA classifies over 43% of the population as obese? TV news coverage shows most recipients looking well fed, and some likely to benefit from missing a meal or two.\n\nPlease do your part to keep this discussion a little more reasonable and less about feeling sorry for people who can obviously afford newer clothes, cell phones and even tattoos.\n\nTom Shastid\nWalnut Creek\n\nFlip attitude toward debt\nis what got us in mess\n\nRe: “Shutdowns a destructive way to negotiate budget” (Page A6, Nov. 11).\n\nI was incredulous when reading Wallace Clark’s letter. Clark believes the shutdown was a result of “… allocated funds exceed funds available.” That was not the issue at all. The issue was how the money was to be spent. And then he proposes: “An available alternative, increasing the national debt, is already available and a well-used procedure.”\n\nAnd that is exactly the attitude that has gotten us into the fiscal trap that we are now in. “This debt does cause a problem over the long term,” and “A large part of our current spending is paying off the current deficit.” The last statement is a woeful understatement. We spent more money on interest on the national debt last year than we spent on defense. Every deficit adds to our debt, and all our debt incurs interest. It will only get worse until we get it under control.\n\nJohn Griggs\n\nEditorial’s conclusion\npoints to plutocracy\n\nRe: “This has gone too far. We’ve seen enough.” (Page A8, Nov. 9).\n\nI strongly disagree with your conclusion in the piece.\n\nIf your ending paragraph is accepted, then we don’t have a democracy, we have a plutocracy. Your printed conclusion further cements the helplessness of 7 million Bay Area citizens to determine the government that should rule us. That you should thank the oligarchs for protecting us further disdains the fundamental right in a democracy of “one person, one vote.”\n\nEric Eschen\n\nEx-parks GM leaves\ncontext out of critique\n\nRe: “Ex-parks GM may sue after resigning” (Page B1, Nov. 11).\n\nEast Bay residents love our regional parks, but few follow the internal politics of district management.\n\nPast general manager Sabrina Landreth, following her resignation Nov. 7, has angrily denounced the elected board of directors. Missing from her narrative are two crucial precursor events:\n\nFirst, results from a survey conducted by the employee union were privately revealed the day Landreth resigned. Landreth was generally unpopular with staff because of her inflexible policies.\n\nSecond, her budget was far from balanced. There has been significant public objection to her recent budget proposal, which would have diverted up to $42 million in Measure WW funds that voters had approved for parkland acquisition. Previous GM Robert Doyle had written a ten-page letter opposing these transfers.\n\nAmelia Marshall\n\nElection results prove\nprotest creates change\n\nOn Nov. 7, voters throughout the country soundly repudiated Donald Trump and the malfeasance, corruption and meanness his administration embodies. While commentators ascribe many reasons for the Democrats’ success, including the economy, Jeffrey Epstein and election protection, they missed the important effect of powerful public protests. Nearly 8 million people took to the streets across the country, with hand-drawn signs and peaceful presence, and that action engaged others to get out and vote.\n\nMany people who feel dissatisfied, fearful and angry about Trump’s misadministration of our government saw that they are not alone. We can resist Trump’s dictatorship. They saw friends and strangers coming to protest and realized that they also could participate, at least by voting.\n\nWhile MAGA media mouthpieces ask, disingenuously, “What do those protesters want?” people are saying on protest signs and on ballots, “no dictators,” “no corruption,” “rule of law,” “democracy.”\n\nJoin in.

In a post on X on November 13, Carlson said he had obtained Crooks’ online posts and accused the FBI of concealing his digital activity. “The FBI told us Thomas Crooks tried to kill Donald Trump last summer but somehow had no online footprint. The FBI lied, and we can prove it because we have his posts. The question is why? Story tomorrow,” Carlson wrote. The FBI responded through its new “FBI Rapid Response” account on X, denying Carlson’s claim. “This FBI has never said Thomas Crooks had no online footprint. Ever,” the post stated, suggesting the bureau under current leadership had not made such assertions. What We Know So Far About Thomas Crooks' Online Footprint Days after the attempted assassination, FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate revealed during a US Senate hearing that investigators had uncovered a social media account believed to be linked to Crooks from 2019–2020, when he was 15 or 16 years old. Abbate said the account contained more than 700 posts, including violent antisemitic and anti-immigration comments that appeared to endorse political violence. The disclosure was among the first public indications of a possible motive behind the July 13 attack in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Crooks fired an AR-15-style rifle at Trump, grazing his ear, killing one attendee, and injuring two others before Secret Service snipers killed him. Investigators have previously described Crooks as a loner with limited social connections beyond his immediate family.

Still, whether it may serve that purpose or only patrols the Caribbean as the US blows up boats it accuses of trafficking drugs, the presence of the 100,000-ton warship alone is sending a message.“This is the anchor of what it means to have US military power once again in Latin America,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for the Andes region. “And it has raised a lot of anxieties in Venezuela but also throughout the region. I think everyone is watching this with sort of bated breath to see just how willing the US is to really use military force.”The Ford’s impending arrival is a major moment in the Trump administration’s campaign in South America, which it describes as a counterdrug operation. It escalates the already massive buildup of military firepower in the region, with added pressure from bomber training runs near the Venezuelan coast, CIA operations that have been publicly authorized inside the country and boat strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed over 75 people..preferred-source-banner{ margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:10px;}The US has long used aircraft carriers as tools of deterrence to pressure and influence other nations, often without employing any force at all. They carry thousands of sailors and dozens of warplanes that can strike targets deep inside another country.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday formally named the mission Operation Southern Spear, emphasizing the growing significance and permanence of the military’s presence in the region. Once the Ford arrives, the mission will encompass nearly a dozen Navy ships as well 12,000 sailors and Marines.TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT'S FOCUSED ON FIGHTING DRUG TRAFFICKING Secretary of State Marco Rubio insists that President Donald Trump is focused on stopping drugs from entering the US by combatting “organized criminal narcoterrorists.”“That’s what he’s authorized. That’s what the military’s doing. That’s why our assets are there,” he told reporters Wednesday after meeting his counterparts from the Group of Seven democracies in Canada.But Rubio also says the US doesn’t recognize Maduro, who was widely accused of stealing last year’s election, as the leader of Venezuela and called the government a “transshipment organization” that openly cooperates with those trafficking drugs toward the US.Some experts say deploying the Ford appears to be geared more toward a government change in Venezuela than drug trafficking.“There’s nothing that an aircraft carrier brings that is useful for combating the drug trade,” Dickinson said. “I think it’s clearly a message that is much more geared toward pressuring Caracas.”Bryan Clark, a former Navy submariner and defense analyst at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, said the Trump administration would not have deployed the Ford “if they didn’t intend to use it.”“I think this administration is very open to using military force to accomplish particular objectives,” Clark said. “I think they’re going to want to actually do some military operations unless Maduro steps down in the next month or so.”After Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth briefed lawmakers last week, Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said they gave no indication that the strikes would be stopping but also indicated that they were targeting cocaine traffickers and not overtly intending to overthrow Maduro.Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, expects US warships to launch missiles from other ships before launching any American warplanes. He said Venezuela has relatively sophisticated missile defense systems from Russia that could put American pilots at risk.“Because they have so many systems, some are relatively new, and all are mobile, we probably wouldn’t get them all,” Cancian said. “So there’s some risk that we could lose some aircraft.”VENEZUELA MOBILIZES FOR POSSIBLE ATTACK Venezuela’s government this week touted a “massive” mobilization of troops and civilians to defend against possible US attacks. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López said in a statement that “land, air, naval, riverine, and missile assets” would be part of a two-day readiness effort “to confront imperialist threats.”State television showed members of the military, police and militias standing in formations across the country. Padrino also delivered remarks, broadcast on state television, standing by a surface-to-air missile system in a military base in the capital, Caracas.Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the US, has insisted the Trump administration’s intentions are to force him from power. Venezuela’s US-backed political opposition has renewed its promise of an imminent government change.David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for more than 30 years, said the US military does not have enough manpower in the region, even with the aircraft carrier, for an invasion.“It’s consistent with this desire to demonstrate credible force, which they had already,” Smilde said of the carrier. “It doesn’t change the equation. I don’t think that the fact that it is there means that they necessarily have to strike. It just means that Trump and Hegseth have not forgotten about this, and they are still onboard in trying to generate a regime change through a show of force.”Smilde said Venezuela’s political opposition has long told US officials that “just a credible threat of force” would cause Maduro’s government to crumble. For Trump, he said, that would be the best outcome of this operation.PUSHBACK ON INTELLIGENCE The US actions have faced pushback in the region, in Congress and among rights organizations. However, Senate Republicans voted last week to reject legislation that would have put a check on Trump’s ability to launch an attack against Venezuela.Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who was recently hit with US sanctions over allegations of aiding the drug trade, on Tuesday announced he was cutting off intelligence sharing with the longtime North American ally until the strikes stop. But he softened his stance the following day, saying the sharing would continue as long as agencies guarantee it won’t be used in actions that jeopardize human rights.Rubio pushed back on reports that the United Kingdom has halted some intelligence sharing in the region over concerns about the strikes, saying US assets in the region provide such information.The US is not “asking anyone to help us with what we’re doing — in any realm. And that includes the military,” he said.Mexico, however, is stepping up its cooperation with the US in targeting drug trafficking. President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her administration made an agreement with the US for Mexico’s navy to intercept boats in international waters near Mexico that the US alleges are carrying drugs to avoid any more strikes off its coast.'A USE-IT-OR-LOSE-IT KIND OF SITUATION' The Ford, originally deployed to the Mediterranean Sea, was within the US Southern Command region but not yet in the Caribbean. The carrier was in the mid-Atlantic on Thursday, a defense official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter said on condition of anonymity.Clark said sending the Ford to South America would have a minimal impact on costs and readiness in the short term because it still has a month or two left on its regularly scheduled deployment.Cancian, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the US can’t afford to have the Ford “dawdling around the Caribbean” for long. It’s such a powerful military asset that it may be needed elsewhere, such as the Middle East.“It’s a use-it-or-lose-it kind of situation,” he said.- EndsPublished By: Nitish SinghPublished On: Nov 14, 2025Must Watch","url":"https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-aircraft-carrier-nears-venezuela-raising-alarms-over-potential-conflict-2819416-2025-11-14","image":"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202511/venezuela-us-tensions-282807877-16x9.jpg?VersionId=KEPjE8OqVfQhT.59gZ7Iv2TRDPgaMzxu?size=1280:720","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:24:50","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.153},{"id":378778846,"title":"Justice Department Sues To Block California US House Map in Clash That Could Tip Control of Congress","text":"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Justice Department on Thursday sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, joining a court battle that could help determine which party wins control of the U.S. House in 2026.\n\nThe complaint filed in California federal court targets the new congressional map pushed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in response to a similar Republican-led effort in Texas backed by President Donald Trump. It sets the stage for a high-stakes legal and political fight between the Republican administration and the Democratic governor, who’s seen as a likely 2028 presidential contender.\n\n“California’s redistricting scheme is a brazen power grab that tramples on civil rights and mocks the democratic process,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an emailed statement. “Governor Newsom’s attempt to entrench one-party rule and silence millions of Californians will not stand.”\n\nNewsom spokesperson Brandon Richards said in a statement, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.”\n\nThe legal move against heavily Democratic California marks the first time the Justice Department has sued over a flurry of unusual, mid-decade House map revisions across the country that were drawn to maximize partisan advantage in advance of next year’s elections.\n\nThree Republican-led states — Texas, along with Missouri and North Carolina — have not faced federal legal action after revamping district lines following Trump’s call for new maps to expand GOP numbers in the House. Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nCalifornia voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 50, a constitutional amendment changing the congressional boundaries to give Democrats a shot at winning five seats now held by Republicans in next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe Justice Department is joining a case challenging the new map that was brought by the California Republican Party last week. The Trump administration accuses California of racial gerrymandering in violation of the Constitution by using race as a factor to favor Hispanic voters with the new map. It asks a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.\n\n“Race cannot be used as a proxy to advance political interests, but that is precisely what the California General Assembly did with Proposition 50 — the recent ballot initiative that junked California’s pre-existing electoral map in favor of a rush-job rejiggering of California’s congressional district lines,” the lawsuit says.\n\nProp 50 was Newsom’s response to Trump’s maneuvers in Texas, where Republicans rejiggered districts in hopes of picking up five seats of their own ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when House control will be on the line.\n\nDemocrats need to gain just a handful of seats next year to take control of the chamber, which would imperil Trump’s agenda for the remainder of his term and open the way for congressional investigations into his administration. Republicans hold 219 seats, to Democrats’ 214.\n\nThe showdown between the nation’s two most populous states has spread nationally, with Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio adopting new district lines that could provide a partisan advantage. Other states are considering similar moves.\n\nThe national implications of California’s ballot measure were clear in both the money it attracted and the high-profile figures who became involved. Tens of millions of dollars flowed into the race, including a $5 million donation to opponents from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super political action committee tied to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.\n\nFormer Republican Gov.

Lewis, whose family remains the controlling shareholder of the English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, was indicted in 2023 on allegations that he schemed for years to abuse his access to corporate boardrooms and repeatedly shared inside information with romantic partners, associates, private pilots and others. “Mr. Lewis admitted he made a terrible mistake, did not fight extradition in the case, and paid a $5 million fine,” a White House official told NBC News in a statement Thursday confirming the pardon first reported by The Athletic. The statement said that the 88-year-old Lewis, who now lives in the Bahamas, “requested a pardon so that he may receive medical treatment and visit his grandchildren and great-grandchildren in the United States.” Lewis’ net worth is $6.9 billion, according to a Forbes estimate. In a statement provided through Harry Roxburgh, a spokesperson for Tavistock Group, Lewis said: “I am pleased all of this is now behind me, and I can enjoy retirement and watch as my family and extended family continue to build our businesses based on the quality and pursuit of excellence that has become our trademark.” A source close to the Lewis family said in a statement that Lewis and his family “are extremely grateful for this pardon and would like to thank President Trump for taking this action.” Trump recently resumed issuing pardons after the White House temporarily paused and sought to tighten its reviews following concerns that the process had become a lucrative business for lobbying and consulting firms during Trump’s second term. Trump on Monday pardoned his former attorney Rudy Giuliani and 76 others who have been tied to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, including attorneys Sidney Powell, John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, as well as his former chief of staff Mark Meadows. Those pardons, however, are viewed as largely symbolic since none of the individuals were convicted of federal crimes, which are shielded by presidential pardon power. Last month, Trump commuted the sentence of former Rep. George Santos. The New York Republican was set to serve seven years in prison after pleading guilty last year to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-pardons-former-tottenham-hotspur-owner-joe-lewis-insider-trading-rcna243826","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251113-Joe-Lewis-ch-1911-e6e233.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:23:21","author":"Garrett Haake,Steve Kopack,Zoë Richards","authors":["Garrett Haake","Steve Kopack","Zoë Richards"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.343},{"id":378778206,"title":"The Scandal Trump Can’t Shake","text":"Since his return to office, President Donald Trump has missed few chances to flex the power he wields over the nation’s most formidable institutions and its wealthiest people. So when the White House announced that Trump would host the latest in a series of dinners with top business executives, this time including JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon and the chief executive of Nasdaq, reporters in the White House press pool prepared to watch Trump show off.\n\nNope. Last night’s dinner was closed to the press. No reporter was even given a glance. And later, when the White House held a signing ceremony for the president to officially end the longest federal government shutdown in history, the reporters present were quickly whisked out of the Oval Office. Today, too, he didn’t talk to the press after signing an executive order alongside the first lady in the East Room. The president, to be clear, had not suddenly become camera-shy. But he had indicated to aides that he didn’t want to face reporters’ questions, because every inquiry was going to be about the one subject that Trump, for all his power, simply can’t make go away.\n\nJeffrey Epstein is dead. But the disgraced financier and sex offender continues to shadow Trump. The storyline’s reemergence yesterday—with the release of thousands of Epstein’s emails, some of which highlight his relationship with Trump—delivered another blow to a president already at the weakest moment of his second term. Trump’s party got wiped out in last week’s elections as voters assigned it the greater portion of blame for the shutdown. The Supreme Court seems set to unravel his signature tariffs. His poll numbers have dipped as Americans conclude that he cares too much about gilded ballrooms and is not focused nearly enough on bringing down high prices. And dread has crept into the West Wing now that Trump faces a rare rebuke from fellow Republicans, including some who have been among his most loyal MAGA foot soldiers.\n\nTrump and a number of top Department of Justice officials this week tried to persuade a pair of normally close allies, Representatives Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace, to withdraw their names from a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing a trove of Epstein material. Their efforts failed, and it will go to the House floor next week. The president in the past two days has made a round of calls to longtime allies to rage against the Epstein matter, blaming Democrats and the media, one of the people who received a call told me. (A White House official later confirmed that the president was “speaking to trusted friends”; both people spoke with me under the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.) In those calls, Trump mused about pressuring GOP senators to block the release of additional files when the matter could go to the upper chamber later this month.\n\nThe White House’s push to keep more Epstein materials from being released came after Democrats on the House Oversight Committee leaked emails yesterday morning that suggested close ties between the sex offender and Trump. House Republicans, hoping to distract from the initial emails, released an additional 23,000 messages. (Some of those emails, including one in which Epstein offered to give the Russian government information on Trump, only raised more uncomfortable questions for the president.) All of this came after Speaker Mike Johnson sent the House home for nearly eight weeks, in part so that he could delay swearing in the Democratic representative-elect whose vote provided the needed margin to authorize the release of the Epstein files. And although Trump has avoided reporters, his anger broke into the open on social media yesterday.\n\n“The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein hoax again” to distract from the shutdown, Trump posted. “Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.”\n\nAll this, of course, raises the question: What exactly is Trump trying to prevent from being released? For months, White House aides have snapped at reporters who even mentioned the word Epstein. But in private moments, members of the president’s inner circle acknowledge that they don’t know the true extent of Trump’s relationship with Epstein. The men were close, to be sure, and clearly enjoyed chasing women decades ago in the party circles of Manhattan and Palm Beach. That’s been known for years, and although that history is embarrassing, Trump has never been charged with any wrongdoing. Is he trying to protect himself? Or someone close to him? He doesn’t talk about it, allies say, except to fume that it’s still a story. But Trump’s over-the-top response prompted the ally he called to urge Trump to change tactics because he’s “not acting like someone who has nothing to hide.”\n\nTrump was always an unlikely champion for those on the right who believed in the Epstein conspiracy theories. The men were undeniably friends. There are plenty of photos of them together, including at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump flew on Epstein’s private jets seven times in the mid-1990s, according to flight logs that emerged at an Epstein-related trial. And in a 2002 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Trump said he’d known Epstein for 15 years and praised him as a “terrific guy.” The financier pleaded guilty in Florida state court in 2008 and was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He received a generous—and controversial—plea deal and served a short prison sentence before being released. He was arrested again in August 2019 and was accused of sex-trafficking minors. Epstein died a month later in jail, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide, but many on the far right suspected that he had been killed to keep him from revealing what he knew about the rich and the powerful. The so-called “Epstein files”—an accounting of who else in his orbit might have been involved—became something of an obsession in the MAGA movement. Though Trump never quite championed that cause, he led many to believe that, were he to return to power, he’d expose the truth and deliver justice.\n\nThat’s not at all what has happened. Even after Attorney General Pam Bondi declared early this year that she had the Epstein files on her desk, only scattered documents were released to right-wing influencers. Trump then made clear that he wanted to move on, blasting those still obsessed with Epstein who, in the president’s words, has been “dead for a long time. I don’t understand what the interest or what the fascination is.” He sued his on-again, off-again friend Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion after The Wall Street Journal reported in July that Trump had sent Epstein a lewd birthday card in 2003.\n\nBut some in Trump’s base felt betrayed, like he was trying to invalidate a core political belief of theirs. And some Republicans refused to abandon the issue. Four of them—Mace, Boebert, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Thomas Massie—defied Trump to vote with Democrats this week on the Epstein discharge position. Boebert and Taylor Greene did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Massie said the representative was unavailable. A spokesperson for Mace responded by pointing to a social-media post in which the candidate for governor in South Carolina urged a focus on the women and underage girls whom Epstein trafficked. If the measure passes both houses of Congress, Trump would likely veto it—and face even more scrutiny.\n\nIndeed, Trump’s own efforts to manage the story have only fed it. His account of why he and Epstein had a falling-out two decades ago has shifted multiple times. His aides have advised him to stop saying that he has the right to pardon Epstein’s former partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking and related offenses. (Maxwell was transferred to a cushier prison in Texas over the summer after an unusual one-on-one meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump’s former personal lawyer.) White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt raised eyebrows yesterday when she said that Trump was not considering a pardon for Maxwell “at this moment in time.” The White House did not respond to my request for comment.\n\nFew people in the White House believe that the Epstein matter will swing many votes next year. But it has the makings of an unrelenting distraction, a scandal that could bog down Trump’s presidency. Further Republican rebellions could loosen Trump’s grip on the GOP just as he is trying to preserve his party’s Capitol Hill majorities. Should he lose one or both of the houses of Congress next year, he’d face congressional investigations and be firmly relegated to lame-duck status.\n\nTrump is set to depart Washington tomorrow for another weekend at Mar-a-Lago, according to the White House. At the lush Palm Beach club, where he once palled around with Epstein, the president will surely talk to allies, eager to change the subject from the one consuming his administration.\n\nA travel press pool will also make the trip to Florida on Air Force One. At least for now, Trump is not scheduled to take questions.","summary":"The president is desperate to make questions about Jeffrey Epstein go away, but there is no sign they

Civil rights advocates have argued that the new boundaries in Texas and Missouri illegally disadvantage minority communities at the ballot box.\n\nProposition 50 in California means that Democrats might win as many as five additional seats in the House in 2026, in an explicit attempt to offset the new Texas congressional map.\n\nHowever, the California Republican Party and 19 registered voters sued the state in federal court on November 5, a day after the election was held.\n\nThey claimed California’s redistricting effort violates provisions of the US Constitution by unlawfully favouring Hispanic communities.\n\nThe Justice Department has echoed those concerns in its complaint. It argues that California’s map “manipulates district lines in the name of bolstering the voting power of Hispanic Californians because of their race”.\n\nIn response, Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for Governor Newsom, said, “These losers lost at the ballot box and soon they will also lose in court.”\n\nNewsom has emerged as a prominent Democratic critic of Trump, calling the president’s opposition to California’s ballot measure the “ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE”.\n\nNewsom has confirmed he will consider a White House run in 2028 once the 2026 midterm elections are over.\n\nCalifornia’s new district boundaries will apply for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nNormally, congressional districts in California are drawn by an independent commission, based on the results of a national census taken every 10 years.\n\nProposition 50 suspends that commission’s work for the next three national elections and instead adopts a map created by the state legislatures.\n\nIn theory, electoral maps should reflect the people who live in a given state. In reality, most boundaries are rejigged by the parties in power, in a process called gerrymandering. Legislatures in many states determine how the districts are drawn.\n\nCalifornia’s new congressional map aims to dilute Republican voters’ power, in one case by uniting rural, conservative-leaning parts of far northern California with Marin County, a famously liberal coastal stronghold across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nThe Justice Department is asking a judge to prohibit California from using the new map in any future elections.","url":"https://guyanainquirer.com/trump-administration-joins-lawsuit-against-californias-redistricting-maps/","image":"https://guyanainquirer.com/app/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-11T220719Z_1486360491_RC2LUHAJ1AOK_RTRMADP_3_CLIMATE-COP30-US-GOVERNORS-1763073477-6Dcj58.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:22:00","author":"Cb_usr","authors":["Cb_usr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gy","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":378785106,"title":"BBC Apologizes to Trump But Rejects Making Any Compensation","text":"The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump for its dishonestly edited report on January 6, but says it won't be offering him any compensation.\n\nThe BBC has apologised to US President Donald Trump for a Panorama episode that spliced parts of his 6 January 2021 speech together, but rejected his demands for compensation.The corporation said the edit had given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not show the 2024 programme again.Lawyers for Trump have threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn (£759m) in damages unless the corporation issues a retraction, apologises and compensates him.\n\nTop leadership at the BBC resigned earlier this week, but neither admitted to doing anything wrong. Deborah Turness, the CEO of News, issued a \"mistakes have been made\" statement but also denied there was any bias at the BBC. And yet, the Telegraph is reporting today that they identified another instance in which the BBC made essentially the same misleading edit, two years before the one that aired last October.\n\nBBC Newsnight also doctored footage of a Donald Trump speech and ignored concerns that were raised about it, The Telegraph can reveal.Spliced footage of the speech, which aired in an episode in 2022, made it appear that Mr Trump was encouraging his supporters to riot.The edit was similar to a version aired in a Panorama documentary that was broadcast last year...BBC insiders have sought to portray the bias allegations as part of a Right-wing coup against its news operation, suggesting that individual errors were not evidence of a systemic problem.However, the separately doctored Newsnight footage – disclosed to The Telegraph by a separate whistleblower who had worked on the programme – suggests issues are more ingrained in the corporation than its defenders claim.\n\nOnce could be an accident but twice is a pattern. Here's video of the newly discovered BBC edit from 2022.\n\nThe Telegraph revealed that the BBC doctored footage of President Trump’s Capital speech a SECOND time and ignored concerns that were raised about it by a former White House chief of staff.This sliced edit was used on Newsnight in 2022.This is activism, not a mere “mistake”. pic.twitter.com/EoYDsgz4c5— Chris Rose (@ArchRose90) November 13, 2025\n\nMick Mulvaney, who served as acting White House chief of staff in 2019 and 2020 and then became a Trump critic, appeared on the BBC Newsnight program where this misleading clip was aired. This is a live-to-air program and Mulvaney complained at the time that the video had been spliced together in a way that was misleading. Here's video of his reaction to the clip from 2022. \n\nBBC have been pushing lies for years, Panorama & now Newsnight. They aired this clip back in 2022 & had Mick Mulvaney as a guest, he called them out saying you've spliced clips together live on air.Trump needs to bring the BBC down so it sends a message out to the other MSM. pic.twitter.com/Wcdf5mjBUP— JARDINE (@oJARDINEo) November 13, 2025\n\nThe person who gave this information to the Telegraph worked at the BBC as a graphic designer on the Newsnight program in 2022, which is how they remember that this clip existed. They said Mulvaney's comments were raised in an internal meeting the next day with some producer asking about the clip. But the concerns were immediately brushed off and that was the end of it. You can hear the Telegraph's interview with this former BBC employee here.\n\nTrump's lawyers gave the BBC until Friday to apologize and offer him some compensation. Now he's received the apology but won't be offered any compensation. Does that mean Trump is going to sue tomorrow? I think the answer is possibly yes.\n\nIn response to the latest revelations, a spokesman for his legal team said it was “now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump”.\n\nThe fact that this happened twice and that the first time it was called out live really does make it harder to believe this was a mistake and not the result of bias. However, there is a hitch:\n\nMark Stephens, a lawyer at the London-based firm Howard Kennedy, said Trump would faces a “pretty insurmountable” challenge if he tried to sue in the U.K. given the relevant statute of limitation. “He had one year until Oct. 28, 2025, to launch his claim,” he said. “So he’s about two weeks out of time.”\n\nIf he's 2 weeks past the deadline for airing this last year, he's well past the deadline for the previous instance. So there may be a procedural reason this can't move forward. I'm not an attorney so I'll leave the legal wrangling to the experts. But stay tuned because we should know more about what comes next by tomorrow.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

The issue is especially sensitive in Japan, where there have been high-profile cases in recent years of karoshi, or “death from overwork”.\n\nSome argue that the meeting, which involved several aides and lasted about three hours, would feed into unhealthy extremes. Others said that Ms Takaichi was placing unnecessary burdens on her staff.\n\nMr Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister who leads the main opposition party, called Ms Takaichi’s decision to hold the meeting “crazy”. When he was Japan’s leader from 2011 to 2012, he would start work around 6am or 7am.\n\n“It’s fine for her to work, but she should not be getting other people involved,” he said in an interview. “Everyone is in bed at that time of day. It’s a very sad attitude for the top leader of the country to show.”\n\nMs Takaichi, who took office in October as Japan’s prime minister – the first woman to serve in that role – has sought to clarify the circumstances of the meeting. She has said that her fax machine at home was jammed (faxes are still a mainstay of communication in Japan). She decided to go to the prime minister’s residence – she has not yet moved in – so that she could review briefing materials there ahead of a 9am budget meeting at the Diet, Japan’s Parliament.\n\nMs Takaichi, speaking to Parliament on Nov 7, acknowledged that her early morning preparation had “caused inconvenience” to her staff. But she said it was necessary to meet so early to rewrite drafts of answers for lawmakers on a variety of issues.\n\nMs Takaichi’s supporters have defended her. Some in her party, the Liberal Democratic Party, have blamed opposition lawmakers for submitting questions too late.\n\n“Even a workaholic like Prime Minister Takaichi wouldn’t want to be at work at 3am,” Ms Midori Matsushima, an LDP lawmaker, wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSome business leaders also have spoken in support of Ms Takaichi, saying they do not understand the fuss over her work habits.\n\nMr Kenji Koshio, chief executive of Shindenki, a small electronics company in the city of Kobe, wrote on his blog that troops, police officers, firefighters and medical workers were expected to work around the clock. Why not Japan’s prime minister?\n\nResponding to the uproar over the meeting, he wrote: “Why don’t you just stop being so lame and be grateful to the people who are working hard for the people of Japan?”\n\nThe controversy comes as Japan considers relaxing the upper limits on overtime, an idea that Ms Takaichi recently endorsed. The current limit of 45 hours of overtime per month was put in place in 2019 after the death of Ms Matsuri Takahashi, an employee of Dentsu, the advertising giant, who died by suicide in 2016 after clocking more than 100 hours of overtime per month.\n\nMs Takaichi has supported allowing people to work more overtime, saying it is an important source of income. But she has also said that it should not come at the expense of the well-being of Japan’s workers.\n\n“I do not approve of overtime that leads to death from overwork,” Ms Takaichi said at another appearance in Parliament in November. “I am concerned that a reduction in overtime pay will lead to people damaging their health by taking on unfamiliar side jobs in order to earn a living.”\n\nSince entering politics in the 1990s, Ms Takaichi has made her work ethic a part of her identity. She promised during her recent campaign to scrap her work-life balance upon taking office, saying she would “work and work and work and work”.\n\nHer comments were criticised by relatives of people who have died from overwork in Japan, who said she has set a bad example.\n\nSince being named prime minister only about three weeks ago, Ms Takaichi has had an unusually packed schedule. She recently hosted a visit to Japan by President Donald Trump, and she attended meetings in Malaysia and South Korea.\n\nMr Shigeaki Koga, a former economic official, said in an interview that he could sympathise with Ms Takaichi’s frenetic first few weeks in office. But he said she should stick to her predecessors’ practice of holding meetings only after 7am or 8am.\n\n“Three o’clock in the morning is way too early,” he said, “no matter what.”\n\nMr Koga noted that it was probably impossible for any modern leader to get adequate rest, but he said it was important not to place burdens on staff.\n\n“The prime minister can’t relax,” he said. “But the best thing is to work hard in secret.” NYTIMES","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-pm-takaichi-faces-backlash-for-starting-meeting-at-3am","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/66345d7ddcf2db021747c1650ae6879eadfffcd2de3439ee4133788fda29c9de","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:20:00","author":"Ms Takaichi","authors":["Ms Takaichi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.304},{"id":378722874,"title":"ANSA Chemicals Jamaica donates 69,800 litres of bleach to support sanitisation efforts after hurricane","text":"Latest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nInternational News\n\nNorth & East\n\nEnvironment\n\nSocial Love\n\nHorse Racing\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCommonwealth Games\n\nFIFA World Cup 2022\n\nEntertainment\n\nArt & Culture\n\nTuesday Style\n\nFood Awards\n\nJOL Takes Style Out\n\nDesign Week JA\n\nBlack Friday\n\nRelationships\n\nClassifieds\n\nMotor Vehicles\n\nPlace an Ad\n\nJobs & Careers\n\nStudy Centre\n\nJnr Study Centre\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News\n\nFood Awards\n\nEntertainment\n\nWorld Champs\n\nCareer & Education\n\nEnvironment\n\nAdvertorial\n\nSupplements\n\nClassifieds\n\nDesign Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(From left) Director General of the ODPEM Commander Alvin Gayle;Dwaine Williams, general manager of Berger Paints Jamaica; Stephen Summers, country manager of ANSA Chemicals Jamaica; and Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change Matthew Samuda, paused for a photo at the relief support handover at ODPEM on Wednesday. \n\n Latest News, News \n\nNovember 13, 2025\n\n\n\n\n ANSA Chemicals Jamaica donates 69,800 litres of bleach to support sanitisation efforts after hurricane \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a continued effort to support public health and safety, ANSA Chemicals Jamaica has announced a donation of 69,800 litres of bleach to help with the ongoing sanitisation efforts in communities across the island that were severely impacted by Hurricane Melissa. \n\nThis donation consists of eight per cent industrial-strength bleach and five per cent household bleach, aimed at ensuring households in remote or isolated areas have access to properly treated water for their use. \n\n“ANSA Chemicals Jamaica and our parent company, ANSA McAL Chemicals, are committed to aiding the relief and rebuilding effort by providing quality bleach to support sanitation and water treatment in communities severely impacted by Hurricane Melisa. \n\n“This donation is a part of our ongoing commitment to the people of Jamaica in their time of need,” said Stephen Summers, country manager of ANSA Chemicals Jamaica.\n\nHe noted that the donation includes 50 IBC totes (1,000L each) of eight per cent bleach, totaling 50,000 litres, and 1,800 cases of five per cent household bleach amounting to 10,800 containers and 19,800 litres.\n\nAs part of this initiative, ANSA Chemicals plans to deliver between three to five totes per day, in addition to one container of 1,800 cases of household bleach (1.5L bottles). \n\nThe company aims to distribute these materials efficiently and effectively to ensure timely access to safe water sanitization resources.\n\nIn a media release ANSA Chemicals quoted Minister of Water, Environment and Climate Change Matthew Samuda as saying: “A storm the size of Hurricane Melissa is not something that any government can manage without partnerships, whether multi-lateral, bi-lateral, the private sector and local NGOs. This is one such partnership, and we’re very happy with the donation from Ansa Chemicals.\n\n “One of the things people don’t contemplate after disasters, until you have a public health crisis, is our ability to keep the place clean and deal with the spread of germs and other similar issues, so we are happy for this donation”.\n\nANSA Chemicals said the supplies will be distributed through and by the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM) and quoted Commander Alvin Gayle, Director General of the State agency as welcoming the contribution which helps to strengthen its efforts in managing this public health crisis caused by the passage of the hurricane. \n\n“These cleaning, sanitation and purifying supplies from ANSA Chemicals are quite vital. I think a lot of us underestimate the requirements for sanitation after a disaster, and as such, this will go a long way to ensure that the Jamaican population remains safe after this disaster,” the release quoted Gayle.\n\nANSA Chemicals Jamaica is a leading provider of chemical products in the Caribbean, specializing in solutions that improve public health and contribute to the safety and well-being of communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags: ANSA Chemicals Jamaica bleach hurricane relief \n\n\n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments · Make a comment\n\n\n\n\n ALSO ON JAMAICA OBSERVER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Flow Foundation draws inspiration from resilient spirit of Hanover and Westmoreland residents \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n In the wake of the widespread devastation left by Hurricane Melissa, the indomitable Jamaican spirit stood proudly amidst the destruction, according t... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n US Death Row inmate granted clemency minutes before execution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n WASHINGTON, United States (AFP) -- An Oklahoma man who was to be executed by lethal injection for a 2002 murder was granted clemency at the last minut... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational News, Latest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Mexican car industry fears higher tariffs on China will drive its demise \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AFP) -- Mexico's car assembly industry, one of the biggest in the world, fears US President Donald Trump's tariff war will impede... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News, News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Banton doubles down on theft claim, accuses Vaz of victim shaming \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n Reggae superstar Buju Banton has doubled down on allegations that his hurricane relief items were stolen at the port and has accused Daryl Vaz of atte... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘Nothing was missing’: Vaz refutes Buju Banton’s claim of stolen hurricane relief items \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n KINGSTON, Jamaica — Minister of Science, Energy, Telecommunications and Transport Daryl Vaz has refuted allegations made by reggae superstar Buju Bant... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Heavy traffic in Linstead following alleged shootout \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n ST CATHERINE, Jamaica — There is heavy traffic in Linstead following a reported overnight shootout between police and suspected gunmen on the Linstead... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Education ministry gets $500-m for school clean-up \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n With school resumption labelled as top priority, the Ministry of Education has announced that $500 million has been dedicated to clean up efforts of i... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Schools to resume next week out west, says education minister \n\n\n Shift systems, tents being explored \n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 13, 2025 \n\n\n MONTEGO BAY, St James — Some schools in hurricane-ravaged western Jamaica will resume classes next week, relying on a blend of shift systems and makes... \n\n\n\n\n {\"jamaica-observer\":\"Jamaica Observer\"} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOUSE RULES\n\n\n\nWe welcome reader comments on the top stories of the day.

Hegseth said the operation is being led by Joint Task Force Southern Spear and US Southern Command (Southcom), with the objective to defend the \"Homeland, remove narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secure our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people.\" \"The Western Hemisphere is America’s neighbourhood – and we will protect it,\" he wrote on social media on Thursday evening. The announcement follows reports that Hegseth, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Dan Caine and other senior military officials briefed President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday on possible military options in the region, including land strikes against Venezuela. Also Read: US Warship Nears Venezuela - Could Strikes Be Coming and What Might They Hit? It also came shortly after news that the US military had carried out its 20th lethal strike against an alleged drug-trafficking boat on Monday. A Pentagon official, speaking anonymously to The Hill, said four \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the operation in the Caribbean Sea. At least 76 people have been killed since the counter-narcotics campaign began in early September. The strikes have taken place in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which the administration says are intended to curb the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. In late January, the US Navy’s 4th Fleet said it would begin a separate initiative, also called \"Southern Spear,\" to deploy a mix of robotic and autonomous systems to detect and monitor illicit trafficking in Southcom’s area of responsibility, which covers more than 30 countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean. It is unclear how Hegseth’s most recent announcement relates to that earlier plan. The US has significantly increased its military presence in the region in recent months, sending warships, F-35 fighter jets, surveillance aircraft and other assets as pressure mounts on Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, whom the administration has described as an \"illegitimate leader.\" Further reinforcements arrived this week with the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, to Southcom. The vessel carries more than 4,000 sailors, F/A-18 Super Hornets and long-range Tomahawk missiles.

It also gave Pulte’s critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims.\n\n“This is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump’s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. “His behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.”\n\nThe episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He’s prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president’s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell.\n\nIn June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building — a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.\n\nPulte is also targeting the nation’s largest homebuilders\n\nPulte also has focused on large home construction companies, which have drawn Trump’s ire. Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume.\n\n“I’m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!” he posted to X in early October.\n\nIn a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency “requires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.”\n\nFannie Mae said it takes “compliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.”\n\nPulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCurrying favor with the president\n\nSince his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump’s campaign, records show.\n\nWhen Trump sought to oust Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Pulte became a leading attacker, routinely taking to X, formerly Twitter, where he has over 3 million followers, to excoriate the central bank leader.\n\nOn Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that some Fannie Mae ethics and oversight officials who were fired last month had been investigating whether Pulte improperly obtained mortgage information for James, who was charged last month with bank fraud after Pulte sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department. She said the charges, which she denies, are politically motivated.\n\nPulte’s power over the mortgage lending industry is unusual. Not long after his Senate confirmation, he appointed himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which both hold trillions of dollars in assets. The companies serve as a crucial backstop for the home lending industry by buying up mortgages from individual lenders, which are packaged together and sold to investors.\n\nThe three competing roles present the potential for a conflict of interest that is detailed in emails reviewed by AP. Like many matters of public policy in Trump’s Washington, it appears to have begun with a social media post.\n\nIn early October, Trump criticized the homebuilding industry, which he likened to the oil-market-dominating cartel OPEC.\n\n“They’re sitting on 2 million empty lots, A RECORD,” the president posted to his social media platform, Truth Social. “I’m asking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to get Big Homebuilders going.”\n\n“On it,” Pulte posted in response on X.\n\nSensitive data was gathered\n\nHe turned to Smith, who in her brief tenure at Fannie Mae had become a trusted Pulte ally whose work portfolio transcended the boundaries dividing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\nSoon, a team at Fannie Mae was overseeing an effort to pull together a tranche of mortgage data, according to emails reviewed by the AP. Smith played a central role and shared the confidential lender-level pricing information with Freddie Mac, which set off alarms at both companies, according to the emails. A spokesman for Freddie Mac declined comment.\n\nIn the Oct. 11 email to Smith, Evans, the Fannie Mae mortgage executive, also added others to the email chain because they “were involved with this week’s efforts to compile this information” and he wanted to “make sure you do not exacerbate this issue.”\n\nDanielle McCoy, Fannie Mae’s general counsel, weighed in, adding that the information Smith provided to Freddie Mac should “never be shared” and “could put the company at risk.”\n\nOthers who were part of the email chain included Almodovar; chief operating officer Peter Akwaboah; Devang Doshi, a senior vice president for capital markets; and John Roscoe, a Pulte loyalist and former Trump White House aide, who served as Fannie Mae’s vice president for public relations.\n\nDays later, Almodovar, McCoy and Evans — who did not respond to requests for comment — were out of a job. Meanwhile, Roscoe was promoted to co-president of the company, while Akwaboah was named acting CEO.\n\nPulte also got something he wanted.\n\nA day after the terse email exchange, Trump posted a graphic to his Truth Social network that featured Fannie Mae’s logo, a list of large homebuilders and the headline “We Give Them Billions.”\n\nPulte quickly reposted it.\n\nAssociated Press writer Fatima Hussein contributed reporting.","url":"https://www.courant.com/2025/11/13/trump-pulte/","image":"https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trump_Pulte_80129.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-14 00:16:00","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":378784790,"title":"Top Fannie Mae officials ousted after sounding alarm on sharing confidential housing data","text":"By BRIAN SLODYSKO\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration’s top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor, alarming senior officials of the government-backed lending giant who warned it could expose the company to claims that it was colluding with a rival to fix mortgage rates.\n\nEmails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the “very problematic” disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company’s head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte’s behalf.\n\n“Lauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,” Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae’s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email addressed to Smith. “That is confidential, competitive information.”\n\nHe also copied Fannie Mae’s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: “As Per Director Pulte’s Ask.” Evans asked Fannie Mae’s top attorney “to weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.”\n\nWhile Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies.\n\nHousing industry rattled by dismissals\n\nThe dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats.
