After her ejection on April 22, Nuzzi reported on the trial without informing readers she was banned from the 15th floor of the Manhattan criminal courthouse where it took place, her subsequent coverage shows. Court officials removed Nuzzi after guards caught her snapping pictures – for the second time – in an adjacent room where reporters and some public attendees watched the trial on a monitor. Officials gave Nuzzi a warning after the first offense, but she ignored it. “She was treated with deference originally, but continued taking photos despite the fact she was instructed and told not to,” another reporter who covered the trial told The Post. “Journalist Olivia Nuzzi was expelled for the remainder of the Trump proceedings for breaking rules prohibiting the taking of photographs in the audience overflow room at our criminal courthouse in Lower Manhattan,” spokesman Al Baker confirmed Friday. Under state law, the unauthorized televising or photographing of court proceedings is a misdemeanor, but Nuzzi and several other journalists caught breaking the rule during the Trump trial were not charged, records show. Nuzzi’s ouster came more than a month before the trial ended with guilty verdicts against Trump on May 29. She will also be barred from attending Trump’s sentencing, set for Nov. 26, officials said. During the trial, journalists and other attendees needed a court-issued pass to get to the 15th floor, which was highly secured by the Secret Service and NYPD. Photojournalists were permitted to shoot only facing Trump’s defense table, not from behind it where court personnel could be viewed. Taking photos in the overflow room was also strictly prohibited, Nuzzi did not take photos of court proceedings on the monitor in the overflow room, and the second offense involved photographing a friend after the trial was done for the day, said a source familiar with the incident. New York Magazine did not return emails from The Post seeking comment on Nuzzi’s expulsion from the trial, and asking whether the magazine ever informed readers about it. The magazine suspended Nuzzi after she admitted “the nature of some communications between myself and a former reporting subject turned personal,” a reference to RFK Jr. She denied a physical relationship.","summary":"Before New York Magazine writer Olivia Nuzzi was suspended for allegedly sexting with RFK Jr, she was booted from Donald Trump’s hush-money criminal trial for taking photos against court rules, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/21/us-news/new-york-mag-writer-olivia-nuzzi-was-banned-from-trumps-hush-money-trial-for-breaking-court-rules-twice/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-sunpk3yfy-1726965390744.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726951024&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bv9uH4we-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:37:50","author":"Susan Edelman","authors":["Susan Edelman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.388},{"id":256947700,"title":"Biden and Albanese declare the Quad alliance is 'here to stay' beyond the November US election","text":"The leaders of the Quad have declared the alliance is \"here to stay\", as the four-country dialogue faces the uncertainty of a changing US administration in November. The United States, Australia, India and Japan have held talks since 2021, to improve cooperation across the Indo-Pacific region with a particular focus on security. US President Joe Biden raised the prominence of the grouping early in his term in office by starting the leader-level talks. There are concerns that if Republican nominee Donald Trump wins the presidential election in November, he may not have the same level of commitment to the Quad alliance. But all four leaders — who met in the US state of Delaware at Joe Biden's former school this weekend — expressed confidence the forum would remain prominent. \"While challenges will come, the world will change, [but] the Quad is here to stay, I believe, here to stay,\" Mr Biden said as he opened the talks. Asked a short time earlier by the media if the Quad would survive beyond the election in November, he replied: \"Way beyond November. Way beyond November.\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Quad's relatively recent beginnings worked to its advantage. \"Unlike some international forums, the Quad doesn't have a long history,\" he said. \"It's not defined by tradition, but it also means that it is not confined by it. It means that as it develops, it can evolve. \"And that is, I believe, what is happening.\" India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will be the longest-serving leader of the Quad at its next meeting, also forecast a long future for the grouping. \"The Quad is here to stay,\" he said. Joint coast guard operations and expanded vaccine programs The summit was held at Archmere Academy, the private Catholic prep school Mr Biden and three of his children attended in Claymont, Delaware. Having raised the prominence of the Quad, Mr Biden seems keen to ensure it remains relevant long beyond his time in office. Leaning on his personal connections to give gravitas to the event may help shore up its standing and, in turn, his foreign policy legacy. This weekend's Quad meeting had an expansive remit with discussions extending well beyond security issues. Loading... The leaders agreed to step up maritime cooperation, including plans to conduct joint coast guard operations in the Pacific for the first time next year. \"It's about identifying what's going on in the maritime areas in these states,\" Mr Albanese said, noting illegal fishing and other outlawed activities are taking place. \"It's very important they're able to monitor it and this will assist.\" Co-operation on health was also elevated, with the establishment of the Quad Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Under the initiative, Australia will expand its immunisation program for human papillomavirus (HPV) to prevent cervical cancer in more countries. The supply of the vaccine will be extended from Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu to include Malaysia, Timor-Leste, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Fiji and Nauru. In announcing the initiative, Mr Albanese drew a parallel to America's efforts to put man on the Moon in the 1960s. \"Not because it was easy, but because it was hard. That's the spirit of this endeavour,\" he said. \"All of us know that curing cancer, defeating it once and for all, will be hard. \"But not as hard as the lonely, exhausting, physical and emotional ordeal of diagnosis and treatment.\"","summary":"The leaders of Australia, the United States, India and Japan meet in Delaware, announcing plans for joint coast guard operations in the Pacific and an expanded vaccination program. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-22/quad-alliance-to-stay-beyond-november-us-election/104381376","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7a3e6af51c3b6f7e5c9f04d431c09ea2?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1383&cropW=2458&xPos=348&yPos=90&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:22:17","author":"Melissa Clarke","authors":["Melissa Clarke"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.163},{"id":256947316,"title":"Kishida, Biden hail stronger Japan-U.S. ties in farewell meeting","text":"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday celebrated a stronger-than-ever alliance between Tokyo and Washington in what was seen as a farewell meeting between the two outgoing leaders. Biden, who U.S. officials say feels very close to Kishida, hosted him at his private residence in Wilmington, the president's hometown in Delaware, and praised the Japanese premier for being a \"visionary and courageous\" leader over the past three years. Biden noted Kishida's leadership has made it possible for Japan to fundamentally strengthen its defense capabilities and transform its role in world affairs, the White House said. \"The two leaders committed to sustain efforts to take the U.S.-Japan alliance to new heights and to continue standing side-by-side together as steadfast global partners,\" it said. Kishida and Biden, who both took office in 2021, each decided this summer not to seek reelection amid slumping public support in their respective countries. During the meeting, which took place hours before a four-way summit of the Quad grouping also involving the leaders of Australia and India, Kishida and Biden reviewed some of their joint accomplishments and candidly discussed common challenges facing Japan and the United States, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In addition to confirming the importance of passing the robust alliance to future leaders, they discussed major foreign policy issues, including China's \"coercive and destabilizing activities\" in the South China Sea and other parts of the world, according to the White House and the ministry. They said the leaders also reaffirmed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are essential and underscored their opposition to any attempts to change the status quo by force. Kishida agreed with Biden to continue supporting Ukraine and applying tough sanctions to Russia, as well as to deal with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats closely together and trilaterally with South Korea, according to the ministry. Kishida announced in August he will not run in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election, set to take place on Friday. Biden, who ended his bid for another four years in the White House in July, has repeatedly praised Kishida for significantly increasing Japan's defense spending amid the severe security environment in Asia. Despite the enduring conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, the United States continues to view China as its most consequential geopolitical challenge and the Indo-Pacific as a region of central importance for Washington's strategic interests. Under such circumstances, Japan is increasingly seen as an indispensable ally not only by the Biden administration, but also by a large majority of Democrats and Republicans. Nonetheless, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have opposed plans by Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. to acquire United States Steel Corp., siding with a powerful labor union based in a critical battleground state that could determine the U.S. presidential election in November. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee running against the Democrat Harris for the White House, is also against the Japanese leading steelmaker's proposed acquisition of the smaller U.S. producer, making the issue a delicate one between the two countries. Kishida stressed that Japan has contributed to the U.S. economy as the largest investor, while voicing hope to further strengthen bilateral cooperation, according to the ministry. But it remains unclear if either of them touched on the buyout plan during the meeting that lasted about an hour. On many occasions, Biden has hailed Kishida's strong commitment to support Ukraine and consistent efforts to warn that \"Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,\" which has drawn global attention to the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden invited Kishida to Washington as a state guest in April, during which he said the alliance has been transformed into a \"truly global partnership\" during their tenures and announced a long list of agreements with the prime minister. The agreements, focused on boosting the alliance's deterrence and facilitating its networking with like-minded partners, included working toward more integrated command and control structures between Japanese and U.S. forces.

That evening, during a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, Trump was asked whether he believed his own U.S. intelligence agencies, who had definitively concluded that Russia interfered in the elections. His response? “I don’t see any reason why it would be [Russia],” he said, while Putin, a former KGB agent, standing just feet away, denied the allegations. It was a shocking moment: The ‘leader of the free world’ appeared to side with the leader of a foreign power accused of meddling in American democracy over the consensus of his intelligence community. The backlash was as immediate as it was fierce. Politicians from both parties, intelligence officials and the media were stunned by what many called a betrayal. Yet, this moment was not just about one comment. It only expressed Mr Trump’s complicated relationship with the U.S. intelligence agencies—which often saw him questioning their findings and, in some cases, publicly contradicting them. Given the attitude with which he’d received all news of the Russian interference in the election that brought him to office, his response should not have surprised him. Yet, it was. Because somewhere in their psyche, citizens believed that the America-first apostle would practice what he preaches by siding with his country’s intel, at least in the open. In a tweet, Trump would later try to retract his statement the next day. He claimed he’d misspoken and meant to say, “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia.” But the damage was done. Though loosely, President Bola Tinubu sounded like Trump when he blamed the Borno floods on climate change and termed it a “natural disaster.” Some back story. When the President visited Borno State last Monday to assess the damage wrought by the floods, it was like putting some action behind his “deep concern” expressed in a statement barely one week earlier. The previous week, his deputy, Kashim Shettima, also visited Maiduguri and sank his feet in the floodwaters to get a feel for it. After that pseudo baptism, Shettima emerged from the water with an epiphany: the people needed rice, lots of rice, to mitigate the flood. Thanks to him, many other people and organisations have dumped tons of rice in Borno. A disaster relief fund sounded like the most sustainable solution for the President. Tinubu urged the private sector to contribute to the fund, saying, “There must be a disaster relief fund. I will invite the private sector to team up with us and help rebuild the affected areas.” However, the President did not stop there. Like Trump exonerating Putin, he acquitted every official whose reported negligence led to the Borno tragedy when he said, “This disaster was a natural one. It was not the making of anybody. We cannot pass the blame. We pray that the Almighty Allah will receive the souls of the departed and grant them eternal rest.” Wow! Just wow! To be clear, the official narrative provided by the National Emergency Management Agency was that floodwaters engulfed Maiduguri when the Alau Dam, a critical infrastructure designed to regulate water flow and provide irrigation and drinking water, overflowed after heavy downpours. However, multiple reports have revealed a stream of negligence on the part of the Borno State Government and mismanagement of funds by officials of concerned ministries. For instance, a HumAngle report dated September 14, 2024, revealed that despite at least N309m disbursed to rehabilitate the deteriorating Alau dam between 2018 and 2024, the infrastructure remained dented by erosion and huge cracks that eventually gave way. The Chad Basin River Development Authority had released the funds to different companies in 13 tranches. As rehabilitation foot-dragged, the government received multiple warnings from residents but insisted that Borno State was under no flood threat. Experts say research by the University of Maiduguri proved the sorry state of the dam, but there was no action from the government. It is unclear if the President got a situation report before departing Abuja for Borno State last Monday. It is safe to assume he did. And if the report was holistic enough, it must have reflected some of these fault lines. If it didn’t, we would have to raise questions about what the President actually reads and watches. Or, hear me out; maybe it did, but he settled for the “natural disaster” narrative instead. Maybe! The disaster here is not the heavy rains—Borno State gets its fair share of downpours annually—but a dam left to rot and overridden by nature. That is no natural disaster, and calling it that or blaming climate change removes the element of accountability. Before settling on the relief fund, the President said he had “been reflecting on how to tackle this kind of disaster and the effects of climate change.” I’d say think no further, Mr President. Dig for root causes. Begin with accountability. First, acknowledge the multiple reports of alleged negligence and mismanagement of funds meant to repair the Alau Dam. Then, direct an independent inquiry into the matter. You will find loopholes littered all over. When you find them, as you will, deal with them decisively. Tinubu shelves UNGA to face hunger So, the President shelved his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly this year. He delegated Vice President Kashim Shettima to lead Nigeria’s delegation this time. “President Tinubu, who returned to the country last Sunday after his trip to China and the United Kingdom, wants to focus on domestic issues and address some of the country’s challenges, especially after the recent devastating flooding,” the Presidency explained in a statement signed by Tinubu’s Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, Mr Bayo Onanuga. A netizen using the X handle @EmmanuelNdiokw4 said, “This is a most reasonable decision showing the President he’s not insensitive to the expectations of Nigerians at this moment in time. It would have been unfortunate if the president were to embark on another foreign tour so soon after his absence from the seat of power for three weeks.” Having recently toured France, China and the UK, it only makes sense to remain at home and focus on domestic matters. The VP is capable of delivering Nigeria’s address at the meeting. However, Shettima must not treat this opportunity as a yearly poem where leaders only recite and go. Being arguably the first VP to lead Nigeria’s delegation to UNGA in over 25 years, he should direct attention to the real issues Nigeria faces, including strategic matters such as Nigeria’s permanent place on the UN Security Council. We wish him well.","summary":"On July 16, 2018, the US intelligence community watched in shock as then-President Donald Trump contradicted mountains of painstakingly sourced evidence of Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.

The other shadow hanging over the summit was November's US presidential election, with the isolationist former president Donald Trump in a tight race against Biden's political heir Kamala Harris. Biden insisted that the group would survive whatever the political situation. \"While challenges will come, the world will change because the Quad is here to stay,\" Biden told the leaders in his public remarks before journalists were ushered out. Asked by reporters if the Quad would make it past the Nov 5 election, Biden replied: \"Way beyond November. Way beyond November.\" \"HERE TO STAY\" India's Modi made a similar pledge - in a commitment that will be welcomed by Washington, Canberra and Tokyo as they court the historically non-aligned New Delhi. \"Our message is, the Quad is here to stay,\" said Modi, who is due to host next year's Quad summit in India. Biden, who bowed out of the US presidential election in July after concerns about his age, filled his farewell summit with personal touches. The four-way summit took place at his former high school in Wilmington and he earlier opened up his home in the city for private, one-on-one talks with each of the leaders. \"I am really pleased that you were able to be in my home and see where I grew up,\" he said. The leaders also announced investment into fighting cervical cancer for Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative - again a deeply person project as his eldest son Beau died of brain cancer. The media were given no access to the private meetings at Biden's home. Biden posted pictures on social media of him with Albanese and then with Kishida in a wood-paneled drawing room in his house, and showing them the view of a lake from a veranda. The White House said the summit reflected the way Biden prioritized international alliances.

Tim Walz claimed that former President Ronald Reagan was the “last union member” to appear on a “national ticket.” VERDICT: False. Former President Donald Trump was a member of the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union. During a campaign rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, Walz spoke about how “the thing that built the middle class” had been the ability to allow people to “collectively bargain and form a union” with their neighbors. Walz added that he had been a union member of Minnesota’s teacher’s union. “I’ve been told….I’ve been told that I am…..For decades, a card-carrying union member of our state’s teacher union, which I was,” Walz told the crowd. “The last union member on a national ticket — Ronald Reagan. I promise you, I will not lose my way. I will not lose my way.” Walz has previously made a similar claim. In August, Walz claimed he was “the first union member” to appear on a presidential ticket since Reagan. “I happen to be the first union member on a presidential ticket since Ronald Reagan,” Walz said at the time. “But, rest assured, I won’t lose my way.” This claim was fact-checked by ABC News, which found that Trump had been a member of SAG-AFTRA until he resigned from the union. While Reagan served as the president of SAG-AFTRA for “seven terms,” Trump was a member of the SAG-AFTRA union for more than 30 years before he resigned in February 2021. Trump’s resignation from the union came after SAG-AFTRA said it found “probable cause” that Trump had “violated the union’s Constitution,” and threatened to expel Trump from the union in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCLAIM: Democrat Minnesota Gov.

In an interview with The Guardian, which was published on Saturday, the reporter asked the pop star “where she stands on the forthcoming election,” with America “on the verge of voting in its first female Black president,” the author wrote. “Well, you know what they supposedly said?” she asked the reporter. “She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian.” It appeared that she was not aware that Harris is both Black and Indian, which the reporter explained to Jackson. “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days,” Jackson responded. “I was told that they discovered her father was white.” That is, of course, false. Harris’ father, Donald J. Harris, was born in Browns Town, Jamaica and grew up in Jamaica. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was born in Chennai, India, and died in 2009. Harris’ parents divorced in 1971. As The Guardian points out, those who question Harris’ heritage “tend to be hardcore QAnon-adjacent, Trump-loving conspiracy theorists,” which the reporter concluded that Jackson was likely neither. And while it’s unclear who the specific “they” is who falsely claimed Harris is not Black and that her father is white according to Jackson, the reporter pondered where Jackson might be gathering this misinformation. Back in July, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed he didn’t know Harris is Black. “I’ve known her a long time indirectly,” Trump said during an appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He added: “She made a turn, and she became a Black person, and I think somebody should look into that,” appearing to imply she “became a Black person” for political gain. The Guardian also asked Jackson if she believed America was ready for Harris. “Honestly, I don’t want to answer that because I really, truthfully, don’t know. I think either way it goes is going to be mayhem,” Jackson said.","summary":"In an interview with The Guardian, pop star appears to parrot misinformation Trump and others have spread","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/janet-jackson-kamala-harris-black-election-mayhem-1235108774/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JanetJackson-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:07:20","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":256947752,"title":"US presidential candidate Donald Trump conceded that another debate would have 'good entertainment value'","text":"US presidential candidate Donald Trump conceded that another debate would have 'good entertainment value' | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

When it came to achieving Rufo’s wins in fighting critical race theory, gender ideology, and diversity, inclusion, and equity, he said he focuses on three elements. “There’s fact, emotion, and power,” said Rufo in a Saturday speech at the Canada Strong and Free Network Regional Conference in Red Deer, AB. .Rufo said what motivates politicians to act is a sense of urgency often emanating from media rooted in facts. To get politicians to act, he said he has generated media narratives. By doing his investigations, he said he has been able to work news cycles. There is an adage in local television newsrooms that if it bleeds, it leads. He said the magic from his campaigns come from “exclusive, very powerful, and very persuasive information that was gathered, packaged, and deployed into the field, into the discourse, on social media and traditional media.” He did a series of investigations about CRT where he looked at school curriculums and trainings provided to him by sources showing outrageous educational choices. When he took out former Harvard University president Claudine Gay for plagiarism, he said he did that by having a copy of her PhD dissertation showing she had copied large parts. Since this information was factual, he said he knew it was going to pop and create discourse in the media. He quoted Greek philosopher Aristotle, who said people need to gather all of the facts. If people master all of the facts, they have a rhetorical advantage. The activist went on to say emotion is the domain of storytelling. Additionally, he said it allows people to be persuasive. One example he offered showing emotion works is when he spoke from the heart on Fox News about his investigations into CRT in American government departments in 2020. He made the case it was an urgent threat. Once he had argued CRT was harmful, he cited evidence showing what was going on in the American government. At the end, he called on former US president Donald Trump to issue an executive order banning it in the American government. The next morning, he received a phone call from former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Meadows said Trump saw him on television the night before, had been persuaded, and instructed him to get an executive order together. In response, he was invited out to Washington, DC, to help with the executive order. He said he learned a clear, concise statement grabs people’s attention and can motivate them to make change. Rufo continued by saying politicians using their power to take action stems from the outrage cycle. If people do not have outrage, he said they are not winning in politics. While outrage can be useful, he said it has to be directed towards a positive outcome. That is where people can bring the wonks in. To get politicians to take action on issues, he acknowledged people have to be put them high on the hierarchy of urgency. He said this is where the wonks come in to offer drafted bills, provide the legislated language, give rhetorical key points, offer supporting evidence, and do some original reporting on why changes need to be made. By using this approach, he said he has been able to make changes in multiple states. He added this part is the upper crust, but it requires bottom-up momentum. Rufo concluded by saying rhetoric is a lost art. He said it used to be a fundamental part of education. “If you look at the letters from the Founding Fathers of the United States in the late 18th century, when they talk about a good education, a lot of what they’re talking about is an education in rhetoric as the language of politics,” he said. “We’ve reduced it to a kind of scientific language, and it indicates kind of poverty of spirit in how we think about politics, how we train political figures.” .Rufo followed up by saying he loved the video of Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre eating the apple and taking out a reporter. “This guy’s fantastic,” he said. “I love that guy.” With Poilievre, he said he has adopted a savvy rhetorical model. As far as Poilievre's presentation, he said he “comes across as an affable, average, jolly, kind of generous suburban dad.” Rufo said in 2022 Cambridge Dictionary added another definition for the word woman to include transgender people. .WHAT IS A WOMAN?: Cambridge Dictionary changes definition for woman.“Cambridge Dictionary just dropped a new definition of ‘woman,’” he said. The new definition Cambridge Dictionary added for woman is an adult living and identifying as female who might have been a different sex at birth..This is what the Western Standard is up againstThe Trudeau government is funding lies and propaganda by directly subsidizing the mainstream media.

Jackson, 58, made the shocking assertion in an interview with The Guardian, when asked on her feelings about the United States having its first female black president. ‘Well, you know what they supposedly said?’ the singer answered. ‘She’s not black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian.’ ‘Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.’ Harris, 59, was born in 1964 to Dr Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian-born cancer researcher, and Donald J. Harris, a black Jamaican economics professor. The couple wed in 1963 and separated in 1971, after welcoming Kamala and her younger sister Maya, 57. Gopalan died of cancer in 2009 aged 70, while Donald Harris, 86, is now a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University after retiring in 1998. Jackson’s late brother Michael faced controversy about his skin after it changed color from black to white over the course of his career. He blamed a medical condition called vitiligo and denied bleaching his skin. And the Nasty singer’s false claim about Harris being half-white has been compared to one of Donald Trump’s most notorious claims during the presidential campaign. Trump claimed Harris ‘happened to turn black’ while addressing a the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention in Chicago in July. He said: ‘She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. ‘I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. ‘So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black? ‘I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a black person. I think somebody should look into that too.’ Harris shrugged off the remarks days later accusing Trump of ‘the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect.’ She added: ‘The American people deserve better.’ The vice president has yet to comment on Jackson’s remarks about her race. Trump’s comments on Harris race outraged many conservatives, with even his own supporters said to be annoyed at the former president for not focusing on attacks on Harris’ policies. Earlier this month, Trump appeared to double down on his comments about Harris’ race. ‘I don’t care what she is. I don’t care. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.’ Polls show that the race between Trump and Harris remains on a knife edge ahead of election day on Tuesday November 5.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJanet Jackson has claimed that Kamala Harris is not black &#8211; and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson shockingly reveals something about Kamala Harris that echoes one of Trump&#8217;s infamous remarks about the VP first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/janet-jackson-shockingly-reveals-something-about-kamala-harris-that-echoes-one-of-trumps-infamous-remarks-about-the-vp/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Janet-Jackson-makes-jaw-dropping-claim-about-Kamala.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:01:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":256947618,"title":"Watch: President Biden places hand on PM Modi's shoulder as he answers question on Quad survival","text":"Placing his hand on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shoulder, President Joe Biden reaffirmed to the Quad members that the alliance would endure 'way beyond November', addressing concerns about its future after the US elections.The 2024 US Presidential Election is set for November 5, 2024.

Archdiocese spokesperson Joseph Zwillng told The Post they learned that Harris would not be there on Saturday. “We are disappointed that she will not be with us, as this is an evening of unity and putting aside political differences in support of a good cause of helping women and children in need regardless of race, creed, or background. “We hope she reconsiders,” he added. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign has since reached out to the Archdiocese and confirmed he will be in attendance, according to Zwilling.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is skipping this year’s Archdiocese of New York’s annual Al Smith Dinner — a major annual fundraiser for local Catholic charities — becoming the first presidential hopeful to duck out since failed Vice Presidential candidate Walter Mondale in 1984.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/21/us-news/kamala-harris-to-skip-traditional-al-smith-dinner-first-time-presidential-candidate-has-ducked-charity-event-since-1984/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-hsro51fz7-1726961967416.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1726947620&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bv9uH4we-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:49:14","author":"Patrick Reilly","authors":["Patrick Reilly"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":256946156,"title":"Biden hosts his final Quad summit at his Delaware home, high school","text":"President Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown of Wilmington to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure. When Mr. Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. “It will survive way beyond November,” Mr. Biden declared as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater in nearby Claymont for joint talks. Biden hosts leaders at his Wilmington home and high school alma mater The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. “I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,” Mr. Biden joked to fellow leaders. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. “This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,” said Kishida, who like Mr. Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. Kishida, according to the prime minister’s office, thanked Biden at the outset of their meeting for inviting him to meet at his home. White House officials said holding the talks at the president’s house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the vibe of Mr. Biden’s one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as “two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.” He said Mr. Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him “insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.” Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Mr. Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. “There cannot be a better place than President Biden’s hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,” Modi said. Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Mr. Biden’s individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits. What Biden hopes to accomplish with the summit As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Mr. Biden and Modi had been expected to discuss Modi’s recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said “that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.” The gathering was also an opportunity for Mr. Biden and Japan’s Kishida to bid each other farewell. Mr. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Mr. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China’s “coercive and destabilizing activities” in the Pacific, Russia’s war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. Tension surrounds Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Mr. Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two candidates in the 2024 presidential election, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Mr. Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will roll out a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths.

The official added that Harris would welcome the opportunity to attend as president if she is elected in November. The decision was first reported by CNN. Donald Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about whether he would attend the dinner. His 2016 appearance at the dinner invited boos when many in the audience felt he crossed a line when he called Democrat Hillary Clinton corrupt and claimed she hated Catholics.This year's white-tie gala is scheduled for Oct. 17.Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who plays a prominent role in the dinner, has been highly critical of Democrats, writing a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed that carried the headline, \"The Democrats Abandon Catholics.\"The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner is named for the former New York governor, a Democrat and the first Roman Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party in 1928. He was handily defeated by Herbert Hoover. It raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally shown that those vying to lead the nation can get along, or pretend to, for one night.The event has become a tradition for presidential candidates since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960. In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because Clinton vetoed a late-term abortion ban.Trump and then Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who is Catholic, both spoke at the fundraiser in 2020, when it was moved online due to concerns about large gatherings spreading COVID-19. Amid the pandemic and economic woes, there was no joking and both candidates instead used their speeches to appeal to Catholic voters.Mr. Biden, who is Catholic, has not attended since he took office. In 2016, Trump began innocently enough. He joked that then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer used to love Trump when he was a Democrat. He poked fun at plagiarism involving the Clintons. But Trump's remarks soon devolved into bitterness and insults.","summary":"Presidential candidates from both parties have traditionally appeared on the same night at the dinner benefitting Catholic Charities​.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-skip-al-smith-dinner-president-campaign/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/13/b04c2e3b-07cf-43cc-b6c1-427ec2bb429d/thumbnail/1200x630/8bf0537de9e8c84c7ba3a9e2f4a2c131/gettyimages-2170853423.jpg?v=159d4576ec63c034c87559bf5085176a","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3207447_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:35:00","author":"Herbert Hoover.

The former first lady – who once bashed the festive season while in the White House -unveiled her new ornament collection, ‘Merry Christmas, AMERICA!’, on social media Saturday. ‘Each unique piece captures the magic of the holiday season. Let these ornaments inspire cherished memories & bring warmth to your entire family,’ her announcement on X read. The ornaments, which are named ‘USA Star,’ ‘Vote Liberty,’ ‘Let It Snow,’ and ‘Love & Freedom,’ range from $75 to $90. The businesswoman and entrepreneur’s foray into Christmas decor has stirred backlash on the internet. In 2018, Melania was recorded expressing her frustration about getting the White House into the festive spirit, saying, ‘You know, who gives a f— about Christmas stuff and decoration?’ When former president Donald Trump, was in office, Melania decorated the White House with Balsam fir trees that dripped with icicles, which social media users found eerie and cold. In 2018, she decorated the East Colonnade with 40 bold blood-red trees and draped 14,000 red ornaments throughout the White House. Although her office stated that the red symbolized ‘valor and bravery,’ the decor quickly earned the nickname ‘murder trees,’ leading to a wave of memes, public backlash, and accusations of being ‘un-American.’ One X user wrote: ‘We all know what you REALLY think about Christmas,’ referring to her leaked comments about Christmas decor in 2018. ‘The first family of grifting their own supporters,’ said another. ‘You are always trying to sell something. Damn girl. Trump has you out here on the track to pay his legal bills,’ Nurses for a Better Missouri posted on X. Others stood up for the former first lady. Kellyanne Conway, for example, said she missed Melania Trump running the Christmas events in the White House compared to how Jill Biden was decorating. “It was very tastefully done,’ she said. Melania’s self-promotion of her ornaments comes after the former first lady referenced her controversial redesign of the White House Rose Garden in a recent post promoting her upcoming book, omitting any mention of the public backlash it received. On Friday, she shared details about the redesign on her X account as part of a series of unusual snippets leading up to her book release. Earlier posts included defenses of her early nude modeling photos, featuring images of Michelangelo’s David. This time, she highlighted the dramatic 2020 overhaul she led for the garden as part of a multi-day marketing effort amid her husband’s campaign to regain the White House. Presidential historian and author Michael Beschloss was among the critics who publicly condemned the project, which involved removing mature dogwoods and replacing them with new flowers and shrubbery arranged in a rigid pattern. A year after the redesign was revealed, Beschloss criticized the concept, stating, ‘The evisceration of the White House Rose Garden was completed a year ago this month, and here was the grim result—decades of American history erased.’ In a rare move, the former first lady responded online. She pointed out that the photo Beschloss shared in his tweet showed the garden in its early stages. She followed up with a more recent image of the Rose Garden, now in full bloom with thriving pink and white flowers. “@BeschlossDC has proven his ignorance by showing a picture of the Rose Garden in its infancy. The Rose Garden is now adorned with a healthy and colorful blossoming of roses,” her office tweeted.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMelania Trump has come under fire after revealing her surprising new business venture&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Melania Trump faces backlash for unexpected business move with conflicting priorities: &#8216;Your true feelings about Christmas are apparent&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/melania-trump-faces-backlash-for-unexpected-business-move-with-conflicting-priorities-your-true-feelings-about-christmas-are-apparent/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Melania-Trump-is-ridiculed-after-revealing-surprising.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:30:22","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.314},{"id":256946036,"title":"Indo-Pacific Leaders Strengthen Maritime Security Cooperation at Biden’s Final Summit","text":"Leaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States will announce plans for new security initiatives in the Indian Ocean on Saturday, while outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden is hosting counterparts from the Quad grouping established out of shared concerns about China. Biden welcomed Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a four-way meeting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, to stress the importance of maintaining the Quad, which he sees as a signature foreign policy achievement, before he leaves office in January. Senior Biden administration officials told reporters ahead of the meeting that the leaders would announce plans to expand an Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, launched two years ago to include the Indian Ocean region. The leaders will announce a plan for joint coast guard operations that will see Australian, Japanese and Indian personnel spend time on a U.S. Coast Guard vessel. The countries will also announce plans for increased military logistics cooperation, the officials said before the meeting. They said the leaders would step up work to provide critical and security technologies, including a new open radio access network, to the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia, regions of intense competition with China, Washington’s main strategic competitor. A health initiative will highlight cooperation in combating cervical cancer, the officials said. Analysts said the expected outcomes would mostly build on work that has already been done within the Quad, which Biden elevated to summit level in 2021. Saturday’s meeting will be Quad’s sixth leader meeting. Journalists were granted access to initial remarks from the leaders before a meeting on Saturday. However, after journalists were asked to leave, officials were briefly caught on hot mics discussing China during what was intended to be a private meeting. “Our first topic of discussion is China,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken after reporters were escorted out. Moments later, Biden said, “We believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China diplomatic relationships. And he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest.” “China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region. It is true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Strait,” Biden continued. “It’s true across the scope of our relationship, including on economic and technology issues. At the same time, we believe intense competition requires intense diplomacy.” The president also pointed to his phone call with China’s President Xi Jinping earlier this year, as well as national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s trip to China this summer, adding that “we see this engagement as important for conflict prevention and crisis management amidst our strategic competition.” The hot mic comments about China came after Sullivan was asked earlier on Saturday about whether the four leaders will focus on China. “The Quad isn’t really about any other country. It’s not directed at another country,” Sullivan told reporters. “It’s directed at problem-solving, standing up for a set of common principles and a common vision for the region.” “So I don’t think you should expect to see focus on any particular country, including the PRC in the Quad leader statement,” he continued, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. Analysts said new maritime security initiatives at a time when China is stepping up pressure on its territorial rivals in the South and East China Seas would send a message to Beijing. They said it would also represent a further shift of emphasis of the Quad’s activities to security issues, reflecting growing concerns about China’s intentions. Lisa Curtis, an Asia policy expert at the Center for a New American Security who previously worked at the White House, CIA and State Department, said India, which is not part of any military alliance, has been worried about perceptions that the Quad could be militarizing the Indo-Pacific. “But I think China’s recent maritime aggression could be changing the equation for India and could be prompting India to become a bit more open to the idea of Quad security cooperation,” she said. Analysts and officials say Biden hosting the Quad is part of efforts to institutionalize the body ahead of his departure from office, as well as that of Kishida, who is stepping down after a leadership contest next week, and elections in Australia by next year. “We’re expecting this Quad summit … to demonstrate the Quad partners are more strategically aligned than they have ever been, that they remain committed to putting real resources behind this effort to provide public goods for the Indo-Pacific, and most importantly, that the Quad is here to stay,” a senior U.S. official said. The official noted that the Quad met at foreign minister level under the previous administration of Donald Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris in November, and enjoyed bipartisan support, as reflected by the formation of a congressional Quad Caucus ahead of the summit. Albanese told reporters on Thursday that Canberra and Washington share concerns about China’s security ambitions in Pacific islands countries where Beijing is seeking a growing policing role. “We’ll be discussing ways in which we can provide further support in the region to developing nations, including the action that we’re taking together on climate change and supporting their energy security,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States will announce plans&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Indo-Pacific Leaders Strengthen Maritime Security Cooperation at Biden&#8217;s Final Summit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/indo-pacific-leaders-strengthen-maritime-security-cooperation-at-bidens-final-summit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Indo-Pacific-leaders-expand-maritime-security-cooperation-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:15:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":256945342,"title":"Vance: Trump tickets picks up ‘100,000 votes’ with every time Harris bombs an interview","text":"Kamala Harris is serving up so much “word salad” during her rare media interviews according to Republican veep candidate J.D. Vance, that the Trump campaign is openly rooting for her to do more. “Every time she does [an interview], I think we pick up 100,000 votes,” quipped during a rally on Saturday in Leesport, Pa., when asked about Harris avoiding media interviews. Harris’ latest public-speaking debacle came Thursday during a star-studded virtual rally hosted by Oprah Winfrey. She ended with a two-minute monologue that confused many people listening — including Winfrey, according to online commentators who said the powerful media mogul looked “lost” and “unimpressed.” “We love our country. I love our country. I know we all do, that’s why everybody’s here right now. We love our country. We– we take pride in the privilege of being American and this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans, understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us,” Harris said with pauses and smiles. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump also fired shots at Harris’ bizarre remarks at the celebrity rally while addressing 10,000 of his supporters on Saturday in Wilmington, N.C. “Kamala was a total disaster yesterday, and at every other interview it’s been a freefall …. She just can’t do an interview,” he said. During a softball interview with an ABC affiliate last week – her first solo media sit-down since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee — Harris also appeared to dodge questions and said little of substance. Harris went off on a series of cringe-worthy rants with anchor Brian Taff of Philadelphia-based Action News 6, including after Taff’s initial question on how she’d bring prices down in the U.S. “Well, I’ll start with this: I grew up as a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard,” said Harris, before moving on to greener pastures — but not the economy. “I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn. You know? And, um, and I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity,” the vice president added. She never said how she’d tackle inflation, but instead highlighted her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and provide tax breaks to new small businesses.","summary":"Kamala Harris is serving up so much “word salad” during her rare media interviews according to Republican veep candidate J.D.

The annual diplomatic pilgrimage is bringing more than 140 world leaders to New York City, including the heads of Israel, Palestine and Ukraine. Keeping them safe is the US Secret Service’s next big challenge. The agency, under a cloud after a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, is confident in its multi-layer, multi-agency plan to protect the UN General Assembly, which is deemed a Super Bowl-level National Special Security Event. The plan — developed with New York City police and the UN Security and Safety Service, among other agencies — includes not just motorcades and protective details, but NYPD helicopters and patrol boats, a dozen UN security K-9 teams sweeping for explosives, road closures and traffic diversions. The Secret Service is bringing in agents from posts around the world for the event. The Coast Guard is restricting East River access near the UN and the Federal Aviation Administration is closing airspace. With so many presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and others dignitaries in one city and under one roof at the same time, the UN General Assembly is actually bigger than the Super Bowl. It's the most complex event the Secret Service is involved in each year. This year, it's coming during a especially busy stretch highlighted by the Republican and Democratic conventions and the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Speaking Monday after the Secret Service thwarted another apparent assassination attempt on Trump in Florida, Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. said employees were “redlining\" like an engine pushed to its limit. But, he said, “they are rising to this moment” and meeting the challenges. “The operational tempo is incredibly high,” said Patrick Freaney, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office. The Associated Press got a rare look inside security preparations for the UN General Assembly, including the “Brain Center” and a joint operations center that lets the Secret Service, NYPD and other agencies communicate instantly to root out threats and logistical snags. They're also coordinating with the foreign security services that protect each of the dignitaries. Freaney said the National Special Security Event designation — for special events of national significance — smooths the way for interagency planning, communication and cooperation. The Secret Service is in charge, but the NYPD’s robust counterterrorism and other operations, and the UN’s 300-person Security and Safety Service, play pivotal roles. “We have over 140 heads of state, heads of government that we’re moving around the city,” Freaney said during a tour of the joint operations center, which has space for 10 local and federal agencies, including the FBI and Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State and Defense departments. “One of the most important things is bringing all of them in here and then departing safely,\" Freaney said. \"Think about that logistically — bringing 140 motorcades into one area all at the same time. This plays an integral part of bringing those details in safely.” The Secret Service, NYPD and State Department will also be operating their own command centers — in Brooklyn, at One Police Plaza in Manhattan and at a nearby hotel ballroom. The NYPD, the nation’s largest police force, has its Joint Operations Center equipped to give officers real-time feeds from security, drone and helicopter-mounted cameras, along with other critical information. The UN Security and Safety Service, which is in charge of keeping the UN headquarters campus secure, has its command post in the “Brain Center.” Down a basement hall from the main hub of UN activity, wall-to-wall monitors show live feeds from dozens of the 1,400 security cameras on the 18-acre (7.2-hectare) headquarters campus. All are recorded and can be reviewed instantly. Automated voices alert potential breaches and emergencies. Computers generate real-time data and photos for each of upwards of 22,000 people who pass through security checkpoints per day. Fire alarms tie directly into the city’s central dispatch system for immediate response. The command post is staffed around the clock by UN security officers who work in 12-hour shifts while world leaders are in town. The goal, Inspector Malinda McCormack said, is to receive, analyze and quickly disseminate information. Security plans for General Assembly started to take shape a few months ago. The Secret Service and its partner agencies use past gatherings — this is the 79th edition — as a blueprint, while making adjustments for changing world events such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. “There’s an incredible trust,” said Michael Browne, chief of the UN Security and Safety Service. “There’s incredible sense of collegiality and collaboration, which I think is a key ingredient for success in a very complex and challenging operation such as UNGA.” As of Friday, authorities said, there were no specific or credible threats to the event. But, Rebecca Weiner, the NYPD’s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, acknowledged “the chaoticness, the diversity and the unpredictable nature of the threat environment” requires law enforcement to be nimble and anticipate all the many ways someone could seek to cause harm. “These are very different times,” Weiner said. World leaders are meeting at the General Assembly for the first time since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered an Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of people. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said Friday that the department has tallied more than 4,000 protests over the war, with more anticipated next week. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are both expected at General Assembly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also expected to return, but not Russian President Vladimir Putin. While the fighting is an ocean away, authorities are “thinking about what’s happening overseas in these home countries and what we can anticipate here,” Weiner said. “The whole purpose of this assembly is bringing countries together,\" she added. “The whole purpose of our security posture is making sure we’re doing the same.”","summary":"Next week’s high-level meeting of the UN General Assembly is bringing more than 140 world leaders to New York City, including the heads of Israel, Palestine and Ukraine","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/secret-service-un-general-assembly-protection-b2616846.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/21/18/UN_General_Assembly_Security_28050.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:07:23","author":"Michael R.

Well, no.","text":"EAMON RYAN IS nervous going into this week’s United Nations General Assembly in New York. As Climate Minister, Ryan is there to represent Ireland alongside Michael D. Higgins, Simon Harris and Micheál Martin. From his perspective, the week is a precursor to COP29 (the UN’s climate change conference), which will be held in Azerbaijan this November. Ryan explained he is nervous that enough progress won’t be made this year, but he’s hopeful that last year’s efforts can be built on. “It’s not certain. It’s really contentious. The level of climate financing we need is so huge, and it’s such a divisive issue. And the world is in such a difficult situation at the moment,” Ryan said. It’s understood the minister will be appointed to a senior role at this year’s COP, playing a key role in negotiations. However, Ryan made the point that there is so much happening in the world at the moment that can derail climate progress, pointing to the political uncertainty ahead of the election in the US as one concern. When asked what another Donald Trump presidency would mean for climate, Ryan responded: “There are certain gold rules if you’re in government, we don’t comment on other elections. “There are plenty of people who can run the commentary on what a Donald Trump presidency will be. People can imagine what my views would be,” he added. What about our own election, does Ryan expect the Green Party to be back in government? “I really hope so,” Ryan said. He’s more certain when asked if he has confidence that his current coalition partners are up to the task of responding to the climate crisis without the Greens: “No, not without the Greens.” In particular, he fears progress made over the last four years in public transport would be reversed if either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael remain in government without the balance of the Green Party. “Not to be overly critical of my colleagues, but I think they themselves would recognise that with the Green Party element in government, you get much more ambitious action on climate. You get much more ambitious action on nature,” Ryan said, adding that he believes both parties would also reverse progress made with retrofitting and with nature restoration. After 13 years as leader of the Green Party, Ryan’s resignation in June of this year came as a surprise to many. The leadership contest that followed resulted in TD Roderic O’Gorman taking the reigns of the party, beating Senator Pippa Hackett with a slim 52% majority. Ryan told The Journal that he was “happy either way” with either candidate succeeding him and that he’s now happy to follow O’Gorman’s lead on coalition negotiations, after the election. On the timing of the election, he maintained the government will be going full term but added there “isn’t much of a difference at this stage” whether it is “November or February or March”. Health of the Green Party Last week, it was announced that well-known climate activist and former Green Party councillor Sadbh O’Neill, is to seek the Labour Party nomination to stand in the next general election in the Waterford constituency. If selected by Labour, O’Neill will be going head to head with Green Party TD Marc Ó Cathasaigh. When asked if O’Neill’s decision to move to the Labour Party reflects poorly on his party, Ryan said it doesn’t. “I wish Sadbh well, I’ve the highest regard for her,” Ryan said. “There wasn’t an opening in the Greens, because we have a sitting TD so that may have influenced her decision…I don’t think it really says much about the Green Party,” he added. Budget 2025 Ahead of the Budget, Ryan’s priority is getting an outline in place for how the Climate and Nature fund will be spent. The €3bn fund was established by Ryan as part of last year’s Budget to pay for climate action and nature restoration projects, but its contents cannot be spent until 2026. He’s hopeful that the fund will be used expand public transport services as well as help transform heating systems for homes, businesses and public buildings like schools and hospitals. “No one can paint the world as a pretty picture at the moment, but there are positive signs,” Ryan said. He pointed to the “phenomenal” change solar power has been for our energy system, and the fact we managed to get through the energy crisis that resulted from Russia’s war in Ukraine, as two examples of these positive signs. “It showed the ability to manage crises in a way. So it’s not all impossible. If you felt it was impossible, you would give up, but you can’t.” ——— This article is part of Policy Matters, a series from The Journal that takes a deep dive into the ideas and solutions proposed by Ireland’s politicians on some of the biggest issues of the day.

Martin Sheen and others from the cast of “The West Wing,” the hit drama about a liberal president and his staff, were invited by first lady Jill Biden for an event to mark the 25th anniversary of the show. Sheen exhorted the crowd to find something worth fighting for, “something deeply personal and uncompromising, something that can unite the will of the spirit with the work of the flesh.” His voice and hands rose, his cadence matching perfectly that of President Jed Bartlet, the character Sheen played for seven seasons. “When we find that, we will discover fire for the second time, and then we will be able to help lift up this nation and all its people to that place where the heart is without fear, and their head is held high,” Sheen said. “The West Wing” remains a favorite of many who now work in Washington, both liberal and conservative. Among those spotted in the Rose Garden were House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Joe Walsh, once a tea party-aligned Illinois congressman who is now a sharp critic of former President Donald Trump and supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. Asked to name his favorite character, Walsh replied, “I’m partial to Martin Sheen because I want to be president one day.” (Walsh ran and lost a longshot Republican primary challenge to Trump in 2020.) It was clear in the speeches and the party’s touches that at least a few “West Wing” fans work in the White House. There was the U.S. Marine Band playing the opening notes to the show’s theme as Biden and the cast walked out. There were references to “big blocks of cheese” — a show tradition of requiring staffers to meet with eccentric or offbeat characters — and the walk-and-talk dialogues in which characters moved through the halls at high speed. Waiters passed out bourbon-and-ginger ale cocktails called “The Jackal,” a reference to press secretary C.J. Cregg’s dance and lip sync routine in one iconic episode. The show’s creator, Aaron Sorkin, spoke after Sheen and referenced a bit of real-world politics: Biden’s decision not to seek a second term after his disastrous debate performance. Sorkin was among the high-profile Democrats who called for him to withdraw, writing a column for The New York Times with a potential “script” for Democrats to replace Biden as their nominee with a Republican, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. His column ran on July 21, hours before Biden announced he would drop out. “The fact is, ‘West Wing’ moments do happen,” he said Friday, addressing the first lady. “And Dr. Biden, we saw proof of that on the morning of July 21.” Sorkin also recognized the cast members in attendance. Among them: Richard Schiff, who played communications director Toby Ziegler; Janel Moloney, who played assistant Donna Moss; and Dulé Hill, who played the president’s bodyman, Charlie Young. He noted the absence of a few high-profile actors — Allison Janney, who played Cregg, as well as Bradley Whitford and Rob Lowe — who he said were on set elsewhere. “The rest of us are apparently unemployed,” he joked. After the crowd laughed, a voice chimed in from Sorkin’s right. “Not yet!” Jill Biden said.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — With President Joe Biden away from the White House, it was left Friday to another man with Oval Office experience to stand at the front of the Rose Garden and give a rousing call to service....","url":"https://nation.lk/online/the-west-wing-cast-visits-the-white-house-for-a-25th-anniversary-party-277863.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jill-biden-and-west-wing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:00:08","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.357},{"id":256944926,"title":"Cards Against Humanity game sues Musk's SpaceX for trespassing ","text":"Cards Against Humanity (CAH) is suing Elon Musk's SpaceX for $15 million after it allegedly left construction equipment and destroying property on CAH land in Texas.

In an email screenshotted and shared on X, CAH shared an update about the parcel of land, which was purchased in 2017 to protect from “racist billionaire Donald Trump’s very stupid wall,\" through a crowd-funding effort. \"We promised we’d use every legal tool at our disposal to protect this land from bullies like Trump and Musk (who's spending millions to get Trump elected and also wants to build the stupid wall)\" CAH wrote in a statement. \"If we don’t take action now, why would anyone ever trust us again?\" The card game company said that SpaceX, Musk’s space exploration company, offered to buy the land at half its value, to which they responded with the lawsuit.

CAH has historically supported the Democratic Party, donating upwards of $40,000 to Democratic candidates in the 2020 cycle. “SpaceX’s acts have caused damage to both relationships in a variety of ways, but, in particular, by creating the impression that there is some association between CAH and SpaceX.

S. President Donald Trump and pop icon Michael Jackson, is reportedly planning a takeover of Tranmere Rovers, similar to Ryan Reynolds ' at Wrexham. Reynolds, the Hollywood actor, along with co-chairman Rob McElhenney, have transformed the Red Dragons from a non-league team to a club with a global cult following. Now playing in the EFL's third tier for the first time in two decades, Wrexham's rise is undeniable. Inspired by the groundbreaking work done by the celebrity duo at the Racecourse Ground, Tacopina, a former New York prosecutor, is said to be considering a similar project with one of Wrexham's oldest rivals. Tranmere, located just over the border in north-west England, has always been overshadowed by neighbouring football giants Liverpool and Everton. However, Tacopina has reportedly been in discussions throughout this year about potentially orchestrating a dramatic takeover of the League Two side. According to The Athletic, his bid is now only awaiting regulatory approval from the English Football League (EFL). The Wirral-based club, Tranmere Rovers, is currently under the ownership of former Football Association chief executive Mark Palios and his wife Nicola. They've been at the helm since 2014, with interest from lawyer Tacopina first surfacing when he attended a Tranmere match in April. Tacopina, who has previously represented ex-MLB star Alex Rodriguez and musician A$AP Rocky, was part of Trump's legal team as recently as January. He's no stranger to football either, having been part of a consortium that purchased AS Roma in 2011, before selling it and buying Bologna in 2014. He later bought Venezia, helping the team climb two divisions up to the second tier of Italian football. After selling in 2020, he purchased SPAL the following year - a tenure marked by a three-month suspension due to missed tax payments. According to The Athletic, Tranmere Rovers have not commented on the potential takeover. It remains to be seen if and when a buyout at Prenton Park will occur, pending approval from the EFL. Should the deal go through, it's reported that Tacopina plans to leverage his celebrity status to draw more attention to Rovers as he aims to elevate their league standing. Furthermore, a new home for the historic club could be on the horizon in the next few years if the takeover gets the green light.","summary":"Joe Tacopina, a former lawyer to ex-U.S. President Donald Trump and pop superstar Michael Jackson, is reportedly eyeing a Ryan Reynolds-style takeover at Tranmere Rovers","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/donald-trump-wrexham-michael-jackson-33723194","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/article33723192.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-1486397709.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:00:00","author":"Tom Beattie","authors":["Tom Beattie"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.608},{"id":256945744,"title":"Trump rejects CNN debate against Harris, citing start of early voting","text":"Earlier in the day, Harris’s campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23. It would have been the candidates’ second debate, after a September 10 encounter that most pundits said she had won. “The American people deserve another opportunity to see Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots,” her campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. “I hope (Trump) will join me,” Harris posted on X. Trump claimed during a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina that he would like to debate — calling it “good entertainment value” — but the start of early voting in some states had taken the air out of the idea. “It’s just too late, voting has already started,” he said. He added, to a large and enthusiastic crowd of supporters, that while CNN had been “very fair” when he debated President Joe Biden in June, “they won’t be fair again.” Vice President Harris replaced her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket after the 81-year-old Biden’s disastrous performance against Trump. His exit from the race left Trump, 78, now the oldest ever presidential nominee, against a much younger Harris, 59. Voting underway Saturday’s announcement came as some states have already begun early voting in what is an agonizingly close race. The result is expected to hinge on seven battleground states, including North Carolina. Trump addressed the crowd in the port city of Wilmington from behind bulletproof glass, following an apparent second assassination attempt against him. A gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida last Sunday, with security agents foiling any plan to harm the former president. In July, Trump was struck on the ear by a bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop. The US Secret Service — tasked with protecting the candidate — on Friday admitted to “deficiencies” and “complacency” in the shocking security breach. Anti-immigrant rhetoric Trump won North Carolina in the 2020 election against Biden. But Harris is aiming to flip the southeastern state for Democrats, on the strength of her support from African Americans and young voters. Trump’s speech on Saturday reinforced the hardline anti-immigrant rhetoric that has become a centerpiece of his campaign, falsely claiming migrants were “attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest.” He also promised the crowd that the United States would “reach Mars before the end of my term.” The former president was facing a new challenge in North Carolina after a bombshell report on Thursday revealed that Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor whom Trump has endorsed, had called himself a “Black Nazi” and made other incendiary comments on a porn website message board more than a decade ago. Robinson has denounced the CNN report as “salacious tabloid lies.” The presidential race remains neck-and-neck and every vote will count in the election, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept if he loses. Trump faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.","summary":"Harris's campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/21/donald-trump-cnn-presidential-debate-kamala-harris-early-voting/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2172740128-e1726958746492.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:52:18","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":256944248,"title":"Harris Agrees To Second Debate, Trump Says It's 'Too Late'","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris agreed Saturday to debate former President Donald Trump again next month — but he told a crowd of supporters it was \"too late\" for a rematch.Both candidates \"received an invitation\" from CNN to face off Oct. 23 in the Atlanta studio where Trump debated President Joe Biden in June before Biden dropped his reelection bid, the network noted.Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said in a statement that the Democratic nominee was \"ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump,\" and that he \"should have no problem agreeing to this debate.\"Harris also said on social media that she \"will gladly accept a second presidential debate\" and added that she hoped Trump \"will join me.\"But Trump said during a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that he would turn down the invite.\"The problem with another debate is that it's just too late, voting has already started,\" he said, CNN reported.Since their Sept. 10 debate, Trump has waffled on the idea of facing Harris again, saying in a Sept. 12 post on his social media website, \"THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\" because, he insisted, he had won.The next day, he softened that position, telling reporters in California: \"I did great in the debates, and I think they've answered everything.

The coins display Trump’s face and an image of the White House with the words “In God We Trust.” Earlier this year, Trump launched golden Trump sneakers and Trump bibles. He has also been selling several batches of NFTs as well as physical Trump cards. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday that the coins are “The ONLY OFFICIAL coin designed by me—and proudly minted here in the USA.” The “Silver Medallion” coins will be available on Wednesday via a website set up specifically to hawk the merchandise. Trump also shared a video on Truth Social, saying “This beautiful, limited-edition coin commemorates our movement, our fight for freedom, prosperity, and putting America first, we always put America first.” “It’s more than just a collector’s item, it’s a testament to the resilience and strength of the American people, our American patriots that we love so much,” he said. A description on the site selling the coins states that they’re a “1oz .999% silver medallion.” The coins are “struck with a proof finish featuring our 45th President’s profile on the obverse and the White House on the reverse,” it adds. Trump launched God Bless the USA Bibles ahead of Easter alongside country musician Lee Greenwood, who sang the tune during the Republican National Convention this summer. Trump frequently uses the song as he enters his campaign events. “Happy Holy Week! Let’s Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless The USA Bible,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in March. In February, Trump launched a golden sneaker embossed with a large “T.” The “Never Surrender High-Tops” for “go-getters who don’t know the word quit” were made available for $399. Trump also released a book entitled Save America after he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. At $99, the book offers an “unparalleled look” into Trump’s first and so far only term in the White House. The book’s cover features the now iconic image of a bloodied Trump waving his fist in the air as he urged his supporters to “fight.” Another pair of sneakers, also featuring the image, are being sold for $299. The Trump Store, where Trump sells his merchandise, also features beach balls, flip-flops, bibles, mugs, dog collars, and golf ball markers. There are also t-shirts, mugs, and posters featuring his mug shot following his arrest in Georgia in the election-interference case.","summary":"‘This beautiful, limited-edition coin commemorates our movement, our fight for freedom, prosperity, and putting America first,’ the former president says","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-coins-commemorative-cost-b2616825.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/21/22/trumcoin.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jobnTLVd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:47:11","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.382},{"id":256945746,"title":"Wall Street pours cash into Harris campaign while Musk, crypto sector back Trump","text":"While polls show the race is extremely close, Harris pulled ahead in the money chase. She boosted her war chest in August after raising $361 million, while Trump spent $32 million more than the $130 million he raised as he launched a costly ad campaign to blunt her momentum. His allied super political action committee also depleted some of their cash reserves. Trump got support from new sources including donors from the crypto industry, whom he’s assiduously courted, and some longtime Republican donors who’ve only recently started supporting him, such as hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who didn’t contribute to his prior campaigns. The filings recorded the largest single reported gift from Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer. He gave $289,100, the maximum amount, to the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports GOP House candidates. Musk also created a super PAC this year to support Trump and House Republicans, which has been spending millions in recent weeks. It won’t disclose its donors until next month. The new support for Trump wasn’t enough to offset the costs of launching expensive ad campaigns. Harris and her main super PAC, Future Forward PAC, have booked $421 million in paid media from September through Election Day, nearly double the $216 million for Trump and his allied super PAC MAGA Inc.

Finance industry donors included Oaktree Capital Management LLC’s Bruce Karsh, Robert Stavis of Bessemer Venture Partners and I Squared Capital co-founder Sadek Wahba. Janice Savin Williams of Siebert Williams Shanke, legendary oil trader Andy Hall, Glenn Fuhrman, who managed money for Michael Dell, and E. John Rosenwald, a vice chair at JPMorgan Chase, also donated. Celebrities Scarlett Johansson, Carol Burnett, Frances McDormand, Mayim Bialik and Alan Alda were among the donors. Fashion brand founders Stacey Bendet, of Alice + Olivia, and LoveShackFancy’s Rebecca Hessel Cohen also gave. Bronson van Wyck, known for designing and planning Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman’s 70th birthday party, joined Florida chronicler Carl Hiaasen and Susan Fales-Hill, a writer and television producer, as Harris donors. Harris’ allied super PAC Future Forward got $3 million each from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the Pacific Environmental Coalition, a nonprofit led by technology venture capitalist Matt Cohler. Cohler’s nonprofit donated to Nikki Haley’s super PAC in the Republican primary. Reed Hastings of Netflix and Ripple Labs co-founder Christian Larsen each gave $1 million, the latter in the form of XRP cryptocurrency.

This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021.\"It will survive way beyond November,\" Mr. Biden declared as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater in nearby Claymont for joint talks.Biden hosts leaders at his Wilmington home and high school alma materThe president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner.\"I don't think the headmaster of this school thought I'd be presiding over a meeting like this,\" Mr. Biden joked to fellow leaders.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week.\"This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,\" said Kishida, who like Mr. Biden, is set to soon leave office.Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. Kishida, according to the prime minister's office, thanked Biden at the outset of their meeting for inviting him to meet at his home.White House officials said holding the talks at the president's house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the vibe of Mr. Biden's one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as \"two guys — one at the other guy's home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.\" He said Mr. Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers.The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him \"insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.\"Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Mr. Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere.\"There cannot be a better place than President Biden's hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,\" Modi said.Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Mr. Biden's individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits.What Biden hopes to accomplish with the summitAs part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China.Mr. Biden and Modi had been expected to discuss Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Sullivan said \"that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and that \"every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia's war machine.\"The gathering was also an opportunity for Mr. Biden and Japan's Kishida to bid each other farewell.Mr. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning.The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness.Mr. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating \"courage and conviction in strengthening ties\" with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China's \"coercive and destabilizing activities\" in the Pacific, Russia's war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues.Tension surrounds Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of U.S. SteelThe U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Mr. Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two candidates in the 2024 presidential election, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan's Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel.Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election.Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Mr. Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal.The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries.The White House said the leaders later Saturday will roll out a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens' son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer.As Mr. Biden's time in office draws down, the White House also was celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a \"Quad Caucus\" in Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of the outcome of the November election.","summary":"\"It will survive way beyond November,\" Mr. Biden declared of the Quad as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-quad-summit-japan-india-australia-wilmington-delaware-home-high-school/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/21/b63e067a-dfb9-41c3-bfc4-0a5bc70c2c62/thumbnail/1200x630/cc8d5fcea8b7dde69d813a59bbc8cfed/gettyimages-2172751088.jpg?v=159d4576ec63c034c87559bf5085176a","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/2024/09/21/2374169667764/3211339_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:18:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.073},{"id":256943858,"title":"An unusual Sydney rental ad attracted critics online. Before long things blew 'out of all proportion'","text":"Alyssa Hardy doesn't enjoy leaving a negative review online. \"But when they're deserved,\" she told the ABC, \"I do.\" On Wednesday, the Sydney-based emergency health worker made the decision to leave a negative review of the real estate agency Wills Property. Not because she was a former client, but because of what she had seen on TikTok and Facebook. A rental listing for a three-bedroom apartment managed by Wills Property went viral on social media earlier this week due to its unusual conditions. Those conditions included tenants being required to help maintain the childcare centre below, as well as being unable to leave or enter the apartment in the 10 hours the centre was open. Those posts on TikTok, Reddit and Facebook resulted in the listing being removed. But it also elicited a sense of outrage in some, including Ms Hardy. \"Another person had given them a Google review, and I wanted to do the same to let the public know what was happening, in a way that was a bit more public than a private Facebook group,\" Ms Hardy told the ABC. The rise of digital vigilantism A phenomena that's emerged in the wake of the internet is digital vigilantism. One example of this is when users will intentionally negatively review a business online as a form of retribution for its behaviour. In some cases, large numbers of accounts, or a few people using multiple accounts, will organise to mass-negatively review a business to damage its reputation, an act known as review bombing. Ms Hardy's review, which has now been removed by someone other than her, was intended to raise public awareness of the listing. But two hours after she posted, the 26-year-old received a reply from Wills Property. That reply acknowledged that she was not a former client and referenced lawyers. But it also listed Ms Hardy's employer. \"I think they were trying to intimidate me,\" Ms Hardy said, adding that she was also contacted by Wills Property on her personal Instagram. 'Felt very, very violating' Since the first days of the internet, people have shared information about themselves and others online. But as life becomes more centred around digital platforms, the potential repercussions of this communication has magnified. One aspect is how far and fast ideas can spread online. In 2020, a trend on TikTok eventually led to K-Pop fans organising online to collectively undermine a political rally for then-US president Donald Trump. But another is how our information can be used. Doxxing, for example, is one phenomenon where private information is intentionally shared online to cause harm. As with Ms Hardy, Wills Property found personal information elsewhere online of those who posted about its listing, including replying to a second negative review — which is also now removed — noting their town of residence and ABN number. The agency also contacted the user behind a thread on Reddit about the listing, emailing them via their personal and work addresses while also messaging their partner on LinkedIn and Instagram. \"They reached out to my partner, which I just thought was just going too far, and it just felt very, very violating,\" said Reddit user Cords9836, a 25-year-old from Sydney's inner west. \"I haven't heard anything else, but I was definitely nervous, especially when they reached out to my work email address. That just felt a bit predatory.\" In a statement to the ABC, Wills Property director John Wills said individuals in the business had received \"personal threats\" since the listing was posted on social media, and that they only posted \"publicly available information\". \"Since this story broke, Wills Property has been flooded with calls and correspondence to our office. These communications to us have grown increasingly disturbing over the last 48 hours, prompting us to notify the police,\" Mr Wills said. \"We were advised by the police to reach out to the makers of the original posts and ask them to take the posts down.\" NSW Police were unable to confirm whether or not threats regarding the listing had been reported. Questions around ethics and laws Demi Swain, a senior associate at Bennett Litigation and Commercial Law, said it's not illegal to post someone's personal information online, \"provided it's all public information\", but it could be considered intimidation or harassment. \"There's various consequences if people are engaging in that type of behaviour. I think just obviously, rather than attacking in that manner, it's not strategically smart.\" It's also not illegal to post a negative review. Hugh Breakey, an ethicist at Griffith University added there's nothing unethical about posting negative opinions online, such as a Reddit thread. \"Precisely one of the reasons we have freedom of speech is so people can talk and think about things that are going on that they have ethical worries about.\" But Dr Breakey said when something does err towards the side social punishment, like review bombing or sharing personal information online, it becomes ethically more complicated. On one level, this type of internet vigilantism can informed by misinformation and escalate quickly. \"The ethics of social punishment is itself pretty murky, because it's pretty easy to get this stuff wrong,\" he said. But it can also be considered a form of punitive action. \"You're trying to call out someone, and you're attaching their name and sort of identifiable information to what they are doing,\" Dr Breakey said on publishing personal information. \"And that's a confronting thing to do in any context.\" 'You can't control how significant that information winds up being' Another concern around sharing personal information online is, once it's amplified, the situation may have unintended consequences. \"The general point is that, one of the reasons to be wary about this, is because you can't control how significant that information winds up being,\" Dr Breakey said. In October 2023, a number of university students in the US were vilified when an open letter they signed in support of Palestine following October 7 was posted on social media. Those students later experienced doxxing, stalking and assault. \"These types of social punishment — and I think this is a type of social punishment — is probably a lot more ethically problematic than it feels to the person in the moment when they are doing it.\" In his email to the ABC, Mr Wills said Wills Property regrets \"that this matter has been allowed to blow out of all proportion\". For Cords9836, while they empathise with the agency being harassed, they said it doesn't justify their behaviour. \"But I don't think how they've responded to the situation was okay, either.\"","summary":"After a three-bedroom inner-Sydney apartment went viral for its strict conditions for tenants, the internet came hard for the agency behind it.

Kennedy Jr. after interviewing him in California, and pursued him via text to the point where he had to repeatedly block her, a source close to Kennedy’s camp told The Post. “She went after him aggressively,” the source said Saturday. “She targeted him pretty hard. Bobby was blocking her continually. It was a little scary. She was obsessed with him. I think she still is.” Nuzzi’s camp pushed back on allegations the situation was a “Fatal Attraction” type of scenario or that she instigated the relationship — but did not deny that the digital fling was tumultuous, suggesting both parties may have stopped texting each other at times. “It’s absolutely untrue that she was the aggressor, but both parties were aware of how high pressure and high risk the circumstances were and for that reason their communication was very on and off,” a person with knowledge of the situation said. “Olivia’s point of view is that to call this a relationship or affair is completely inaccurate. It was at most a flirtation,” another source close to Nuzzi said. The two allegedly began “sexting” sometime after Nuzzi, 31, met with the 70-year-old Kennedy family scion for a November feature piece on the then-White House hopeful, sources had previously said. Nuzzi and Kennedy’s relationship was strictly digital, but allegedly included risqué pics from the Washington correspondent, Puck News reported late Friday, citing a source. Kennedy, the son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, is married to “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, while Nuzzi was engaged to fellow political reporter Ryan Lizza. Nuzzi and Lizza have since split. Kennedy, who ended his bid for the White House in August, was a no-show Saturday at a family wedding in Hyannis Port, Mass., where Grace Kennedy Allen — the granddaughter of Ted Kennedy — was set to tie the knot. He was expected to attend a campaign event for Donald Trump in Nevada Saturday night. A friend of RFK Jr.’s said it wasn’t uncommon for women to throw themselves at Kennedy while on the campaign trail. The Post reported from Kennedy’s campaign launch in Boston in April 2023 noted the “hot MILFs” flirting with him that day. Nuzzi was placed on leave Thursday after New York magazine editors became aware of the inappropriate relationship. Kennedy’s team previously said he and Nuzzi only met in person “once in his life for an interview she requested, which yielded a hit piece.” Hines, who turned 59 Saturday, has not commented on the scandal, though an insider insisted to Page Six that the actress is “no pushover.” The actress was spotted at a Milan Fashion Week afterparty Friday, and had apparently ditched her wedding ring, the Daily Mail reported. Kennedy has a history of romantic entanglements and once kept a list of up to 43 rumored mistresses in his cellphone. He had contact information for dozens of women in an alphabetical list under the letter “G,” which his late second wife believed stood for “goomar,” the Italian slang for mistress, The Post revealed in 2014. At the time, Kennedy didn’t comment. One of the women on the list was Hines, who married Kennedy at his family compound in Hyannis Port that year. “All these women fall for him despite his age and his voice,” the source said of Kennedy Saturday. RFK Jr. campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Spear did not respond to messages Saturday asking about Kennedy’s relationship with Nuzzi. Asked Friday about the diary, Kennedy said, “I don’t think there is any way you could have a diary or journal of mine from 2001. I don’t have any comment on it. I have no diary from 2001.”","summary":"New York magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi was \"obsessed\" with Robert F.

The question was posed at the outgoing President - who is not seeking re-election - as he posed for a photo with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Anthony Albanese and Fumio Kishida. The four leaders represent the four member countries of the Quad, a security and strategic grouping committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Responding to the question on Quad's future, Biden turned around and placed a hand across PM Modi's shoulder and said, \"(It will survive) way beyond November.\" The Quad summit is being held in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. The US elections this November will see a Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump fight with Biden not returning to the ring. Japan's Kishida too has announced he won't seek re-election. This implies both the US and Japan are set to be represented by new leaders at its next Quad summit. In his opening remarks, PM Modi offered to host the Quad Leaders' summit in India in 2025. He also highlighted that a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific is a shared priority and shared commitment of the Quad. \"We are meeting at a time when the world is surrounded by tensions and conflicts. At such a time, it is important for all of humanity that the members of the Quad move forward based on shared democratic values,\" he told the Quad leaders.","summary":"US President Joe Biden, one of the architects of the Quad grouping, was asked ahead of the Quad summit in Delaware if it would survive beyond November elections.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-will-quad-survive-beyond-november-bidens-gesture-pm-modi-by-his-side-6620503","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/8t8f5l48_biden-modi_625x300_22_September_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:14:00","author":"His Side","authors":["His Side"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.124},{"id":256942892,"title":"Janet Jackson Talks about Kamala Harris’ Family and Background in a Strange Way","text":"Janet Jackson knows a lot about Rhythm Nation, but she clearly doesn’t know anything about Vice President Kamala Harris‘ heritage. In a sprawling and at times confusing interview with The Guardian, Jackson postulated about Kamala Harris’ family background while seemingly admitting that she did not know what she was talking about. “Well, you know what they supposedly said? She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,” she told the reporter. When the profile writer clarified that she is of both Black and South Asian heritage, Jackson answered, “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told they discovered her father was white.” Jackson, in making her comments, was parroting conspiracy theory right-wing talking points perpetuated by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. At the presidential debate held earlier this month, he said, “I don’t know. I mean all I can say is I read where she was not Black. And then I read that she was Black and that’s OK. Either one was OK with me. That’s up to her.” (In an interview with NPR, one scholar called it birtherism 2.0, referencing the conspiracy first posited by fringe theorists, who wanted to call into question former president Barack Obama’s legitimacy as a candidate by weaponizing his African father’s immigrant status.) It is well documented that Harris’ father, Donald, is a Jamaican American professor of economics at Stanford University, while her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a renowned breast cancer researcher and scientist, hailed from southern India. Both her parents immigrated to the United States, meeting as graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley. In Harris’ 2019 memoir, The Truths We Hold, she wrote, “My mother, grandparents, aunts and uncle instilled us with pride in our South Asian roots. Our classical Indian names harked back to our heritage, and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture.” She added, however, “My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya [her sister] and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.” Elsewhere in the interview, Jackson went on a tangent about “all this child trafficking crap that’s going on,” a strange out-of-the-blue comment considering the plethora of child sexual abuse allegations levied against her late brother. She also said she believes the U.S. will descend into “mayhem” regardless of the election results this November. Jackson, a multiplatinum artist who has influenced everyone from Britney Spears to Kendrick Lamar, has been cited as a source of inspiration by the biggest R&B and pop musicians today. The five-time Grammy-winning artist has also graced television and film screens in credits like Will & Grace (where she played herself), Fame, Good Times, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and Poetic Justice, for which she got an Oscar nom for Best Original Song. The legendary performer is currently on the second leg of her Together Again tour. Her older brother, Tito, the founding guitarist of The Jackson 5, died less than a week ago.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJanet Jackson knows a lot about Rhythm Nation, but she clearly doesn’t&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson Talks about Kamala Harris&#8217; Family and Background in a Strange Way first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/janet-jackson-talks-about-kamala-harris-family-and-background-in-a-strange-way/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Janet-Jackson-Goes-On-Bizarre-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:12:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":256942734,"title":"Trump Melts Down And Attacks Bill Maher And Stephanie Ruhle As Election Slips Away","text":"More proof that Trump knows that the election is slipping away from him as he went off off on a rant about Bill Maher, Stephanie Ruhle, Bret Stephens, and The New York Times.

Tim Walz claimed that former President Ronald Reagan was the “last union member” to appear on a “national ticket.” VERDICT: False. Former President Donald Trump was a member of the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union. During a campaign rally in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, Walz spoke about how “the thing that built the middle class” had been the ability to allow people to “collectively bargain and form a union” with their neighbors. Walz added that he had been a union member of Minnesota’s teacher’s union. “I’ve been told….I’ve been told that I am…..For decades, a card-carrying union member of our state’s teacher union, which I was,” Walz told the crowd. “The last union member on a national ticket — Ronald Reagan. I promise you, I will not lose my way. I will not lose my way.” Walz has previously made a similar claim. In August, Walz claimed he was “the first union member” to appear on a presidential ticket since Reagan. “I happen to be the first union member on a presidential ticket since Ronald Reagan,” Walz said at the time. “But, rest assured, I won’t lose my way.” This claim was fact-checked by ABC News, which found that Trump had been a member of SAG-AFTRA until he resigned from the union. While Reagan served as the president of SAG-AFTRA for “seven terms,” Trump was a member of the SAG-AFTRA union for more than 30 years before he resigned in February 2021. Trump’s resignation from the union came after SAG-AFTRA said it found “probable cause” that Trump had “violated the union’s Constitution,” and threatened to expel Trump from the union in the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.","summary":"Democrat Minnesota Gov.

A lot of the show's goods were akin to campaign merchandise. Other less political items included shoes by Texas-based Brazilian designer, Claudia Lisotta, jackets from the New York brand, Elie Balleh, that were adorned with feathers and beads, and skirts from Lost and Found Apparel, a clothing line that embroiders Bible verses. According to the Daily Mail, netizens were left amused and unimpressed when videos of the MAGA-themed fashion show went viral.

However, his arrival has caused a stir beyond the traditional freshman excitement, as Barron has inadvertently become a viral subject on TikTok. Students are posting shaky, blurry videos of the 6-foot-9 teenager roaming the campus, with captions speculating about his movements and personality. Some of these clips have accumulated hundreds of thousands of views, fueling an online obsession with Barron that seems to be driven by his mysterious persona. As per the reports of Daily Beast, one NYU student noted, “I feel like Barron could’ve gone to any school, but the fact that he chose one of the most liberal schools in the country speaks volumes. I was shocked and super intrigued that he would choose NYU. Would love to speak with him and would love to read his ‘why NYU’ essay.” The viral TikToks have a Sasquatch-like vibe, as Barron’s massive height and personality make him a subject of intrigue among his classmates. While the online content focuses mainly on his physical presence at NYU, some of Barron’s classmates have started sharing their own thoughts about the former president’s youngest son. In particular, Barron’s decision to attend NYU, a notoriously liberal school has raised questions. One student expressed surprise and said, “He's going to NYU so if he is at all interested in girls, he's going to become kind of liberal I'll tell you that.” Another student added that they would definitely consider a friendship with him: “His dad is his dad and he is [his] own person so I'm not going to judge.” In agreement, another remarked, “Of course, who wouldn't want to be friends with a Trump?” Despite his famous last name, it appears that Barron’s classmates are giving him a fair shot, as reported by the Daily Mail. Previously, during his school days also Barron was famous for his mysterious persona. An insider noted, \"Barron was very funny and sociable. He would start the most random conversations and could be very entertaining. He was also very mysterious. He never attended football games or dances.

That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,” the “That’s The Way Love Goes” hitmaker, 58, said during a chat about “the State of the Union.” “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told,” she went on. “I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.” Vice President Harris, 59, is the daughter of two immigrants. Her father is Jamaican while her mother is Indian. Fans were appalled by Jackson’s false statements and slammed her on X, with one writing, “This is why she’s irrelevant and leeching off of her brothers’ success.” Of course, the singer’s older brother is the late Michael Jackson, who was frequently questioned after his skin turned black to white in the 1990s. It was known at the time that he had vitiligo, a disorder that causes patches of skin to lose color, per Mayo Clinic. Bringing up the debate that the “Beat It” singer’s changing skin tone caused, another X user penned, “Janet, you know better than to believe that nonsense… especially after all the race controversies Michael went through…” “‘That’s what I heard’ is the new way of saying ‘i believe the stupid, unsubstantiated s–t people tell me,'” a third dismayed person tweeted. Another shocked user added, “I have always been a fan of Janet Jackson but this just no. Stop.” Several others compared Janet’s comments to the statement Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made about Harris changing her race while speaking at a conference of black journalists in July. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the former president, 78, said. “I did not know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.” He added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and … she became black.” Page Six contacted Janet’s rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"\"I was told that they discovered her father was white,\" the musician said in a recent interview.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/21/celebrity-news/janet-jackson-called-irrelevantfor-questioning-kamala-harris-race/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/90160027.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:50:02","author":"Sara Whitman","authors":["Sara Whitman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.703},{"id":256941806,"title":"Day in Photos: The Largest Beerfest, Overcrowded Prisons, and Unsuccessful Plans","text":"First Lady Jill Biden speaks to guests during the opening ceremony for a new White House educational center, on the South Lawn of the White House on Sept. 21, 2024.

(AP) — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China’s increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden’s comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he’s hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing’s actions as a “change in tactic, not a change in strategy.” China continues to struggle to pull up its economy that was pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. “At least from our perspective, we believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China’s diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest,” Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. “It is true across the scope of our relationship, including on economic and technology issues.” Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China’s claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly spoken out about concerns about Chinese military assertiveness against Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between the Chinese and Philippines navies in the South China Sea. Biden recently dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. Biden added that he continues to believe “intense competition requires intense diplomacy.” The comments came as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure. When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. “It will survive way beyond November,” Biden declared as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater in nearby Claymont for joint talks. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. “I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,” Biden joked to fellow leaders. Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. “This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,” said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. Kishida, according to the prime minister’s office, thanked Biden at the outset of their meeting for inviting him to meet at his home. White House officials said holding the talks at the president’s house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. Sullivan described the vibe of Biden’s one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as “two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.” He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him “insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.” Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. “There cannot be a better place than President Biden’s hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,” Modi said. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Biden and Modi discussed Modi’s recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said “that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.” Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China’s “coercive and destabilizing activities” in the Pacific, Russia’s war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will roll out a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths.

Trump campaigned in Wilmington, along the state's southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president's top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. He did not mention Robinson during a speech that lasted just over an hour. Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” Trump's campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump “is focused on winning the White House and saving this country\" and calling North Carolina “a vital part of that plan,\" without mentioning Robinson. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Harris' campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris’ campaign, it’s their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a down-ballot race. Both abortion rights and Robinson are electoral liabilities for Trump in a state he previously won twice. Already before CNN's report, Robinson was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general. Polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close race here and nationally. Trump downplays abortion as a campaign issue In his first outdoor rally since the second apparent attempt to assassinate him, Trump argued women would be safer and more prosperous with him as president and would “no longer be thinking about abortion.\" “I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure,” Trump said. “Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again. So women, we love you. We’re going to take care of you.” The former president said women won't have to think about abortion because decisions about regulating it are now left to the states. Many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Trump nominated three of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks last year, with Republicans in the state legislature overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto. Voters overwhelmingly say they trust Harris to do a better job handling abortion policy, with 55 per cent favouring her while 27 per cent favoured Trump in a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Harris and Democrats running down ballot have highlighted stories of women who faced severe medical complications or death because they didn't get proper medical care from doctors worried about the impact of abortion laws. Harris on Friday blasted Trump as a threat to women’s freedoms and their lives, warning in a speech in Georgia that Republicans would continue to target access to abortion if he returns to the White House. Trump also showed a gentler side, inviting two of his young grandchildren on stage. The former president lifted Carolina to the microphone, where she said “Make America great again” to cheers, followed by her older brother, Luke Trump, who said, “Vote for Grandpa.” They’re the children of Eric Trump, the former president’s second son, and his wife, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who is now serving as co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Bulletproof glass surrounded Trump as he spoke, a new precaution for outdoor venues the Secret Service implemented after a bullet grazed Trump's ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Trump supporters dismiss the new claims against Robinson A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That’s part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall. With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina’s marquee down-ballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as “Martin Luther King on steroids.\" Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued: “I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.” Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down\" and comparing abortion to slavery. Charlie Kimball, a 46-year-old former construction worker from Burgaw, who said he is currently on disability, dismissed the new allegations against Robinson as “fake news.\" “That’s his personal life. Who cares?” Kimball said. “It’s all hearsay … It’s not true. It’s all speculation. Where’s the proof?\" While more visits have been made by presidential contenders to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state’s importance. Following Biden’s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris. Wilmington is home to New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state. Julia Novotny, 55, of Wilmington, said she's come around to supporting Trump after initial reservations because of allegations that he's been sexually abusive to women, which he denies. “He’s classy, he’s a gentleman, he looks good in a suit and he has strong values,” Novotny said. “Everybody makes mistakes, and whether he did or didn’t, I don’t know, but you know what? Leave him alone. He’s a good man. He wants to change this country. Our country is in the dirt, and the only man who pulls us out is Donald Trump.” Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Jonathan J.

Trump recognized a number of Republicans while completely sidestepping any mention of Robinson during his rhetoric-and-racism-filled rally, which included his typical unsubstantiated rants that migrants are ruining our country, this time claiming they are “attacking villages and cities throughout the Midwest” and that “every job” created in the U.S. in the last two years has gone to migrants. He also touched on his obsessions with crowd size, saying this one went back “as far as the eye can see” to open the rally and later denying that he and J.D. Vance are “weird.” He said women will be better off should he be reelected, claiming “Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be, with the states,” despite 63 percent of U.S. adults in a Pew Research Center survey saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases. He also made the unsubstantiated claim that Democrats are demanding “execution of a baby after birth, which is what they want.” His claim was eloquently refuted earlier in the month during his debate with Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Yet, he added on Saturday, “I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe, and secure. Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again.” Meanwhile, as abortion has been in the hand of states, a disinformation campaign against a ballot measure to restore abortion rights in Florida has taken hold as providers say the state’s abortion ban has doctors afraid to do their jobs and is putting patients at risk.

This time, Louise made headlines after flashing at a rally for former President Donald Trump in Long Island as part of her self-styled fundraising campaign, “T*ts for Trump.” no way the girl that flashed the portal just flashed a Trump rally 😭 pic.twitter.com/odjywsgAU2— juju 💰 (@ayeejuju) September 19, 2024 In a candid interview with the New York Post, Louise shared that the stunt was intended to support Trump’s campaign financially. “After I left, I donated money to Trump for all the hassle I caused!” she said after police reportedly tried to escort her from the event. “I make $100k a month now after [the portal incident], and I’m trying to make $500k off my Trump-themed content to give to Donald.” Louise’s latest stunt is part of her effort to raise half a million dollars through her OnlyFans content, which she plans to donate to Trump’s campaign. “Trump was an entrepreneur, I’m an entrepreneur, I understand him,” she told the Post, comparing her business savvy to the former president’s. Despite her flashy appearance at the rally, Louise noted that the event itself was a positive experience. “Everyone was so polite and respectful,” she said. “I heard so many amazing conversations between Black supporters and white supporters, Jewish supporters and Christian supporters, gay supporters and straight supporters. It was super cool.” While her presence stirred a reaction from attendees and law enforcement alike, it remains to be seen whether her “T*ts for Trump” campaign will reach its ambitious $500,000 goal.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAva Louise, the 26-year-old OnlyFans model who went viral earlier this year&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Ava Louise Becomes Viral Sensation Again for Flashing at Long Island Trump Rally&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/ava-louise-becomes-viral-sensation-again-for-flashing-at-long-island-trump-rally/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:36:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.122},{"id":256943990,"title":"The maker of a party game bought land in Texas to troll Trump. Now it’s suing Musk’s SpaceX","text":"In a lawsuit filed this week at a Texas court, Cards Against Humanity alleges SpaceX has essentially treated the game company’s property — located in Cameron County — as its own for at least the past six months. The lawsuit said SpaceX, which had previously acquired other plots of land near the property, has placed construction materials, such as gravel, and other debris on the land without asking for permission to do so. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cards Against Humanity, which is headquartered in Chicago, had purchased the plot of land in 2017 as part of what it said was a stunt to oppose former president Donald Trump’s efforts to build a border wall. The company said 150,000 people had each contributed $15 towards the effort. Over the years, Cards Against Humanity says the land has been maintained in its natural state. It also says it contained a “no trespassing” sign to warn people they were about to step on private property. The company is asking for $15 million in damages, which it says includes a loss of vegetation on the land.","summary":"Cards Against Humanity is accusing Elon Musk’s SpaceX of trespassing on and damaging a plot of vacant land the company owns in Texas.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/21/elon-musk-spacex-cards-against-humanity-lawsuit-texas-trespassing/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2074390099-e1726954255267.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:35:58","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":256932402,"title":"Early Addition: Dancing with the ankle monitor","text":"Andrew Cuomo — who's reportedly trying to run for mayor — misled a congressional subcommittee about his involvement in a 2020 report deflecting blame for COVID deaths in nursing homes, according to emails reviewed by the New York Times.
